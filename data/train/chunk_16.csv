kishbish,AskWomen,1389384556.0,"I'm late to the party, but - I am actually planning on being a single mother by choice, and using a donor. 

Adoption is great. It's also extremely expensive for those without considerable income and savings. It's very uncertain. - you can wait on a list for years and never end up with a child. It's much harder for a single person to adopt as opposed to a couple. Philosophically, adoption as a single parent is great. Logistically, it's difficult without significant resources or going into a lot of debt (again, with no guarantees). 

The thing I spend the most time thinking about is this - I am making a conscious decision, without my child's input, that this child will be born without a father in their life. Sure I have male friends, male family members and male coworkers that will be a big part of my child's life, but my child won't know their biological father at least until they're 18 (I'm planning on only going with a donor that will allow his child to contact him in adulthood). How big of an impact will that make ? Will my child resent me for making that decision? If it's a girl, will she have daddy issues without a father in her life? If it's a boy, who is he going to go to with questions he would never ask his mother (because I really think there are some things a boy will not want to speak to his mother about)? How best can I prepare for that? How can I prepare for questions like , ""All the other kids have fathers , why don't i?"" That's what I struggle with. "
ulvok_coven,TrueReddit,1389384556.0,"&gt; To pursue this vision, however, used to require great technical skill. 

TL;DR the whole article: It isn't good if it isn't hard.

What I've come to realize about modern and art is that it is a genre meant to be in conversation with other genres of art. So of course it doesn't make sense to the rest of us that these simple pictures should be in a museum, because we're not part of the conversation of style, placement, technique, etc., which actually makes modern art meaningful. It's an artists' genre.

And obviously, there are artists who enjoy it and support it and think it has merit; we don't have to enjoy it, we can just let them. Who the fuck cares? I don't listen to ska, I hate ska in fact, but if someone else enjoys it then they should listen and smile. Cheers.

There are lots of parallels in music, of bands which musicians love for doing unusual but subtle things. Virtuoso playing is much less impressive than a skilled, experienced musician playing something no one's ever thought of, or playing something we've heard before, but not in the same way. One of Marilyn Manson's most popular songs - not even among musicians but just in general - was Sweet Dreams, an 80s pop hit turned on its head. Dialogue is part of art.


So, Julian Baggini, fuck you. Fuck you for trying to tell people they aren't allowed to be artists. You took a pretty picture and paid a fee and they decided your picture wasn't good enough. This article makes you sound a petty Val dissing a boy for not being interested in her."

proclivity4passivity,relationships,1389384574.0,"Are you really willing to divorce your wife and the mother of your child because she's not kinky enough for you? I mean, I get that she *used* to be ""kinky,"" but you're expecting her not to have changed over the course of ten years. After all, she's still having sex with you. It can't be all bad.

That having been said, something that *might* work is to completely stop pressuring her. Don't bring it up. Don't suggest anything other than what she normally wants to do. Because that could make her feel that she's not good enough. And if you don't feel like you're good enough for your partner, you're not going to want to get kinky for them. If she feels no pressure from you and like you're satisfied with ""boring missionary,"" *maybe* she'll step up the kink out of pure appreciation that you've stopped hounding her.

Also, she shouldn't be bothered by you looking at porn. I mean, everyone looks at porn. But there again, maybe that's another thing that makes her feel not good enough. And if you're lowering her self-esteem instead of boosting it, the likelihood of the kink goes down."

UlgraTheTerrible,wemetonline,1389384684.0,"Strategy: 

(very early in the relationship)

""Hey, add me on facebook!"" 

Now look for family profiles, namely their aunts, uncles, mothers, and cousins, as well as checking through their photos for authenticity... Which means, look for a few people here and there that they have tagged, make sure they're also tagged in some pictures... 

Basically, see if it raises your hackles. If something does bring a red flag to light, like they don't have many friends or no family and such, ask why. The way they answer is usually pretty telling. 

Strategy:

(a bit later on)

""We should talk on cam a bit.""

**VERY IMPORTANT:** Do not buy the bullshit that they can't afford a $25 webcam and don't have time to talk to you face to face if they spend more than 15 minutes on conversing with you. 

Why, you ask? 

Because, if they can't afford a $25 webcam, they probably shouldn't be able to afford the internet at all. And if they can afford to spend hours *typing* to you, they can afford to spend hours with their camera turned on, almost whenever you request it. 

If they are *sometimes* unwilling, but frequently willing, it usually means maybe they have a zit. If they are frequently unwilling, and only willing at odd hours, it probably means they're waiting for their spouse/girlfriend to leave. 

Strategy:

(once a relationship has been established)

**ASK TO TALK TO SOME OF THEIR FRIENDS/FAMILY FACE TO FACE**

Unless they're up to some shady shit, they should be *proud* to show you off. If they're not, they're probably spineless or effectively teenagers (living at home, too reliant upon parents to be really thinking about a relationship) and you should probably run away... 

That said, I was kinda one of those spineless people for a bit, and I was actually quite honest and genuine, but then again, there's another thing you can look for: 

**CONSISTENCY**

Do they mention someone/something in passing? Take note of it. See if they mention again. Don't be afraid to ask and maybe skew a detail and see if they correct you... 

Look for red flags. It's not dishonest or distrustful to look for red flags and do a little bit of fact checking, it's fucking smart to do so because this is the internet. It's not a sea of predators by any means, but it *is* an ideal environment for predators to hunt in, and therefore you should take precautions. 

Oh, and I think it goes without saying that ""Don't you trust me?"" and ""What, are you checking up on me?"" are major red flags coming from anyone, except it totally doesn't go without saying and most people have to get burned several times before they learn that someone saying that once is playful but hearing it often generally means that the person saying it can't be trusted at all. 

But I think the best strategy of all is this:

Try to remain in control of yourself. Yes, getting swept up in the thrill of new love is fun and exciting and you want to let yourself go, but just because you want to doesn't mean it's a good idea. 

Love is patient. 

Love is kind. 

So be patient. Be kind. But be fucking smart about it. "

* The bars in the top-left octagon now show Agent Level instead of progress within your current level and there is a new bar above the XM bar which shows your Level progress.

* XMP charge mechanic: The rapid fire trick, though technically still there, is out and now you can hold down FIRE in order to charge an XMP for up to a 20% boost in power.

* The FIRE XMP shortcut (hold and drag up) now loads up the XMP selection drawer without firing automatically.

* I forget when the Deploy mechanics were overhauled, but that's much easier to use than it was originally.

* Alignment tools: The ADA Refactor turns green portals blue, the Jarvis virus turns blue portals green; one-hour cooldown after activation. No way to tell exactly when a portal has been flipped, so if you attempt a second one within an hour it will fail but still use up the item.

* You can hack portals with a shortcut now; hold down and drag left. The same shortcut as when you target a portal but when you're in range of said portal. Unfortunately you can't just hold down TARGET and have it change to HACK once you're in range.

* Portal submissions are solely via the scanner now.

* Alerts tab in COMM.

* COMM mentions by tapping or typing in an agent's name.

* The ability to mute agents in COMM.

* You can view other agents' profiles by holding down the agent name anywhere it appears, such as COMM, portal owner, in the resonator deployment screen or in the portal photograph viewer.

* Inventory count

* Recycle (how long has that been in now?)

* Power cubes. They might have come in in April, actually.

JIVEprinting,Fitness,1389385083.0,"Alright, let's get you a real answer.


Everybody wants everything.


Heck, I want everything.


But let's talk about what you would actually use.


Once you've completed Starting Strength, you will enjoy a greatly improved physical existence.  But getting stronger than that is going to have little, if any, marginal effect on your life.  It might be fun, but unless your life is pretty unique you simply won't have any need or use for that kind of strength.


Now let's say you lean down to around 10% bodyfat.  Hey, you look great!  But unless you live in an expensive coastal city, you won't look any different in your clothes any more shredded than that.  You can even add some more mass with hypertrophy programming, but things like detailed symmetry (or hugeness from years of steroids) aren't really going to boost your quality of life further.


Speed and agility mainly come from strength, subsequently expressed with skill training.  Whether it's judo or parkour, this is simply a more specific cultivation (where strength is the most general.)  So let's say you start training for something (maybe football?) and learn the relevant skills for some months.  Cool!  Do you want to refine them further?  Well there's no point in that unless you're going to be competing, since you're already a hefty notch above untrained persons (which is what you wanted) and being better still won't convey any of the same cool benefits that your initial acquisition did.


And endurance?  It's kind of a joke.  Once you can run two miles, you will never encounter a situation where you'd be better-served to run ten with similar effectiveness.  Ever.  It's not even useful if you could.  Two miles is actually a pretty polarizing feat of endurance, anatomically speaking.  Running five miles is purely a contrivance, and one of obscene irrelevancy to human beings (to say nothing of further distances.)


More to the point, you CAN have more endurance than that (and even benefit from it practically!) but this is a question of specificity.  Firefighters and wrestlers both need tremendous endurance for their chosen pursuits, but their specific goals do not (and can not) overlap at all.  And sustained cardio is absolutely preposterous for any application other than its own sake.


**So what you want is entirely realistic**, but attempting to train in all these conflicting directions at once would be almost totally counterproductive.  


Get strong, then lean, then tough, then big.  Or even change up the order if you like, but going from Starting Strength to barbell complexes then to something like PHAT would be an intelligent plan.  (Food intake is the constraining variable.)"

Benjajinj,LetsTalkMusic,1389385140.0,"I'm not sure what I make of it this year, really. I'm pleased to see Laura Marling for best British female solo artist, as my favourite artist and (in my opinion the best songwriter around at the moment). The album was good, although not quite as good as her earlier stuff. More experimental though, which bodes interestingly for the future. Ethan Johns produced this, so while I can say I know the other producers well he gets my vote.

Arctic Monkeys should definitely get best album as well, with what seemed to me to be one of the only proper mainstream 'rock n' roll' records of this year. Having seen them live too, they're easily at the top of their game. I remember someone mentioning 'biggest rock band of the moment' and there was general consensus towards them too, and my thoughts are with them for best British act.

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1389385369.0,"Warhammer 40k has an awesomely low-tech solution (by comparison to Dune, at least). Prosthetics and energy technology made power armor standard for infantry, so guns had to become much, much more powerful to compensate, which actually made them less reliable and more expensive to operate. Plasma guns blow up, bolters jam, and you basically have to hit someone directly in the head to kill them anyway; your might not survive the battle but it'll take you much longer to bleed out, and you'll be shooting the whole time. Melee weapons are heavy and short range, but reliable and relatively cheap in terms of energy. And as in true in real life, stopping bullets doesn't translate to stopping bludgeoning, crushing, or shredding. In addition, jet packs and stealth have been developed, allowing melee troops to close gaps before they take too many shots.

Really though, if you're going 'hard' sci fi you'll never make it work. Armor needs explosives or very high-velocity projectiles to pierce, and armored vehicles tend to rule warfare for lots of reasons. If you're only moderately hard, then just make the armor really good against bullets and bad against hammers and/or blades."

JAWJAWBINX,changemyview,1389385467.0,"Maybe, a lot seem to just be issues in development (either psychological development or development of the brain) and we have no idea why they occur, there's a reason why psychology is full of NOSes and that's because there's stuff that seems to happen with no consistency (PDD-NOS is usually ""this person is autistic but they don't quite match the criteria"" but sometimes it's because there's some developmental disorder that we haven't named or even seen before). The main issue with knowing what's a mutation, especially what's a specific mutation, is that we don't understand what most genes do. We don't know how the brain works, we don't know what different genes do but we're learning and more interestingly we're mostly learning that the complex structures and relations that we theorized are so much simpler than the what we're finding that it's almost unbelievable.

We're even finding that previously held beliefs are in fact the opposite of the truth, this is especially the case with ASD. Previously people thought that the autistic were emotionless or barely had emotions, that they were incapable of empathy, that they were less sensitive, they couldn't communicate or understand (at least in most cases), the list goes on. The strangest thing is that the autistic community (keep in mind that the autistic and autism communities are very different and more or less opposed as the autism community, which does not have a bastion on this site, considers the autistic persona non grata in almost all circumstances) has been suggesting most of the recent revelations for some time."

kanji_sasahara,malefashionadvice,1389385553.0,"5th Avenue between 47th and 57th st. There are mobs of tourists, but there are tons of stores including the flagship Uniqlo, Saks 5th Avenue, Zara, Banana Republic, Massimo Dutti, Gant, and Bergdorf Goodman.

If you are looking at higher-end then go one avenue over to Madison Avenue between 57th and 72nd st. Barney's, Burberry, SuitSupply, Tom Ford, Ralph Lauren flagship, Lanvin, Emporio and Giorgio Armani, etc.

Of the ones listed I highly recommend Uniqlo for basics, SuitSupply for any of their affordable suits and outerwear, Barney's is the ultimate men's department store, and Ralph Lauren has one of the best store layouts I've ever been in.

You can finish up the day by visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art over on 5th Avenue between 80th and 84th st.

Soho also has some great stores. Paul Smith, Barbour, Reiss, Carson Street Clothiers, Saturdays Surf NYC, APC, and a bunch of other places.

Personally I prefer the walkable nature of Soho and the smaller, cozier store setups, but for convenience sake go with Midtown since all the flagship stores are up there and will most likely stock what you want."

Neebat,AnythingGoesNews,1389385617.0,"I tutored college students in the 1990's.  I rarely saw any athletes.  The athletic department provided dedicated tutors just for the athletes.

If those tutors were unavailable, the athletes were forced to come to me.  Every single time this happened, it was clear that the athletes were accustomed to having a tutor who would do their homework.  They were in college to train for the pros and They didn't expect to learn anything.

The academic part of the process exists purely as a facade to make it look like athletes are part of the college.  I think it has something to do with alumni contributions.  It certainly has nothing to do with education.

ohwowgosh,BodyAcceptance,1389385655.0,"I wasn't denying that it was happening, I was just pointing out that trivializing the article that was posted due to the topic wasn't fair. Especially because if were the opposite situation of someone saying ""well I'm thin and I get made fun of too"" on a post about fat acceptance, it would have been deleted for derailing the discussion.

No one, not even this post is denying that larger people tend to have it harder, but really that's not relevant if it's someone talking about their personal experience with bullying.

I think this sub tends to lose sight of the fact that body acceptance encompasses all body types, and is a personal thing for people. While privilege should totally apply to a group as a whole, I think it is important to remeber that personal accounts shouldn't be trivialized, or overlooked just because the individual happens to belong to a privileged group. Regardless of privilege bullying hurts everyone, and people shouldn't be told that their experience is not as bad as someone else's just because they are privileged. What they experience is as bad as it gets for them, and that's what matters for people trying to accept themselves.

I'm sorry that there are trolls, and I know I will probably never know what it's like to go to the mall and be limited to one or two stores, even at my biggest I was a size 14 and that is carried most places. However my (and the bloggers, and everyone else's) experiences with body shaming have all been directed at me when I am smaller, and its those experiences that make it hard to accept myself. They are important to me, and are important regardless of how much worse other people have it. Telling people that they are not is hurtful, and damaging to someone who is trying to accept themselves.

I wasn't trying to start something. Just voicing a frustration!"

I don't advocate violence at all, especially in the form of devastating nuclear weapons, but since we're talking in past hypotheticals, here, I feel pretty comfortable saying that the US could have ended that conflict much in the way it ended WWII, with a couple of well placed bombs and threats of more on the way.

In any case, compare the lives lost in North Korea to the lives lost from collateral damage in my nuke scenario and I think the existence of NK would still be worse.  Not to mention that if you're comparing suffering, the flash of a nuclear weapon, or even lingering death afterwards, is probably preferable to a lifetime of torture, control, starvation, and imprisonment, ending with cruel execution or death from malnutrition."

AKA_Sotof,AskWomen,1389385955.0,"&gt;While true, I never felt this is a case of women being in power but rather Aes Sedai being in power, thanks to their powers, and they happen to be women. Aes Sedai skewing the power balance on a global scale is only natural though considering what they are capable of and how intertwined they are with politics.

That's exactly the point. They're solely women because men cannot be Aes Sedai due to the madness. The entire red Ajah does in fact go out of their way to attack and hurt men in the books and the rest of the Ajahs with the exception of the green have a milder sense of superiority over men. It does matter that the most powerful people in the world is solely one gender - it puts the whole balance of power between the genders out of whack.

&gt;I think Jordan made a great job of creating a world where men and women are very equal and whoever is ultimately more ""favoured"" is more a matter of personal capability, and he did so without it feeling forced. I can see why you might disagree though, I definitely see how you can make a strong case for women being more empowered then men in WoT.

I don't like that absolute. The setting changes a lot as the story progress. As Rand rises the inequalities in power gets cast down violently. There is however absolutely no discussion on whether or not women have more power at the start of the books - they do. They're in control of basically everything if you exclude the meddling of the Forsaken.

cluberti,sysadmin,1389386092.0,"This is true, but I figured it was worth explaining (because I think it's a misunderstood area - even I misunderstood it initially).

First, an organization can indeed reimage OEM machines.  However, they do **have** to have:

* an active Volume Licensing agreement with Microsoft

* at least one VL license of that Windows version and type in the agreement

* the VL media **must** be used to create the reference image

* that image must be identical, component-wise and language-wise, to the OEM image it replaces


A person or organization **cannot** use OEM media to create an image to be used to reimage OEM machines - only the OEM can do that legally.  You *can* recover the recovery media and copy that elsewhere to restore the machine to it's out-of-box state if desired (wise to do before reimaging too), but you *cannot* use that recovery image for any other purpose.


If an organization meets the 4 requirements above, you can indeed reimage OEM machines, but you'll need to provide the key on the CoA sticker for activation of those machines after imaging if you're not going to use VL licenses to cover their licensing, so unless you keep them in a database somewhere and can pull them an inject them into your unattend.xml during the imaging process, you'll be activating those machines manually.

NoirCellarDoor,apple,1389386116.0,"Although I am *still* an Apple guy, and I'm very glad you were given great customer service, I feel that at the end of the day, it is up to the person you end up working with.

A few others have spoken of this great customer service, and I've also read it online, like your case; but about a year ago, I was having some iPhone issues (the speaker didn't work so I couldn't hear anyone on a call, I would have to use an earpiece) and I was somehow hoping that they would either fix the problem or give me a refurbished phone, or do something to solidify this ""great customer service"" backing they seem to have.

None of the above.

Pay us $200 and we'll give you a refurbished phone.

To which I walked right out. I waited about 6 more months without a speaker and just ended up getting a new phone when the 5S released, *and* sold my old phone back to my carrier for $200.

I'm not trying to say I was entitled to a new phone from Apple, because that's ridiculous to expect. Imagine if everyone got a new phone when they had an issue, *but* I definitely don't consider them having extraordinary customer service. That has been the only time I've ever needed help from Apple, and they failed me.

But Hey!, Enjoy your new iMac!

CalzoniTheStag,vegetarian,1389386207.0,"My favorite is the Broccoli and Tofu in a light garlic sauce dish I make. You can adjust the ingredients to your preference. Here it is:

* 1 Big head of Broccoli, chopped to size

* 1 pack extra firm tofu, drained, pressed, and cubed

* 4 green onions, the whole stalk

* 3 cloves garlic 

* 1/2 onion (or a small one) 

* 2-4 cups of vegetable broth (water will also work)

* 2 tbsp vegetable oil (I sometimes use corn oil)

* A bit of sesame oil. (optional, but it makes it taste amazing)

* A bit of soy sauce. (also optional)

* Some corn starch and salt (optional)

Chop up the onions, green onions, and garlic and throw them in a wok with the vegetable oil. Let them swim around for a while, then throw in the the broccoli, chopped to your size preference. Cover with the broth or water and let cook until the broccoli looks happy. 

In a container, I mix some corn starch and salt together and throw the tofu in and shake it up a bit. If you are making the ""light"" version (without the sesame oil and soy sauce) you can skip that. 

I then throw the tofu into the mix and mix it around a bit. I usually add a bit of spice to it but that's it. Serve and enjoy! "

illiterate-,WTF,1389386340.0,"No, but I have family members with thyroid disease and psoriasis. From what I understand, is that having autoimmune diseases present increases your chances of having a type of autoimmune disease.

Like you, pregnancy brought out the worst of my symptoms and they never went away until I started taking Methotrexate, I'm not cured but I am better.

I'm warning you, sometimes it takes awhile for antibodies to be present. I was fortunate that even on prednisone antibodies were still in testable titres to get somewhat of a diagnosis. Don't give up, be your own advocate.

I hope you're able to exercise, even if it is just walking 30 minutes a day. It helps!!!!! Your joints may be painful to the point where it feels like you broke bones, but moving helps the synovial fluid from thickening and causing inflammation. In nursing, they really instilled in me the term ""You use it or you lose it!"" I know that during the waiting for a diagnosis and for treatment to work can be painful, there were days where I just cried because the pain was brutal, I had inflammation to the point where it felt like the skin on my hands and feet were going to burst open (it hurt, they had to cut off my wedding ring), and the fatigue makes you feel like shit. Hang in there! It most definitely can get better! Be positive, surround yourself with positive people.

I'm sorry if I'm rambling, I dont' even know what exactly you're going through. I just really hope that you get the best outcome. You can ask me anything if you want. I found that when I was diagnosed, I didn't know anyone my age with these problems - only the old ladies at the rheumatologist's office. So, if you want support or are curious, feel free to ask :)"

There are surely others too that can affect the cost/benefit ratio, all of which just adds up to an even more complex arrangement of probable outcomes.

In the same way as you can't really say the cost outweighs the benefits, you also can't say the benefits outweigh the costs, not without precisely defining what those costs and benefits are, and what arrangement of factors you're talking about.

I understand why people talk about this in terms of cost/benefit - they think that if you cannot convince someone about the science, at least you can convince them by appealing to their self-interest. I just think it is futile, because accepting where on this arrangement of probable outcomes we lie depends very much on what you accept of the science.

JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1389386930.0,"Telekinesis is moving stuff with your mind, it has some potential issues based on strain effecting the brain and the brain being fragile. Telepathy is mind reading and that is a bit more problematic because its downsides wouldn't kill you but would instead just drive you mad. Take for example the way it was dealt with in Heroes, telepathy gets you the surface thoughts (assuming that one can do any more creates all sorts of issues and would likely add in a bunch of potential health issues) and those aren't usually structured or even controlled. You'd be getting the brain's equivalent of static, that just so happens to be random bits of songs, clips of shows, impulses, fractured thoughts, and memories. If you've ever heard of intrusive thoughts then imagine that to the nth power, you would risk psychosis by simply using the ability because you cannot control other people's thoughts. To make matters worse there is a similar ability (referred to in fiction as empathy but in real life as emotional contagion, literally feeling other people's emotions) which seems to exist in real life and excluding the small portion of the population who seem to have it the emotional output cannot be kept separate from one's own emotions, that means either attempting to control it and not allow it to function (imagine trying to control and shut down your hearing) or carefully control their own emotions so that they can shut them down and begin faking everything at a moments notice (upside is that they already need to learn to fake displaying emotions like the rest of the population). I wouldn't be too surprised to find out that telepathy actually exists to some degree but the ability is simply part of a known psychosis just as empathy is part of a known disorder (which thankfully does not directly affect sanity or intelligence)."

Neebat,java,1389387073.0,"Just to add to your theory about two version numbers that matter...

Most software projects use a 1.x numbering until they're ready to throw out everything and do a major overhaul.  (I'm on several projects right now that I hope will make the leap to 2.0 soon!)  An example of this in Java is the EJB 2.0 specification which is an entirely different animal from the original.

Sun held onto that same 1.x numbering until someone admitted they'd never throw out the whole thing and start again.  At that point, you might as well jump to 2.0 and pretend it's all new.

Some languages have even done the leap forward more than once.  Perl 5 bears little resemblance to Perl 4, and Perl 6 is a whole different language.  (Which unfortunately will never be finished.)  By making Java 2 be a fake, reverse-compatible version, they avoided that kind of mess.

Python illustrates the problem with a real full-version leap.  Python 3 is different enough from Python 2 that lots of projects aren't bothering to make the leap."

My daughter sleeps through the night every night and has done so since 6 months old. She is now 20 months old. It took 3 days of 'training' to get her to sleep through the night. Our bed time routine is pajamas, put in crib, cover with blanket, turn off light and close the door."

fr1ction,asktrp,1389387374.0,"&gt; Where do I start? 

Sidebar.  

&gt; I need narrowed initial reading recommendations  

Try putting them in alphabetical order? Organize a dart board with book titles, close your eyes, then throw a dart? You gotta start somewhere man. If your goal is to read them all, just choose one at random. If you don't wanna read them all, then a good starting place is to make a list of the ones that you do want to read.

Personally, I just looked for which books are 1) available on kindle/Google Play Books and 2) Were cheap. There was my personal starting point, nothing to it.

&gt; I get intimidated with the ""talk to one woman a day"" jump in the water advice  

If it's too intimidating to do it, I'd argue where you're not yet at that point in your life when you want to make a change bad enough.  

Everyone sucks at everything the first time, but the only way to get better is to keep throwing yourself at it until you figure it out.  

&gt; Should I start therapy? Or will it be laden with incorrect advice and a feminist bias like our society?  

The great thing about this whole redpill thing is working on yourself. When you do that, you will be able to recognize what advice is good and what is flawed and you can pick and choose how you want to act based on what you know works, and then throw away/ignore what you know doesn't work."

Fluttershyhoof,TwoXChromosomes,1389387456.0,"I used a couple youtube videos for tips and training techniques, then developed some of my own training exercises, then used them for like an hour or two a day, every day minimum. I used audacity to record myself as I spoke to people on Skype, Ventrillo, the phone, etc. Then I'd play it back, listen to the parts I liked, recreate them, and build from there once I got ""in the voice"". I trained so much that I couldn't talk afterwards because my voice hurt so much. Now though? It's natural for me. I actually -cannot- go back to my old voice. I don't know how. It's lost. My voice is no longer segregated into ""guy voice"" and ""girl voice"" there's just ""my voice""... which happens to be female! :D "
GuyWithNoHat,sex,1389387456.0,"/u/MissFemme is correct.  Buying flowers and things are romantic gestures, sure, but it isn't the same as a sensuous foot/back rub.  Initiate sex *slowly*.  So slowly that she will wonder if you're even initiating.  Kiss that neck while she is doing dishes, but don't go any further.  In other words, tease her slowly.  Imagine that her brain and body have about 20 little switches to flip, and once they are all turned on, she will be warmed up enough.  Remember, you have to turn on her mind as well as her body.

Kids can also take a mental toll, because it's easy to fall into mom-mode or dad-mode.  The stress of kids can really knock a libido out of whack.

Just remember these things:

1. Get her to relax (this may take a while)
2. Turn her on slowly (if you're penetrating 5 minutes in, you're going to need to slow down).

Everyone is different and your mileage may vary, but this is generally pretty good advice.  "

gtalley10,facepalm,1389387809.0,"I'm in my 30s, and it's crazy to me to think that chicken pox is basically gone in the US now. That's one we all had to *hopefully* suffer through as kids to get the immunity now given by vaccines because of how bad it was for adults. I got it in 1st grade over spring break and my grandmother visiting for Easter couldn't even be in the same room with me cause she never had it. 

That's a shame your doctors haven't given better answers, particularly pediatricians when your kids were little. Saying to look online is tough because there's soooo much bullshit information out there (like with most controversial subjects) it's hard to wade through the nonsense unless you already know what you're looking for. 

I don't know of many specific sources of the top of my head to look. I know [Bad Astronomy](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy.html) regularly has posts about vaccines and puts good, sourced science based info. That's where I first heard of Dana McCaffery's story. His [year in review article](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/12/31/_2013_the_best_of_bad_astronomy.html) had a mention of a couple vaccine related stories, older ones can be found on google. As for reddit, /r/askscience would be where I'd start looking for threads or to start one for questions like this. 

For you, hypothetically, even if anti-vax is right and vaccines actually cause autism, your kids are old enough now that they aren't going to ""catch"" it. The causation problem with that argument about vaccines is that the onset of autism symptoms is generally IIRC between like 8 months and 2 years old... right around the time when they're getting vaccines, so it seems the logical cause even though there's no actual correlation.

Because I'd be equally mad if I got punched in the ""pubic mound"" or in the face or in the shoulder or even in the thumb. The part that defines an interaction as sexual assault isn't who ""owns"" the body parts, it's consent. If I demand to be punched in the pubic mound and then someone punches me in the pubic mound, it's not sexual assault it's just weird.

On point B, this is an opinion phrased as a fact that ends up admitting its an opinion anyways so it's subjectively true. As a woman, some words may target or belittle my gender with connotation or context but as an adult, I get to decide what hurts me. 97% of the things I find offensive are things I forget about in an hour, and both of our stats are 100% uncorroborated. As they say, there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. 

&gt; True equality is when a woman can be as stupid as any male typically is on reddit and still not have sexual assault wished on her.

True equality is when a woman or a man can be as anything as s/he wants in any place and when sexual assault on any human being never ever happens. FTFY, because while the definition of equality would literally mean man == woman, making *any* gender the measuring stick just makes everyone sad.

The pretense is that AT&amp;T *hopes* the money will convince him to stay.  They are fully aware that it may not be enough, but they've deemed it to be a good decision.  They have accepted this risk.

Even if we assume he blatantly lied to the customer service rep who issued the credit, I can argue that the credit serves to counter-act the lie that the new plan would be ""a lot cheaper"".  

To go back to your original comment: ""Using one entities immoral behavior ( e.g: AT&amp;T overcharging for their services) to justify your own (lying) are both inherently selfish acts.""

I agree that both are selfish, but an imbalance of power exists.  If AT&amp;T's representative lies (""assuring him it would be a lot cheaper""), there isn't much OP can do to counter-act that.  He can complain, but they're not likely to do anything about it.

The only thing that got me most of the money back was publicly complaining on their Facebook page and threatening to cancel the contract and dispute the charge.

I understand what you're saying, and agree that that's how it should work, but that's not how it works in the real world with companies who are large enough to either not care or be incompetent when it comes to customer service.  If they screw me over, I have to do everything in my power to protect myself, because they're only looking out for themselves."

1. Voting was based on property ownership, if you paid rates (council tax on property) you got a vote, you got a vote for every property or business you paid rates on, therefore multiple property owners got multiple votes. 
2. Due to widespread discrimination in housing very few Catholics/nationalists were property owners and therefore had no vote. The big business and property owners were protestants/Unionists ensuring they had electoral control.
3. Gerrymandering, the act of moving voting boundaries to ensure inbuilt majority in areas where there were actually Catholic/nationalist majorities (for example Derry) meaning that even when Catholics did get to vote their vote was rendered useless

Did he take that position because he thought the Chinese government couldn't maintain the peg? What about the relatively low interest rates and growing foreign currency reserves that run counter to a government being unable to maintain a peg.

essentially, you will strip the DRM and then you can have a file to use in whatever reader you want.

Or just do a google search for your ""book title(or author)+epub+download"", download it and then use it DRM free.

Personally i like using Google Play Books, because it syncs across all my devices and is device agnostic. You can now upload via the app too, so that's nice. I usually download the mobi or epub from the web. use calibre to clean it up, convert it to epub, edit the meta-data, etc. Then i upload the epub in my library to play books via the online updated. bing bang boom, easy peasy and my books (and bookmarks) follow me everywhere.

I have to disagree here. I'm actually watching it right now (literally, I've got episode 2 sitting, paused), and I've switched between the voice tracks numerous times during episode 1. It's very clear that the English VA's were not in the room together, since since many voice inflections seemed off and unnatural. Furthermore, Himari's voice seems too old for the girl she's playing, and her pronunciation of ""Survival Tactic!"" is legitimately cringeworthy.

ajdeemo,DotA2,1389388901.0,"having a drastic change like meepo's can have dire consequences if you're not careful. i suspect icefrog wanted to buff him, but also be careful. because meepo requires a pretty high skill to be played properly and he's uncommon, he's played a lot less than other heroes, meaning there's little data about him. this means that even if icefrog does buff meepo to be competitively viable, he probably still wouldn't be noticed for a while, so he'd get buffed more and more. eventually, people might realize how good he is, and then all of a sudden he's way too fucking good in the meta. something similar to what happened to wisp.

i highly doubt he's like that in his current state though. i just think icefrog tried to change him up and see what happened before buffing him more. also, it doesn't help that two of the bigger changes in 6.79 (night vision and tranquils) also affected meepo heavily. the general consensus is that 6.79 overall was a nerf to meepo, which i believe is probably true."

The ninth, tenth and eleventh regenerations all seemed fairly straightforward; the twelfth regeneration seemed to be more violent for one of the following:

* The regeneration also expelled the massive radiation he had absorbed.

* He held the regeneration back for an immensely long time in order to visit every companion before it took hold, and so when the time came to let it happen, it did so with force, as though the pressure had built up.

* His left arm was pointed directly at the console which may have damaged it and related systems too.

I don't see a reason for regenerations to increase with violence each time. The Master's regeneration in *Utopia* was no more violent than normal, and he had long exceeded the cycle he had originally before his resurrection."

hylandw,DnD,1389389106.0,"If they're playing 4 as you said, they will, at least, have the player's handbook. These are what you can make.

I'll provide definitions for a few words; it may sound insulting if you already know them but some of the smartest people I've taught hadn't heard of them before.

Races:

Dwarves: Short, stocky humanoids who are known for their constitution (health) and wisdom.

Elves: Tall, thin humanoids with pointed ears who live in the forest and are known for their dexterity (ability to dodge and dive and do things with their hands) and wisdom.

Humans: Humans. They're the most versatile race. They can play any class.

Halfling: Short humanoids who are notorious for having a knack for thievery. They are charismatic (have a way with words) and have good dexterity.

Half-elves: Half human, half elf. They have the finesse of elves and the drive of humans. They are intelligent and charismatic.

Eladrin: ""High elves"". Elves originate from these guys. They come from a different plane of existence called the Feywild, a land where the forces of nature are strong. They are intelligent and strong.

Dragonborn: Dragon-looking people who are known for being honourable. They are strong and charismatic. They also have tails (heehee) and (once you get to a high level) their great warriors have wings and can fly short distances.

Tieflings: An ancient curse lies upon these people. They resemble half-human, half-demons, with horns and tails and solid-colour eyes. They are not always seen well by others, as they are known to have evil tendencies from time to time. Any child of a tiefling, regardless of partner's race, is always a tiefling. They are charismatic and dextrous.

Pick one.

Here are the classes:

Wizard: A wizard. Eladrin, humans and half-elves make good wizards.

Fighter: Big burly fighter. They typically use either a large two-handed weapon or a weapon and a shield. Their role is to take the most hits and keep the others from getting hit, because they have the best armour and the most health. Humans, dwarves, eladrin and dragonborn make good fighters. I suggest a Dragonborn.

Paladin: Like a fighter, but they have religious ties. They are lawful and true. Humans, dwarves, eladrin and dragonborn make good paladins. Dwarves are particularly good at this.

Ranger: Imagine the awesome, medieval version of a forest ranger. They are swift, and use either bows or a weapon in each hand. Humans, elves and halflings make good rangers. Elves are, however, usually the best.

Rogue: A sneaky thief/assasin who uses deception and stealth to do their part. Elves, halflings, humans and tielfings make good rogues.

Warlord: They are commanders on the battlefield, good with blade and leadership. They are a ""leader"" meaning while they also attack, they are particularly good at healing and spurring on their allies. Humans, half-elves, dragonborn and tieflings make good leaders.

Warlock: These are people who use magic, like wizards, but in a more offensive capability. They also have their magic from forbidden sources, making an evil pact for their power. Tieflings, dwarves and humans make good warlocks.

Clerics: These are iconic. They are also heavy-healing leaders. They are religious people who fight for the good of their god. Half-elves, dwarves, elves and humans make good clerics.

NOTE: You'll see that humans are good at everything. The way they work is they are built from the ground up for a specific class. They can thus be anything, but this means while they are good at some things, they are only average at others. Still a good choice, as other races are less balanced and have less options.

So pick one of these now.

Make sure your race is good at their class. This will help you. You can ask me or other redditors for advice on your character. I don't know what level you're starting at, but remember that heroes start, usually, at low levels, but are nonetheless exceptional people. You may not be a god on earth, but you're still above average. You may be your town's hero, or a notable guardsman, or a mercenary, or even a prisoner who the rest of the party saves without knowing about their dark past.

Good luck! Remember that character creation can sometimes be a little daunting, but once that's done, it'll be fun! 

For dice, find a store [here](http://locator.wizards.com/#brand=dnd). Some may have more stuff than others, but all of them will, I repeat, *will* have dice. You'll need one, minimum, of these:

20-sided die (d20)

12-sided die (d12)

10-sided die (d10)

8-sided die (d8)

6-sided die (d6)

4-sided die (d6).

If you want things to run smoother, I suggest getting one or two extra d4s or d6s. The way things work is that the DM (or dungeon master) will present a scenario, and you must react. Example: ""You enter a dungeon. Deep within, you hear the echoes of a dragon's snores. What do you do?"" and then you would say ""I light a torch!"" or ""I plunge into the depths of the dungeon!"" or ""I poop in my sock!"" or ""I ready my blade!"". Whenever you want to do something, the DM can choose whether or not you should make a ""check"". This means you roll the 20 sided die and roll it, adding whatever modifier is applicable to your result. The number you get must equal or beat the number assigned to the check by the DM. He may or may not tell you what the number is. A popular house rule is that a 20 (the highest roll) is a critical success (meaning you succeed marvelously) and a 1 (lowest) is a critical failure, or ""critfail"" (You fail miserably).

This should be the very, very, basics. Reddit will provide everything you need to know.

Something I might add: You have 6 dominant ability scores.

Strength is the ability to crush a tomato.

Constitution is being able to eat a rotten tomato.

Dexterity is being able to dodge a thrown tomato.

Intelligence is knowing tomatoes are fruit.

Wisdom is knowing not to put them in fruit salad.

Charisma is being able to sell a tomato-based fruit salad.

I can't remember where I stole that from."

Those are all the points to work on, particularly inflection, pitch, and resonance. The others are more subtle, but if you get those three down, the rest comes pretty natural. 

Pitch is tricky because, too high and you sound falsetto, unnatural, and over-fem, too low and you sound andro or male. It's all about finding -your- natural pitch. That takes time. 

Inflection is the difference between ending words or sentences by changing pitch up or down. Males tend to go down in a more affirmative direct sound. Females tend to have it sound more light, like a question almost. If you have a woman who doesn't vary pitch and inflection, she sounds ""monotone"" and ""masculine"". 

Last is that tricky little resonance. Males tend to talk from the chest, females tend to talk from the back of the head. It's hard to describe it any other way... Male have a deep rumble, females have a softer, clearer tone. "

* Homegrown Smoker. Because you need your vegan BBQ and you need it now.

* Sip. Because nothing says ""I'm thirsty"" like vegan BBQ. They have milkshakes. They're vegan. 

* Paradox Cafe. Breakfast. Good. Decent prices. I can throw a rock at it from my apartment. I'm lazy, okay?

* Bye and Bye treated me well with their southern plate *however* I'm a kid of the SE. I peer into *Sweet Hereafter* hoping for an empty bar. It's never empty. It's way better than Bye and Bye.

It doesn't make you look good to have to resort to that.  They offer all kinds of advice for controlling your wife before it gets to that point, which basically equate to treating her like a child, with firmness, but kindness.  As to how common resorting to violence was, I have only ever seen reference to one case where local magistrates got involved and punished a guy for beating his wife, but I saw this totally by accident while looking for something else.  If you wanted to look for more of these examples in archives, I'm sure you could find them: all I can say is that it was within the power of local magistrates to punish this behaviour.

**Victorian Disco sample:** Not overly impressed with the pigmentation on this, but I do really like the color (which I was hoping for). It’s a midnight blue with lighter blue sparkles. 

**I+TA samples:** These completely blew me away! Rose Royalty is the most gorgeous rose gold, and Amaranthine is a really lovely and unique dark purple with coppery shimmer. The texture of these is absolutely lovely, they swatched really well. Also, the samples were packed with a ton of product. I’m so excited to try these out, especially Rose Royalty. 

**Overall:** I LOVED this subscription and totally felt like it was worth my money. I really liked the opportunity to try out other indie companies, but it was I+TA’s products that knocked this out of the park (even without Precious Flicker- edit: which is being sent to me asap due to some awesome customer service!).


***Shiro***

I love Shiro products and these two were no exception. You Snow Nothing is a really, really lovely color. The copper sparkle in this comes out much more in person than in the swatch on the website. I would really recommend ordering this while it’s still available, it’s so pretty and unique. You Know Nothing is a lovely pearly white.

postExistence,truegaming,1389390606.0,"this is a good question.

Most games that involve killing usually have a narrative or a story attached to it. And most narratives have characters who have ""conflicts,"" issues they need resolved. In all other forms of media, conflicts have numerous ways of resolving themselves in more traditional forms of media (television, film, theater, novel, poetry, etc.). But in video games, we resolve conflicts through killing and violence.

It's a lot easier to simulate violence in video games because on the surface it is unbelievably simple: shoot, punch, kick, hack, kill. Conflict resolution through dialogue is difficult to implement. Imagine transposing the non-interactive dialogue of, say, *Casablanca*, into an interactive fiction story. You play as Rick Blaine and choose from *any line he could possibly say* to all the other characters. You can control his posture, his eye movements, even the length of time you hang onto certain syllables when pronouncing words. 

* How do you even begin to create the kind of interface necessary to *receive* this information?

* How do you represent this information in code?

* How do you implement the interpretation of this information to formulate responses from NPC's?

* How do you create the appropriate software to express the responses from NPC's?

* And the biggest question of all: how much can you implement to make it look like you've got a complex system?

That costs tons of money. Violence as conflict resolution is just cheaper."

ComradeZooey,SubredditDrama,1389390865.0,"The connotations of 'White Student Union' are negative because most 'White ____' clubs tend to be racists. To an extent the entire reason that Black clubs exist is because historically they have been grouped together regardless of their actually ethnic background, and because in many cases African Americans don't know their ethnic background as a consequence of history. 

Most white people, however, are aware of their ethnic backgrounds(English, Irish, German etc...) so there isn't a need for them to group themselves so broadly, also there isn't a need because, in general, white people where never discriminated against based on the colour of their skin. Discrimination against white people was usually due to their ethnicity and/or their religion. Hence you do have things like Catholic Student Unions, Jewish Student Unions, Irish Student Unions etc...

So a more acceptable club might be to create a Celtic Student Union, German Student Union etc... that focuses more on the ethnic origins of people. 

TL;DR It's a consequence of history that black people have to categorize themselves by race. Most white people have the advantage of knowing their ethnic background, so the more broad category of 'white' isn't needed."

TheBlackDahliaMurder,weightroom,1389391208.0,"The thing is, as far as my aesthetic progress goes, I couldn't be more pleased considering I've only been lifting for about 6 months and have gynocomastia (which has caused me self-esteem issues my whole life). And also, I'm not necessarily in a rush to be lifting huge weight on the compounds - I'm patient as long as I keep seeing progress. My ultimate goal is the 1000 club, and I'm willing to take as long as it takes. So I'm kinda in the ""if it's not broke, don't fix it"" thing. 

I'm also happy with how much my bench/OHP progressed in that time. 

Bench 5RM: 95lbs &gt; 165lbs

OHP 5RM: 55lbs &gt; 115lbs

So as far as that goes, I'm pleased. I realize they aren't great lifts (180lb body weight) for someone lifting 6 months, but I'm still showing progress on that which is all I need to be happy.

But my squat is just downright depressing and I don't know what to do. I've already stalled once for a 3x5 scheme at 165lbs and had to deload (I very loosely follow SS for how I progress my compounds), which is just sad. I can't contribute my stall to not eating enough or sleeping enough because my other lifts aren't pathetic like this. I will eventually get a form check video up, but I've been constantly watching videos and reading articles. I do a push/pull/rest/legs/rest/repeat split so I only squat once every 6th day, but I don't think that should cause a stall like I've experienced.

My deadlift isn't great either, but that's moreso due to a back injury that kept me from deadlifting for a few months (causing me to restart at 135). So tomorrow I'll be doing 1x5x225, which isn't good, but it's still progressing nicely and 215 felt relatively easy so I know I have a little while before I stall there.

predalienmack,AskReddit,1389391265.0,"Preface: I'm just putting my thoughts down, so this may seem somewhat disjointed. Apologies in advance.

My Mom never ""taught"" any religious belief system to me, and to this day, what she does or does not believe in remains a mystery to me (I'm 20 years old). All I do know is that she is not into the brain-washing community aspects of religion (mainly church/religious schooling here in the US), and may or may not believe in a higher power. This intentional ambiguity and her emphasis on me figuring out things for myself and being my own person played a major part in the path to me being an agnostic atheist. 

That does not mean that there were not bumps in this path in terms of colliding with the possibility of having faith along the way, though. Being raised as a middle class child in the US means that I watched Disney movies, which in some cases arguably promoted very monotheistic, particularly Christian ideas and morals, and I celebrated widely accepted/""mainstream"" holidays (if only for the candy and presents) like Easter and Christmas with the fam, so you could say I lived in a very ""on the surface"" Christianity-oriented world. In the world I lived in as a child away from my Mother (with the extended family and at school or with friends), Chrsitianity was the commonly accepted and assumed religion, and especially in the wake of events like 9/11, kids who followed Islam were certainly ridiculed and treated as if they were criminals in the little microcosm of society that was a private school in my elementary years (though other religions were certainly looked down upon as well). 

Admittedly, I did not give the whole issue much thought while I went to said private elementary-middle school in SoCal, and I knew so little about religions at the time that in a conversation with friends about the topic, I recall classifying myself as something to the tune of ""15% Catholic, 35% Protestant, and 50% Christian."" This state of ignorance ended when I moved to Colorado around the end of the fourth grade. 

I started taking an interest in what these religious doctrines (particularly Christianity) dictated for us to do and what our purpose was in the fifth grade. Reading into basic logical inconsistencies and hypocrisies in the Bible (like God telling man not to kill, with God on the other hand having wiped out entire portions of humanity for not being what he intended them to be, when he was the one who created them and gave them free will to do what they wanted in the first place) definitely turned my ten year old brain off to the idea of religious belief based on faith and belonging. 

It was at that point that I became an atheist, though my emphasis on empiricism and demonstrable evidence being the basis for the adoption of ideas came later on. I recall reading ""God is not Great"" in middle school and being very roused by the ideas in it, to the point where I became very much an anti-theist as opposed to just an atheist, which led to me being very aggressive and hostile in debate/argument settings with my peers who happened to have deeply held religious beliefs. I killed the possibility of a lot of friendships due to my strongly held stance. 

As I got into high school and went through it, I slowly, but steadily mellowed out on the anti-theism stance until I got to the stance that I basically hold now: I have not witnessed any piece of convincing or demonstrable evidence that a higher power exists or that I should follow any specific religious doctrine, which leads me into having an agnostic-atheist stance. I'm cool with people who choose to believe in such things (though it's obviously difficult to be really strong friends with people you disagree with on so many fundamental levels of philosophy and the nature of our existence), and I only really take an issue with other people's beliefs when they use them as an excuse to discriminate against others on social/political/economic levels or if they believe that physical violence can be excused because of these beliefs or when they brainwash children into a specific mindset from an age where they don't know any better and can't weigh the factors for themselves.

TL;DR - I'm an agnostic atheist because of various factors that have contributed towards my development in life."

irrational_abbztract,BF4_X1,1389391330.0,"Welcome to the sub:

Here's my basic list of tips:

1. Learn the key bindings.

2. Always ""Spot"". This gets you points and tells your team where the enemy is.

3. Shoot in bursts. Higher accuracy = more damage to enemy = more chance of getting a kill. Bursts also mean less wasted ammo.

4. Have an aim (hehe get it?) as to what you want to be. Do you want to be a medic, an vehicle destroyer, a sniper or pilot..what do you wanna be?

5. Practice. There's a Test Range and its there for a reason. Go there and try the weapons and vehicles and learn how they work. I couldn't land a heli for shit until I went there and practiced for 10 minutes.

6. Play the fucking objective. Gets you points. Helps the team. Wins you matches. Is fun. Makes you a better player.

7. Talk to the squad. Talk to the team. Communication is the wall stopping you from winning. Your Squad is a fucking squad for a reason. You watch their back. They watch your back.

8. Adapt to the game. Do what is need for the WIN. That is the only objective there is to the game. If don't contribute to the win, you don't contribute. Do what the team needs you to do. DO NOT SNIPE. DO NOT. I swear to god if you snipe in your matches, I WILL hire an assassin to kill you. Unless you're a sniper that can get proper kills at 1000m or so, don't fucking snipe. You'll get killed A LOT and you don't help. If the team has no engineer, be an engineer. No medic? Be a medic. Anything but sniping from the edge of the map.

9. SPOT. You forgot about this didn't you? Well guess what? If you forget to spot, you are essentially your team to get fucked. The team needs to know where the god damn enemy is otherwise were all in the dark. We don't know shit about what's going on.

Got it?

1. SPOT 

2. SPOT

3. SPOT

4. SPOT

5. **DONT SNIPE**

6. PTFO

7. Practice"

BlindSoothsprayer,AskReddit,1389391744.0,"I was raised protestant.  My parents took me to church from the time that I was born onwards, so I can't remember a time when I hadn't been exposed to religion.  However, I remember that something always felt wrong about it.  I'm a very scientific/mathematical minded person.  So when I failed to see that the existence of God was obvious/self-evident, I figured I must have been missing or misunderstanding something.

Then, sometime around my early to mid teenage years, I decided that I definitely did not believe in God.  I can't place an exact date on it, because it was more of a gradual realization.  I thought that the universe was governed by (deterministic, as I erroneously thought) mathematical laws, which clearly leave no room for divine intervention.

In recent years, however, my opinion has softened.  I have become more open-minded.  It is ironic, because it seems that atheists are the ones that usually claim to be more open-minded.  I've been exploring some other religions (e.g. Buddhism and Hinduism), and also revisiting my Christian roots.

In conclusion, I would classify myself as an agnostic.  To me, it seems incredibly arrogant to either be religous or atheistic.  I am still very scientific.  Faith is a concept that I absolutely do not understand.  As foolproof are the principles of the scientific theory, no current theories can describe everything with absolute precision.  Perhaps one day we will have a theory of everything, but that day has not yet come to pass.  Hence, all I know is that I know nothing."

ComradeZooey,SubredditDrama,1389391875.0,"In the humanities Racism as a concept needs to have power behind it. Black slaves in the south may have hated all white people, but because they had no power to enforce their prejudice it cannot be called Racism. To broadly speaking, in the humanities, Racism is prejudice and power. Hating someone individually due to the colour of their skin is prejudice, unless there is significant power to enforce that prejudice, then it's racism. If I understand correctly.

It's one of the many cases where the academic definition is nuanced and complicated, and therefore not entirely useful for a dictionary definition. Like I said though, in popular thought, Racism and Prejudice are almost synonyms. So to the average person Racism might simply mean discrimination on the bases of race. Also ethnocentrism is separate from racism. While the Irish were discriminated against, it was not due to the colour of their skin, mostly it was due to their religion and historic animosity between the English and the Irish. While some people tried to justify their prejudice against the Irish by saying they were a different race, that was in the context of racism being ""scientific"" in the Victorian mind. The big separation was that an Irish or Jewish person could, given enough effort, probably pass as English or German etc... while a Black, Asian or any dark skinned person would be discriminated against no matter what effort they put in. That's not to say that ethnocentrism is better or worse than racism, they're both awful, but distinct concepts.

If you ever look at what companies graduates from schools like MIT, Berkeley, CMU, etc. go to, you will find a large portion (75% or more) of them don't end up at any of these supposed ""top"" talent companies (so then these companies must be hiring from much lower tiered places, and don't actually have all the talent you presumed).

thunderburd,AskMen,1389392339.0,"Copypasting my answer from a thread from a few months ago:

I think feminism too often contributes to the erasure of male victims of rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence. It looks only at the most successful, most powerful males in western society while ignoring the vast vast numbers of males at the bottom to justify a BS theory of ""patriarchy"". It encourages the demonization of men. It views all areas of male suffering (high number of suicides, homelessness, workplace deaths, child support and family court, violent crime victim rate, circumcision, etc.) as ""patriarchy backfiring"" or re-frames those issues as ""benevolent sexism"" (so this bad thing happening to men that doesn't happen to women? Yeah, it's ACTUALLY worse for women because patriarchy.)

So I very very very much dislike feminism. Are there feminists that I consider good people? Absolutely.

(ie: I know I can see my NJ/PA/NY friends when I'm in town or they're here; We're good that way)

I'll throw anyone on my FB. It ain't no hurdle. I added the guy I'm seeing before our first official date(s). He's seen my messy bedroom. I'm sure he can handle my FB feed.

If I'm dating a person I call them their name. He has a name. I use it. Usually I don't bleet MAH BOYFRIEND in mixed company but again holding hands, close sitting, close talking, affection are all pretty clear signals we're not two buds hanging. By the way, if we're just buds you'll be lucky to get a fist bump outta me. I only am this way in a close relationship. It's my private way to say ""you know what, guy I'm seeing, you matter a lot"".

If I set a relationship status online (this flair was because my old one was *trust issues* which I have but not right now) it's just to let people know what's up who aren't actually in my social circles. I do see it needed to progress the relationship in these times. However if we all deleted all social media I'd still see ""I love you"", ""let's move in together"", ""marry me"" and ""hey so I'm pregnant / did you mail the adoption papers off?"" as progressions like a normal person who isn't all tied to TWEET CULTURE. #yolo"

Think workers vs. capitalists. Who cares about individual liberty if the group dynamics could be improved? You should always align yourself against the oppressor as that is what is evil.

I think it comes down to we consider that oppression coercive and libertarians just say oh that's the free market. On the left we would say one cannot be free so long as we have disproportionate power in the hands of a few. Capitalism structurally is disproportionate power based on capital running our lives. I'd argue libertarians are for freedom of a few to dominate the many while establishing perceived dependency in a feudal like existence. They just don't realize it, because they somehow think the hoarders lusting for ownership and power will not crush competition.

Assemble the Legion is how you want to win that game, burn everything and save Chained for a Pack Rat that you can't answer any other way or Desecration Demon.  Once Assemble is down DD is a non issue after a few turns.

A Pack Rat with 5 mana up is a little tough, but if you've still got enough burn you're still just 1 for 1ing with them.  I like Mizzium Mortars in the SB to get a 2 for 1 or more on late game Pack Rats, as well as another answer to Specter (and I take out every creature in the deck vs Mono B).

Basically, if you can burn everything for 4 or 5 turns and then stick an Assemble the Legion while you're at 10 life or more you pretty much can't lose.  If you don't draw enough lands for it or they Thoughtseize all of your Assembles and you don't top deck one you pretty much can't win.

Benjamin Franklin Gates stepped into the chamber and looked around. Where most people saw various symbols of American might and historical jurisprudence, he saw a multitude of hidden codes, messages to future generations, and the occasional Masonic bit of advice. Almost instinctively, he scanned every inch of the room, ignoring for the moment the nine Justices of the Supreme Court as they stared at him. He wondered what the grand connection was, why the Bald Eagle on the west-facing frieze was--

""Mr. Gates,"" Justice Kennedy interrupted. ""Are you prepared to explain your findings?""

""Oh, yes indeed, your honor, sir,"" he replied nervously. ""And may I say what a great privilege it is to finally be able to--""

""Will the witness please just get on with it?"" Justice Scalia was in one of his infamous bad moods. Gates wandered silently for a moment, wondering where exactly he was supposed to stand as he addressed the court. He settled for just in front of the defense's table; after all, he was their star witness.

""If it pleases the court, the code I discovered... well, it starts out with a simple mathematical trick: the Magic Square. You're probably familiar with it, even if you didn't know its name: a three-by-three square with the numbers one through nine placed inside. Now, the numbers have to be arranged so that all three rows, all three columns, and the two diagonals, they all add up to fifteen."" Gates ran his fingers through his thinning hair. He was starting to pick up steam, and he didn't want to start rambling, not at the Supreme Court of the United States. He focused himself.

""Now, when Ben Franklin was consulted during the writing of the Constitution, he pointed out a number of Federalist arguments for a number of clauses that hadn't yet been approved. Eventually these became the Bill of Rights, which you of all people are quite familiar with."" A tittering of laughter from the audience. Even Justice Thomas, the famed stoic, chuckled a bit.

""Ben Franklin, as we all know, wasn't permitted to write any part of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, because the Founding Fathers were afraid that he'd do... something funny with it. But they still consulted him when it came to the Bill of Rights, and here's where his genius came into play: he chose the order of the Amendments which became the Bill of Rights-- the first nine, anyway. Have you ever wondered why the right to bear arms is the Second Amendment, and not the Seventh? Or why the Fifth Amendment is the Fifth? Ben Franklin secretly advised Madison on which order to put them in. The Tenth Amendment, by the way, was added long after Franklin's input was solicited.

""So, back to the Magic Square. There's only one combination of numbers that solves the magic square, if you discount mirror images and ninety-degree turns:

""8 + 1 + 6, 3 + 5 + 7, and 4 + 9 + 2""

Gates paused and took a sip of water. *Pace yourself*, he thought to himself, *don't look like a raving lunatic*. His parents were sitting in the upper balcony, beaming. Even his father had never testified in front of the Supreme Court. Gates watched as Chief Justice Roberts scratched something on a notepad in front of him. Writing the numbers down, perhaps, making sure everything added up.

""Having... examined an original copy of the Constitution myself,"" he continued, reminiscing about the time long ago when he'd stolen it from the National Archives, ""I noticed something odd about it: there are seven articles of the Constitution, and in each of them-- discounting years mentioned or amounts of money-- there are nine numbers mentioned in the Constitution: Ten, four, thirty-five, two, twenty-five, six, thirty, twenty-one, thirteen. Many of these are obvious: how many states ratified, ages to hold office.

""But!"" Gates exclaimed, his mind beginning to race, ""each Amendment, respective of its position in the Magic Square, also happens to be long enough to accommodate its respective number in word counts!"" Justice Alito frowned, his brow furrowed. ""Let me be specific: the Eighth Amendment, first in the Magic Square, has at least ten words. The First Amendment has at least four, et-cet-er-ah, et-cet-er-ah,"" he said, sharply enunciating those words.

""So what's the answer, Mr. Gates?"" Justice Kagan asked.

""I'm glad you asked: sure, you could say that those word counts are coincidence, but! here's the giveaway that it's a code: take the Eighth Amendment. First on the Magic Square, its tenth word the critical one. The tenth word of the Eighth Amendment is eight. letters. long. The First Amendment, second on the Magic Square, it's fourth word is a single letter: ""a"". If you keep going, you find that each specific word is the same length as the Amendment number it is contained in.""

""And what do you get when you find all those letters?"" Justice Breyer asked impatiently.

""You get a code: H-A-I-L-K-I-N-G-G, 'Hail King George'."" Gates paused to catch his breath. ""The American Revolution was a fake. We've been secretly subjects of the United Kingdom all along. History,"" he said pointedly, ""has been a lie. And that woman--"" he pointed at Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, who was sitting at the defendant's table-- ""she is our actual ruler and sovereign."" He turned to her, bowing deeply. ""Isn't that right, Your Majesty?""

""Indeed,"" she replied."

I get what you're saying and I probably do have some sociopathic traits but apparently it's something you're born with.

It is great he saved 400 lives, I just have a hard time understanding the point. The whole idea of doing a good thing for humanity, gaining hero status or whatever makes no sense to me once you are dead.

It might sound selfish but seriously, once you are dead and I don't mean dead and looking on from heaven, I mean dead.. what does it matter what happens on Earth?

I can see how from a societal point of view pushing the self-sacrifice idea has value. Same with historical Kings and today's politicians who push that concept.

when I ask myself though, if my life is equal to someone else's, it isn't. I have a right to live and so do they but if I can spare my life (even if others die) I will.

skgoa,formula1,1389394066.0,"Oh Boy. First we have to be conscious of the fact that ""grip"" doesn't physically exist. It's just short for ""the car did what I wanted it to do."" It's different on every lap and I. Every corner and completely unquantifiable. Now, generating aerodynamic downforce is a means to improve a car's ability to do what the driver wants. I.e. more downforce means ""grip"" at a higher speed. (A speed at which there would otherwise not be ""grip"".) Downforce is a quantifiable quality of a car, with which one can compare cars. Someone at some point apparently thought that there must be a corresponding quality that governs low and medium speed ""grip."" Since this must be a result of the mechanical makeup of the car, it was called ""mechanical grip."" 

Now, it's not that bad when it's understood as a simpler term for ""weight management"" or something like that. But unfortunately many people have taken up the strange notion that a car has a certain quantifiable number of ""grip"" that consist of part ""mechanical grip"" and downforce. This is just not true. And there lies the problem with the term, because the words we use shape the way we perceive the world. Talking about a trade off between the two doesn't make sense at all and only leads to wrong statements like the one above. You always want the best weight management, the best center of gravity, the least drag, the most downforce...

And ""aero grip"" is a strange new term for downforce that r/formula1 invented a couple of months ago. The first time I came across it was when someone claimed that with the rule changes after the 2004 season ""the FIA reduced aero grip and increased mechanical grip to improve overtaking"", which just isn't what happened at all."

Wells has more than 5 years in MLB, so at his request, he can either be released from the Yankees or kept on the MLB roster.  He has to give consent to be sent to the minors.  In either case, he still has to be paid.

If he is released and another team picks him up, the Yankees still pay his salary minus what the team who picks him up pays him (usually MLB minimum).  So of his $21,000,000 salary, the Yankees will still be responsible for the vast majority of it (though $18.6 million of his 2014 salary is already being paid for by the Angels)."

Benlarge1,AskReddit,1389394219.0,"why can't music just be fun sometimes? the people that complain about other people not ""enjoying"" music the *right* way are so fucking pretentious it makes my top hat and monocle spin. just because pop songs are, you know, popular DOESN'T mean that other genres of music can't just do their thing. what people don't realize is that music is ART. If the art is moving you in the form of making you dance to the beat then it's good art. Saying sophisticated lyrics and things that make you think is what should only be accepted as good music is like saying abstract art should only be accepted as good art.

Also who the fuck are you to say that pop artists are only making music to make money? Pop artists work incredibly hard on their music and are (yes) making money doing what they love. I've been to both pop music artists concerts and ""traditional"" music concerts and I have to say that holy shit did the pop artists make you feel like you were important.

Its like you're just blind to the fact that for a lot of people music is just something to listen to. Get over the fact that your ""precious"" music is just as valid as ""Mr. World Wides"" new hit single."

I can see why people do it, but I don't like it for two reasons.  Firstly, I find it aesthetically unpleasant.  The printed page is beautiful, and your scribbles aren't adding to that.  Second, from a more philosophical stance, I believe it's a bad idea.  By committing your thoughts to page right next to the original passage, you'll never be able to read that passage again without seeing your old commentary.  You're locking yourself in to thoughts that may or may not be correct.

There are ways to do this without violating these two principles, but as for myself I'd never write in my Bible."

He's incredibly picky won't eat anything 'healthy', he gets a bit pouty if my mum doesn't make something he 'can eat' and will sit downstairs, watch TV and not eat at all and that makes my mum anxious because she doesn't want anyone to be mad at her. Even though if she had made something he liked he would STILL sit downstairs and watch TV while my mum watched upstairs. IDGI

When I was 18 I decided I needed a change and couldn't be so obese anymore. I started learning about calories and nutritional values and portion sizes and have been slowly losing weight since. I had been part of a gym since I was 16 but I started seriously going and I lost 50lbs.

When I pointed out the nutritional values on things to my mother and tried to educate her on things she hopped on the bandwagon for a little while but slowly got off, even cancelled her gym membership because 'she has no time' despite now being retired. Last night I got home from work and she'd bought a 6 pack of donuts(on top of the 6pc cinnamon buns we already have) and made an entire thing of mac'n'cheese for her just and my dad. I've tried to help her, all I can do now is help myself. 

EDIT: I should add, while I do blame my parents for the fat, I still really love them and besides this they were really lovely parents. My mum has ALWAYS told me how beautiful and smart and wonderful I am and my dad always took me on errands with him or to the Santa Clause parade in the freezing cold because he's not as comfortable with verbally telling me he loves me.

**HOWEVER**, HRT does do a lot to the face. It reduces muscle making it appear less heavy, redistributes fat in areas like cheeks which give a more feminine appearance, and clears up your skin and shrinks pores which will make it appear more youthful.

Same thing happens with the rest of your body, muscle loss, fat redistribution, and skin changes, as well as halting further masculinization; and that's not even counting all the positive mental effects of HRT.

 My mom/brother/stepdad all are Jehovah's Witnesses.... so that went over as well as you'd expect. Mom disowned me and my brother/stepdad haven't even spoke to me in 2 years. So there's that.

Note: I'm not entirely sure about *your* mother per se, but the above is certainly true of mine. Confronting the true reality of it has helped me immensely. Yes, I want the world to be sunshine and roses where everyone tries their very best and everyone gets a gold star but the harsh truth is that some people just fucking suck. While it seems somewhat hopeless in that of course the only thing we can do is try... 

But I find it very heartening to know that we're far more likely to succeed at our tries if we are honest with others and ourselves about what's really going on, rather than trying desperately to make excuses for our parents in an effort to rewrite the miseries of our past into something easier for us to accept. 

But this is the truth as I know it: My mother ""loved"" me, but only when/if I fulfilled her flighty and capricious standards or if I showed indications of finally leaving her to her miseries all alone, with no buffer for her true core of self-hatred and loneliness. 

Her true existence is one of continual fear and loathing at her very core, where she is never good enough, so she employs extremely unhealthy methods to try to convince everyone (including herself) that she's not the pathetic loveless creature she truly is... The pathetic loveless creature *she refuses to understand* that she *chooses* to be. 

In many ways, I pity her. Which is why I haven't cut her off completely. But I am careful to give extremely limited access to my true thoughts and feelings... I am careful to play nice. Because my mother, inasmuch as she is pitiable and somewhat pathetic in many ways, is very dangerous to my mental and financial well-being, because, despite my insight, she is able to manipulate me.

I had just decided that he wasn't interested in me after all. I gave myself all the pep talks about moving on, considered what my other options might be and who else I should pursue, the whole bit. Later that day, he sent me a text asking if I'd like to go get something to eat because he was near my apartment. I accepted, doing everything possible to temper my enthusiasm.

We had dinner, which felt very un-datelike but was still fun (he said later he didn't actively consider it a date). I kept a critical eye on the situation and came out undecided as to whether we were hanging out as just friends or not. Then we went to meet up with some friends who were going to see a movie. We were late, so we wound up sitting together on the front row. I noticed part way through the show that he wasn't moving his arm away from my arm rest (which had my arm on it as well, of course). I was not sure what to make of this. After a long while, I decided to move my hand down to where his was and see what happened. He immediately reached out and held my hand.

After the movie, he took me home. We decided to linger in the car because there was an NPR show on that we both wanted to hear. I was tracing one of the tattoos on his arm and asking him about it. He just...leaned over and kissed me. At first I didn't move, so he kissed my cheek. Then I kissed him back. And then we kissed each other. And then I went inside."

We welcomed him in and he was AWESOME. He outdrank us, he hustled us in beer pong, he taught us cool stuff.

Van Brunt Stillhouse bourbon.

Atmosphere: Sitting around thinking about watching a movie. Then again the next day (just now) because I was worried about being unfair.

Presentation: A few ounces neat, in a simple glass. Let it sit out for a half hour or so to get some air. Second time was an ounce neat in an old tiny A&amp;W Rootbeer glass. It didn't get to sit around this time, and the results were no different.

Appearance: Dark, like caramel, but ever so slightly cloudy, like an apple cider vinegar almost.

Nose: Oak, the ghost of a better bourbon, a little sweetness, and then something akin to someone opening a cheap bottle of rye in another room.

Taste &amp; mouth: Nice mouth feel, round, with a little something like exploding sparks of black pepper. Undeveloped taste, almost like the various elements in the mash bill were fighting one another. Nothing stands out, not a hint of the usual maple or vanilla or pecan or richness that comes with other bourbons (even others under 4 years old).

Finish: plastic-like ethanols, and some final whiff of acetone in the nose.  It also oddly numbs the inside of one's cheeks like dental anesthetic.

Overall: hugely disappointed for the tremendous expense. Perhaps they'll get better. But this isn't Hudson, and it especially isn't Widow Jane (though that's probably not a fair comparison)."

I was more interested in it from a cinematic standpoint than from a narrative one, though.  A lot of the film was visually interesting and there were some moments that were really well done- like when the camera would flash back and forth between Don's face and the porn he was watching to indicate how he was ""losing himself"" and how that same technique was used with other characters to imply the same thing.

On the other hand, it does suck to be evaluated by means other than your individual merits. The national dialogue on these issues tends to be divisive though, in part because people have so little interaction with each other. Someone in the midwest who says that racism is ""over"" obviously hasn't been exposed to the poorer neighbourhoods in the major metropolitan cities.  It really is a lack of understanding and empathy. On the other hand, dismissing those people and calling them racists isn't going to help, it's just going to cause more division. It's another situation where sincere dialogue is desperately needed, and that's something that American media is terrible at."

risto1116,GNV,1389395538.0,"I go on occasion, been to more baseball games than anything else in the last 2-3 years. Here are my tips:

-They offer cheap/free tickets sometimes. Follow GatorZoneBB (or whatever it is) on twitter to see the deals. Sometimes it's ""buy 2 tickets, get 2 hotdogs free"" or something. Lots of giveaways, too.

-Show up and buy your ticket at the gate. Ask for cheapest available. For smaller games, you'll have no problem moving up closer. If you want nicer seats for big games, buy online and buy early. 

-Parking is actually not that bad. Not as bad as you'd think. The common mistake is to try and park close to the stadium. If you park out in the lot nearest the exit, you can be in your car and on the road in under 3 minutes. The parking garage is a nightmare, especially the higher you go.

-My parking tip: I park down near the tennis courts/soccer stadium area. It's about a 5 minute walk MAX and it offers me 3 different exits to choose from. I'm not the only one doing this, but it sure is easier than parking right next to the stadium/O dome."

But there are plenty of reasons for the bride and/or groom not to want to be drunk at their wedding.

Also, there are lots of cameras, and some people really do not photograph well when drunk. One of them could also be driving afterward, if they haven't hired a limo or something. Maybe they want to have a coherent wedding night. Maybe the bar is really expensive and they're just getting by paying for everyone else's drinks.

Maybe she can't drink for some reason, like she's pregnant or something, and she doesn't want to be the only sober one at the party. Maybe they have a really traditional family or they're having a solemn religious ceremony.

LeeTaeRyeo,AskReddit,1389395878.0,"Deaf (with capitals) indicates someone who was raised in Deaf culture. Deaf (without the capital) is used for anyone that is born deaf. The primary reason that I used ""Deaf"" is that the Deaf community tends to use ASL which does not necessarily encode sound information about the local language and has its own culture. Non-culturally deaf individuals are those who were raised in an area without a major Deaf community, or lost their hearing later in life (and thus didn't grow up in Deaf culture). The deaf often use lip reading and SEE (Signed Exact English), which encodes sound and mouth-shape related information about words. So, the sound of the English language is often less shocking for those that are deaf (because, again, a large part have lost their hearing later in life), than those that are Deaf.

In general, ""Deaf"" is used for those who grew up in Deaf culture (typically in the form of attending a school for the Deaf), whereas ""deaf"" refers to those who did not grow up or have access to Deaf culture."

&gt;I think it comes down to we consider that oppression coercive and libertarians just say oh that's the free market.

The left considers labor markets fundamentally coercive. Libertarians don't. Hence you've broken three levels of differentiated values while our position is the hierarchical labor capitalist structurally violates your own supposed principles. Seriously, the only way capitalism gets people to do many of the things they do is by denying them access to fundamental necessities of life unless they submit to the labor demands of capital holders. 

I'm well familiar with your vision of what free unregulated markets would be. I've long since rejected the notion as I'm an ex-libertarian. There's nothing throughout history to suggest a self-regulated market will be anything but a practice in dominance by a capital elite akin to feudalism if carried out over a long enough timeline. Some level of mobility within the economic nobility certainly is to be expected, but the relationship of capital to labor is almost universally an antagonistic one where the capital holder leverages submission, obedience and seeks a level of dependency in the laborer to the ends of the capitalist. There's nothing to suggest a greater level of mobility offered by freeing capitalists from democratic restraints left only to what little leverage consumers and unaligned laborers might provide.

Capitalism itself is but a small tweaking of the feudal system that altered the mode of production and relationship of labor to capital(lords were just capital holders and serfs laborers at the most basic level). Remove proportional restraint of the state from the capitalists and you're just on a descent back toward feudalism.

Oh and now you're onto the bad minimum wage, bad monetary policy shtick I see. Well, historically speaking organized labor either privately often through violence or through the state is all that's ever really kept upward wage pressure. There's little reason to think in an era of ever expanding technological automation in particular that private utilization of labor would be near universal or come with rising standards of living. Which we would require near universal employment, employment derived through labor market leverage, or a labor movement like we've had in the past before buying power would likely rise. Some would rise either way, while others would fall. Such is the pattern of capital circulating the globe as civilizations rise then fall. All managed by a hierarchy of capital elites with limited mobility amongst the classes. "

A 'what engine oil should i use or when should i change my engine oil?' thread turns into about 50 replies based on anecdotal evidence of ""my grandpa did this for 40 years"" or ""my brother did this""

I'm pretty sure that's why this subreddit has rules. If someone has a clear cut problem about a repair, it's much easier to give answers based on information and fact, and not turn threads into anecdotes by 50 different people. I do agree that the name is misleading. Though it does say on the sidebar ""r/Cartalk is the #1 Reddit auto repair community, with over 14,000 subscribers and growing.

redundanteater,bourbon,1389396488.0,"Van Brunt Stillhouse Bourbon Whiskey, 80 proof (wheated bourbon with 65% corn sourced from NY State)
Batch 1
Price: about $35 for a half bottle (375 mm)

Atmosphere: Sitting around in my tiny but elegant apartment thinking about watching a movie. Then again the next day (just now, same place) because I was worried about being unfair to a local producer.

Presentation: A few ounces neat, in a simple glass. I let it sit out for a half hour or so to get some air. Second time was an ounce neat in an old A&amp;W Rootbeer glass. It didn't get to sit around this time, and the results were no different.

Appearance: Dark, like caramel, but ever so slightly cloudy, like an apple cider vinegar almost. According to the label, it is unfiltered, so perhaps the odd appearance was on purpose.

Nose: Oak, the ghost of a better bourbon standing behind my shoulder, a little sweetness, and then something akin to someone opening a cheap bottle of rye in another room.

Taste &amp; mouth: Nice mouth feel, round, with a little something like exploding sparks of black pepper coming after a quick swish. Undeveloped taste, almost like the various elements in the mash bill were fighting one another. Nothing stands out, not a hint of the usual maple or vanilla or pecan or richness that comes with other bourbons (even others under 4 years old). There was a brief lag, then more ethanol astringency than would be expected from 80 proof.

Finish: plastic-like ethanols, and some final whiff of acetone in the nose. It also oddly numbs the inside of one's cheeks like dental anesthetic. That effect quickly wears off, but was very strange.

Overall: hugely disappointed for the tremendous expense. Perhaps they'll get better. But this isn't Hudson, and it especially isn't Widow Jane (though that's probably not a fair comparison).

Score: 67/100  (I'm a university professor. I want to give it a high D, just to encourage them, but I don't want to get anyone's hopes up by giving it a passing grade.)"

I say it sympathetically, but clearly. I try to let them know, mostly with my tone, that I feel bad about hurting them but it really just isn't going to happen.

Keep it short, but kind. If they want to drag it out, then that's OK on a limited basis - if it doesn't seem productive for them, then gracefully extract yourself from the conversation. Don't explain why you aren't interested unless they ask, and then focus on your own feelings. Only give feedback about them if it's both asked for and constructive (ie, something you think they can and should do something about).

The thing is, people are always going to be upset. Rejection sucks, and it hurts, and there's not really a way around that. You can soften it a bit, but you'll still likely make someone cry at some point. It just comes with the territory.

EDIT: I do try to be sincere in the way I express things, rather than using overused phrases like ""I'm flattered"" or ""It's not you, it's me."" I think it stings a bit more when you know you're being handed a line. When I put things in my own words (even if the sentiment is exactly the same), I think that helps a little bit."

I can understand your point about the hate, but when you consider that he made a UK #1 record and *still* uses pirated software, it's really hard to respect him, even if he was an excellent producer. 

When you combine this with the fact that he clearly lacks both imagination (simply dragging in presets and stuff from sample packs, with almost no modification) and technical knowledge, people naturally start asking questions and feel that he doesn't deserve the hype.

When I watched this video, I realised why some people think that making electronic music requires little effort. When you compare Garrix's video to any other producer in the same video series, it becomes clear that he has basically no idea what he's doing. 

EDIT: I personally don't care too much about the lack of original sound design, because that's basically the same with any other pop track out there, just how the ""music"" industry is (I was pointing out some issues others may have with it).

I lived with mine during a portion of my 20s, and mostly I just kept to myself. They'd specifically built their house to have living rooms on multiple levels, so me and my brother had a place to ourselves and we played video games and watched movies. It was considered polite to eat with our parents, though, so there was that little bonding experience most evenings even if it was just 30 minutes scarfing down food while watching the news.

For your situation, though, find something you'd actually like to watch with them and spend time with them then, or just sit down with and talk to them for a little while each evening. Tell them how your day went. Tell them what's up with your friends. If you have a laptop, show them funny things you saw on the internet (at least the worksafe ones). Listen to what they have to say, even if it's boring.

It'll go one of two ways. You'll either start thinking of them more as friends so it won't feel like a chore, or you'll bore them to the point they won't bug you to spend more time with them. :)

Lluxx,actuallesbians,1389397298.0,"For strangers (I know you didn't ask this, but I'm including it anyway because it's the sort of thing I used to be desperate to know), it's all about how you present yourself. Their first impression of you is likely to be from across a room and you want it to be the right one. I, for example, have two friends. Friend 1 is pretty attractive and Friend 2 is very attractive. But Friend 1 always gets strangers approaching her, far more than Friend 2. Why? Because the first girl looks like she is absolutely loving life whereas the second girl looks like life is a chore. The first girl is confident, having great fun and acting ridiculous. The second one is only paying attention to how many people are paying attention to her and looks like she's on some kind of serious mission and not having any fun. 

Anyway, so let's say you look like you're having great fun and so you've successfully caught a girl's attention. The most important thing, I find, is to be playful. Be funny, be self-deprecating (but only a little!), be slightly teasing. Also, ask questions and be genuinely interested in her responses. Don't be afraid to pay her compliments but don't seem like you're just flattering her. Keep it light and only a little suggestive until you know what she's comfortable with. If she seems to be enjoying herself and is responding in kind, carry on!

With body language, being relaxed and friendly are - once more - the most important things. Try to keep your arms relaxed because folding them can make you look shut-off or grumpy. Try to keep your eyes on her so she knows you're paying attention to her as she talks. If it's appropriate, touch her on the arm or shoulder; as long as you don't accidentally make her feel trapped she should be fine. A good test is to consider what you'd feel okay with happening to you as a rough guideline. 

I've left a hell of a lot out here, but I don't want to ramble. This is only the most general of advice, but just go with the flow and remember: don't come on too heavy, be friendly, be funny, be interested in her.  "

I forgot my wallet at the house of a friend, there was money on the wallet but when i came to take the money he spent some part of this (so he just took my money on my own wallet? what the hells?) and said that he would not pay everything he spent just a part. I take this on a sportive way and said to he that he would yes pay all.
So today i went take my money and i act like nothing has happaned, i smiled a lot i did not say anything about it. So i was like: ""ok bro, u stole the money of my wallet, but is ok.""

I will agree the advice of this sub tends to be (as you said) often ""full of shit on every level"" but it's also cliched advice that has a subtext of ymmv. As I said, the guy I began seeing recently unknowingly placed a negative value judgment on me starting on date one. I didn't really feel bothered by it.

I did say ""Oh your ex is that hot girl on your facebook! I thought she was just a friend and you were her nerdy dude bestie."" [paraphrased]

It was a good lesson, as I was a late adopter of last gen console and the only button masher I occasionally still played on ps2 was tekken tag. It did stop me from buying tekken tag 2 though. 

In my old age, I much prefer a more laid back rather than actions-per-minute play style.

If I recall, EFI Live is the software for GM ECUs and it's about $2000, only purchased by tuning shops. I'm not sure about the current state of Ford ECUs, Dodge is accessible but I think only by installing a piggyback (which is a second ECU that changes the signals coming out of the stock ECU). Piggybacks are usually the best way to access a modern ECU, because of cost, ease of tuning, and safety.

I know that the older Saab ECUs (Trionic T5.5 and later) are open, Subaru ECUs are open(ish), and maybe a few others. I know some Saab guys who drive around with a laptop in the passenger seat, constantly retuning. I'm not sure about most of the Japanese import stock ECUs. People who want a lot more power usually go to an aftermarket ECU.

If all you want is more information there are a lot of products that allow you to plug into your cars OBD2 port and monitor I wide variety of data. A cheap Bluetooth OBD2 module and an app for either iOS or Android will feed you all kinds of data."

Someone who entered with perhaps an 85% average from highschool is bound to drop a few percent. That puts them right on the line.

If you were a 90+% student in highschool, you'll probably keep your scholarship with a little work, and if you were a 70%-82ish% student in highschool, it is more than likely that you weren't going to keep it anyways.

It's irritating though. I had a 10.9 GPA (A-) last year, but a number of engineering firms are looking for students with an A or higher.

And people have used bears as basically glorified pets for long time (think circus animals) and elephants were work and war animals through  much of their ranges for a lot of eyars.

The problem with a bear as a pet is a bit like a tiger as a pet.  Many of the same underlying principles of keeping a tiger are the same as keeping a house cat, the same sort of diet, toys, habits etc.  But if you annoy your cat and she takes a swat at you, you might  get a scratch.  Annoy a tiger and you're dead.  Bears are big, expensive creatures to have around, that don't really do much that people  would want, and they can, even by accident kill or seriously injure you very quickly.  Oh, and many species hibernate, so your beloved family pet spending a couple of months a year hiding in the basement and trying to kill anyone that bothers it is problematic. 

The smallest species of bear is I think the Andean bear, which on the small size is 100Kg, and more like 200Kg.  The common bears in Europe and Asia and North America are 600Kg+.  It would take a  lot of generations of successive breeding to get one down to the  size you might want.

I don't let this (particular) kind of fear run my life, but it makes me worried for the future of mental health, and the future for those categorized with severe mental illness.

The stand out improvements are his mid-range shot is going in more, and he's shooting free-throws at a respectable percentage.  But he's also gotten worse at a lot of things.  The most noticeable is his finishing at the rim is down like 5% from last year which is huge for a big man.  He's also turning the ball over more and has less assist.  Almost every single advanced stat is down from last year as well.

From the few games I've seen of him, his jump shot form still looks awful, and he has terrible footwork.  He bullies his way into the post, there's no finesse to his game.  He's also a very lackluster defender.

Box scores don't tell the whole story, but he looks like a slightly better in some ways, slightly worse in other ways, last year's Blake Griffin."

When I've been involved in such situations (the man-hating ones), it seems like it's pretty universally accepted that the ladies involved don't actually hate men; they just want a space to vent. So they get together, maybe they drink something, and they blow off some steam. You'll hear all kinds of man-hatey things, complaints about SOs or exes or guys they know, rating attractiveness, speculating on people's relationship or physical abilities, etc. etc. It's all the bitter kind of stuff that you don't really mean, not at the core of you, not in any kind of real-life situation, but that nonetheless pops into your head from time to time and has no socially acceptable outlet.

That's how I've always observed it, anyway, the few times I've seen men do it and the many times I've seen women do it. 

EDIT: ""Behind-their-backs"" conversations like the one you described - ranking attractiveness, laughing at photos, whatever else, have rarely happened in my life since leaving college and tend to be pretty tame.

So this is directed by the same guy as *Revolutionary Girl Utena* (Kunihiko Ikuhara).

And then 12 years later, he bursts back onto the scene to direct this, Brains Base' 2011 show *Mawaru Penguindrum*. In doing this, Ikuhara, according to the Nihon Review, [""has made the most victorious of returns with an anime of ambition unmatched by anything I’ve seen in the last ten years.""](http://www.nihonreview.com/anime/mawaru-penguindrum/)

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389401733.0,"&gt;First of all, isn't it going to hit a ceiling eventually?

Yes, kind of.  The number is different in different countries, but the lower bound on unemployment in the US is about 3-4%, you can't get it much lower than that without causing problems (inflation).  How can too much employment cause problem?  Imagine trying to hire 1000 people with only  one qualified applicant.  It becomes very hard to run a business like that, and you may have to pay a LOT of money for the person you do hire.  

Different countries count employment and unemployment in different ways, so you'll have different lower bounds on unemployment in different places.  

&gt;Second, why is our country so fascinated with job creation? Isn't automation removing a lot of jobs and thus it is to be expected that we will not be able to increase the amount of jobs we have?

If that was true we should all have been out of work a century and a half ago.

Automation increases the average productivity per worker - where before one person could make barely enough food to feed himself and his family, now a farmer can make 50 or 100x as much food as he or she needs.  So we have less farmers, but  more people making cars.  

This is essentially why there is necessarily always some unemployment, and that's good.  Some workers are being replaced by automation, but then  they are hopefully training into something new, or that added productivity would equate to increased wages that should increase consumption and increase demand for those services.  With food there's an upper bound on how much you need,  so the fraction of the  labour force engaged in agriculture continued to go down for ~3 centuries.  But the demand for cars and computers drive employment up - that farmer producing 25x as much food as his great grandfather has more money to spend on other stuff.  

The jobs report is a big deal in part because the US (and european) economies are still doing very badly - Europe worse than the US due to the Euro and conservatives in charge in the UK.  So they have relatively high unemployment rates.  Big companies care about the macro economic situation - 74 000 new employed people  at ~4k a month in income (on average), equates to 300 million  dollars a month in new spending on everything from houses to cars to video games.   Big outfits estimate what they think the jobs number will be (in the case of the US I believe this was 220 000 ish) and if the actual jobs numbers are significantly better or worse than  estimates than the estimates are wrong and that's bad.  

Oddly, monthly job numbers are usually wrong, so there are usually revised numbers for a month later (e.g. right now they probably revised the job numbers for november, while giving the preliminary december estimates).  The news media though, they see a headline about job  numbers and cling  to it, even if it's not particularly reliable.  The real change in the number of jobs and working people matters, the  estimates are financial tools for big companies to try and make decisions on.  "

This would never happen in a healthy relationship and you should realize that. Your story doesnt make that much sense either. You really just let her talk to you like this for an hour?

I mean I hope the very best for you and your SO in the future but I cant stop thinking that this is just the beginning of a bigger clusterfuck. You said it yourself: If you only hear the negative you will think negative about the person. So where are her good intentions and why does she even think that she needs to defend him like that and why doesnt he defend you? There is more about the whole thing and I recommend you to explore your feelings and behaviour before you spot all the problems around you - again in a healthy relationship there wouldnt be a situation like this and if I were you I wouldnt tolerate it but somehow now everything is fine again?

Sometimes leds require a similar system but they can usually be run off the original circuit. Some of the pricier bulb or festoon leds come with corrective circuits and work great.

Unicornrows,AskReddit,1389402530.0,"Well, it's true that everything is part of physics' plan. The laws of physics are completely consistent and you can't have the good without the bad. So you could argue that if some child had survived the circumstances which caused him or her to die, then there would have been an imbalance of atoms which would have exploded and destroyed the entire universe. After all, mass and energy are always conserved. In that way, bad things are part of life and are necessary to have good things.

Otherwise, although it's always a good idea to be optimistic and look on the bright side or look for a silver lining, it's silly to think that God is interfering with the laws of physics to kill or cripple people for the good of the universe; yet that's what you suggested when you wrote ""those deaths could have contributed to the greater good of the universe"". If God does that sort of thing, then how did Hitler slip through the cracks? Or did Hitler contribute to the overall good of the universe by saving it from the evil Jews? If so, then why did God not just smite those evil people instead of allowing Hitler to cause so much collateral suffering?

racistsfuckoff,socialism,1389402982.0,"I never learned anything about it (Australia). In my final year of high school I chose politics instead of modern history, and politics focused entirely on the history of Australian politics since settlement. Most people I know who took modern history class had half of the year devoted to Nazis and WWII, and half to the Russian revolution. A comrade of mine just finished this class in 2013, and it seems like it was reasonably comprehensive, but very very right-wing. Essay questions about Lenin's cult of personality, why did Lenin make his revolution so violent? etc.

That's basically it though. We're never taught about socialism, or even comparative politics, in school. At a university level we are, but it tends to be pretty awful. I did a comparative politics class in my first year, and most of the semester was spent talking about the different kinds of liberalism. We had *one* lecture to cover communism/anarchism, which actually gave some reasonable definitions, but was obviously rushed. In a third year topic I did last semester, we learned all about how Marx said in the communist manifesto that he wanted the state to get bigger and bigger until it did everything in society, and there was nothing left for anyone else to do, and then that'd be communism. 


So overall it's really bad. Some universities have very good history topics which cover some of these ideas, but the quality really depends on who you get as a lecturer. "

At that point I asked him to take me home because no one needs to be around all that and then this morning (2 days later) I wake up with horrible cramps. FML. Anyhow I'm sure he sees that as me on the crazy train but it's not something I'm doing on purpose. Guys don't have PMS or periods each month. You have no idea how hard it is to remain stoic in the face of someone you care about saying things to you that hurt his feelings.

sparklekitteh,TrueAtheism,1389403285.0,"Social scientist with an advanced degree here. There's quite a bit written on the ethics of covert participation observation, presumably a lit search on the students of Boas an such will cover you there. One of the best examples, IMO, is Goffman's ""Stigma,"" where he went ""undercover"" in a mental institution in the name of sociology, really fascinating stuff.

Normally, when doing this sort of research, it's extremely helpful to find yourself a gatekeeper: someone who's ""in"" on your plan and can introduce you to contacts in the field. In this situation, it would play off as ""Hi, this is my friend byterulliansbutt and zie is visiting church with me today."" That gets you immediately into a group of contacts, which can produce more useful data than just sitting in the back of the church and watching. (Granted, it's more difficult to scribble notes to yourself, but that's a different fieldwork issue entirely.)

From an ethical standpoint, if you present yourself as someone attending church activities because you are genuinely curious as to why these people believe what they do, then you are being honest to a point. But be aware that they may be quite persistent in their evangelism attempts, because you are officially ""on their turf"" of your own accord. 

Additionally, should this ever become a school project, you may need to chat with your IRB; this sort of situation can be difficult because of the observed population's lack of informed consent and involuntary participation. It would be wise to refer to the AAA and ASA's ethical codes for research in this regard."

As we all know, lead is heavier than air heads. You can test this hypothesis by holding a brick of lead and eating an airhead candy. Clearly the lead is heavier. 

Gravity pulls on heavier objects. The high density of lead in a woman's head (i.e. her being dense) gets pulled on harder by gravity. This creates an unstable equilibrium, and since the breasts force the woman's center of mass to be slightly more forward than a man's, we find that nature pulls girls downward, forward. Evidently, even nature likes to expose boobies. To counter this gravitational pull, the ladies back their trunk up to restore equilibrium.

This also explains why it doesn't work on fat men. They're still airheads and they are at a stable equilibrium. Although their center of mass is also somewhat more forward, it's at a lower height and it's counterbalanced by the hair on their back. "

0urlittlesecret,AskReddit,1389403859.0,"A tough topic indeed... I personally think there are better ways to teach a child than even the forms of ""spanking"" that are miles away from physical abuse.

That being said, it is better than the total lack of discipline many kids (especially these days) are raised with. 

Kids need to be conditioned to aspire to emulate positive traits, and to generally reject negative behaviours and attitudes. To be independent, but not selfish or isolated...to strive to be strong and intelligent, but help without judgement those who may not be so strong or smart...to be an example to others when it seems doing what's right would be uncool or out of place.

What of that can spanking *alone* teach, aside from the dominant power of fear inspired by a physical act of aggression? I used to believe in it, I was raised by the hand and the belt, but I have a free-spirited, elementary school aged daughter who has quickly taught me that to control another person is impossible beyond the moment. To use force and fear to those ends will foster resentment, confusion, and mistrust. 

I have gone so full circle on this issue... I used to gently but firmly hold her hand, turn her wrist upward slowly and without any expression of anger or aggression, and slap her wrist with two fingers with as much force as a blob of mayonnaise falling out of your sandwich. I would not even go so far now...and I cringe at the recollection of those few times I thought spanking had been appropriate.

Don't teach your kids to submit to your control, for it will only serve those who will take control once you are less a presence in their lives. Foster a striving in them to better themselves and a subjective understanding of the importance and necessity of morality and dignity. They will remember what you praise them for long after the lesson you tried to teach them with your hand instead of your words has faded into ambiguous fear and degradation of self.

thesilvertongue,TheBluePill,1389404001.0,"It's a school of economic thought developed in the late 19th century in Vienna. It's notable for using a system called praxeology instead of more the more standard economic models for predicting economic behavior which tend look at society more in terms of collectives than individuals. 

From a student's stand point, it's by far the best system because you don't have to use those damn Keynesian graphs or do copious amounts of calculus or statistics. 

While I don't agree with it's central tenants, I certainly don't dismiss it as a sham and I think it's an interesting argument. Many great nobel prize winning economic thinkers subscribed to the Austrian school. 

All economic theories have their fair share of stupid followers so you should do research on Austrian economics before you just dismiss the whole thing as a sham because people you don't like find it popular.  

It's on the free-market capitalist side of the economic spectrum along with Monetarism and Chicago which are my favorites (yes I just outed myself as Libertarian). Needless to say, it's popular among Libertarians and/or Republicans and as you said some nationalists and terpers. 

Anyway, this is probably a better question for /r/Economics, /r/austrian_economics, or /r/explainlikeimfive  because this sub is about laughing at misogynists, not discussing economic theories (I enjoy both btw). Infighting about politics will just rustle people jimmies, and marginalize all 3 or 4 of us economic liberals on this subreddit.

If you don't like AT&amp;T's bandwidth charges or their manipulation of those bandwidth charges, you should be able to leave AT&amp;T for a competitor.  The reason this is big news is because people are convinced (maybe correctly) that there is no alternative to AT&amp;T that doesn't pull this crap.

Perhaps most importantly most women, especially if they're paying thousands, get the dress custom tailored. That's not happening with a rental.

xAFBx,AskMen,1389405229.0,"When I was 18 I met my ex shortly after she had started seeing this guy only to find out that he had a girlfriend at another school and promptly ended things with him. I happened to meet her the night she found out and we ended up talking for about seven or eight hours just the two of us. 

At one point in the conversation we got onto the topic of taking off bras at which point I said something about how easy it was etc. (little did she know I had never seen a girl's bra IRL, let alone taken one off myself). After some banter back and forth where I continued saying how easy it was she moved across her bed (we were sitting on it because she lived in a single room and only had one chair) and sat on my lap telling me to take off her bra. Thanks to the adrenaline and the lack of reactions in my face I managed to keep my cool and reached around and undid her bra with one hand my first try - I've never been more proud of myself than that night (I constantly hear about guys not being able to do it after years of sleeping with women and I did it my first try ever, feels good man).  I then joked about taking off her shirt which she responded to with, ""go ahead."" I assumed she was just joking around so I didn't go for it and conversation settle down. I slept over in her bed that night and a while later found out that she was coming on to me and cried herself to sleep that night because she thought I had turned her down, further hurting her self-esteem after the events of the day.

We ended up being together for four and a half years after that and she never let me live down missing that opportunity to sleep with her. Fair enough I reckon, looking back it was pretty obvious that I could have slept with her that night."

JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1389405323.0,"Even controlled and focusable you have the issue of not being able to control other people's thoughts. If you want a single bit of information from somebody you won't really be able get that from them, you may get bits but you can't be sure you'll even get close to what you want. Then you need to consider how you'd get the thoughts, I think it's safe to assume that telepathy would function similarly to empathy in how the information is processed. That means that you wouldn't be able to easily find the gap between your own thoughts and those of the people you're reading for the vast majority of the population (the rest have brains that function differently enough that the nature of the thoughts, the way they're structured and presented, would likely be alien enough to tell they aren't your own if they didn't appear to your mind as from somebody else), they would appear to be your own unless you were able to determine the nebulous difference between your own thoughts and those of others. Even attempting to use it to simply ease interactions with others would be almost guaranteed to fail, people rarely think in social situations and when they do it's often unconnected or loosely connected. Interaction in humans is largely reactive, you have some responses that you were born with and others that you have learned and used to the point that they're rote. The only way I can see telepathy as being useful is if it only functioned to communicate on command, basically a mental instant messaging where you think something at somebody you've connected to or somebody you've connected to thinks something at you and the message is sent. It would be limited and useless in most situations but there wouldn't really be all that many drawbacks, assuming of course that one was limited in what could be sent."

In that game, you play as Amaterasu, Goddess of the Sun, and your quest is all about eradicating evil from the land (with plenty of great plot twists along the way), and restoring faith in the Gods to the people. Yami is the incarnation of evil and darkness and nastiness and all that stuff.

Yami does not have character. Yami doesn't even have a single line of dialogue. Heck, his existence isn't even mentioned until the final chapters of the game, and it's not until you're inside his boss arena when he is seen for the first time. Sure, the fragmented spirits of his true form were the villains that composed the majority of the game, but Yami is probably one of the least developed villains ever seen in a game.

So what makes him good? The freakin' fight against him. Sweet baby jesus, this guy is everything a final boss should be. He has not one form, not two, not even three, but FIVE forms (as seen in the linked picture). To take this guy out, you need to apply each and every ability you've learned over the course of the entire game. Every single power available to the player is essential here, no matter how mundane. Because of this, it truly feels like you're just barely standing toe-to-toe with this guy. It really feels like a final fight.

But by the time the fourth form is defeated, his darkness has fully eclipsed the sun... Seeing as how you're the Sun Goddess, that's a very bad thing. But then... Every NPC you've met along your journey begins praying to you. The entire population of the world is at your back. Then the crowning moment of kick-ass happens: Amaterasu regains her full godly form, [the most badass song in the game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya3yxTbkh5s) starts playing, and you get to kick the ever-loving shit out of this poor guy with super-charged powers that blow everything you've used up to this point out of the water.

thesilvertongue,TwoXChromosomes,1389406326.0,"I respectfully disagree. 

I agree that no woman or girl should be forced, coerced, or pressured into to dressing a certain way against her will. I realize that this does happen an it is a legitimate problem.

However, not all women who cover their hair or bodies do so because they are oppressed. Women can choose to dress this way for many different reasons. 

&gt; A person's face is their identity. And this image quite vividly and effectively portrays the erasure of individual identity that happens when women wear these things.

I don't think this is the case at all. These garments can be an expression of a woman's cultural, religious, national, or personal identity. They can show a woman's identity instead of hiding it. For many women, these garments are an important part of their character. For others, they're just a trivial stylistic choice. I still don't see how it degrades women's identities. 

&gt; A woman choosing to stuff herself into a cloth bag because she feels there's some moral obligation to do so, is no different than a woman who chooses to starve herself, or vomit up her own food, because she feels there's good reason to do that.

Yes it is. Starving and vomiting are self destructive and dangerous. Wearing certain garments that cover your hair, face, or body is not. 

&gt; We don't need to support people's choices when they do themselves and others harm, we don't need to support people's choices when they send a harmful message about the dignity of women.

Again, people wear these garments for a variety of reasons. It doesn't necessarily convey a message about women or their dignity. There are hard core women's rights activists who dress this way.

Some of the seem to believe that ""misogyny""- extreme dislike or hatred of women- is some rampant thing that occurs on a personal level multiple times every day, and that disputing this makes one inherently misogynistic themselves.

In case you didn't notice a common result of testicular injuries, at least ones beyond simple pain (all of which can be caused by less force than most would apply when purposefully hitting somebody there), is death and it's usually due to the testicle rotting within the body and causing gangrene or internal bleeding resulting in fatal blood loss.

People using desk/lap computers are doing so only because the tablets &amp; smart phones don't do what they need, which in MANY cases is to run software designed for Windows. Non-windows operating systems' success depends, for now, on their ability to correctly and completely run Win software. So discussing how great the UI is for Ubuntu is about equal, in my mind, to how great is the Win emulator.

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389407551.0,"I abandon the kids to their father and go out.

I know craptons of people having babies... in my hometown several hours away.  In the city most of my friends are work/school friends and like yours, no where near starting families.

Sometimes I feel like the old lady in the room, I don't care about some of the stuff they talk about at all.  I don't have much in common with lots of them.  But we still have a good time.  Same thing with the mommy friends I'm trying to cultivate.  As a less-than-crunchy professional who leaves my children to be raised by strangers, I don't have that much in common with a lot of the mommy crowd but it's still nice to get together sometimes and we have a good time.

It's tough when they're little, and when you're pregnant, but you aren't chained to the house.  Look for facebook groups and community organizations that you have SOMETHING in common with.  You don't have to become besties with all of them, but it helps having a diverse acquaintance to keep you social.  Play dates and Epicure parties with my mommy friends.  After work drinks and the occasional ladies night with my working girls.  It helps you find balance.

I think the trick is that you can't be afraid to drop the ball at home.  Your spouse is perfectly capable.  Your children will learn that it's ok when mommy leaves, she always comes home.  You get to feel refreshed.  It's good for the whole family when you get a break.  

So get some margarita mix and get some girls to have a little pity party for you.  It helps.  Although I'm more of a pina colada girl myself.

*edit: suppose I should add, i'm not quite 30 and I've been dealing with being the only ""mommy"" since I was 20.  It takes time to master.*"

I didn't really care for her, but the way some people talk about her seems a bit over-the-top.

Personally, I wasn't that into Kennedy, but she was more interesting than most of the rest of the Potentials. I found it hard to be too invested in the Willow/Kennedy relationship because there was very little build-up and I wasn't satisfied with the way the show had covered the grieving of Tara.

I don't think this in the *least* but I see no problem with *you* thinking this.  Though I do sort of feel like ""...really...?"" when I hear people express this view.  That's just cause I have trouble wrapping my mind around it.  Sex is for anyone who feels comfortable having it.

It's unpopular among many because lots of people who have this view don't know how to not be a judgey asshole about it.

Renner1,TwoXChromosomes,1389408541.0,"&gt; ""Equality"" is one of those concepts that's really damn difficult to parse, so forgive me if I don't accept that you are a good judge of what equality looks like or what actions and words being 'for equality' is supposed to invoke in others.

I agree-- ""equality"" is always going to be a very vague, mutable concept. In that vein (although I'm sure you'll disagree) you can't seriously say that ms. archetypical overly-aggressive hypocrite third wave feminist there has ""the"" definition of what equality or ""actual"" equality is.

&gt; It's not vague at all. It is explicit: tell a women that you want to stay home and raise kids and she'll have a serious problem with that.

The implication is vague. Saying ""women"" is extremely vague, and it's obviously something that commenter can't possibly know.

&gt; This is a harmful stereotype. It's not 'vague', it's just untrue.

It's not ""just untrue"". 

Additionally, I'm in disagreement with that specific person, in the sense that I don't think new fathers should take up the role of househusband, especially if they were working prior. For obvious reasons the new mother is better equipped to deal with an infant, and she gets maternity leave as a given anyways.

&gt; You can very certainly prove whether women are whining and being hypocrites. Those terms have relatively fine meaning demarcations, and human behavior is perfectly quantifiable. 

I was again going on the idea that the statement was too all-encompassing and not related to specifics. 

Yes, you can easily tell when or prove that certain women are whining or acting in a hypocritical fashion.

&gt; This statement was made by assuming 'women' refers to a caricature of feminism, not actual existing women.

The most rabid of the third wave feminist movement do a great job in negatively caricaturing themselves primarily in the ridiculous and partisan way they behave. I can say that I am very happy that most women especially don't identify actively or infrequently with this movement, because it is a very good case study in social and genderpolitical hypocrisy, as well as being very well know for raising a stink about everything related to men and sex, and whining.

Jynweythekylow,FancyFollicles,1389408775.0,"Make sure you know what kind of curl you're looking for. If you're wanting less of a poodle look and more of a loose curl they should use larger perm rods. The length of your hair is a factor as there are specific ways to wrap a perm. If your hair is only and inch long you can't fit a perm rod with an inch diameter in there. You have to be able to wrap the hair around the rod twice. With long hair it usually ends up being wrapped in a spiral perm, or double-rod (piggyback) perm. Since you have virgin hair you shouldn't run into many problems except dryness. 

The chemicals in perms work because they break and reset the bonds in your hair that make it straight, wavy, curly etc. (for example, a jheri curl is when the hair is chemically relaxed and then permed to a desired curl.) You won't know if your hair is resistant until you get to the salon. They should to a test curl on a small area to see how your hair recacts. Perms can be pricey, but are usually worth it. Remember that you will see new growth and eventually want to get another perm in six months. you should also invest in some moisturizing products (avoid products with drying ingredients) because the chemicals will dry out your hair, especially over time if you maintain the perm by getting it redone. Also, it's good to get it trimmed afterward, to help with the dryness. Sometimes the haircut is included in the service, but it depends where you go.

LyssaBrisby,sex,1389408797.0,"I have a friend who was abused as a kid, and some of the things that happened to her are now in her ""kinkset"" as an adult. Not because she retroactively enjoyed them -- kind of the opposite: that she needed to consciously, personally *reclaim* those acts in a new context and with a trusted partner, to write over those bad memories with new, potent, positive ones. They are inherently charged because of her history, but they are made new again by her partner.

I could see that being a factor with your husband, given his history, and I'm so impressed with both of you for muddling through a very tense and vulnerable emotional neighbourhood, and for your openness in working with him on these kinks. I can imagine that going through those old patterns and memories with a loving partner could be immensely healing for him (and hopefully rewarding for you).

I also agree with the poster about how arousal/orgasm thoughts can be quite different from regular-brain thoughts, though I would admittedly also struggle with the ""wish you were a guy"" thing.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389409340.0,"Cost.

Even in europe where fuel prices can run over 2 USD per litre in some countries, electric cars are very poor economic choices.  Remember you still need to power it, batteries need to be replaced etc.

Have a look at, for example, the ford Focus in your area, the 'electric' version ends up being about 2x as efficient as a regular version.  Except it's almost 3x the price.  (At least where I am, the price is ~36000 versus 13 300 for the minimum option sets).  You have to use A LOT of fuel to make up for a 23000 dollar difference in sticker price.  I think the average driver in the US only does about 20 000 Km, - well a focus gets an average of 6.8L/100km, so you're only looking at ~3000 litres  of fuel a year in the base model.  If you cut that cost in half by going  electric, even in europe at 2 bucks a litre it's going to take about 8 years of driving that much to make up the cost  difference - in the US it would take 15, and that's not accounting for extra maintenance costs due to an electric vehicle and whether or not EV's will hold value if the technology changes.  If you need a new battery every 10 years that serious limits how much benefit you're getting.  

Even at 2 bucks a litre oil is really really cheap compared to the cost of an electric engine and battery pack. And the US pays on average half that.  

It just takes too long for an EV to pay for itself.

And that's not even looking at something like a Tesla, which has issues like range anxiety, lack of charging stations etc.  That's just the cheap electric-petrol hybrids that can still be fueled  up like  normal.  A cheap tesla runs  in the 80 000 dollar range.  Compared to a traditional powered vehicle that's basically absurdly expensive.  Tesla makes up  it's sales by being a luxury brand for luxury consumers that are happy to pay way more to drive than they need to in an effort to lead the industry to a more sustainable path.  "

Here's a more accurate version:

Major: All innate human desires have objects that exist.  
Minor: No matter what a human achieves in life, he or she always has a desire for ""something"" beyond that.

Like what, ""patriarchy theory""?

 Feminist theory may have leaked into academia, if not, strictly speaking, mainstream academia, but the vast majority of second and third wave literature and theory is very tenuous at best, and not at all should be taken as historically factual or otherwise ""the truth"" or valid.

&gt;  Psychologists and sociologists do not believe it has any credibility. 

I wasn't aware that the Red Pill was trying to present any specific ideology as legitimate or universal. ""Men going their own way"" offshoot is valid as a personal choice, I suppose, but it really seems to be counter productive in the same way that feminist separatism is.

&gt; Red Pillers blame women. 

They certainly don't like feminist theory, I'll say that, especially third wave theory and associated bullshit. I can empathize on that score, but I don't think railing against it angrily as some of them do is helpful, not the less because it gives some in third wave feminism more ammunition."

behindtimes,truegaming,1389410068.0,"I really think it's what you grew up with.  So, in a way, it's partial due to your country of origin, but that's only one piece.

What I mean is that I grew up in the USA mostly with PC games in the 1980's through early 1990's.  My genre of choice is adventure games.  If you look at that time period in the USA, that tended to be the genre of choice for most PC gamers.

But here's where country of origin matters in my opinion.  RPGs like Wizardry &amp; Ultima were popular both in the USA &amp; Japan, and those two games pretty much had major influences to RPGs in both countries.  But if you look at Japan and the USA, the RPG developed in different ways.

Now, from the early 1990's through the last 1990's, the RPG genre died to an extent.  They were few and far between until the late 1990s.  Pokémon and Final Fantasy 7 happened to be major sellers on both sides of the ocean, but this is where origin matters less, because it was an introduction of the genre many westerners.

It's great. Trust me.

There are undoubtedly better portrayals but those are all of adults and most of them are only implication (one of the two I'm thinking of implied it very subtly, you'd need to essentially be autistic to catch it, and the other was a bit more explicit but the actor has stated the character is not autistic yet the portrayal is excellent up to a point). There are also some (read the vast majority) really awful portrayals. For the most part we're in the middle of the black face era (as in the portrayals are similar to that) for ASD, the better portrayals usually have actors who do such a good job that they could very well not be acting autistic and simply be autistic, I'd doubt it though since there are always some issues (episodes that are so bad that they're basically out of character during it)."

The laid-back approach that's often interpreted as weakness is the laissez-faire leadership style which is inefficient in itself. To be seen as both laid-back and respected, you'll need to adopt a democratic leadership style which is based on consultation and group participation in decisions (with you as leader still retaining the final authority on decisions). There's a small overview of it [here](http://www.leadership-toolbox.com/democratic-leadership-style.html) and you'll be able to find much more online and in business journals.

At least the religion I grew up in was 3 hours of church on Sunday (and you can't do anything else that day except study scripture or visit other members of the church), and then probably 8-10 hours the rest of the week of other activities/meetings/commitments. Everybody in the church had a role and slacking is highly frowned-upon. Then you have to commit time to home teach, plan lessons, study scripture, pray, etc. I can't even get to the gym and cook breakfast before I'm out the door, where am I supposed to find time to read my scriptures daily? I know other religions require less of your time, but I just haven't found any other religions appealing. And you probably guessed correctly, I grew up Mormon."

The real key here though, I think, is that trans people are generally *more accepting* of their own sexualities.

Renner1,confession,1389412229.0,"&gt; Not everyone in academia accepts the theory, but it is a recognized theory. Red Pill Theory is not recognized. 

The majority of the people who accept that theory academically are the so-called ""gender analysists"" and others sort of floating around that school, I can imagine. People who want to believe that it's factual and therefore promote it as legitimate.

I wasn't aware that Red Pillers were actively trying to promote any sort of cohesive theory, to be honest.

&gt; In general, feminism is accepted by academia.

Accepted as an existing, verifiable thing, at any rate.

&gt; One of the reasons is because feminists don't shun intellectualism. 

Don't shun some forms of intellectualism, you mean.

&gt; Also, most people in academia believe in social equality. 

Yes, there are a lot of egalitarians in the world. Probably more then ever.

&gt; Feminism is a social equality movement

Second and third wave feminism isn't about ""equality"", as can be seen through rhetoric and behaviour.

Especially in the most affluent countries where the division and ideological mutations are most prominent.

&gt; They don't like feminism, because feminism tells women they don't have to be obedient to a man, or that women should enjoy being treated poorly by men.

I think they don't like it for much the same reasons that I dislike and am at odds with it. The sheer amount of rhetorical bullshit that comes especially from the third wave, for example. The demonization and seeming antipathy towards everything male from the remnant of the second wave. A whole lot of things, of varying levels of validity to them.

&gt; They are like the Taliban

That's a pretty big leap, don't you think?

Taliban hates the idea of any men behaving in any other way then the Taliban-approved ultra-Wahhabi lifestyle, you know.

&gt; feminism because it gave women the opportunity to seek education and financial independence, instead of relying on men, and being at their mercy for everything. 

Historical revisionism. One can hardly say with a straight face that ""only feminism provided anything positive or decent for women""."

Being with one person a long time the spark of instant sexual attraction isn't going to be the same as it was early in relationships or with new people. This doesn't mean that you aren't in love. Long term love that lasts has to do with working through hard stuff together, being compatible in many ways living habits, agreement on possible children, work ethic, traveling/not, argument/communication style. Being able to be honest with each other even about the not so easy stuff is important. It sounds like you are going through normal grief. Just because you miss the good times and care about her doesn't mean it was meant to be. Seems like you need to kiss some more frogs to be able to tell if you find the right one.

If only saying that made it so, right?

&gt; They don't deny this, either. That's how they really feel, and they are pretty open about it. 

That's how a certain percentage of them feel. There's a certain percentage-- at least a plurality, it would seem-- of third wave feminists who seem to think that man's natural sexual state makes him some sort of rape-beast, or that men are by default ""misogynistic"", especially if they don't see themselves as feminist.

&gt; I have a feeling that almost all of them became interested in the Red Pill because women aren't interested in them. So they turned into angry, resentful people who hate women, just because they don't get the sex they believe they are entitled to. 

I don't think red pill is inherently about ""hating women"". From a feminist perspective, particularly the third wave perspective, it may be-- but according to that, anyone who isn't an active, enthusiastic feminist is at the very least a ""bigot"", or ""sexist"", or ""anti woman"", and so on.

I think you're intelligent but I'm obviously going to take what you're saying here with a grain of salt.

&gt;  just because they don't get the sex they believe they are entitled to. 

This sounds like distortion again.

&gt; I don't care how successful they are at sex, anyone who is that misogynistic because women don't bow down to them, is a loser. 

There's no proof of collective or systematic misogyny. There are some who do display bad attitudes to the opposite sex (as there are feminists who openly and proudly do the same), but collectively, or inherently? 

Not seeing that from an objective view.

&gt; Those men expect women to be completely submissive and obedient

This is also something I can't take at face value. Contemporary feminist rhetoric seems to be about how any woman who isn't identifying as a feminist is by default ""oppressed"", and that a man telling a woman to do anything whatsoever at any time constitutes ""oppression"" or ""sexism"" or ""misogyny"".

&gt; I have studied the history of almost every civilization that has ever existed, and almost everyone was patriarchal, to varying degrees. 

Doesn't prove the existence of a ""patriarchy"" as defined by feminist theory, for on thing. Patriarchal doesn't imply default dominance/subjugation of all men over all women, and certainly not a willing/deliberate attitude to keep women as a whole ""miserable"" or in thrall."

It was a rough beginning but I did not experience what you're feeling, so I don't think it's so much a result of the circumstances as it is a hormonal issue. Baby blues is totally normal. PPD is totally normal. It says nothing about you as a person or as a mother--it's just something that happens, and you deal with it, and you feel better.  
  
I don't know if you sound as bad off to me as to throw the PPD flag on the field just yet. It can never hurt to seek professional help though, so if you feel like you want help then absolutely reach out for help. Many women simply take time to bond with their babies, so as long as you aren't having dark or dangerous thoughts I'm not going to fault you if you choose to just take your time and relax. Your doctor will ask you how you're feeling (emotionally) at your 6 week follow up anyway, so how you handle it until then is up to you.

SentientBagOfWater,AskMen,1389413135.0,"I generally agree with this, although I think it's worth making the point that there's a growing acceptance that a very small percentage of women do experience real psychiatric symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.  Exactly how to define and manage this condition is an ongoing area of research.  Subjectively I think the women who attribute poor behaviour to their hormonal cycle greatly outnumber those who actually experience this, but it's difficult to tell which is which as a layman observer.

From the point of dealing with it in relationships and friendships, even if we give everyone who claims it as the reason the benefit of the doubt, I guess I compare it to any other illness with psychiatric symptoms.  Would I blame someone with bipolar disorder for their irrational actions during an episode?  No, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't be upset by things they may do or say to me.

What matters more though is how they deal with me afterwards.  If they consider it a license to ignore the effects they have on other people, then we're done.  If they try to shame me for ""denying their emotions"" when they were doing weird, irrational shit, we're done.

I didn't care too much for that song on the album, but the Where The Light Is version is phenomenal, and it happened to come out in 2008, my very first year working full time after spending a lot of time screwing off in college and playing guitar. 

That year I discovered that I don't suck at working.  I know that sounds weird, but I went from a part time web designer, doing mostly very simple layouts in templates that already existed to a full time web designer who made some awesome (and W3 compliant!) sites to a corporate web developer (PHP / mySQL / javascript) working with newspapers throughout our company in a span of about two years (no degree either!).  I'm sure everyone can take their own interpretations of the lyrics, but the train is life and it's plowing away on you.   At the time in my life, I was ecstatic to be earning money, and to be doing very well at something. But it all happened so fast, like a freight train plowing down the tracks, that you do get anxious and want it to slow down.  

Hell, it's only five years later and I now work in oil, nothing related to web development.  Life is weird and moves faster as you get older.

It took several years for DS homebrew to even figure out WIFI correctly, so this will take time. One that's done, you need an SDK so that developers can start making homebrew, and with homebrew comes good testing platforms to start development on an emulator since you can tell exactly where in your code things are and aren't working. From there you develop the emulator even more to get it to work with normal ROMs, thus fine-tuning it over and over until it's a polished emulator."

Renner1,confession,1389413591.0,"&gt; and why should anyone judge that behavior?

For the most part I think they should be judged if they behave a certain way and then complain about what comes from their behaviour.

The girl who blows two dozen guys in a week, for example, who makes no secret about it, and then starts complaining about being objectified because guys are hitting on her or whatever. 

She's not obligated to blow everyone who thinks that she's easy, but that attitude is a direct consequence of behaving in a certain way.

Same thing goes for some girl who grinds on guys all night in a club or whatever and then acts like it's a sexist atrocity that they got turned on or they think she's flirting with them.

Same thing goes, to a lesser extent, with a girl who wants to show off all her sexual assets as often as possible, but then complains about people noticing or checking her out on the street.

&gt; Everyone is entitled to a certain degree of respect. 

Sure, at the basic level. Until they prove otherwise or that they're worthy of more respect in general.

&gt; This guy had sex with 80 women, some of them unprotected, and now he has HIV, and has probably spread it to some of his partners.

I don't think he's worthy of respect because that sort of careless shitty behaviour shows him up to be pretty careless and a jerkoff, in part.

Of course, if the person he contracted HIV from knew and didn't say anything about it, she's not at all much better, especially if still sexually active."

DrPepperHelp,electronic_cigarette,1389414169.0,"Ok let me clarify that for you. Coffee beans need to be roasted. Heat is applied. Now dark roasts and light roast have two different roast times. Darker roasts tend to have less caffeine than lighter roasts. The effect is kind of like water boiling. You have 2 cups of water in one pot set to medium heat, and another 2 cups of water in another pot. Everything is the same about these two pots the only thing that will change between the two is the heat applied. The hotter one will boil and evaporate much faster than the one that has 1/4 the heat of the first pot. The same principals apply to caffeine.

Just because something that has a boiling point of what ever does not mean it can't break down or evaporate prior to the boiling point. We are also applying a direct heat to the juice, and on top of that we are not using cig-a-likes that they used in the study. We can be pushing far higher temperatures on even an ego at 4.8 volts. I can easily see our temperatures going to 5+ times that with some of our sub-ohm setups. "

psychicsword,AskReddit,1389414756.0,"**Some Background:**

As a kid I was always short and thin. By the time I entered high school, I was the shortest kid in the class(guys and girls) and one of the thinnest. When I was 13 and entering High School I was 102lbs and 5'1. Not exactly terrible for that height but definitely underweight and short. My doctors kept trying to eat more and I would constantly fight them about it but for my physical that year my mom asked the doctor if it is possible I had a growth disorder as one of her friend's kid had the problem. At my mere 3"" deficit on other boys my age he said it was impossible that I had the disorder and that I was just a late bloomer and he couldn't justify the 6 hours of fairly painful testing that would need to be done to prove or disprove that I had the problem. 

After fighting with my doctor for 20 minutes he finally gave into my mom's wishes and ordered the test. It started with an x-ray to determine bone age and I was in fact a late bloomer but it wasn't as delayed as the doctor was expecting so he allowed the next stage which was a Human Growth Hormone test. They took 2 vials of blood ever hour and on the 3rd hour they flooded my body with insulin almost to the point where I would pass out due to low blood sugar but they forced me awake for another 3 hours. Turns out I had a 50% HGH deficit exactly like my mom suspected and that if I had undergone my growth spurt I probably would have only grown to 5'4. They also ordered me to see a nutritionist after the bone density/age x-ray. The nutritionist told me that I was barely making by with what I was eating and that I simply needed to add about 1k calories but ideally more because I was only eating like 1.5k calories on average. 

**The Cause:**

Thanks to the nutritionist's suggestion and the HGH supplements I did start to grow. I was eating about 3.5k calories and gained about 10lbs an inch(which is apparently good). Unfortunately in order to get my self to eat that unnatural amount of food for me I had to eat ever single moment I thought about it. This locked me into a habit of eating every time I got bored and remembered that I was supposed to eat more(all the Adderall didn't help much either). Over time this habit stuck and when I stopped taking the HGH at the end of high school I went from eating an amount that would make me grow 3"" a year to running a huge calorie surplus thanks to the lower required intake. Over the next 4 years at college I went from 160lbs and 5'10 to 230lbs putting me just barely in the Obesity category on the BMI and Body Fat Percentage scale(30.4% body fat today). 

**tl;dr:** I had a 19.3 BMI as a freshman in high school and was really short for my age. I took HGH supplements and was told to eat every waking moment because I had a HGH deficiency. I stopped taking HGH tanking my metabolism. I continued to eat like I was still growing 3"" a year causing me to gain 70lbs in 4-5 years. "

Their skin is dark green, with snakelike scales that can blend with their surroundings. They have five digit slightly webbed claws. They have a head shaped similar to an Indian cobra. Like their distant terrestrial cousins they have venom sacs that can produce deadly venom when they bite an enemy. They have small horns that were once used as defense, but now is a status symbol. Females, on the other hand, are humanoid felines. They have legs like that of Earth cats, two catlike tails, five digit feline claws and the face of a feline with long feminine hair/fur. Their eyes are slightly slanted.*

No. I don't know why you keep saying this. The only reason you would draw this conclusion is if you think that circumcision is the *only* factor that affects HIV transmission, but it's clearly not...Like I said, there are many factors, and circumcision is not a major one. 

*However*, with enough data, the other factors can be separated and controlled for. This is the purpose and power of the RCTs and meta-analyses which have already been cited. After all the math is said and done, circumcision is *still protective.*

&gt;that overall render whatever protection is acquired through hacking off parts of your penis insignificant.

Well no, that’s just completely wrong. In fact, it *is literally significant*: statistically significant. And also personally significant to the people who were spared infection because of their circumcision. Again, this is the conclusion of the citations above.

&gt;does not hold up to very high scientific standards, right?

Most surgical procedures cannot ethically be double-blinded. Do you require double-blinded clinical trials to conclude that organ transplants save lives? All the fields of surgery, which are evidence-based cornerstones of modern medicine, rely on non-double-blinded data. It does not invalidate the data.

&gt;are done over a less than a year, have a 2 months of intercourse discrepancy between the 2 groups ( considering it takes 6 to 12 weeks on top of that to detect antibodies) and only one that receives safe sex advice,

You're not providing citations. I have no idea what you're referencing. Do you? It would be very incorrect to imply that the 3 RCTS or all the studies referenced in the reviews and meta-analyses only have 1 year of follow up.

&gt;Circumcision alters sexual behavior and function...going harder or having more extreme sexual practices

I don't get your logic. In your first post you stated that men who were circumcised were more likely to not use a condom. And you're concerned that they ""go harder"" and have ""more extreme"" sexual practices. So naturally you would conclude that they should get *more* HIV. So why do these studies still find significant reduction in transmission? Because circumcision protects against HIV transmission.

Note: [Two of three of the RCTs found no difference in sexual behavior. The third found .9 more partners for circumcised vs uncircumcised men after 2 years. That was the only difference.](http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD003362/male-circumcision-for-prevention-of-heterosexual-acquisition-of-hiv-in-men) And despite this, circumcised men still experienced significantly fewer HIV infections...

&gt;all these studies were conducted in Subsaharian[sic] AFrica

No. The 3 RCTs were. Many of the other studies referenced in the reviews and meta-analysis I cited are conducted in the developed world. Apparently you didn’t read my citations.

Your arguments are starting to conflict with one another. You aren’t reading the data information I’m providing, and you’ve stopped providing any citations of your own.

I messed up a few orders, and was basically in my own world the whole time I was there. Most of my coworkers let me be, but this one driver just would not shut up about how sorry he was and how he was praying for me and my bf. I tried to just nod or smile for awhile, but I was getting really pissed off. At one point, the driver must have noticed I was getting upset (though he probably didn't guess it was at *him*) and he tried to put his fucking ARM AROUND ME. I lost my shit.

Renner1,confession,1389416237.0,"&gt; My point is, they are open about hating women. 

Some of them, possibly.

&gt; To be honest, if a man doesn't agree with the ideas of feminism at least somewhat, he is probably a misogynist

I disagree with second and third generation methods, and ideology, and historical outlook, and societal outlook-- and somehow I've never felt the urge to hate or severely dislike women. 

&gt; Do you think they actually like or respect women? 

I think it really depends.

&gt; Among the Red Pill, yes, they are misogynistic.

Some of them could display certain attitudes that are unhealthy. I don't see them saying some of the things that the batshit level second generation feminists said about men, though.

&gt; They believe men had no obligation to women, 

But you said women don't have any obligation(s) towards men, right?

I'm not sure how many of the people there think they have no obligation towards women because they don't like feminist attitudes.

But my view is that men and women who interact with each other are always obligated to each other in certain ways.

&gt; Not all men feel that way though. Then again, most men aren't Red Pillers.

This is true. Majority of men don't buy into feminist theory, though-- especially not the worst of second and third wave theory.

&gt; Why would I want to be in a relationship where a guy tells me what to do all the time? 

See, herein is part of the problem. I don't know how you got what you just said from my saying ""A man telling or asking a woman to do anything at all is instantly condemned as vile sexism or misogyny"".

&gt; Why do you think men chose to dominate women for centuries? And even when women started to express unhappiness, they tried as hard as they could to continue their oppression? 

But this is assuming that the ""patriarchy"" revisionist narrative is the truth."

kishbish,Advice,1389416853.0,"First off, stop drinking. Developing a dependence on alcohol will fuck up your entire life. You think things are tough now? Think of how tough it would be to deal with all of this *and* an addiction to alcohol. You're self-medicating, and I know it's easy to forget about things for a while when you're drinking. But it will lead you down a road that is extremely hard to come back from. 

Secondly, even though your siblings all have their own families, why *wouldn't* they be expected to help out with your parents? Just because you're single doesn't automatically mean you're the only who has to do everything. Do they know about the state of things with your parents, and how serious it is? If they don't, you may need to have a serious discussion with them. Chances are, if they are very busy with their own families, they don't have any idea how tough things have gotten for your parents and hopefully they will want to lend a hand once they understand. 

I understand about not wanting to move back home. I'd feel the same way in your position. What about a compromise - is there a bigger town or city near your parents where you'd stand a better chance of finding work, and you could visit your parents regularly? You don't necessarily have to live with them, or in the same town as them, to keep an eye on them. I'm sorry about your mom - my dad tried to commit suicide when I was younger, and it really throws you for a loop. It sounds like your folks are caught in a tough situation. Do they belong to any churches or civic organizations that might be able to help them with the house? Do you have enough spare income to pay for a maid to come in a couple times a month, or for a handyman to do some small repair work in the house? 

I'm not sure there's a whole lot you can do about your schedule, and you're right, that schedule makes it almost impossible to have much of a social life except maybe on weekends. 

As for getting out of a rut - start small. It sounds like you've got a lot on your plate and a lot of stress to deal with right now, so don't tell yourself you've got to change everything right away, or make all the huge decisions at once. Start with cleaning one room in your apartment a day until everything is clean and tidy. Clean, neat surroundings will help you think a little clearer. Then, maybe on one of your days off, go out and do something, even if it's just going to a movie or taking a walk in the park. Perhaps you could volunteer a few hours a week for a cause or place that you're interested in - that will also broaden your social circle. My point is, it doesn't have to be something huge right away. Baby steps. 

I feel for you, dude. After my dad's suicide attempt, my parents went through some of the same stuff, with the house getting terrible because they couldn't take care of it and I think they were both dealing with forms of depression. It's so extremely difficult watching that because you love your parents so much, and want to help them. If you ever need someone to talk to, PM me. Good luck. "

You didn't specify red pillers prior. Doesn't matter really.

&gt; On what? I can't think of any examples of people on that subreddit showing any compassion or respect for women

I've glanced over it and I have to say I don't see anything overtly, obviously indicative of antipathy towards all women.

Nor an ideal of ""women in general don't deserve respect"".

&gt; I have no idea how you think second wave feminism is worse. 

Second wave feminism spawned the almost legendary (in a bad way) feminist writers and ideologues who very genuinely seemed (seem?) to have a hatred of men, or anything associated with maleness.

&gt; Everyone has an obligation to inform future and past sexual partners that they are HIV positive. 

Of course on that I agree. I thought you were talking more so in general, which would still be something I wouldn't agree with.

&gt;  If a guy says ""Can you please..."" Or ""Would you mind..."", I will be far more open to that than having a guy tell me something like an order or a demand. 

Sure, someone asking you do to something or to think about something or whatever is just more polite in general.

&gt; Do you believe it's not true?

No, I don't. I think it's historically revisionist and more or less a baseless concept.

I think a society can be-- and there have been-- patriarchal, but I don't think evidence would support a patriarchal society being categorically unfair or oppressive to women, nor did patriarchal societies develop based off of ""how can we men dominate women the best way?"".

Be confident and take the evidence as granted. As long as you ask her what all that means she thinks there is a way out of this. What you need is to tell her what you are doing next and why. Dont search for questions because that means ransom. You saw the evidence and you react. Dont even try to be angry with her but just tell her that its over and you cant proceed like this nor should she. You will hear the truth only if your decision is clear because its the only moment she will be comfortable telling you. She cant deal with the fact what she did to you and it would take a complete breakdown for her to admit it. Just tell her what you conclude and feel sorry for her fuckup - you deserve better and she deserves whatever and thats the only healthy POV you can take.

GuyWithNoHat,sex,1389418848.0,"Take them in the best-lit room of your house.  If you have a camera and tripod, you're almost set!  Take a lot, too, cherry pick the best ones.  If your camera has a self-timer, set it (for the highest delay possible that makes sense) and also set it to take multiple shots.  You should be able to set the camera so that it will wait 20-30 seconds before snapping the photos and then take 3-5 pictures in quick succession.

The main trick for great photos is to eliminate the need for a flash.  If the lighting is excellent, you should be able to turn the flash off and have nice sexy realistic photos.  If the lighting is bad, you might still be able to get some good photos if you turn up the ISO setting.  If your pictures have an orange or blue tint to them, you might need to set a lighting-type setting.  This will have options like ""Tungsten"", ""Fluorescent"", etc.  Tungsten is for bulbs that have a Tungsten filament (think old-styled bulbs, where the bright wire is visible while it's lit).  Fluorescent is obviously for the newer style low-wattage bulbs or the long tube-style fluorescents.  This will fix the color weirdness.  As you switch rooms, you may need to keep changing this setting.

Make sure there are no bright lights behind you, unless you're using a flash, or want a silhouette-style photo.  If you're taking super close-ups, make sure what you're shooting is extremely well-lit and use the macro setting on your camera (usually a flower icon) -- don't forget to turn Macro off when you're done with the close-ups!

Your camera's quality will play a huge role in how well these turn out.

EDIT: One final note, don't be afraid to test out some locations in your house by shooting things that aren't your naked body first.  For example, if you have a stuffed bear, stick it on the bed where you plan to lay and tinker with the settings until the photo starts looking good.  Then try it with you in the picture!"

That doesn't diminish the scorn I have for what I perceive to be the significant number of people who take the illness you have, straddle it, and ride it off into the sunset as an excuse for almost any poor behaviour.  It also doesn't diminish the sympathy and solidarity I have for partners of women who end up being blamed and shamed and made to feel *terrible* for daring to be hurt by hurtful words and deeds, or daring to challenge the same when they are irrational.  This is the way in which I generally agree with the above post.

The_Big_ID,Terraria,1389419067.0,"Early-game bosses are the best way to get crimtane/demonite, but for the main tools and the armour, you're going to need to take on the Eater of worlds (Demonite), or Brain of Cthulhu (Crimtane).

From my experience with the BoC, I can say it's slightly easier to handle in a confined area than the EoW.

Going in with a bit of basic armour (wood, cactus, iron/lead/silver/tungsten at most), a few health potions, and a well made arena + campfire (maybe a heart lamp if you have a spare heart crystal), provided you can get the bombs to break open the areas, you should be able to spawn the demolitionist, which will allow ye to get grenades (they're moderately cheap, and VERY effective against the BoC's first form if aimed well), you should probably get shruikens as well, as the penetrating damage is helpful against the clumps of creepers.

(This guide is for the crimson, I've yet to try early-running EoW in 1.2)

Find a decent crimson-chasm, use bombs to break open two of the hearts, if you get the rotted fork/crimson rod, they're very helpful in this battle against the 'creepers'.

Build a 5-6 tiered platform arena, make sure you can jump up/down the platforms.

Make + add optional campfire/heart lamp

I highly recommend the following: Grenades, (Iron/lead or better) bow (with ~100 flaming arrows), lesser/greater health potions, 


The battle should go something like this:

Use item in the middle of the arena, brain appears far-away, creepers yet to appear on screen, phase out, re-appear randomly, creepers should begin heading towards the brain.

Climb above the brain, allow the creepers to clump at it, throw 1-3 grenades, usually takes out 90% of the creepers, mind out the way if any more charge.

Alternatively, if you have the crimson rod, place a cloud directly above you before throwing grenades, if you're lucky, this will take out all creepers in one move.

Alternatively, the rotted fork can be used to meet a sideways creeper-barrage, effectively serving as a shield whilst dealing penetrating damage.

Shruikens can be thrown up at the creepers at the higher risk of being hit (high risk for a double-hit), to the sides (drop-off makes them less effective), or above them (penetrates fully, hits once. moderate risk, moderate reward). They're most useful if you lack, or only have a few grenades.

The undertaker is not very effective against the masses, unless you are adept at dodging the creepers and picking them off one-by-one. (this requires a large ammo supply, keep in mind)

If the first grenade barrage fails to kill all creepers, switch to bow/sword/rotted fork, and take them out.

If the grenade strategy works, a large clump of 20hp healing hearts should be nearby, use those for a mid-potion cooldown healing.

PHASE 2

When phase 2 begins, the brain will phase further away from your position, change form, and then begin homing in on you.

Your top priority right now, is keeping him off of your position, and to not be pinned. Keep moving, and don't go close to walls, you can be very easily trapped.

if you can see the direction the brain is approaching from, shoot him with a bow/undertaker/boomerang/grenade, whilst heading in the opposite direction.

The knockback will make him phase, and quickly re-appear in another random position near you.

In the event you are pinned down, a grappling hook (anything will do) can be used to quickly escape through the boss, slightly reducing the overall damage you would take (the panic necklace can sometimes be used to escape, but he can sometimes phase into your fleeing path), otherwise, you would have to tank out a few hits (usually about 90hp-120hp) before he phases again. If you have any grenades, use them now.

Repeat the 'run+gun' method, and the boss should fall easily enough.

Most battles should net you 90-160 crimtane, which makes 22-40 bars.

Hope this helps."

&gt;In a phone call with reporters, Mr. Duncan said the Promise Zones would receive extra points when applying for existing competitive grants awarded by the Department of Education. He said that some communities, for example, might use grant money for expanding preschool for disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds.

My interpretation is that they are making these areas automatically count higher for all social benefits that their local communities might have to apply for. If there is a special grant that needs applying for and you need to meet 15 out of 30 different criteria these communities automatically start at 5 points. To cut through the red tape they might also automatically file the applications for them. Technically this wont be giving them any money they weren't already able to get but it does save a lot of time for the community staffers that are most likely overworked. "

GuyWithNoHat,sex,1389420344.0,"First and foremost, I'm sorry to hear that you're having a difficult time with finding sexual happiness.  I do not think you're alone, and there are plenty of women that would be more than happy to share information with you.

I think there are two issues here.  The first is that you're still feeling too insecure, perhaps from your past weight dilemma.  Any person that is filled with insecurity is going to have an impossible time trying to achieve orgasm.  The second is that you've *never* experienced orgasm.  Most women who finally break through that barrier have a much easier time getting there in future encounters.

You need a break!  You need a no-pressure, doesn't-matter-what-I-look-like afternoon, with a soothing spa or shower and some sexual stimulation.  Don't give up, but forget about the orgasm.  Do what feels good, if something doesn't feel good, switch it up.  If it starts to *feel too good*, don't be afraid, ride it out.

TL;DR: Figure out your body first.  This will save your next candidate a lot of frustrating trial-and-error, and I assure you that there will be much less conflict if you can work through this task."

I just wanted to address this portion of your post.  Remember, you shouldn't resent the sex -- you should resent the absence of whatever else it is you're needing.  For him, sex is the thing he needs to feel intimate and really close to you.  If it's not the same for you, you have to teach him how to provide what you need.  It is important to express satisfaction with the sex (if you are *indeed* satisfied with it), so that he understands that your needs are different than his, and that you aren't criticizing his sexual abilities.

As many things as you have posted makes me think that moving in together might be jumping the gun a little bit, or that a therapist is still maybe a good idea.

* The sensory inputs are weird. Fluorescent lights will buzz (if you remember the world cup in South Africa, it's a bit worse than that) and some will flicker, you will be able to hear the individual cycles of fans, you will be able to feel tiny differences in some things and be totally oblivious to others. If it's loud or crowded then get out.

* If you start feeling weird mentally, find somewhere dark and quiet and just huddle into a ball while listening to music. Failure to do so will have dire consequences and may result in an early, permanent end to the test drive.

* Be careful eating or drinking, some things will just seem horrible (do not attempt alcohol because it will taste like rubbing alcohol, see the note on senses). If you ingest anything toxic green peppers will work as a substitute for ipecac.

* Be careful around people, you will feel their emotions and you will have no control over it or be able to keep theirs separate from your own. If you find a way to block this other than shutting down the emotional processing please leave a note.

* **DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT.** It will fuck up your head and it will hurt. You may also have some flashes of major negative emotions as a result, try to be careful when that happens.

* Be careful with music, some artists and some songs will effect you like a person feeling a strong emotion would. If you can find music that gives off the same emotion as any extreme you're feeling then that may help normalize things.

* You will need to fake your emotions and relearn to read people, there are some incompatibilities with stock emotional processing and they refuse to acknowledge them.

* The joints may ache, don't worry you just need to crack them (good luck with the knees, again leave a note of any solutions).

* The right hand clicks when closing and the wrist does the same on rotation, don't worry but don't over do it (they will cramp up).

* The fingers are very flexible and need to be cracked often, push at the base in order to do so otherwise you will probably cause them to cramp a bit.

* If the head starts twitching then crack the neck, if it happens again in the same day make an appointment with a chiropractor.

* Avoid ingesting a lot of caffeine at once or powerful stimulants, they will either knock you out or fuck you up (your brain will not play well with them)."

* Get yourself warmed up, maybe have a few orgasms on your own before he even joins in (this isn't a long-term solution, but may make it easier for you to get some additional orgasms when he joins)

* Try to work out a system for communicating during sex.  Discuss the system when you're in the car driving somewhere, not immediately before or after sex.  An example would be, ""If what you're doing is working *really* well, I will say 'Yes!' often; if you hear me saying 'Yes!' often do not speed up or change what you're doing.""  Something like that.

* Make sure to ask him about some areas you could improve upon as well.  Remember, just because you aren't happy, doesn't mean that *he's* happy.  He might be getting off, but maybe not in the way he would like, or maybe he doesn't get to finish where he wants to.  Be prepared for some criticism you may not have been expecting.

Sometimes it's good to have 1-way sex sessions.  Take turns.  On Monday, you will bring him to full orgasm without expecting anything in return.  Then on Tuesday, he should do the same for you.  If the receiver feels guilty or selfish afterwards, they can reciprocate."

DevilGuy,worldnews,1389422567.0,"I have, and you're argument is beside the point.

All religions, but most especially those springing from the Judaic tradition assert first that they are the infallible word of god. By basing their ideology on the foundation that their starting principals are infallible they must by necessity never admit that anything in their text can be wrong, to do so would undermine the whole structure of their belief system. Thus when enough time passes and better more complete answers are found to some of the questions these religions once purported to answer conflict is inevitable.

Islam is particularly vulnerable to radicalization because it lacks a central authority to act as a moderating force, or to enact reform. Though it's true that such authority isn't always wielded appropriately, without it there's no way to effectively combat radicalization within the religion itself."

I'd never spanked anyone before.  I wasn't sure *how*.  I've never even entertained the notion of expressing dominance.  After I spanked her, and noticed how wet it made her, it's almost all I can think about.  I fingered her to orgasm with her bent over my lap and her skirt hiked up.  After that, I pushed her down on her knees and made her suck me off.  Before I came, I told her that I was going to cum all over her pretty face.  She continued to suck me off, and when I told her I was cumming, she pulled me out of her mouth and I shot several loads on her face, one of which accidentally got in her eye.

Afterwards, she told me how hot it was, and I realized that there must be something to this *dominant side* I was starting to develop.  After this, we talked about being honest with our needs, and it almost put all the pieces together.  She has been the happiest when I'm most in control and primal in nature.  This means being a little bit aggressive and taking what I want, and it turns her on immensely to see me this way.

zegafregaomega,Games,1389423786.0,"I don't really consider it to be GOTY-Bait because it's a pretty experimental game. The idea of Oscar-bait is using well-established tropes to make a work pleasing to a specific group of people with huge marketing potential. Video Games don't really have an equivalent to the Academy because VG media is distributed by several big sites, plus there's a lot of vertical accountability with VG media.

A lot of Oscar controversy comes from the Academy choosing something most people wouldn't, like when the 1994 best picture award was given to *Forrest Gump* instead of *Pulp Fiction*. To me, VGs have the opposite problem. The media is way too sensitive to what viewers think because gamers are easily upset people and if they don't agree with an award, they might stop going to that site. I haven't seen a single GOTY award for Gone Home; maybe a Best Indie Game award, or two, but never, GOTY. If anything, I'd call games like GTA V and TES V to be GOTY-Bait because they are both open-world games that present themselves as being more complex than they actually are, which makes them marketable to both casual players and non-casual."

pUmKinBoM,AskReddit,1389423995.0,"I use to work from home for a call centre and I was crazy tired with very little sleep in between days. So I had a hard time staying awake and more than a few times would fall asleep during my lunch or 10 minute breaks. That's not the worst though. One time I fell asleep with my headset on my head and still logged into the phones but everyone from the office was trying to get a hold of me while this happened. I mean my computer was lit up with messages (no speakers were provised), my phone had a full voicemail and missed calls (had it on silent for work), and the worst part is that the head of HR was in the office checking calls and found out I was sleeping and tried calling my phone.

Luckily this was my last day before vacation so I had a week before I had to deal with it but I figured I was fired for sure. When I got back from vacation I logged in and was told to call the HR Manager for what I could only figure were my walking papers. I explained my piece and they told me it better not happen again...then they let me go back to work. I didn't even get written up for it or even a verbal warning so I felt ahead of the game. Unfortunately they stepped up the security for home agents and gave us speakers, webcams, and a loud ass binging noise that goes directly to your headset all because of my infraction. 

People loved me at that job and it sure helped me get away with a lot but not many people can say they have survived something like this without being fired."

lsharkk,Conservative,1389424082.0,"FCM operations banker here, all industries benefit from stability - property/product/excise taxes/tariffs staying the same or going lower, regulations staying the same, the dollar holding value, etc. - and when politicians start putting bills that threaten said stability on to the floor, businesses get nervous and ""hoard"". I see this manifest in how our clients trade financial commodity products as these are tied to non-finance industries like farming and mining and heck, even herding. Yep, the CME trades [live cattle](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/livestock/live-cattle.html). 

The farm bill buzz led to a huge amount of insecurity in farm products - hedge funds and other speculative investment firms were hesitant to put money in something that might get heavily taxed and regulated, causing farming companies to spend more to bring their product to market which either slims their margin or profit or, more likely, raises the price. While the bill wasn't even the voting phase, trading in farm products heavily declined; elsewhere, coal saw an massive influx of new investors as well as other metals and foodstuffs (sugar, coffee, corn, rice). These banking guys are moving billions through these industries *a day* and some day traders manage multi-million dollar portfolios individually, so they care about even the tiniest bit of info on what could affect a product's price, hence why they pay their lackeys to turn up on the Hill and bother the other lackeys into pushing their little price schemes.

You may be REALLY poor at interviewing.  A lot of people think they've done a knock-out job but it doesn't always work out that way.  Unfortunately there is no way for you to ever find out how you did on your interviews because that information is kept locked away.  I'm not going to recommend paying one of those ludicrous ""prepare you for med school interviews"" for-profits but you should probably find someone to practice your interview skills on.

What school did you go to for undergrad and graduate school?

Your 3.82 GPA isn't bad but folks get screened out for having a C+ and they can still manage a 3.82 GPA.  What's your math and science GPA?  That tends to matter more than your overall GPA because it discounts humanities classes.

The letters of rec are another huge problem for med students.  It's not your fault but some people just REALLY suck at writing those letters.  Saying ""John was outstanding"" 50 times in a row usually leads to a note on the file that discounts ""buzzwords.""

Your advisers also sound like they're a tad bit ignorant.  No adviser should be tell you that you've got a sure shot, EVER.  The in-state schools can also harm you.  Say you're interviewing at Tufts, BU, and Harvard; all 3 of those schools have more than enough people from their own undergraduate universities so they're looking for a bit of diversity.  You can say it's unfair but it's just the way the world works sometimes.

As far as the money situation goes, AMCAS has a [fee assistance program](https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/fap/) and the majority of schools will waive the fee if you provide documentation that you're broke.  You DEFINITELY need to apply to more schools than that and maybe broaden your horizons so that you're applying to places out of state.

I wish I could help more but confidentiality waivers, etc etc.  I'd recommend hopping on Student Doctor Network as they are a pretty legit source when it comes to applying to med school."

Then we both happened to be in Vegas for New Years, but I didn't tell him because he stopped responding to my text before I could tell him and we ran into each other. He was sweet but he's since ghosted. I'm bummed just because I really liked the sex and the cuddles all night and all morning were perfect.

LolaRuns,Games,1389427361.0,"&gt;And that's what Gone Home feels like; a quota of social problems stuffed into a game.

I get that the theme ruffled some feathers, but from interviews I got the distinct impression that that wasn't the case here, that for example the lesbian romance wasn't there to fill some quota but rather because it reflected some aspect of the devs (I believe they described themselves once as a 4 person team of both male and female, lbgt and non-lbgt members). 

I'm not experts on lesbians, but my impression has been that 

1.) This idea of a gay/lesbian young adult novel about the first falling in love is a big theme for the community, maybe because the growing up period can still feel pretty traumtic for a lot of lbgt folks? And another big theme is how to make those stories uplifting rather than depressing but still feeling like at least some form of realism (aka lots of complaints from within the community that too many coming of age young adult stories are about falling in love with a straight person and having no chance and that that is the opposite of uplifting). 

2.) The idea that doing a story about lesbians and then having one of them die is in very poor taste seems to be really prevalent in the lesbian world. It's something that was talked about extensively for example when Tara died on Buffy. The idea is that apparently there has been a long tradition in cinema to portray lesbians as this beatiful yet tragic thing who are ultimately not meant to be in this world and that that is a very fucked up message to send. So usually any lesbian character dying is often met with a knee jerk aversion and generally seen as an extremely cop-out method of storytelling. ([here](http://www.afterellen.com/the-9-worst-fictional-lesbian-bi-deaths-of-2013/12/2013/2/) are some recent examples) [as a result I was deeply unsurprised when I heard about the ending/that it didn't end with a suicide or devil worship or anything like that, to me that sounded very typical in this context of what lbgt folk think is important about stories]

So to me it felt like, 

1.) Lesbians were chosen because of personal, in team associations

2.) The ending was chosen because the team was probably keenly aware of inner LBGT discourse on various fiction

So I would buy ""too married to inner lbgt thinking/too exemplaic of a lbgt worldview"" (even the parents' problems fit into this, from a lbgt teen POV that probably would be an important message as well to know ""your parents aren't perfect either/have their own problems/are keeping secrets as well"") over ""filling some quota"" as a complaint against the game. 

To me, based on how the game is structured/what story it tells, it being born out of typical lbgt background/sentiment seems the more plausible explanation as the game is extremely consistent with that world view, up to maybe even being willing to weaken the quality/realism of the story in order to fit that narrative tradition better. I find it believable that it would be there because somebody on the team genuinely believes in that world view over that they would fake/meet some quota to achieve that world view (since again their behavior has been very consistent with this, including for example their refusal to go to PAX).  

IMO the main concession to the game being for a mixed audience is the player character being an ""every woman"" (aka not gay herself) but chances are that that was also influenced by them not having the resources to tell the story from Sam's POV with like believable character animations/direct interactions with characters. (other than that, I don't know who the lbgt members of their team are, so maybe it was a concession that it was girls rather than teenage boys, who knows)

I subscribe more to the idea that the story wasn't creative (aka perfect wish fullfillment from the POV of an lbgt teen) over that it wasn't genuine in choosing what it was about. "

mnmnstrd,Bass,1389427480.0,"For hard rock, you can't beat a P bass with rounds, especially if you're playing pick style. It's all really comes down to personal preference, but the P bass nails the sound I have in my head when I'm thinking of how I want my bass to sound. Something about the raw sound of one grunty pickup played hard until you naturally overdrive your amp just puts a smile on my face :) I feel like a jazz bass is a bit cleaner sounding and works better for other styles of music. As someone who owns both kinds of basses, a Jazz with the neck pickup soloed will not come close to the sound of a Precision. They are totally different sounds. There a tons of Youtube videos of people playing these basses, so you can get a good idea of which sound you prefer. The best way to choose is to play these basses at a music store. Besides the pickups and body styles, the main difference is the size of the neck. You'll typically have a narrower nut on the Jazz bass (1.5"" on the Jazz versus 1.625"" or 1.75"" on the P bass). Depending on the size of your hands, you may find the Jazz bass more comfortable. I have big ol' mitts so the P feels right at home for me. However, Fender basses are the de-facto electric basses, so you can more or less use a P or a J in any style of music. I wouldn't overly stress over which one you buy.

TL;DR: Can't really go wrong with either. P bass has a wider neck, Jazz bass has a narrower neck. Both basses are extremely versatile and have been used in just about every genre of modern music for the last 50 years. Play both and decide which one speaks to you."

My main point is that yes it happens, but it's not all as bad as it  appears, though some definitely is. I think women do many of the same things, what with the comparing attractiveness and talking about fantasies or bragging about accomplishments.

So I contacted them asking to have the games removed from my library so that I could buy the collection ""again"", since the site cancelled the other one, since I messed up. They gave me that ""please handwrite your Support Ticket Number on the blah blah blah"", but there was nothing to write on so I was left confused. But to my surprise the next day I looked at my library, the games weren't there, so they at least solved my problem.

Oh yeah, and they also said they ""couldn't locate my Steam ID through the information you have provided"", even though I put a direct link to it. Totally dumb automated answer, but at least they quickly did what I needed them to do."

badmotherfuhrer,WritingPrompts,1389429785.0,"""Badmotherfuhrer, can I see you in my office?""

""Uh, sure,"" I said, wondering if today was finally the day of my arrest. I had been stealing from the company for several years now, skimming cash from certain sales accounts. So far, I had evaded incarceration, and even managed to keep my job, but I knew that every week I was getting close to slipping up. Every single time I thought they'd caught me, though, it was always for something else. I wondered what it would be this time.

I followed my boss into her office. Her large, mahogany desk was arranged such that her computer screen could not be seen from the door. As I walked in, she sat in her giant, winged, leather exec's chair, and motioned for me to take a seat across from her. Silence overtook the room as she rested her chin on her fist and scrolled. What she said next made my stomach drop.

""You know, someone should really go to prison for this.""

""For what?"" I asked cautiously, playing dumb until I found out what she knew. But she said nothing, instead continuing to scroll.

My mind swirled with potential excuses. I couldn't go to prison. I wouldn't survive. Besides, it's not like anyone really *needed* that money more than me, right? After all, I *told* them I had a baby on the way. I *told* them that, and they did nothing. So really, they brought all of this on themselves. Right?

""Do you not like working here, or something?"" she asked.

""I like it fine,"" I said. ""Why do you ask?"" Removing her chin from her hand, she leaned back in her seat and crossed her legs, turning towards me. 

""Because--and I'm sorry to have to break this to you--you are *never* going to make it as a writer.""

I stared open-mouthed at her.

""I'm sorry, what?"" 

""Come on,"" she said, uncrossing her legs and looking back at her computer, ""you didn't think I'd find your reddit account? And all your /r/WritingPrompts submissions? It's not like you're hard to find.""

""I..I..."" I stammered.

""I mean, really, look at this. 'Are you the guy? You know, the guy, the guy everyone talks about?' Are you serious? I find more inspiring things on the inside of my 6-month-old's dirty diaper. You better be glad you have this job, because writing isn't exactly your fallback.""

My eyes, having nowhere else to look, found themselves staring at my hands, which were resting in my lap. 

""It's...just a...a hobby,"" I squeaked out. 

""A hobby?"" she asked in mock bewilderment. ""In that case, you should find a different one. One that not even you could mess up. Like...sleeping! Or drinking!""

I had felt nervous walking into her office, but now I only felt shame, like a pubescent boy whose naughty stash had been discovered. 

""You know,"" my boss continued, ""I think I would have felt less shame for you if you were embezzling from the company than I do having discovered this. Now get back to work.""

Without raising my head, I got up and, quickly but silently, walked back to my office. I did not stop at the water cooler, nor did I stop at Dave's desk to chat. I did not pass Go, and I did not collect $200. 

I think I would have rather gone to jail."
