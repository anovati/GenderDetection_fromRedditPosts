YOU are a person who deserves to be treated respectfully and attentively.

You will ask each other questions about your lives, and you won't need to make any ""moves"" right away. You just need to chat and be comfortable and happy conversing about this and that. You deserve that from other people and you are willing to reciprocate that attention and respect.

ed8020,Autos,1389591621.0,"Well, you could do it either way. The block itself is the heaviest part, though you'd have to rent a cherry picker to actually lift it out of the car. If you wanted to see how it's done I'm sure there's lots of youtube videos on the subject.

My initial thought was just to start at the top of the engine and work your way down, tossing the parts in the back seat as you go. If you want to attempt to put it back together then there are procedures. Some parts, bolts and the like go only in specific places and you need to keep track of what pattern they are in. Many will be almost identical but be different lengths because they have to penetrate more than one part or go deeper because they have extra pressure on them. Then there are others that all look the same but over time they become worn to each other so there actually are minor differences that will become apparent once the engine is running again.

I once cracked my block on my way to work. As soon as work was over I went to a junk yard and got another complete engine. Because it was for a different model car I had to strip of the ""top end"" which consists of the carb, intake manifold and heads. I know it sounds like just a few parts but it's a bit more involved than that. At this point you can see almost all of what's on the inside. Crankshaft, camshaft, rods and even the pistons are exposed. I then stripped the top end off of my old engine as those parts were what was different between the two engines. Once that was done the engine is a couple hundred pounds lighter. I had rented a cherry picker while I went to get the new engine so I pulled the old engine out, dropped the new engine in, put my old top end on the new block and drove it home. I did all this in the parking lot at work. It took me 22 hours straight to do it all.

When people ask me if I'm a mechanic I say, ""No. I just know how to fix **my own** car"".

There are tricks to the trade that every shade tree mechanic knows. One of them is how to keep track of which bolt goes where on particular parts. These parts are things like exhaust manifold (the part of the exhaust that bolts to the block), the head bolts (if it's a 4 cylinder the head is the very top of the engine though the valve covers cover it, or if it's a V6 or V8 they are on top of each side and give it a more  pronounced V shape and the intake manifold (sits on top between the V or comes out of the side on a 4 but in both cases the carb sits on top of it). To keep track of where the attaching bolts go on each of these parts use a cardboard box (pizza boxes work great) and punch the bolts into them in the same pattern as they came off the engine. That's just one of the tricks but it's oh so important.

So anyway, whether you want to put it back together is up to you. The main lesson is learning how everything comes apart, what connects to what and how the parts work together. Kinda like dissecting a frog in science class. You may not put it back together but you do learn how it all works together."

In the last 5 or 6 years we've actually seen a significant transformation of the  DRPK army, they now have  dedicated units of RPG infantry for example- something they picked up from the Iranians, who tested the idea with Hezbollah and who passed it on to the Taleban/Al Qaeda somewhere along the line.  That kind of thing has been devastating to US convoys in Iraq  and Afghanistan, but no one had really thought of it before.   That's not a matter of uniforms or not, nor are IED's, it's a matter of being able deploy the right kind of explosives to the right places.  Though, admittedly, Iraq has better cell service than the DPRK which helps.  

&gt;""don't fire unless fired upon rule

Tell that to the people in their cars driving to work getting massacred by machine gun fire from the backs of pickup trucks.   If the US stuck to a don't fire until fired upon rule it might be winning.  But blowing up some dude on the way to a wedding with a hellfire missile from a drone isn't endearing them to the locals, nor is setting up checkpoints and killing innocent people on a regular basis.

&gt;North Koreans don't do that shit, they're enemies in uniform marching in lockstep.

Only in the parades they show on TV.  Which are just that: parades.  Theatrics for the  sake of theatrics.

Even in the korean war the  DPRK used mobile light foot infantry through forests and mountains very effectively.  That technique still works essentially.  Well, when you're on the defence.  The DPRK can fire a bunch of missiles ones or twice and a lob some artillery shells but that would all be wiped out by airpower after a few weeks, they'd have a hard time moving much  serious firepower south of the DMZ for the same reason we would have trouble moving north.

It's the non-consensual nature and power dynamic endemic to pedophilia that makes more than just another orientation. It's why we don't allow serial rapists to use this bullshit excuse. Because it's fucking wrong. Most things aren't so black and white, but some things are. This is one of them."

I was confused because of the fact that the lines are vertical like the French flag, but since the flag extends so far, I was thinking the flag might be of the Netherlands since it could be pointing downward and the lines could be horizontal. I'm not sure if this info is useless or not, but it's all I've got.

Maldevinine,Fantasy,1389593796.0,"There's not that many. Something about fantasy just doesn't work with mysteries and investigations.

**Daniel Polansky's Low Town** novels are very much in the noir style, with mysteries being slowly revealed to the reader and similar characters to what you would expect. The setting is 10 years after a world war 1 equivalent conflict with magic instead of machine guns. These novels are morbid, but not that dark.

Other then that, **Servant of the Underworld** by **Alettie De Bodard** is the Mayan High Priest of the Dead trying to solve a locked room murder mystery. It's not a fair play mystery for obvious reasons, but it is good and a very unusual setting."

t0talnonsense,AskMen,1389594720.0,"I'm going to respond to your final comments first. I never said he shouldn't tell the husband. I agreed that she should be given a time limit, make it a week. If she hasn't told him by then, THEN the friend should step in. You admit that we know nothing about the husband, their relationship, or their household. For all we know, the husband has been pushing her away or being distant and she was looking for comfort somewhere else. Maybe she is a terrible person and just decided to cheat unprovoked. We. Don't. Know. Instantly assuming she is some terrible slut who can't be trusted is overstepping given the amount of information we were given. The entire point of the ultimatum is to give her the opportunity first, and then if she fails, further prove that she cannot be trusted. Now onto my points about how this actually impacts the relationship.



With something this serious, it's the transgressors responsibility to own up to it. Of course they don't want to. The wife was obviously having trouble already not telling the husband. Otherwise, why else would she have confided in the OP? It's troubling her. There's no doubt about it. She's probably afraid of losing her marriage, and never wanted this to happen. Giving her the ultimatum of ""you tell him or I will,"" forces her to own up to it. She can try and lie about it, but the OP knows whatever she confided in him, and *how* she confided in him. The husband will naturally be questioning of anything she says, and if the OP says something that doesn't match up with her story, he would be an idiot not to talk to her about it. Or, he may decide to ignore it. You never know. 

* The woman cheated, at least once
* She's obviously having trouble with her conscious and keeping this from him
* The husband **deserves** to hear this from his wife, and no one else.


One other thing to consider. The 2 kids they already have. Giving her the opportunity to own up to her mistakes like an adult (even if you have to give her an ultimatum to get her to do so) gives their marriage a better chance of working out, which will benefit the children in innumerable ways, assuming they can truly move beyond this moment.

I sincerely wonder if you have ever been in a serious relationship/marriage. Trust me. As someone who has had to own up to my own  serious fuck ups. It sucks. It eats at you, and it will break you down. If she really is sorry for what she's done, then it will come out when she has to tell him."

Tashre,IAmA,1389595379.0,"Former baggage handler here.

Invest in quality luggage. Seriously. We don't get paid enough to care.

Pro-tip: If you can find ones that suit your volume needs, buy music cases. They are generally very sturdy (compared to the average POS luggage people buy, and don't even get me started on south east asian travelers) and usually get automatic off-white glove treatment by handlers. Normally airlines will ask to see if there are actual valuable fragile items in a piece of luggage if you tell them there is before putting on fragile stickers (which don't mean shit to most people most of the time, which is why good luggage is rugged) but there's nothing stopping you from slapping your own on, though don't go overboard with it; stickers all over the damn place are normally people trying too hard to get their bags special treatment, especially if they're not from any actual airline, and most baggage handlers learn to ignore these and many take them as a challenge. Place them in centralized, visible locations on each side and in few amounts and you'll be set.

Above all, **THE number one way to ensure your bag will most likely get the best treatment is to have good, solid, accessible handles** on them, on more than just one side. Handlers have to throw hundreds of bags a day, most of them stupidly heavy, and, again, don't get paid enough to care too much about them, so they'll throw bags with the most convenient purchase they can get on them. Make sure this means the well built handle and not some errant strap or flush handle they have to dig for or you're going to get ripped and broken pieces off your bags and they will be thrown about much more haphazardly than if the handler is able to get a solid grip on it and direct its travel accurately.

Also, the conveyor system will subject your baggage to more Gs than baggage handlers will 90% of the time. They have massive amounts of torque and it's unreasonable for their jam tolerances to be set low, so be damn sure you don't have straps or loose bits hanging out or you're likely going to get them ripped off (either by the system itself, or by the annoyed technician who spends 2/3rds of his day fixing belt jams).

Also, speaking as an American airport worker, for those coming from overseas and have your luggage totally saran wrapped, while I understand why you do it, understand you're sacrificing handling efficacy for pseudo-security, and your shit *will* get flung about."

Another example- say you buy a new car, and it's awesome. Are you going to drive it home, park it then go do something else? Hell no, you'll find any excuse to go for a drive until the initial novelty wears off. :)

CrazyPlato,changemyview,1389595923.0,"Just to be clear, are you asking us to change your view on drugs, or on using drugs as a treatment for your depression?

As a treatment, I'd recommend that you consult someone with at least a knowledge of psychology and medicine before you take anything like this. A lot of drugs will have a different effect on your brain than you want, some may even make things worse. I only say this because you don't mention asking a professional about any of this, and I think it's a bad idea to go in blind, even if you've read some papers on the subject.

Now, if you're asking us to change your view on drugs in general, I'll challenge the ads that changed your view in the first place. They don't really say much, just ""this drug gives you a false image of something"". 

First of all, there's no credibility here: no citations of studies, no medical opinions, just a random statement. You could imagine a stranger on the street saying it the same way, and it wouldn't be credible then either. A statement like this needs at least a rational argument to justify it.

Then there's the abstract nature of the statements. To say that *every* experience of an abstract emotion, under the influence of a drug, is fake is just dumb. I'm sure there are at least some instances of people taking THC and being genuinely creative (not ""fake perception of creativity"" as the poster says), or finding real love during an experience with MDMA. And all it takes is one instance to disprove a ""always/never"" argument like ""MDMA never lets you experience true love"".

Which is my final point with the subject of drug use in general. Every person experiences substances differently, so it seems like a mistake to make a hard-line denial of a substance, based on the statement that some people would be hurt by trying it. Obviously, this would depend on the scale (if there's a strong chance of danger, obviously it makes more sense to say that it isn't worth the risk), but some of these substances have a strong chance of not being harmful at all, at least no more than a night of drinking would be."

He is 18 now, and can do whatever he wants its his body. If you don't like it then you can talk to him, but you can't force him to do anything. 

Honestly I think the problem is that you just have these stereotypes that aren't necessarily true dead set in your mind and can't see it anyother way. Its 2013, I would wager that the majority of people either don't care or they like pierced ears. Just because someone does something to their body doesn't make them part of a group. I could get a massive tattoo across my chest that said ""I am a gay man."" Does that actually make me a gay man, and change who I am sexually attracted to? Of course not, I'm still aroused by women. Piercing his ears is something that he wants to do, and it isn't going to make him a douche, gay, or a criminal if he wasn't any of those things before he got his ears pierced. 

Personally I think it is rather superficial to not be able to be with someone because of pierced ears. Lasting relationships are built on more than just appearance, you fell in love with his personality and him as a person which isn't any of those stereotypes listed above so why are you upset? Of course you can ultimately break up with someone for anything you don't like in a relationship, because its up to you."

CrazyPlato,changemyview,1389596967.0,"How many Muslim terrorist groups do you think there are, who are an actual threat?

With that in mind, it's foolish to assume that terrorists are likely to be Muslim, when in reality just about anyone with a shady enough background could be a terrorist. The problem is that the current American practice is to focus more on Muslims regardless of background, rather than focus on shady people of all ethnicities. It causes tunnel vision, and there's a greater risk of the TSA missing somebody while they focus on one group of people especially.

Chicken_Wing,WritingPrompts,1389598072.0,"First and foremost, write about something you like if you can. Something you're interested will always lead to better results. If you want to write the introductory paragraph first, so be it but remember that if you don't like it by the end of the essay, change it! Revision is your greatest ally! Write to get it out of the way and go back through to see how you can improve how you phrased something or make it more clear or delete a word/phrase. Get your idea on the page and then revise it to the evidence you have. If you start out with a paper which is meant to prove that 2nd hand smoke doesn't harm but find a bunch of research that it does, fucking change the focus of the paper! It took Jack Kerouac 3 weeks to write ""On the Road"" but years to revise it and it's considered one of the best American novels. Find sources to emphasize your points, not create them.

Dr Sears coined that phrase, here's his website: http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/attachment-parenting.

allenstenhaus,books,1389599753.0,"OP, I know how that span can be. I actually didn't read a book for pleasure from about six years of age until 24. I would occasionally read what I was required to, but I disliked most of it. High school was a huge example of being forced to read. Due to childhood trauma, I wasn't nearly mature enough to grasp concepts like love, romance, infidelity, incest, betrayal, murder, and all other Shakespearean tales. I was grasping onto my youth so hard, and being forced to read adult novels... they were way out of my league from an emotional and maturity standpoint. 

I have always had a strong grasp of language, syntax, grammar, etc. Writing and reading in general always came easily for me. Even so, spending so many years without reading left me unable to see symbolism, detect hidden meaning in a story, and any number of social skills one develops simply from books. At 24 I was behind in many ways, which countered my ease of understanding language. There was a difference between technical skill and creative skill. I lacked the latter. 

At 24, I finally chose to read something. A new bookstore came to town and all of us were excited about it. Even I was, and I didn't even read! So, I wandered about from section to section wondering if I might stumble upon something of interest to me. Nothing grabbed me.

Finally, just as I was about to give up (yes, I know this is a cliche), there it was. Black, hardcover, gold lettering and gold leaf edging on the paper. The paper itself was what I always describe as Bible Paper. Very thin, but strong and smooth, allowing for many pages in a small space. It even had one of those ribbon bookmarks. 

What was the book? The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide, of course. 

What better way is there to get back into reading? Silliness, science fiction, clever dialogue, humor (subtle and obvious), and general weirdness. A guy like me couldn't pick a better book. 

After that, I would occasionally read for pleasure. Jurassic Park, The God Delusion, Assassin's Apprentice (Hobb), Harry Potter (it was all the rage then), Frankenstein, Soldier Son (Robin Hobb again), The Greatest Show on Earth, and even Twilight. Don't groan too hard. That series made me realize even if I was only ever mediocre, I could still be a huge success with a bit of luck. 

Then I went back to school, and I was able to enjoy most of the assigned books. The Hunger Games did nothing for me, but The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was very enjoyable. I was outright blown away by A Thousand Splendid Suns, and I NEVER would have picked that up on my own. 

Unfortunately, I read no books in 2013 due to a severe lack of time, but I will not fall back into bad habits. This year I will definitely read much more, as I have several books on my Kindle I'm dying to read. 

Seems I'm rambling. The point is, OP, I'm glad you are able to read for pleasure now. It's amazing how invaluable a few good books can be, and I feel everyone should read and enjoy reading... yes, even pop fiction like Twilight. "

I am so tired of this war on black women. It gets so annoying. I'm tired of racial, more often than not, racist comments that are hidden behind ""good"" intentions or ""benign"" attempts to clear matters up. It's like people are beating around the bush when it comes to matters such as these. People are refusing to see their own prejudices and fail to reflect on themselves. You see me, I do that on the daily, so I can keep myself in check and not have society color my views on the world. "

allenstenhaus,AskMen,1389600975.0,"I concur. I would want to be told. Cheating I could forgive, but to expect me to raise another man's child as my own? That's a horrible thing to do to anyone. 

Now, this next part may be an unpopular opinion, but if it were me, I would tell her she either had to get an abortion or tell the husband about the pregnancy, otherwise you will tell him.  Gives her the chance to come clean herself, because her expecting him to care for the child tells me she has no intention to abort. This gets you out of having to tell your friend. Though, it would be good to let him know after that she came to you and you told her she had to come clean, that way you don't look like you're keeping a secret. 

With no kids involved, what he doesn't know won't hurt him. But I would want to know if my wife was pregnant with another man's child. 

I can't think of anything more selfish than knowingly letting a man put time and resources into a child that isn't his. Plus, when the kid looks nothing like him or the siblings he'll figure it out. If the kid is say four or older, imagine what it will do if the child's ""daddy"" leaves. At that age, there is already a very strong bond, and the child might never recover from such hurt and abandonment. Even if the kid is only a baby, it will still grow up without a father if he bails. Who could blame him for wanting divorce after that?

TL; DR - If you can't convince her to tell him, you need to. Even if it costs you both friendships, think of what that child will have to go through when what seems like a stable home breaks up after only s few years. "

kowalski71,truetf2,1389601030.0,"Play a lot of ctf_doublecross as sniper. This is my favorite sniper map, both for my enjoyment as well as training.

Doublecross forces you to play short distance (from the courtyard out the front door), mid distance (across the bridge), and long distance (battlements). You have to choose your sniper location and strategy based on where the current front is. Playing somewhere like the grassy knoll gives you the chance to really control the flow of their team, choose your targets carefully (a medic-heavy, and two pyros hit the bridge, who do you shoot), but also get comfortable defending yourself against spies and having situational awareness.

I like that to be a good team player when sniping on doublecross you have to move around a lot. Sometimes you have to go take a few shots as window sniper to take out a sentry, or head for the bottom bridge to defend the intel. But even then most sniper spots are still in lanes of travel so you'll be crossing paths with members of their teams.

I swear that Valve made doublecross specifically for snipers."

I've been simmering and raging, just the same as you. It hasn't waned, only fueled me further forwards, never fearing the consequences of being vocal, calling out behaviors and spreading education. I have since cut out the rapist from my life completely, and made sure to (tastefully) discredit him and make sure everyone knows of the rapid decline of my respect for his character amongst our mutual peers.

The best thing about rage is that it can be uncontrollable and destructive, but it is better than sadness in that sadness is a *sapping* negative energy, while anger, oh, anger is *fueling*. Both can be directed towards construction and the greater good.

Protect the woman, and make sure she knows you are there for her. Know your place in judgement over this man, but do not think to let it pass you by if your sense of morality will not let you. Act and then use the momentum to actively use your newfound internalization (the key to higher degrees of empathy and understanding) to better the cause.

It doesn't actually do anything to control costs, and only artificially makes insurance cheaper for some by making getting insurance mandatory.

Obamacare only adds to per capita health costs.

JIVEprinting,Accounting,1389602705.0,"Sounds like you're off to a great start!


A master's degree won't really add anything to your marketability unless you want to teach the subject.  The CPA certification is the most important by far.


The ideal career track for an accountant is a year or two of public accounting at a large firm, after which you'll constantly be courted for cushy jobs in industry with high salaries.  Your college GPA is more influential in hiring than every other factor combined.


After you're a CPA you can work in pretty much any area you want.  You may even be hired in as an accountant and ask your boss to put you onto marketing or HR projects, if that's what interests you.  If you feel like something different and decide to become a doctor, salesman, or even a pastor, the CPA designation makes people want to listen when you talk.


You can develop in an area of specialty- like state tax, or inventory- and consult in that field indefinitely.  I actually know a pastor who started in finance, working for the FDIC, who still moonlights one day a week consulting.


As for your schools?  Go for the better school.  It is astonishing the difference a good school makes.  It will literally upgrade the rest of your life.  Who cares about a couple years of loan payments, especially when you're a top-flight CPA?  The real decision is whether you're prepared for the amount of sacrifice that a good school entails.  If you want to party, or explore hobbies either take a semester off or wait for midwinter break.  Spend discretionary time on recommended optional reading (or pursuing related material that interests you) -- anyone can be mediocre, and there really isn't going to be another opportunity in your life for that depth of richness in such an ideal setting.


(I might also have a disproportionately rugged view of the programs, since mine is only 10-week semesters and I transferred from another program so all my core classes are concentrated one after the other, rather than spread over an even college career.)


On a personal note, I would urge you toward diverse experience.  My background is actually in marketing, though I should be passing the CPA exam later this year.  I've also maintained close friendships with a biochemist, an actuarian, and a special needs teacher.  *The synergies that occur when we share knowledge are astounding.*  If history teaches us anything, it's that great human progress comes when unity of purpose is married with diversity of skills.  Therefore, I feel that you want to *avoid* the traditional bean-counting stereotype of the accountant who never leaves his ivory tower and disdains marketers who think they want to become CPA's (looking at you, /u/potatoriot )


The biggest regret I have in college was that I became inactive in church.  If I had pursued spiritual realities, then I could've offered substance and rescue to my friends who were miserable and empty.  But I couldn't, and I will never get those opportunities back."

I speak Czech and Russian (mother tongues), English and Norwegian fluently, German on a basic level and have taken a year of French, so I guess my understanding there would be ""very basic"". In addition to this, I've studied Latin for 5 years as mentioned, but it's hard to rank my proficiency in it.

When I was learning German, the language that helped me most lexically was Russian. When I was learning Latin, German and English helped me memorize the words. With Norwegian, I related most words to German, Russian and English. When I was learning French, I found most lexical similarities with Russian and English.

I have never caught myself thinking ""oh my this is just like that Latin word""; and indeed I was learning languages that do use a lot of dictionary from Latin.

On social issues the Greens are to the left of Labor, which isn't hard as Labor has spent many decades being socially and economically centrist or right wing.

Communists have class politics. The idea is that the working class seize the means of production.

Just because some violence doesn't warrant a restraining order, IE: two kids get in a fight on the playground and punches are thrown, someone slaps their significant other, does not make it okay for said violence to occur.

In college I smacked my friend on the back of the head when he was being a jerk to me. Later when we weren't as mad at each other he told me that if I ever did it again he didn't want to be friends with me, period. he wasn't hurt by it physically, but it was something that he (rightfully so) never wanted to ever have to deal with a friend doing to him. I'm pretty much in full agreement with him. Words are powerful. use them.

OP is in a relationship where instead of using words his SO hits him. does it matter if it physically hurts or not? She's willfully *not* communicating with him. 

Yeah fine you can't get a restraining order, but you can write that shit down and use it as evidence as to why she might not be an effective parent. I certainly wouldn't want to raise a family in an environment where instead of talking to me to resolve issues my husband smacked me on the ass or similar.

I'm personally a great fan of Forked. Earth elemental should definitely be in there. I don't own a second so couldn't add a second in my shaman deck. 

I considered the unbound as well to drop. Seems tho with the amount of overload spells in this deck you often get him at least to 3/5 before he gets silenced / killed. On average i think in my plays he has been worth being in my deck.

mycroftar,firewater,1389611267.0,"Sanitize your equipment, and use your best judgement :)

If you can just plop a hydrometer in the fermenter, take a reading, and remove the hydrometer, that's the easiest solution.  Otherwise you'll need to get some of your mash into another container to take a reading.  Sanitize your sample cylinder, scoop it if you want but I'd probably use another container to scoop the mash and pour it into the cylinder. 

You don't need to siphon until after the fermenting process starts, when you want to protect the alcohol from oxidation.  Until then you're free to pour, scoop, etc.

If you can take a reading in your fermenting vessel, then it's ok to take a reading while everything's still bubbling.  Otherwise you risk oxygenating the water and creating an aerobic environment which can create off flavors, typically you only want oxygen at the very beginning of a ferment.  You could siphon into a container but it's better to just wait until everything's done bubbling to take a reading IMO."

It is an incredibly viable disinfection method. However this is  only possible because disinfection is the last operation and at that point the water is almost completely void of particles (which can block UV rays). In the context of this pyramid theory UV disinfection would be limited because of the suspended solids (limestone mostly), depth of water, and lack of mixing. Despite these disadvantages, I do not think you are giving UV disinfection enough credit.

Also, they implied that seawater was used, supported by the salt found on the inside of the pyramid. Where there is salt water there are chlorine ions. So there ya go, Chlorine and UV disinfection."

&gt;As someone who has spent almost everyday of the last 6 years high I have no idea what I'm supposed to do now. I love my friends but everything we ever did started with or involved us smoking weed.

Wow. That is actually really really fucking sad. I say that to you, as a girl from rural Saskatchewan who is currently sitting in Belgium. Yesterday I went to my boyfriend's mother's house, to a late Christmas/New Year's party. There was a gift exchange. 

A few weeks ago, I stayed in a little village in France and spent a week (again with the boyfriend) driving around the countryside and taking pictures of castles and talking horribly bastardized French to actual French people. (Because those from Quebec totally don't count, trolololol)

Now, my life is actually pretty average. I have a *very* small group of *very* good friends, I've dropped out of University *twice* and I've had more failed relationships than I can count, and I'm currently unemployed... 

But ye gods man!

You're almost 27. *I'm* 27. Now is the time where you start setting some goals, working towards them, and when it comes to finding stuff to fill the spare time... Well, okay, you're on a student budget.... 

But have you tried looking into *real genuine activities* to do with your friends? 

You could do fucking anything. 

**ANYTHING.**

You could: 

-Go to a pool hall and play for a bit. Set up tournaments with your friends. Go bowling. Whatever.

-Take up rock climbing or biking or hiking. 

-Learn ballroom dancing. 

-Go on a minivacation in your own town, visit local museums, libraries, coffee shops... 

-Make art. Make horrible art, make good art, but do it.

-Organize a protest or a rally or a support group. 

-Volunteer to help in a food kitchen, with habitat for humanity, visiting the elderly, whatever.

-Get a part time/casual job working with your hands. (I don't know why, but I think everyone should try this for the sheer satisfaction of it at least once in their lives, preferably something where you can look at what you've done and think ""Wow, I helped make this."")

-Go geocatching. 

-Go on a picnic. 

-Seriously, go fly a kite at the beach. 

-Meditate. 

-Read some books. 

-Catch up on Netflix.

-Get involved in local politics. 

-Write angry letters to corporations for the hell of it. 

-Or maybe just write. 

-Grow, learn, experience, become the person you were meant to be... 


You have *six years* to make up for. And from the way it sounds to me, you didn't lose yourself, you finally found yourself after hiding from them using a smokescreen for six years... So expect the re-acquaintance process to be a little uncomfortable, but ultimately worthwhile. You might be pleasantly surprised at who you'll become without the crutch of weed. "

The second is called a piezometric well and what happens is that there is a impervious layer of rock at which the water is flowing under. The rock acts to both apply more pressure to the water but also to act like a pipe and contain the water.

A water fountain is a different sort of condition when comparing height. At the nozzle of a water fountain the water goes from being pressurized to having zero water pressure. At which point the water is only being propelled by velocity just before it left the pipe. If you were to continue to pipe that water fountain you would see that it achieves a much higher height. Imagine holding a garden hose, if you hold it vertical it will only spay a few inches high. Now add another 5ft of hose and stand on a latter and you will see that the change is negligible. "

UlgraTheTerrible,wemetonline,1389614871.0,"&gt;how do two people form a relationship like this without the real spending time together?

Um...

Maybe because most of our time is spent in (often, not always) meaningful and deep *real conversation* rather than just being next to each other and doing the same thing. 

(I may or may not have something of a dim view of much more than half of the couples I know who got together in person vs. online, and yes, I've had several relationships of either kind)

The connection is very real, and often quite a bit *stronger* than in person connections are, at least at first... 

Because you tell a stranger your soul and you can do that but the people you *know* might judge you if you were to try... Only then the stranger sees your soul and finds it beautiful and tells you their soul, and it's also beautiful and suddenly it's love, or maybe just infatuation, but it's big, it's intense, and you realize you're in over your head.... 

Just be careful though, because there are some liars and jerks out there who get off on having people fall for them like that. 

As for how you bring it up... 

""Hey, listen, I need to get this off my chest... I have developed feelings for you. Warm fuzzy feelings. In my genitals. (You could omit that line if you're not as perverse as me) And I would just like you to know that. I don't know what I want to do about it yet, but perhaps you have some opinions regarding this matter.""

You can take that as is, or rewrite it in your own words.

I7-4770 or 4770k if you want to overclock.

16 or 32GB DDR3-1600 or 1866 RAM.

A good motherboard. I recommend the Gigabyte Z87x series.

A GPU like GTX 760 is quite good for the price it has in relation to its more powerful brothers. Can do high settings at ~45FPS.

A minimum of 500W PSU. Get something modular to make life easier.

Case will depend on what you like. There's big cases and small cases. If you want big, there's the Corsair 750D and the Fractal R4 that are highly recommended. The Corsair 600T stands out in the mid tower category. The Bitfenix Prodigy takes the very small award.

Wifi can be achieved with any wifi card. Shouldn't cost too much. They're around $20 do should be around the equivalent in UK.

Check out /r/hardwareswap for parts. There's always people selling things and you can get great bargains.

Truth

http://mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004752 I can understand Jade's rage. Karkat is REALLY annoying when he does this.

http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/02864.gif

I fucking love [S] Jade: Enter and I don't know why. It's number 2 on my list. Btw in case it wasn't clear to the newcomers, this new Jack is what's chasing the trolls.

Favorite Flashes:

&gt;[1](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006009). [[S] Cascade: Can it really be beaten? All that work and creativity coming together? If it can, I will proudly crown Andrew Hussie the greatest artist of all time!](/spoiler)

&gt;[2](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004827). [S] Jade: Enter: Such chills, such epicness, it wasn't easy for number 1 to beat this.

&gt;[3](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003840). [S] Descend: I find it funny this made it this high. I think this was the moment the Homestuck really grabbed me. [Until now, I expected them to gradually complete the game and come together at a final fight against the black king, following a set storyline of something like say Avatar: The Last Airbender.](/spoiler) This showed to me that the story in itself was not going to follow it's own rules and anything could happen.

&gt;[4](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007138)/[4](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007152). [[S] Dirk: Synchronize\Unite (Counts as one): I love the way Hussie is able to make these connections and let everything flow together, it's a really amazing thing](/spoiler)

&gt;[5](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003049). [S] Enter: OK I'll admit when I first read the story I wasn't really involved in it (I skipped the Midnight Crew Intermission :$). This finally got me to say, huh this looks like it could be pretty interesting.

&gt;[6](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006290). [[S] END OF ACT 6 INTERMISSION 1: I love this one because it's pretty much foreshadowing Act 6 and in a really beautiful way.](/spoiler)

&gt;[7](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007161). [[S] Caliborn: Enter.: And the big bad wolf is revealed. This was a really sad moment for me, mainly because this is the planet from [S] Roxy: Sleepwalk and, to me, it has the same connotations as burning a book. That instantly made me hate LE. Well played, Hussie, well played.](/spoiler)

&gt;[8](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004987). [[S] JOHN. RISE UP.: One of the prettiest songs I've heard in Homestuck, this flash really evokes emotion in you.](/spoiler)

&gt;[9](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006386). [[S] Roxy: Sleepwalk.: This one is really cool beacause it pretty much shows all the places the story has brought us, makes you realize just how big paradox space really is...](/spoiler)

&gt;[10](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004888). [[S] ==&gt;: The Forst and Frogs introduction. It's just beautiful.](/spoiler)

&gt;[11](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007338). [[S] ACT 6 ACT 4: Another storyteller flash. This one pretty much sums up all of the B2 kid's session in just a few minutes. And only using imagery. I find it fascinating how artists are able to do this sort of thing.](/spoiler)

&gt;[12](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002926). [S] Jade: Dream up extra arms and play advanced bass solo.: This one pretty much made me remeber that these kids are into something really big.

&gt;[13](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006472). [[S] Prince of Heart: Rise up.: Really good animation in this one, made me realize how much Hussie's skill has been improving over the past few years.](/spoiler)

&gt;[14](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=008178). [[S] ACT 6 ACT 6 INTERMISSION 1: Another great example of how Hussie's art is improving. Really make the comic feel alive](/spoiler)

&gt;[15](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003701). [S] WV?: Rise up.: We finally get to see the battlefield and the big war that's happening. A really good worldbuilder flash.

&gt;[16](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003500). [S] John: Reunite with your loving wife and daughter.: Does this really need an explaination? HOW DO I LIIIIVE WITHOUT YOUUUU???

&gt;[17](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005660). [[S] Flip.: A really really cool showdown. The glitches just make it more epic IMO.](/spoiler)

&gt;[18](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004478). [S] Make her pay.: A really cool summation of the A2 troll's session and a great interpretation of Vriska's revenge. Amazing artwork as well, the differing styles are a really great supplement"

Your only solid chance of flying in the military is as an Army warrant officer in helicopters. They don't require a college degree for that and the age limit is much higher than for the other branches. 

Aviation in other branches require you to be an Officer, which means you need a Bachelor's degree. You couldn't finish a degree and go to OCS in time to meet the Navy limit of no older than 27 years old by the start of training. Perhaps it is possible if you basically max out your course load and don't take Summers off. Even then it's tough. I think the Air Force has a higher age limit, but they don't accept so many people who haven't done ROTC or Academy... both of those options will likely take you over the age limit anyway.

HabseligkeitDerLiebe,BuyItForLife,1389616948.0,"&gt; When was the last time you needed a German military shovel? Sure, they're indestructible and BIFL, but what's the scenario you're going to use it in? If you already have one, when was the last time you used it that you weren't making a ""I have this shovel and here's the perfect excuse to use it"" excuse?

Well, technically I didn't bought it since I was in the German military and i got it that way but there are some situations I needed it. Usually in winter. German winters (at least here in the north) aren't that harsh that you need snow chains, but sometimes you get in a situation when a tire doesn't get any traction on a frozen road. So you just go to the side of the road, clear away some snow, get some shovels of dirt to put under the tire and you're good to go.

When I was scavenging some mushrooms in the forest a tire got stuck in mud. So I used the shovel to chop off some branches, put in front of that tire and could go on.

That thing is just really handy.

Otherwise I agree with you. Hauling *all* of that stuff is overkill. You're not going to war. Why do you need 2 axes? I know, one is a ""tomahawk"", but what's the difference in an emergency? If you have the military shovel (yes, I really love that thing) you don't need any axe, since the shovel is designed to be used as an axe. It's not that comfortable; it's a pain in the ass to fell a tree with it, but you carry it (as an axe) to make a fire for the night in an emergency or do that mud-branches-thing I described, not to build a cabin."

L1M3,elderscrollsonline,1389617241.0,"&gt; Besides that ESO is missing features that made TES brand so popular, I am personally disappointed how far they have wandered off from TES trademarks and just copied other MMOs. Your choices have literally no impact on the outcome of quests and barely any influence on how the quest will go

We must have played different versions of TES games.

Quests in TES games are almost completely linear. Everytime you do the mages guild quests in Skyrim or the Fighters' guild in Oblivion it's the same, from one playthrough to the next. You don't make choices that affect anything. The world doesn't change after you become the Archmage of the Mages guild, and no one acknowledges your accomplishments.

The differences between playthroughs come from the way you develop you character, and that's no different in ESO.

&gt;the whole ""I level what I use"" is gone in that aspect as well as several others.

Not at all.

In Skyrim, when you use a Destruction spell your Destruction skill goes up. In ESO, when you use an Ardent Flame spell as a dragonknight your 
Ardent Flame skill does up. In both games, when you attack with a bow your bow skill goes up. If you do not use a bow or do not use any Ardent Flame spells then you will not progress in those skill lines. It's almost exactly the same.

I share some of your concerns about the longevity of this game but the complaints you voiced here are patently false."

L1M3,elderscrollsonline,1389618485.0,"&gt;For my $15 a month for a monthly subscription - I get everything - all content, cosmetics, etc. With an F2P model, it usually ends up consisting of overpriced bullshit in a shop where you pay $10 bucks a pop for a cosmetic item. At the end of the day, you'd need to spend hundreds to unlock everything that otherwise would be provided in a subscription-based model.

Not so fast. You make it seem like an obviously bad system vs. good system, yet I don't think it is. Look at it this way:

If I'm playing a B2P game with a cosmetic shop, such as GW2, and I set aside $15 a month to buy things from the cash shop. How long would it be before I was able to purchase everything I wanted? I'm not going to want everything. However, I will be able to prioritize what I do want and won't have to worry about getting something I don't want. (There may be buyer's remorse to deal with, however)

If the game was instead subscription based, and I had to win those same cosmetic items by getting them in random drops, how many months would it take me to unlock all of the ones I wanted? How many things would I get that I don't even want, but can't trade, effectively wasting my time due to RNG?

It's not a simple question, and it doesn't have a simple answer. I've been playing WoW for years and there's still things I haven't been able to get. However, at least I've had fun actually playing the game in that time period instead of clicking through menus. And the things I have gotten I've earned; it's a bit less meaningful when you just buy things. That's why I continue to farm old content for mounts instead of buying the undeniably better looking mounts in the Blizzard store. (They're also horribly overpriced but that's another discussion)

Ultimately, I still prefer the sub model for *me*, but I think when you look at the big picture it's just not that simple."

Thinking about it, I believe a rapid fire killer instinct shot with scope and aggression would have a (50+30+20+10 - 60)=50% chance to crit the pod, so only a 25% chance of no crits.  

Alloy canon does 15 critical damage, +50% = 22.5 base damage.  To a pod, that would be 11 damage (I think it rounds down).

If both shots are critical, the pod would be at 9 HP and would die to a single sniper headshot with the plasma sniper.  Since only nutjobs move their sniper before their assault, it'd probably go down easy enough."

It was getting late, and I had that audition in the morning, but Reddit was on good form this evening, and was doing a better job than usual of holding my attention. I clicked the next blue link, an r/GetMotivated post about not wasting time. I reflected on it briefly, feeling that familiar spark of conviction to better myself fizzle away before moving on to the next link. I yawned, and leaned back in my chair, taking a drink of water. My head was throbbing slightly, but I was used to having headaches and this was mild by comparison. I looked over at the blue notebook that was lying by the now empty glass I just set down, the notebook I’d resolved, a long time ago, to fill with notes and thoughts to augment what would become a burgeoning writing career. I permitted myself a moment of shame for dreams unfulfilled, before returning to my laptop. After getting a little further down the page I was distracted, suddenly, by a piercing wail from outside. It rose and fell to a terrible pitch, and for a moment I thought of a woman screaming, before realising that it must be a fox. A light by the living room door flickered slightly, as I clicked another link, but I barely noticed.


3am and I was still browsing, slowly becoming aware of the stinging weight beneath my eyes. I counted how many hours of sleep now awaited me and sighed at the result. *One more link*, I decided. Outside, the fox screamed again. It sounded so human. I went to my profile and then to my ‘saved’ list, not sure what I’d find. I skimmed down and spotted an r/AskReddit thread about images that never fail to make you laugh. I smiled even at the thought of what I knew I’d see, and clicked on the top link. Sure enough, it was the shit-eating grin of that little dog, with the accompanying commentary. I stared at the dog’s stupid face for a moment before a chuckle escaped me, rising quickly to a hearty laugh. I looked away for a moment, and then back again, only to laugh harder until I was almost crying. *I must really be tired*, I thought, as I finally stopped. But panic, suddenly, my chest tightened. There was still laughter in my ears. *My* laughter. My mouth was closed, but I could hear it clearly in my ears, as though it was coming from all around me. The dog's grin on the screen suddenly seemed grotesque and terrifying. Instinctively I closed Chrome, but it didn’t stop. It was my voice. My voice, coming from somewhere outside of me. I looked around the room, feeling my heart racing, my breath short. The light by the door was flickering. *It must be the computer*. I tried to shut it down, but it was frozen. I tried again. And again, as the laughter now no longer mimicked how I’d been laughing before, but now, still in my voice, became more hysterical, perhaps to match the hysteria I felt as I now smashed the keys on my laptop until the screen tore violently into a jagged mess of distorted colours, and an insane screech burst from the speakers, blending with the shrieking laughter that assailed my ears and my very grip on reality. A jumped to my feet, turning to run. To where, I don’t know, but I was frantic with fear. I raced to the living room door, past the flickering light, tore it open and was grabbed and pulled into the arms of something. Something with a fox mask on its face. Something that laughed, and screamed, with my voice even as its hands tightened around my throat. "

You'll get there in the end, though, just keep plugging away at it and reminding yourself of what you intellectually know. I think I'm probably a bit different to you because I haven't been ashamed of myself since I was sixteen or so, but I can tell you about how I came to accept that I was gay instead of bisexual. 

I think the main reason I didn't want to be a lesbian was that I thought it would mean I was alone. Nearly all my friends are straight, so I thought I'd just never meet anyone else and wished I could be straight instead (or at least remain identifying as bisexual) just because things seemed so simple then. Straight men are everywhere; it would be easy for me to be in a relationship whenever I wanted, I thought. Like you, intellectually I knew it wasn't that simple and I was being pessimistic, but the idea of my options closing so much was scary, even more because I knew I didn't actually have a choice. 

How I came to accept it is that when I voiced these thoughts to my friends, they made a huge effort for me. We go to gay clubs just for my benefit now and they're generally excellent at offering to come along to any community events and being really interested in it all. Sometimes I still get grumpy, because it seems like the odds are so massively stacked against me, but mostly I'm pretty happy. As long as being a lesbian doesn't feel like an inconvenience (that's not a good word, but I can't feel like a better one), I like it. It's a part of me. 

So yeah, to summarise; I think it was going to gay clubs and actually getting a bit more involved in the community that did it. Everyone was so fun and welcoming, and I emotionally accepted what I intellectually knew - this is a community I love being part of and of course there are plenty of girls who like girls out there. For now I prefer to be single, but I don't stress about the future much anymore either. "

He may only be exercising that philosophy with regard to eating animals, but the same line of thought is also one where the biggest bully has the right to beat up the weakest nerd, whereby the richest have the right to horde what they can without regard for the poor, whereby those with political power have the right to use it to keep those without it powerless. What he's saying is, every person for themself, fuck everyone else, you can only look out for yourself.

Well, he's welcome to live by that philosophy, but that's not the world I want to help create. I want to help create a world where we help each other. I want a world where the strong help the weak to become strong, where those with power stand up for the powerless, and and where those who have food and shelter do what they can to share it with those who do not. It is my belief, and the belief of many others, that the more we give to those around us, the more we get in return, while the more we try to take for ourselves at any expense, the less we end up with in the end. 

And if such a world is to be created, if the philosophy of the abundance to be had through kindness and sharing is in fact a true one, then we can not, must not eat meat. We must not take advantage of the most defensless among us, we must not derive pleasure from the suffering of others, for doing so goes against that philosophy. If such a philosophy is true, if giving creates abundance and taking creates scarcity, then we must not take the lives of the innocent and the defenseless, for by doing so we only harm ourselves in the long run."

Being able to relate better is not the same as what she suggested, which is ""because she could stay, so should he.""  THAT is why she brought it up--which IS a mark of poor character.  She cheated on her husband, and is now defaming him in a public setting she sought for help!  Much as anything else the airing of his own bad past behavior when she's trying to ""fix"" things is a mark to me that she only cares about herself.

&gt; Relationships aren't a competition of who is ""not as bad"". If she sees it that way that is immature and the chance of working through this vanishes.

I agree.  And that is why I think the husband's immediate reaction to this was so intelligent, and why I think in this specific case she is a bad person.

&gt;Wtf? Where did you read that?

Numerous posts by her.  The one we're now discussing is one such post, many others in which she turns to the reasons why she was unhappy (rather than the decision to cheat) as an explanation for her actions.

Margrete I, creator of the Kalmar Union and all around super diplomat. What is remarkable about her feat of creating the Kalmar Union is that in all our long history only the greatest king Knud the great can be said to have achieved something comparable.

aDDnTN,motorcycles,1389620955.0,"&gt; I continually amazed by the amount of motorcycle riders who think that their self assessed skills of hyper-perception and godlike riding ability will trump any and all safety technologies; ABS, TPMS, et all.

i'm continually amazed by the amount of mc riders who believe that safety technology trumps learning and honing one's ability, intellect, and instinct! seriously guy. everyone here wants an ABS bike because it will give them better braking ability.

imo, skills are 1000x more valuable than the bells and whistles that make up for it.  technology will break and fail, when that happens all you have are your instincts. 

for a lot of people, mc'ing is about getting away from all those trappings, getting back to something simple. In fact, that's what motorcycling started out as. It doesn't take much more than two wheels and an engine. Now we have layers as much shit on bikes as we have on cars. Some people just don't want that.

TPMS will only alert you to a possible issue **if all of the system is working correctly**. If your brain is working and you haven't turned the ride over to autopilot, then you should be able to read the signs pointing to potential issues.

Assuming that some tech could have saved some guy trouble is just as specious as me saying ""if he had better skills"", except that skills don't just pack up and bail on you without warning.

Too much relying on technology weakens the core instincts regarding survival.

If your less 200lb and of average build sure a wally world bike will do, but if your a big boy like me then a Wal-Mart bike with cheap rear shocks is not going to support your weight and is going to sag big time and no amount of adjusting will fix it.  You'd need to get a hardtail to make it work.  Also expect to do a lot more maintenance, adjustments, etc. with the cheaper bike as they will loosen/break a lot more.

Getting professionally fitted out with the right size bike will also help, my upper back was always sore after long rides.  When I got fitted out I found out I needed a much longer bike and my back pain went away.

I_FUCK_UP_RECIPES,relationships,1389621659.0,"Some thoughts:

I actually think *you* screwed up.  Not with her, with yourself. 

Two years into my relationship with my wife (then-girlfriend), I took her to her first gala as an anniversary gift.  It was an expensive, wonderful date, but I did not take her expecting something back because it did not set me back significantly.  She got me nothing.  How much did I care?  None at all.  When we want to gift eachother BIG stuff, we talk about it.  When I wanted to propose, I found out six months in advance what kind of diamonds and settings she liked, clearly indicating I was not proposing but might someday and wanted to know.  Because she wanted to get me something too, she got me a seiko 5 automatic, which I had mentioned I wanted and love.  For non-proposal gifts, we've done away with surprise entirely; we talk about what we both want.  

She still messed up too because unless there is some significance behind the rock it's a very bizarre and semi-insulting gift.  And I would gently ask what the significance of it is, and explain that you're a little confused.

But do **NOT** compare it to your gift to her.  "

RunsWithSporks,subaru,1389622223.0,"Well, we are Subaru fans, I bought the wife an 2012 Outback just before our daughter was born, mainly because it was the safest car I could think of. We both love it and have no apprehension when we need to take our daughter out when the weather is bad.

The car I just traded in was an 06 Dodge Magnum that I had for 7 years. It was absolutely abysmal in the snow and since I drove our daughter around when my wife worked on the weekends, I needed something safe and reliable. However I didn't want to give up my man card just yet and get a mom mobile. I new I was going to get a Subaru, since we love our Outback, so I opted for something with a turbo. The Impreza was too small, since we also have 2 dogs, and are trying for a second kid. I also did not want to get the same car as my wife. So the Forester just fit the bill, and with the redesign of the XT, they improved the look much more than the old one(except for removing the scoop!). Along with a ton of other improvements. I am also pleasantly surprised with the MPG's, its best in class and a major step up from what I was driving before. It even gets better mileage than the 3.6R Outback. The 2.5 beats it though, getting 4 more per gallon. 

Now, on to the turbo, the XT has 4 driving modes. Intelligent (I) Sport S, Sport Plus (S#) and X-Mode. Intelligent is what you would expect, its for saving MPG's and sensible driving. Sport Plus is for when you want a more responsive throttle and are focused on performance. Sport mode splits the difference. The new X-Mode only works at low speeds, and is for really bad roads and weather, to help novice drivers feel confident. I will just post [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut0XREKWIb0) video, Subaru does a better job explaining it. No other SUV's in its class offers that. 

The only thing I do not like about the Forester is the Navi system. But I think everyone knows they suck big time. I think I will install a Nexus 7 in the dash sometime in the near future.

aDDnTN,motorcycles,1389623136.0,"sorry, i ranted at you, but there are plenty of people trying to make tech manditory and required.

The trouble is, where do you draw the line and where should ""the people"" draw the line?

I support helmets and feel that everyone should be required to wear one. Furthermore, i think that 3/4 or less helms are a complete farce and complete ineffective (in light of overwhelming body of evidence), which means that ""/u/addntn 's helmet law would only support full face helmets, which many might decry as ""too far"" and ""limits my freedom!""

People here have made the case that ABS should be required. This a step to far imo. But does that mean it shouldn't be required? how is it any different that my helmet law?

Mostly, i was trying to make a point that *requiring* safety equipment is no better than *requiring* training, if people are gonna drive like assholes, they are gonna drive like assholes. Shit happens and if you aren't careful it might kill you. In the end, you can only rely on yourself, and so, IMO, we should be training riders to be self-reliant first, then apply technology to enhance and reinforce those trained skills.

To analogize (poorly), you wouldn't train to be an Olympic high jumper using a pogo stick would you? But the pogo (using technology) helps you jump higher and further than one currently can. IMO, if you learn to high jump using only what you have got naturally, and train that ability into a high level skill, which allows you to utilize all of your natural potential you would see much better results. AND THEN add the pogo!

So my problem with ABS, traction control, wheelie control and all the other noob-savers, is to allow people with no natural trained skills go further and end up ""in over their heads"".

Now, ABS works fine as a noob-aid if that new rider is riding responsibly and being overly careful, but we all know that 90% of the new riders aren't like that. Hell i would be shocked to learn that 50% of riders with 10 years experience ride ""with all care possible, as often as possible""."

You said earlier the difference between murder and manslaughter is all in the 'mind' of the perpetrator yet this quote directly contradicts that. McNeill was supposedly an MMA fighter he fully understood the damage that he could inflict on someone as it is part of the sport. He already demonstrated reckless aggression earlier in assaulting three minors. Given the many times that people have so easily been killed from a single hit to the head (and how widely publicised they have been) I think you would be hard pressed proving that he thought such harm was an unlikely outcome.

t0talnonsense,AskMen,1389623793.0,"I think we agree on a lot more than you believe.

&gt; Personally, for something this serious, the most important thing should be for the wronged party to know....telling the wronged party should be top priority.

I never said anything against this, and fully agree. I was speaking about *responsibility* not *importance*. Giving an ultimatum achieves the ultimate, and most important, goal of insuring the husband is told. You misunderstood my discussion about the wife's responsibility, with the importance of making sure the information is conveyed.

&gt;To ease her guilty ass conscience.

That's exactly what I said in a much harsher way.

&gt;""never wanted to happen"" doesn't mean shit at this point, it has already happened.

In context of the OP's situation, you're right. However, we also have to think about the husband. To him, it matters very much if it was a one night stand or a deliberate affair. How and why this came about are very important from the husbands perspective.

&gt;If she's willing to lie about this, what's to stop her from continuing her lie?

Nothing. But the OP knows however much he does, and she knows that. There is nothing stopping the OP from going behind her after the fact (assuming she tells him) and corroborating what the husband was told. In fact, that is an essential part of this entire plan.

&gt;We're not gonna see eye to eye on this. Yes he deserves to have his wife tell him this information,

Again, this is exactly what I said. Give both parties an opportunity to do the most right they can in a very bad situation. The husband should hear it from his wife. She should own up to her actions. They sit down and try to work it out, whatever that means for them. If this doesn't happen, the OP sets the record straight. Either way, the husband finds out. 

&gt;Why give her another opportunity to use love to cloud her husband's judgement? Because she might tell the truth? What makes this time any different?

At this point, the only thing we know about the wife is that she cheated at least once, got pregnant from that encounter, and is intending on hiding it. At no point has she attempted to cloud the husband's judgment. You are taking one very limited set of knowledge and using it to create an entire persona that could be utterly false. Work with what you know. We have no knowledge that would lead us to believe that she repeatedly lies and/or manipulates her husband.

&gt;Being married doesn't prevent an unhappy household, and getting a divorce doesn't prevent children from growing up positively.

I said, ""gives their marriage a better chance of working out.....they can **truly** move beyond this moment"" That meant positively. You're completely right in your statement, but a positive household with two parents is better for kids than a broken home.

&gt;Once again, you're still giving liars too much credit. Maybe you weren't strong enough to maintain the facade, but that doesn't mean that other liars aren't strong/willing enough to do so.

Maybe I am, but I think you are also ignoring the fact that they are married and have 2 kids. There is/was serious attachment and commitment. Without some sort of negative action on behalf of the husband, very few people just decide to up and cheat. She very likely still holds some, if not most, of her attachment to him. If she does, then it will come out. Her body language, voice inflections, etc. are all important parts of the conversation I think you are forgetting. 

It's not a matter of keeping up a facade. Everything I've said is assuming that she owns up and acts like a responsible adult; whereas the majority of your statements assumes she is a terrible, lying, masterful actress. In reality, it's probably somewhere between the two, just like it is for most people."

MyOwnGraniteStone,AskReddit,1389623871.0,"I think whether or not it's really cheaper to go out/stay in depends heavily on what you *could* be doing instead. I mean, it's dinner, right? You've probably been off work for an hour to three hours. At this point, you wouldn't have been working anyway, and that just means you're paying for the cost of the food (and prep if you're going out) and you're not losing money because you're not working.

It's all opportunity costs

Here's how I think about it:

There are two types of time in the day: working time, and break time. The only difference between the two is that working time makes money. Eating out during Working Time saves you time, and is faster, so at $16/hour, you'll make the cost of a meal in the time that you would/could have spent preparing a meal. (Of course, that's assuming you're in and out and eat quickly. That's also assuming you're preparing the food for lunch instead of making it in the morning and bringing it.)

During Break Time, during which people normally eat dinner, you're not making money whether you go out or prepare your own food. Unless you're allotting time to do something else, it's probably cheaper to prepare your own food, because you're not paying for the food and the preparation. Just the food.

**TL;DR:** The deciding factor is less the actual cost of the meal, and more whether or not you could be doing something or earning money. Opportunity costs, opportunity costs, opportunity costs."

Saefroch,space,1389625273.0,"So I'd just like to make sure we're on the same page with techniques used to find planets:

Planets and planetary systems are primarily discovered by watching large regions of stars and watching their brightness over time. When a planet passes between us and a star, we see the star get dimmer, then return to its previous brightness. If we see this same dip (same shape, same depth) twice, we assume we've found that planet's year.

Once we've established that there's a planet, radial velocity measurements are sometimes made for some more accurate data, and to reveal other large planets in the system. As a star and planets orbit their common center of mass, the star moves towards and away from us, causing a sinusoidal redshift. Multiple planets create multiple signals that just stack up on each other, so it's common to discover more planets in a system this way after the first is found.

So to your question...
I guess you *could* say that these are indirect measurements, but they're definitely on par for astronomy techniques, like those used for dating stars and the universe.

There's a lot of astronomy research devoted to studying variable stars, so it's pretty safe to say that any publication that identifies a variable star as a star with a planet would not survive peer review. The light curves (brightness over time) look quite different, and planets have such a tiny effect compared to pretty much everything else. That's not to say that we're totally confident in our results, most things the Kepler mission finds are called ""candidaes,"" and rightly so, until more data can be collected and analyzed."

ruat_caelum,writing,1389625372.0,"Tricky! Leave the love for his kids.

My sister-law's father was married until she was four, figured his shit out, divorced and is living with another dude writing screen plays.

He seems normal to me but I am not exposed to any of the sexuality side of it.

here is how I imagined that marriage going though.

* He probably cares deeply for the woman, but take LUST out of the relationship. When she dresses sexy for him (not nighties but say dresses.) He is genuinely confused on how she can be disappointed in his comment of ""That necklace perfectly frames your face,"" or ""so many men will be jealous of me tonight,"" or ""that dress looks great."" Pretty much any comment that a grandma would say. Sexless and comforting but hes not eating her with his eyes, he makes no jokes about not being about to go into public until he gets rid of his erection. No dirty talk etc.

* He loves his kids! don't fuck this up. The love he has for his children is probably why he is keeping a marriage that is just 'OK' (this is how he would see it) together.

* He hangs ""with the guys"" and feels far more comfortable with them than his wife. He always took to be normal, I.e. he was the guy who had ""guy's night out"" etc. It has been harder and harder to schedule these as his friends are all married and have kids as well (assuming same age range as the main guy) and now they all want to do ""couple events""

* His wife is passive about this. Most people with good communication skills would bring up ""you don't make me feel sexy."" Or ""i'm scared with are losing our spark"" Or ""let's get counseling."" The oint is if she has verbally acknowledged there is a problem she is probably trying to come up with a solution. **on the other hand** If she is just trying to cling to a relationship that is slowly coming apart she might say nothing.

* The wife is an island in this. At home her man is asexual. A kiss here or there but even a kiss on the mouth is not passionate. She has no spontaneous sex stories like her friends, ""Not sure what got into bob Tuesday but he took me right there in the kitchen 20 minutes before the kids got home!"" In public he is the perfect husband, (he works at it) Holding open doors, being great to her friends. He is the perfect father to their children. He has a stable job and they budget their money. They are in fact the perfect couple on the surface...

* in short they both know something is wrong. They have two options for long term denial: Either they internalize the problem, they say ""this is my fault something is not right"" and try to hide it from their partner. They are not sure how to fix it but that's okay because they things they can fix they do! **OR** they externalize the problem and blame their spouse, (for long term denial we need a motive to still try to hide or ignore stuff) So the best bet is they do LOVE their souse or belive they do or whatever. They care deeply and do not want to hurt the other person. More than likely and going simply from statistics the male will blame the female and the female will internalize. So the man thinks there problems are the wive's fault, can't quite nail down what they are, but loves her and the family enough to try to keep things they way they ""should be""




I Would write this by thinking of what a grandma might say every time the gay husband talks to his wife. I would likewise look at alcoholics or battered wives, or the super religious to see how the family portrays themselves publicly. They are hiding something, the roles are too perfect, no one's marriages are this good. The other spouse always seems to have work for group vacations but they can meet up for an hour or two a month.

Assuming they do care about each other and they both see the marriage as close to failing, they would probably work extra hard to keep things together. IF we assume old-school gender roles: He will water and fertilize and mow the grass, they will have the best lawn. She will keep the house spotless, the kid will have so much help and feel so loved (but know something is wrong. and may even internalize it: My parents are so happy when they are with me but family dinners are so cold! Is it my fault? We they happier before I was born?)

Unless the story is about his ""gayness"" I'd leave it be. let the background and the home life show that there is something wrong and perhaps something happens later that makes him at least start denying he is gay to himself. I.e. he is kissed by a guy in drag after being randomly selected to join the guy in drag on stage at some sort of show, comedy club or whatever. His friends give him a tiny amount of normal "" ha-ha fag"" jokes the next day and he loses his shit! Goes off on them. They stop but for the next four or five days he keeps brining it up in front of them. ""I'm not gay dude!"" When offered an apple martini (that everyone is drinking, that one of his friend's wives made upstairs while the men are in the man cave. All his buddies are drinking them.) ""I didn't say anything man I'm just handing off a drink.""

He can either ""see it"" or the husbands can, relay to their wives, who take a closer look, and confront his wife. Then she can deny it or ""see it"" etc."

Required Tests:

C1064/C1064M - Temperature of Freshly Mixed Hydraulic-Cement Concrete

C172 - Sampling Freshly Mixed Concrete

C143/C143M - Slump of Hydraulic-Cement Concrete

C138/C138M - Density (Unit Weight), Yield, and Air Content (Gravimetric) of Concrete

C231 - Air Content of Freshly Mixed Concrete by the Pressure Method

C173/C173M - Air Content of Freshly Mixed Concrete by the Volumetric Method

C31/C31M - Making and Curing Concrete Test Specimens in the Field

-----------------------------------

in the very least, you can look up these tests in an ASTM manual or even online. (http://enterprise.astm.org/filtrexx40.cgi?+REDLINE_PAGES/C231C231M.htm) your college should have copies of this or in the very least provide access (you may have to request it).

Check with your materials and test professor and/or the materials lab instructor. he will be able to get you up to speed. Might even be willing to talk with the researchers to see if they can't run you through the battery of concrete tests.

But it's not really any different (or shouldn't be) than the exercises you did on raw concrete testing in your materials lab.

if you can't find a materials prof, try the soils professor, usually materials/soils are lumped under the same roof in civil engineering.

if none of this works, try asking the head of civil engineer or his/her assistants. someone in that office should be able to point you in the right direction.

other resources, u-grad assistants in the materials lab and ASCE student chapter members, ITE student chapter or other groups. maybe the ""concrete design""  or other structures professor(s).

PS: just found my ACI tech workbook, which you get in the class or you can ~~view~~ buy on that ACI link. Current version is 12, i have version 2. From my tabs/highlights, the things i felt were most important were the various calcs and units for calculating the empirically measured values, as opposed to just reading the physically measured values from the other tests."

More likely, that it would allow a far left liberal to win.  The 2000 election was decided by 500 votes in one state.  Had it gone the other way, we'd have had President Gore.  Its hard to argue he would have done better.

Likewise in 2004, the alternative was John Kerry.  Given his foreign policy under Obama, I think it is safe to say that would have been a bad choice.

In 2008, we had McCain - who it was obvious was not a conservative even then, against Obama, who at the time was largely an unknown.  I voted for McCain, under protest, and I'm not sure it would have been better if he'd won.  He has since gone hard left.

So, I'm making a change, no matter how hard it will be, because I want to be in photos and not look ridiculous; I don't want my friends to say ""you're not fat"" in that patronising way which means ""you are fat, but I don't want to insult you""; I don't want to sit on the couch eating a chocolate bar and wanting to punish myself before I've even finished it; and I want to be able to run like I used to.

She doesn't necessarily deserve it, but give her one last shot to tell her husband herself. If she continues to be weak and cowardly, then you are free to tell him. I think this way you will avoid the stigma of betraying a friend's trust. But the husband deserves to know. "

Ok, I re-read your initial post, and I agree that there will be some cuts. I just don't think it will be that many, 10% maybe just because there really isn't a lot of cops only doing traffic stops. Which is the problem. You still have to have a certain number of officers to patrol a city, and normally traffic stops are only a part of the job.  Except for small towns who rely on traffic fines to even exist.  This might lead to more centralized policing.  That would be an interesting thing, as I think that would be more efficient. It might get rid of having police at city/county/state/federal levels and just have it at county/state/federal or even better would be only state/federal level. Which would be a better coverage and force a standardization of laws from city to city.

The sad truth is that she is playing with you and the other guy. I am sure he doesnt realize the extend of your relationship and is left in the dark too.

blaghart,AdviceAnimals,1389626945.0,"&gt;wanting church's to stop suggesting to their followers who to vote for is infringing on my right to freedom of religion.

Once again you completely misunderstand what freedom of religion means.  It means the government shall make no law with respect to any singular religion.  I have no problem with religion telling its members who to vote for as long as *religion is taxed as such* since *their agreement with the government to avoid being taxed hinges on not telling their followers who to vote for*

&gt;The fact that they have a page dedicated to government relations

Once again you continue to misconstrue what I said.  I said they have no involvement in government.  As in, unlike churches, they don't  fund independent advertising campaigns for bills or tell their members who to vote for.  To suggest that by stating ""no involvement in government"" I somehow meant that they existed outside the realm of government is moronic and reveals, when coupled with your mistaken belief that churches can somehow participate in government without contributing to government funding, that you are grasping at straws to try and justify something that I have unequivocally revealed to be against the law.

As to your links, A) *featuring the president* isn't illegal.  Just because your (*very* right leaning) columnist seems to think it's all political doesn't make it illegal to feature the president in a request for aid.  Also, while I disagree with lobbying by any non-profit, it's not illegal.  What **is** illegal for a non-profit to do is publically endorsing candidates (which churches have done but non profits like the red cross have not, and no, *featuring the goddam president is not endorsing him*) and funding independent ad campaigns endorsing legislation and candidates (which churches like the CLDS have done and non profits like the red cross have not)"

""Fair?"" How would the fairest option be anything but ""let people self-determine""? Why shouldn't we just be ""LaVeyans"" and not Satanists at all? There's no difference.

We are Satanists because we have a shared heritage, because we agree upon a certain symbol's prominence. That symbols carries all kinds of baggage about opposing Christianity and social norms, which we all tend to agree on, even if we agree on nothing else.

If an organization is extorting a lifetime fee from you for your eternal salvation, I'm of the opinion that you have a right to know what they do with that fee. Are they using it morally? Are they good stewards of the estate that they have been given?

When donating to a non-profit, not all are equal. Some use a small fraction for overhead and employee maintenence, and donate all the rest to the actual cause. Others are really, really bad. Why should I feel morally obligated to give money to an organization that is irresponsible with it?

COLDS used to publish their yearly financial record, but stopped. I know, *legally*, they're not required to, but I would hope that the One True Church would be as transparent as it could. 

Then, of course, you have the sticky issue that you have no actual guarantee that the tithing is being used appropriately. Is it being used to maintain a wardhouse in Guatemala, or is it being used for cattle ranches and $5 Billion downtown renovations? Is it being used in a Christ-like manner? You have no way to tell.

Other non-profits, religious and secular, regularly report their financial spreadsheets. Since COLDS has been much less than truthful about more minor things before, it would be nice to see some actual transparency and accountability."

Sentryy,babylon5,1389627663.0,"&gt; I know season 5 gets a lot of hate, but if B5 was allowed to continue it would be seen in a different light.

1. JMS had the story all planned right from the start and it was written for five seasons.
2. Then the network (ABC, right?) wasn't satisfied with the no. of viewers, so JMS had to compress everything into four seasons.
3. Viewer numbers suddenly improved and ABC then demanden an additional season to further milk the cow.
4. Since the carefully constructed story arc was already finished with season 4, JMS had to come up with something new for season 5
5. ""Sleeping in Light"" was filmed during season 4 and was meant to be the last episode of Babylon 5, but then season 5 had to be made and it was moved to the end of that season.

That's how I remember it from the good old days. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5#Writing) tells it a bit differently, but the important point is:

Babylon 5 has ""always been conceived as, fundamentally, a **five-year** story, a novel for television"".

It was never meant to run longer and that's why IMHO season 5 feels so out of place, because the main story was already over after season 4."

L1M3,elderscrollsonline,1389627850.0,"&gt;but a lot of the quests in TES actually give you a choice which have an impact. A choice to kill of certain persons, which then affects your quest line, the quests given, the story and a lot of other things.

This is not true AT ALL. Back in Morrowind days you could actually kill quest givers, and all that would happen is that it would now become impossible to finish the story. You couldn't find an alternate means because the individual stories are completely linear. But they even took that away. Now that they've made it so you cannot affect the story in ANY WAY. 

If you side with the Empire in the civil war storyline what happens? It would be cool if guards in Windhelm would kill you on sight but they don't. You can walk right up to Ulfric and wave your Empire loving hands in his face. 

Not even the main story quests has real options. You don't get the option to not go to the Thalmor embassy party. The guy who helps you invade the party can live or die and it doesn't change anything. You don't have an option to not capture a live dragon. And even after you kill Alduin, do dragons stop appearing? No, dragons keep coming at you for no reason.

The only thing that changes is how you have developed your character. You might pickpocket a key instead of fighting a guy because you're a thief instead of a warrior. In older TES games you could play as a mage, turn yourself invisible and use spells to unlock doors, but they took even that option away in Skyrim.

If you want a game that actually allows player choice, and it sounds like you need one, play Deus Ex.

&gt;Yeah, except the trademark of TSO is ""leveling an ability by doing it (or getting taught/reading books)"". You have books, but you don't really level anything by doing it, you mostly level it via quest exp, skill points etc - which is just a sad copy of other MMOs, yet again not TES.

Have you ever played an MMO before? Just the simple fact that you earn experience for some skills and not others depending on what skills are on your bar is drastically different from other mmos. No other mmo has had a system like this.

Yes, there are tradeoffs because the game is an MMO. You get experience for quests, which is a slight change from other TES games, that's a sacrifice for the game being made an mmo. The tradeoff is that there aren't any trainers. 

But questing is not the only way you get experience; in fact, it's not even the main method of gaining experience. You get just as much experience from kills, exploring, etc. 

Regarding the ""level skills as you use them"", think about this: in Skyrim, you get a tiny bit of experience in one-handed for each single hit with a one-handed weapon. By the time you kill an enemy you have accrued a fair bit of skill exp for your weapon. The same is true in ESO, it's just that you get all of that exp when the enemy dies instead of with each individual hit.

&gt;You should read the description when hovering over the exp bar of skills etc first. You get almost no experience from using a skill (except for professions which are a complete different thing here), you get huge amounts of exp for skills by simply completing quests and having skills in your action bar - which means you simply put 1 skill point into a bow skill, put it onto your skill bar and level it up without ever shooting a single arrow

I know how the skill system works, and better than you do, apparently. I tested exactly what you propose here: I put a point in the first bow skill, put that skill on my bars and then used another weapon (Fire staff, if you were curious). My bow skill did not go up. Class skill lines work the way you describe, to an extent, but weapon skills do not. However, while you can level a class skill line just by having a throwaway spell on your bar, you cannot do that for each individual spell. If you want to improve a spell then you have to use that spell, not just any other spell in the same skill line. Once again, this is radically different from any other mmo, and is very Elder Scrolls.

Also, you're complaining about skill points, but the perk trees in Skyrim are probably the reason this game has skill points at all.

&gt;Besides that, Skyrim almost had no class system. I could become a Jack of All trades, which would take a super long time

You just really don't know much about this game, huh? One class can do anything in ESO. Whether you are a tank, dps, or healer is dependent upon your armor and equipped weapon, and the armor and weapon skill lines are the same for each class. You don't have to make more than one character if you don't want to. Or, you could make two characters of the same class and level them completely differently to the point that they're unrecognizable.

This game is not a perfect copy of TES in an online space. Concessions had to be made for it to be an mmo. However, ESO is radically different from other mmos and stays true to the spirit of the Elder Scrolls."

It basically comes down to, the writers of the Creation book (and by extension the Writing Committee) think all's fair in love and war. They think it's perfectly acceptable to twist, mine, butcher quotes as long as the quotes end up supporting the writers' agenda. 

And regardless of the accuracy of the interview above, it's pretty obvious that this *would* be their stance. Ever since the Ray Franz fiasco where they basically abandoned the Aid book because the person/persons working on it actually had consciences, the Society would be extra-dilligent to make sure those working on the Writing Committee were Company Men through and through, willing to do whatever it takes to twist the truth into ""The Truth"".

jjness,Ingress,1389628240.0,"I'll post on my buddy's behalf: he and I ran the entire northeast corner of the state, seemingly, against a handful of car-less greens at lvls 2, 3, 4. He swapped without even telling me, the exact same day a new frog (who drives EVERYWHERE) decided to get to lvl 4 in one day and a few hundred miles, turning everything green.

That left me the sole Resistance for a week and a half. I quit playing. When he abandoned our team because he was sick of waiting a week and rebuilding naturally-decayed fields, I made sure he would be doing the same thing. 

Now, they (he and the other guy) have massive farm and I'm lucky to get 1 XMP on a hack. If I take out a portal, they are there to build it back up within an hour (no lie). I don't have the time and money to drive around like we did, hundreds of miles, without someone to split gas with. So now I just use passcodes and hack 100AP on my ways to and from work, and occasionally I'll take a portal. Just not much I can do anymore.

He tells me that he gets no cooperation at all from anybody on his side in the state. Everybody is suspicious of him being a dual-account holder (he's requested his Smurf account be deleted but it hasn't been yet) and a spy, so they won't work on him like we Resistance members used to work together before. He can't even get his friends (still at lvl 3, 4) to play more (weather and school gets in the way). 

Moral of the story: be careful when turncoating. My friend is on the verge of quitting or just being a rogue asshole and actively working against both factions because neither faction trusts him anymore."

Yours doesn't enter into it. You are not the median, nor are you the average. Your income doesn't count in this discussion.

But to address your other points: a) no one is forced to go to college; b) absolutely nobody believes that learning doesn't occur outside of college, matter of fact, one of the key concepts in college is ""lifelong learning,"" which is giving people the tools and motivation to continue their education after leaving college; c) again… only 30% of Americans age 25 and up have college educations… the vast majority do not have college educations.

Higher education is about being able to demonstrate that one has completed a program of higher education that has been assessed for effectiveness by an outside agency, and which may have additional certifications by different regulatory bodies. Higher education is also about exposing students to a variety of different general subjects in order to educate them as citizens. Can this be done on one's own? Of course? Can you prove that you've done it? Actually, you can. There are private firms that will evaluate bodies of knowledge for the purposes of awarding university credit.

Currently, college education is about a 60% handout and a bunch of guaranteed but inescapable loans. We could easily remove all handouts and keep the guaranteed loans and we would probably see no drop in college attendance. The economic benefits of a college education far far far outweigh any debt-related drawbacks."

It's just that scary age and I feel subconsciously that if I'm not married by then then I've failed at life and will be forever alone, yada yada. While I know that's probably not the case it doesn't feel that way to me, logical or not. My philosophy has always been to live my life the way I want it, and when I meet a guy I tell them very quickly that I'm not interested in having children and see how they react. 

Right now I have a boyfriend and he said he wasn't sure if he wanted kids. I told him be had better think about it long and hard because I was not going to stay in it for the long haul just to have him change his mind years down the road, and he told me that he'd rather have me than have kids. I've also mentioned to him that I am seriously considering having my tubes tied and asked him what he thought. He said I should do whatever I feel is best for me. So don't despair, there are men out there that will love you for *all* of you, including the fact you don't want children. I know that's not much help now, since you are probably wondering where he is, but just be honest with men you meet. If they react poorly to you not wanting children you can look at is as dodging a bullet. It really does happen when you least expect it, so love your life and you will find someone when the time is right :)"

The second part is the generation portion - the cost to actually generate the electricity that's being transferred over Ohio Edison's equipment.  At some point, either you chose First Energy as your electric supplier or you were automatically enrolled as part of a co-op in your city.

What I was trying to say however is that when you perform an action such as punching someone in the head, the act is aggressive and is exposing someone to an increased chance of death where there otherwise wouldn't be one. The chance of them dying is purely as a result of you being willing to take that risk. In any outcome harm was intended and death was possible(even if perhaps not likely).

This distinguishes it from something that may occur in the course of work, someone makes a desicion that may result in someone's death. Their death was never intended and was just an unfortunate result of probability. The action that was taken was never meant to cause harm, the chance of death was present and occurred but they were exposed to that risk by working there. 

I feel like that's a bad explanation but I'm not sure. Essentially by hitting someone he exposed them to an increased risk of death purely out of anger. While death may not have been seen as likely it was always an outcome and harm was always the intention."

This is definitely “group hug” material, and I may delete it after I post it anyway. Just needed to get it out, ya know?

I'm not one to get emotionally invested in much. In a previous life, I'm pretty sure I had some codependency issues. Nothing was clinically diagnosed (because I didn't go to a doctor about it), but some ninja Google skills combined with what I like to think is some pretty detached levelheadedness when trying to find root causes of issues (probably why I've fallen into the process improvement industry) got me to where I could say (as objectively as possible) that I might have this tendency.

For me, being a Panthers fan has been like dating a couple of my exes. We started out as friends or just hookups easily enough for any number of reasons, from common interests to common friends to some random series of events that just happened to bring us together and ""click."" More time and experience with each other developed stronger bonds that would lead to exclusivity, then the ""serious"" portion of long-term relationships where you start to think about a permanent future together.

I didn't play football growing up other than two weeks in junior high tryouts (I left because I was a tub of lard and didn't understand the concept of ""hell week""--too bad since I was already penciled in as the starting left guard, but I also probably wouldn't have lost half my bodyweight for wrestling, either, but I digress). My father was a casual Saints and post-Marino Dolphins fan; needless to say, there was no track record of NFL success or even interest in our household. I went to UNC Charlotte, which didn't have a football program at the time. All this to say: I wasn't much of a football fan until the Panthers came to town. I just happened to live in Charlotte, we got a team, and suddenly, the town buzzed like it did when I watched the Hornets at the first two Hives. I love Charlotte and never see myself living anywhere else (except maybe Chicago, but damn those winters), and this was going to be our team, and so the courtship started.

There was quick, early success and promises of a Super Bowl within the first ten years despite having a roster full of expansion draft cast-offs, a couple veterans with some worn tire tread, and a couple rookies. Yet, somehow, we beat the Cowboys in the playoffs in our second season. If there was one thing that wasn't allowed in our house growing up, for whatever reason, it was anything Cowboys-related. So, there was a spark, a glimmer that this relationship could be something special. We lost the NFC championship that game, but who cared? Two years in, and we were contenders.

For seven years, we waited for success again. The relationship was stagnant, even a little sour at times (1-15 anyone?), but we were always a couple plays, a couple players, a couple lucky breaks away from a turnaround. It was just close and tantalizing enough that you thought you could make it work, but if looked at from afar, the relationship was foundering. You stayed with it because it was easy, comfortable, and you knew what to expect. While we hoped (maybe silently begged) for success, we fully expected disappointment and distraction from the real issues at-hand. We pinned our hopes to flashy, trendy, and/or quick-fix ideas (Jason Peter, Chris Terry, Dwayne Jarrett, Armanti Edwards), and even we made a concerted effort to change the whole tone and feel of the relationship (George Seifert) when things were just stuck in a rut.

Ultimately, very little worked, and everything would regress to mediocrity at best. Oh sure, there were flashes of what could be: a Super Bowl run and another NFC title game sandwiching a “meh” 7-9 season, then a 12-4 playoff berth a couple years later with arguably one of the most likable rosters we’ve ever fielded, only to see one of the all-time faces of the franchise implode and never return to form. That Super Bowl team, though, was the hook for me (and, I imagine, for a lot of longer-time fans). Up to that point, we had an NFL team, and it was our team, and we had varying degrees of love for the team. I never questioned my support for the team, but that cast really solidified the relationship for me. They made it emotional. They made it permanent.

On the whole, the Panthers’ existence has been mired in being so-so with a couple really really bad seasons, a couple more really good seasons, and otherwise “meh,” but the Panthers are comfortable. We know what to expect at the baseline level, and if we do better than that, then we’ve overachieved for a nice feel-good ride until a return to form. To be fair, the NFL is brutal. Most teams live in So-So Land with relatively very few enjoying sustained success when compared to the entire field (very few suffer sustained disappointment as well). After that Super Bowl, though, I truly lived and died by the team’s success. I’m not saying I would get violent or ecstatic or anything, but my mood would definitely take a turn, and I had to work (successfully, as it turned out) to keep it in check.

Does anyone ever really, fully ""recover"" from codependency? I wonder if those with that tendency just learn to keep themselves away from situations where codependency can be triggered (this would explain my detachment from most serious dating opportunities over the years, those exes aside). With relationships, I am beyond lucky to be happily married to a woman I met in college and then lost contact with until a fluke reconnection a few years ago led us to where we are today. With the Panthers, though, they make me wonder if I will ever be “cured” of codependency. I do have an addictive personality, and it runs in my family (hell, my extended biological family could do a week-long run on Springer). I’ve dealt with bouts of video games, rum-and-Cokes, athletic training, dancing (no shit), and general gadgetry (computers, phones, audio equipment, etc). In those pursuits, I like to think I’ve reached a happy medium, though one or another will swell at times, and after a little placating of an urge (maybe I hit the Xbox a couple times a week for a while before the wife gets home from work rather than the usual 2-3 times a month), all returns to normal. The Panthers are healthier in a lot of ways than other addictions--all my Panthers-related expenditures (tickets, parking, tailgating, at-home party supplies, the HDTV on my patio) don’t hold a candle to those of a long-term-yet-ultimately-toxic dating relationship, so I got that going for my wallet, at least.

The long wait until training camp is starting to settle in. I’ll distract myself with home improvement projects, landscaping work, exercising, riding my Harley, spending time with friends, and nurturing my marriage (which is really Job One, to tell the truth, regardless of anything else in my life). I’ll eventually get over the feelings I have now, something like the very very very beginnings of the heartache from a lost relationship, which is really out-of-character for me when it comes to sports (and which prompted me to write this). I know to my fandom’s core that this was a great season for us, that we actually did overachieve in a lot of ways, and let’s face it: we only lost five games all season. FIVE. That last one really stung, but I also had the greatest in-person sporting event experience of my life so far (the last-minute win over the Saints at home). It will all be a great memory, and I’ll be able to say I was there to see the whole season, either in person, on TV, or on the radio. Certain songs or videos hit a little hard right now (I refuse to watch [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elNwbtX61xQ) again, even though the song keeps playing in my head), but time will heal this wound like it does all others, and I will be back for the 2014 season, hoping we build off this season’s work and set ourselves up for sustained success.

Granted, our track record following winning seasons is abysmal (never better than .500), but then, the Panthers are comfortable, often predictable (like a Mike Shula goal-line run), and we have a really-good-bordering-on-truly-great roster, especially in light of our financial situation. I will buy in. I will keep up with the draft (though not watch because, really, I couldn’t give a rip about other teams). I will track training camp reports. I will begrudgingly play fantasy football again (I did win my money league this year). I will tease myself with pre-season games. I will acknowledge the green-flag of the Thursday, September 4, 2014, “kickoff game.”

Then, on Sunday, September 7, we go back to football, a silly little game in the grand scheme of things, especially in light of the willful trauma it inflicts on the bodies that play it. If nothing else, Sam Mills should remind us of that, but then, for whatever reason, it’s become emotional, and so I will watch and expect mediocrity while inexplicably raising my cortisol levels in hopes of success yet again.

* Public/private minecraft server (averages 4-6 players at any point)
* Home file/media server
* Email server for several domains
* Any shenanigans I decide to whip up including torrents (for linux distros of course), IRC (irssi), among other stuff.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,Christianity,1389630567.0,"&gt;There is no Scripture that indicates the smallest part of the Law has changed. 

Read Galatians 3. There's so much truth that I can't even figure out how to summarize it for you! We are saved by grace, not by keeping of the law. The law was given to tide Israel over until the time that the Messiah came and redeemed us all. The law was not intended to be kept by us today. Here are a few of the most pertinent verses:

""19 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.

22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

23 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.""

Did you catch that? The law was given to bring mankind to Christ. It was our schoolmaster, our teacher. But now that Jesus died and we are saved by faith, we are no longer under the law.

In Matthew 5, Jesus was giving the people a new set of ""rules"", if I can put it that way, to follow. Keeping the law was all outward, but Jesus was shifting the focus from outward righteousness to inward righteousness as He taught the people. And then He said this:

""17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.""

When Jesus died and rose again, He fulfilled it all. Redemption was complete. Sin was paid for. The law was no longer needed because Jesus changed everything. Remember what He said on the cross? *It is finished*. And then the veil in the temple was ripped in half, from top to bottom - there was no longer a great divide between God and man, no longer a need for the sacrifices and offerings performed in the temple. Jesus fulfilled the law and it was not needed anymore.

Here are some other passages for you to read:

Luke 16:15-17

John 1:17

Acts 13:38,39

Acts 15 - this is the chapter where the Apostles held a council in response to Pharisees promoting the idea that you could not be saved unless you were circumcised - they determined that Gentile Christians (that would be me!) do not need to follow the law of the Old Testament.

Read Romans 2-10. It's a big read but it's all about law vs. grace and how we no longer need to follow the law. 

Read Galatians 2, paying close attention to the last half of the chapter.

Galatians 4 - 6.

Ephesians 2. 

Hebrews 7. A few verses from this chapter:

""If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.""

and:

""For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.""

Hebrews 10

The Bible is full of teachings and passages which expound at length the fact that we no longer need to keep the law. We are to live righteous lives, but not because God wants us to be legalistic or because it's how we curry His favour or enter heaven. We are to live righteous lives because we have been made righteous in Christ, through faith. We are to do it out of thankfulness to God for saving our souls. We are to do it because *it's just the right thing to do*. We have been saved from sin - why should we live in it, like a dog returning to its vomit? It isn't about keeping the law...it's about following the footsteps of Jesus, who was utterly without sin.

&gt;But, when after you find Christ as the answer to the question of, ""Who who cleanse me that I can appear before the Holy YHWH?"", you still have the question, ""Who will guide me Do that I can do what is right?"" The Holy Spirit is the answer to that, and He will never contradict Himself.

That's right. Jesus said that the spirit would lead us into all truth. You might be interested in Galatians 5:18 - ""But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."" The Spirit won't lead us to be under the law. 

&gt;The same Spirit should to Moses on Sinai,

Ah but that's an interesting question. How much of the law was given by God and how much was just Moses? Did you know that Jesus contradicted the law more than once? He was constantly being pestered with questions from the Pharisees, scribes, and teachers of the law. Many of his answers contradicted the law. At one point, when he was asked about divorce, he said this: ""Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so."" Think about the implications of that verse for a minute. When you go back and look for the verses in the Old Testament law, it is written as if God said it. But here, Jesus said that *Moses* allowed it and that it went against God's plan for mankind. That, to me, implies something subtle but earth-shaking: perhaps, just perhaps, what we regard as ""the law"" in the OT was not all from God. Maybe Moses had some leeway to make a body of laws for the people, laws that God didn't actually dictate. If God had given that particular command to Moses, why would Jesus now contradict it and say ""from the beginning these things were not so"", as if to say that Moses got it wrong? It's an interesting question, anyway.

AwhMan,ainbow,1389630586.0,"&gt;What if those people depend on those rights afforded through marriage? Would you deny them that based on a personal ideological opinion?

Yes. There are other ways to afford those rights and people shouldn't be given a prize for being/pretending to be monogamous for even the shortest amount of time. Everyone should have an equal chance. Hence the word equal.

Lluxx,actuallesbians,1389630779.0,"I'm with you on that. I get hit on by guys a lot in straight clubs and I'm generally very polite and friendly when I tell them that I'm a lesbian. Most guys are friendly in turn and apologise, to which I say it's no trouble and to have a good night. Some guys are bitter because quite a few straight girls will claim to be lesbians for an easy way to reject someone; those guys are the ones who might say for me to prove it. I just say I don't care about proving anything. It's only guys - and there aren't too many of them, but every now and then - who know I'm gay (generally friends of friends or whatever) and open up with an explicitly sexual comment about it that I'll be rude to in return. 

It seems like for you there's two types of people not getting it. I've definitely seen the 'Don't be ungrateful for being hit on; I'm never hit on' types before, but not just for lesbians. Straight women can be quite cruel to each other about it and I'm sure a guy that complains about unwanted attention gets dismissed in a similar way on occasion. I guess with low self esteem, they assume that any validation is good, when actually it can be intimidating or just plain awkward. If these people are so convinced they look awful and desperately want someone to tell them otherwise, it must be hard to imagine not giving a shit about Random Dude on the Street's opinion of you. 

The other guy, who just sees it as a compliment, probably is kind of similar in the not understanding that a lot of people just don't give a shit what strangers think of them and would rather not hear it. I'd explain it to him as you don't care if someone approves of your relationship; it's none of their business. But if he wants unsolicited compliments to be well-received then keeping them non-sexual is the best way to do it. I don't want to imagine somebody jacking off to thoughts of me later, so if he says 'You are such a cute/lovely/beautiful couple/person' I'll probably take that in a better way than being called sexy or hot or, heaven forbid, asked about threesomes or a man watching. It just sounds a lot more genuine and less like they want to get into my pants. 

If I was grumpy, I'd say that the people you're talking to aren't getting it because they can't imagine a world where not everybody requires validation from strangers and their opinions don't always matter. I'd like to be nice, though, and think that maybe they just have low self esteem or want to genuinely pay somebody a compliment, not realising that what they're saying will be taken in such an intrusive way.

Personally I'd prefer the AMD for a VM box, simply because of the higher core count (even if they're not 100% autonomous cores).

As far as longevity goes, LGA1150 *should* be around for the next architecture after Haswell. After that it's anybody's guess (I'd suspect a new socket). AM3+ would normally have been the better call, but with AMD announcing their withdrawal from performance desktop processors, my personal guess would be they drop the AM* line completely and move everything to an FM3.

- most likely, it doesn't harm you, sure, but it certainly isn't doing you any GOOD to walk through the scanner, and if you fly frequently there's a stronger case to be made for it hurting you.

- it does no good.  The TSA has failed to do anything to make flying safer.  There was a famous video where they were tested 11 times with plants purposely going through with bombs / guns / etc.  total weapons found?  Zero out of 11.  It's a charade.

- it is an admittedly small act of civil disobedience, and if enough people do it, perhaps the people in power will take notice.  Fun fact:  all it would take is maybe 50 people to simultaneously enter security and request a private screening to completely block the checkpoint, to the point where the AIRLINES would become upset.  Since our representative democracy has failed us (the majority of Americans hate the TSA and want it gone), if there's any hope in ending the TSA it rests in capitalism and lost revenue."

Basically like /u/22catch said, the brow shape is good but the colour intensity was a bit high. I also think they were just a little too ""clean"" so you can see there is some smudging/texture to suggest eyebrow hairs in the digital 'after.'

I also think with your redhead skewed palette, your neutral pink lip should have a lot more orange in it. The blue-pink is something you could swing if you were playing to it hard in your clothes (I think redheads in pink can be adorable) but for everyday, I find it a bit clashing.

L1M3,elderscrollsonline,1389632198.0,"Extending a release date is fairly normal, but once a company comes out and says a very specific date it becomes much harder to push it back. It's not impossible, but if it happens it carries some negative repercussions. 

When Ubisoft delayed Watch Dogs last year it was a huge news story and Ubisoft stock went down. People lost money. Companies will do a lot to avoid that. 

ESO is the first game for ZOS, the first Elder Scrolls game not made by Bethesda's main studio, and a highly anticipated mmo. Pushing the launch back doesn't just create doubts about the quality of the game but also makes the people in charge of the game look incompetent for publicly announcing a date they could not achieve. Also, since it is an mmo, delaying the game would probably cause problems with the schedule of setting up servers, or some other problems that wouldn't even occur to us.

It's not impossible for a delay to happen, but it would take a lot.

Lastly, keep in mind that the beta build we played this weekend is probably months old to them, and the build they're using for internal testing is surely weeks ahead in terms of bug fixes.

edit: I forgot to mention that the fact that there has not yet been an official pre-order announcement does make it slightly more possible that there could be a delay. Once they start taking official pre-orders, though, I think even a slight chance of a delay disappears."

princesskiki,aww,1389632694.0,"Yikes, that is not an easy mix for a first time dog.  That's a more advanced breed combination for sure.  You may want to enlist a professional trainer as soon as possible to help you figure out/evaluate any behavior problems he might have and to help you keep control over such a powerful breed combo.  

Boxers can be very energetic and boisterous or high strung.  Will need lots of exercise to keep that managed.  A tired dog is a well behaved dog.  Taking him on runs, really long walks, or possibly bike rides to wear him out daily will be a must.  

Pits can be very affectionate to humans and highly trainable but also tend to have dog aggression issues.  You'll want to wait quite a long time before attempting to take him to a dog park or letting him play freely with other dogs until you determine what his temperament is like.   

Since you're not starting with him as a puppy, you don't know what makes him ""tick"" yet.   That's the hardest part about adopting an adult (which is great, not saying that it isn't...just that it comes with it's own set of issues) is that you don't know how he was raised, what he has been exposed to, and how he will react.  You don't know what it looks like right before he is about to do something and you've got to be extra careful about exposing him to things that he may or may not like.  (Kids, dogs, cats, birds, rodents, loud noises, being left alone, thunder, dog parks, bicycles, skateboards, cars, etc.)

Best of luck :)  And I can't emphasize enough...lots of exercise will go a LONG way in making him the perfect pet.  Every episode of Cesar Milan's show begins with wearing the dog out because most of the problem dogs on the show are simply underexercised."

Pit_Sweat,explainlikeimfive,1389633026.0,"I know this is true of older nuclear weapons such as the ones used in WWII - I'm not sure if things are different now but it'll probably be similar even if it is:

Basically, enriched uranium stored in the bomb is bombarded which causes the atoms to split because it is inherently unstable. The splitting of the uranium shoots particles everywhere (kind of like a grenade) and this causes other atoms around it to split in the same manner. Multiply this by a huge number of atoms, and you get a very large chain reaction which releases massive amounts of energy.

The atom splitting is simpler than you think. In the WWII bombs, I believe they simply shot a bullet (inside the bomb) at the uranium. Because the uranium is unstable, it doesn't have to be some precise process. You just have to hit it with enough energy to trigger the reaction.

You are right in suggesting that uranium isn't the only element that can be used. But gold or lead would not work because they are stable, which is why lead bullets don't explode when you shoot them out of a gun."

Whenever it ends up back in treasury there's nothing to say, it's an irrelevantly small amount of  money to the federal government.

The original part could not keep the engine alive, the part from pick and pull gave the car what I called poor mans cruise control. It would randomly decide to maintain about 35 mph. After that we went to three different stores and asked about the part (we brought the pick and pull one in so they could see what we were talking about). All three auto parts stores handed us a part that looked just like ours only without the little rod so the part was essentially useless, and without the holes to mount it with, so the part didn't even fit on the damn car.

We had people from all three shops come out and look to verify they were giving us the wrong thing and none of them could explain it. So we resolved to sell the car. Which was a good idea because we doubled our money so I cant complain too much.

Edit: so prehaps if by box thing you plug into the alternator you mean the idler and the post recall part was just supposed to dangle there than prehaps we are indeed the fools lol. I guess it's not impossible.

Especially if you have *re-aggravated* the knee since your MRI.  You say it has collapsed more than once - any one of those could have resulted in further ligament damage.

sometimes MRIs are inconclusive and orthoscopic surgery (basically a camera probe into the joint) is needed to determine the source of the instability.

For PT, i would say work on bodyweight lunges and squats, work up from light leg press, stability work on an upside-down Bosu ball, and calf raises.  I've been through enough knee rehab to know that much.  But you really should get a second opinion from an orthopedic surgeon."

Mervint,europe,1389633743.0,"&gt; Jára Cimrman made extensive contributions to mankind, in all areas. He proposed the Panama Canal to the U.S. government, including a libretto for an opera of the same name. He reformed the school system in Galicia. With Count Zeppelin he constructed the first rigid airship using Swedish steel and Czech wicker (the wicker being for the cabin). He was deported from Germany as an anarchist, and his personal documents carried a note that he was ""a source of unrest."" This led the Swiss company Omega to offer him a job to improve the balance wheel for their Piccolo line of ladies' watches. (N.B. the Czech and German words for a watch's balance wheel (""nepokoj"", ""Unruhe"") mean ""unrest."") While in Switzerland, he introduced (and practised for some time) the profession of obstetrician, under the difficult Alpine conditions. He conducted investigations about the life of Arctic tribes who eat their fellows; and once, while running away from a furious tribe, he missed the North Pole by a mere seven meters.

&gt; In Paraguay he supposedly created the first puppet-show. In Vienna he established a school of criminology, music and ballet. He corresponded with G.B. Shaw for many years, but unfortunately the dogged Irishman never replied. He invented yogurt. He generously helped many great scientists: On his own back he carried 45 tubs of pitchblende to the basement of Mr. and Mrs. Curie, he assisted Prof. Burian with his first plastic surgery, he reworked the electrical contact on Edison's first lightbulb, and he found an underlease for Mr. Eiffel. He is the creator of the philosophy of Externism. Because of his enthusiasm for natural sciences, he discovered the monopole (as opposed to the then well known dipole), but this discovery fell into oblivion until it was confusedly revived by 20th century economists. He is also known for having advised Mendeleev, having seen the first draft, that the Periodic Table should be rotated to its current orientation. It is said that when Graham Bell had invented his telephone, he found in it 3 missed calls from Jára Cimrman.

Lluxx,actuallesbians,1389634055.0,"It's worth remembering that the vast, vast majority of people with a fetish that they identify with explicitly are respectful, polite and just won't bring it up unless asked or if they're sleeping with someone. For everyone you've found who's been disrespectful, there is a huge, silent majority who just don't bring it up with you at all, because it's not relevant. We have a fetish society at our university and I know quite a few people in it. They're all lovely, though, and very respectful and super enthusiastic about educating people about fetishes and safety, particularly the latter. 

A fetish is just 'a form of sexual desire in which gratification is linked to an abnormal degree to a particular object, item of clothing, part of the body, etc.' Try not to be uncomfortable with it because most people have things they like which fit into that definition to some extent and most of those people are quiet about it and - if they perceive it to be a big deal - may even struggle with the thought of their partner rejecting them for it. So even if I don't understand why they find whatever it is so attractive, I'll always be supportive as long as it's not hurting anyone or they're not being disrespectful.

I don't mind particularly if guys find lesbians hot, as long as they aren't always bringing it up. I've met girls that find gay men incredibly hot. Guys that find blondes hot, big boobs hot. Lesbians who are just as... open with telling me all about how attractive they find me when I didn't ask for their opinion either. Whatever; they like what they like. I just don't really want to hear about how I turn someone on unless I'm actually interested in turning them on. 

&gt; Being a lesbian isn't some hotness trump card that guys act like it is

I've encountered that kind of attitude before, split evenly with the 'You must be a hideous because you can't get a man'. I just force myself to repeat that people who say this are in the tiny minority and I don't need to trouble myself with them. 

It sucks that a few people can't just use their brain and a bit of empathy to realise that talking about your sexual desires without being asked is generally quite awkward for the other person, but there's always going to be a few bad apples in every group. The most we can do is try to explain it to them and if they still don't get it just leave them to wonder why they keep getting such negative reactions until they figure out maybe keeping quiet would sort this.

psychicsword,PoliticalDiscussion,1389634330.0,"There is no common sense welfare system sustainable or not. The way welfare interacts with the economy is so complex that even people who have PhDs in economics disagree on the best way of doing it. 

My personal opinion is that we should make the welfare system allow for movement more often to get the workers to the jobs. There are a few areas of the country right now that are desperate for workers but we have people who are currently stuck living where they are thanks to home ownership or other reasons. If we somehow were able to aid them in moving to a different location this would be beneficial for the people looking for jobs, the people looking for employees, and the states that the unemployed are currently living in. 

The other avenue is that we need to allow for more adult education and open up a form of grant to get people into trades given that we have the college education pretty well covered in regards to loans and grants. This is another area where there is a lot of demand but far less supply of workers. 

The final avenue of attack is to teach the children currently in school how to avoid ever becoming welfare dependent and setting up a structure that will prevent as many of them from slipping down the economic ladder as possible. Some of the problems that are causing the problems for adults actually started when they were just kids and we need to protect the next generation from the mistakes of their parents and society. If successful this will help reduce the next generation of adults' dependency on welfare. "

rednail64,jobs,1389634481.0,"&gt; What should I be doing to help me get to the point of making a decision

Stop taking tests for a while and instead focus on meeting as many new people as you can.  Set yourself a weekly goal of new contacts you're going to make, and of how many of those contacts you're going to convert into a coffee meeting or an [informational interview](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEMQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fshiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2008%2F01%2F29%2Fmastering-the-informational-interview%2F&amp;ei=OyPUUtPVFdW_sQTm3oLQCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXgBay_0zB2JBCmvNcXb9odPDCew&amp;sig2=8bhmNA492E1ab6tfshn3tw&amp;bvm=bv.59026428,d.cWc)

Don't set a ton of parameters up front for the people you are trying to meet - perhaps just focus on meeting people who are **happy in their jobs, successful, and great to be around**.

I have a feeling putting yourself around people who are fulfilled might help you discover your own needs, as well as help you to create a strong network of advisers and mentors.

Good luck!"

Welcome there.

Why NoFap is better ? If you have Porn Induced Erectile Dysfunction, the interrest is evident.

If you are addicted to porn and waste an incredible amount of time each day watching people fuck, you'll have more time to do interresting things with real people in the real world. Plus it will considerably change your way of seeing the world, and your relations to people (especially girls)

If you're not but masturbates regularly, you'll avoid to get caught in such an addiction, and have the satisfaction to know that your willpower is stronger than your body's urges.


There's a lot of other reasons, just read the people's story there. Everyone has its reasons. You also can explore the ""your brain on porn"" website. It's not science as there is no peer reviewed academic studies, but all this stuff seems legit.

About the ""how to"", same advice : read there, browse. Here are the key points for me, I guess many will agree

- FIRST AND MORE IMPORTANT : You don't change your life by fighting the past, but by building the future. Find something to do with the extra free time you have (the time you wasted Masturbating) : sports is often a good choice as it is soothening, endorphins helps to avoid relapses. Any artistic, creative, ... activity is good, and you'll be happy to learn something new.

- Take a badge : you'll want to see the number grow and not to reset it. Simple as fuck but efficient ! (right column)

- Meditation and/or prayer are an efficient help. It helps focusing and having a stronger willpower.

Enjoy your journey there, and feel free to ask anything. It won't be easy, but it's great.

PurelySmart,askscience,1389635031.0,"Type O blood is recessive as you said. If you have one of the A or B alleles, you get A or B blood (or AB, if you get both). But that doesn't mean they're common. In fact, if you've got a large majority of O, you'll tend to keep to be mostly O, which is the case in the human population.
 
The A and B alleles started off in some particular place (the A in Europe, and the B in western Asia).  It's only fairly recently that world-wide mixing of populations were able to spread these genes.

As populations mix, it will tend to decrease the amount of O blood out there, but not to a big extent. If a marriage has one OO person and one BO person, you'll get 50% BO children and 50% OO children. Eventually, the population will reach an equilibrium. Even though the B (or A) is dominant, the fact that most people have O limits the spread of the B allele.

In a few centuries when the A and B genes will spread more the O blood type will probably reach equilibrium at around 12% of the population having it.

As someone who works in marketing, I must admire cigarettes as a product. By now there's virtually no advertising for them, there's absolutely no intelligent reason to buy them, the only reason for buying them in the beginning being that other people are buying them.. It's a mind-bogglingly successful product yet even more a mind-bogglingly shitty product. Which just fortifies the conclusion that it's about addiction, not pleasure, no question about it. If it's a shit product, people aren't buying it because they want to. But because they're.. WE'RE addicted to it. Capitalism fails where addictive substances come into play.

EastBlackbird,lgbt,1389635961.0,"I understand what you are trying to say and agree completely. Reading once more what I wrote, I notice, for instance, that I failed to address the protagonists' personalities, which is an extremely valid complaint of yours. But, in a way, not addressing their peculiarities was a conscious decision of mine — I thought my post would become uncomfortably long, so I omitted that information.

Since you have shown interest in some very important aspects of what I am writing — aspects I failed to convey in my original post — I will further explain them.

First, the boys. One thing I did not say is that all characters in the book are, pretty much, talking animals. I decided to use this resource mostly because that would allow me to some more freedom in regards to not showing their genders. Because of characteristics of my language, they being animals allows me another layer of obscuring their genders. But, more noticeably, it gave some more characterization opportunities.

One of the boys, let's call him A, is a black panther, which is a very rare species in the setting of my story. That ties to his family origins — they are immigrants — and to their religious choices — they worship some orixás, gods of certain African religions. This boy, A, spent most of his childhood in relative isolation, because his mother, a lesbian, an immigrant, a follower of different beliefs, was not accepted in the local communities until the beginning of the story (they being accepted is the trigger for everything else.)

As a consequence, A often shows a sense of wonder towards the small things the city offers. He marvels at the sight of electrical lightning. And yet, his mother, a very capable fisher, has amassed in travels and sales many objects that A can only truly use once he moved to the city. He had some very old video games, but did not have the electricity to play them. He had a radio, but seldom had batteries to keep it functioning. So, in a way, A is owner of many nice things, but his family's isolation from society keeps him from truly using them.

And yet, A does not fully comprehend his and his mother's position as ""outcasts."" The world is the way it is and he lacks the maturity to analyze it. But, as the story progresses, he develops as character, begins to understand his mother's past, grows the skills necessary to defend his interests... He becomes less naive, more cynnical, and develops an active role in the story. This is going to be exposed mostly by his inner monologue. While he does not engage in discussions or fights to defend what he has, his very active attitude acts as deterrent from further hardships.

His personality ties, in some ways, with his species — a black panther. I'll not go into many details here, but suffice to say that is important to the story.


Now, the second boy, B. He is a puma. His family is closer to a traditional one — mother, father, sister. He grew in the small city where the story happens. So, his past is more akin to a traditional one.

And yet, he is far from normal. He seldom speaks. There was no traumatic event in his life, but he rarely utters a word. And, surprinsingly, his inner monologue tends to go towards a more poetic approach. While Boy A has a more dynamic narrative, Boy B likes to appreciate the moment, the silence, the wind blowing as the sun sets. This ties with certain aspects of puma's hunting habits — they rarely chase the prey, they'd rather hide and wait for it to pass by.

His main conflict in the story is growing out of this voluntary silence. He longs to reach out to people, but finds it difficult. His relationship with Boy A will reflect this — it will grow from silence to chit chat and, later, some few moments of somewhat intimate conversation.

I hope to have made it clear that the protagonists are very detailed characters. I am sorry I did not expose this in the original post. Your comment was extremely important in clearing this. Also, I recognize that the verb ""discuss"" in the name of this discussion was inappropriate. The story should not so much discuss the themes, it would be better to expose them.

If there is something you raised that I did not address, I would love to further explain it. Should it be the case, it was my distraction that kept me from giving more information."

no_real_username,AskMen,1389636111.0,"Before you tell him, try to convince your friend to own up. Remind her that he's probably going to find out anyway (either because of some indiscretion or other, or just because the child doesn't look like him -- or later on, when the child goes to the doctor for a blood test or whatever). With any luck you can convince her that it's better to admit this to her husband now than waiting until he finds out by himself. Even if she thinks she can keep it hidden from her husband, is she willing to lie to her own child for her entire life about something as fundamental as who their parents are?

Failing that, maybe just give her a plain ultimatum? Tell her that if she doesn't let her husband know, you will?

I would probably try to avoid tipping him off ""anonymously"" though. That's just more lies and secrecy to add to the pile. Just like your friend is going to be in trouble *when* (not if) her husband starts suspecting, it seems pretty likely that you're going to be in trouble *when* (not if) your friend learns that her husband suspects something is up.

Another angle is this: what do you want for them?
An anonymous tip or hint to the husband that ""your wife cheated on you, and is carrying someone else's baby"" is pretty much the most destructive way to break the news. If anything can ruin their marriage and hurt both of them, that is it. Is that what you want for them?

I you don't tell him at all, and keep the secret, then at least there's a *chance* they'll live happily ever after in blissful ignorance.
And if you make your friend own up, then there's a chance that they can repair the damage.
But If her husband finds out in any other way, either by you planting the seed of doubt, or by being tipped off in any other way, that's just going to add fuel to the fire. Not only was he cheated on, he had to find it out the hard way.

Won't it be better for them both (and for the child) if she admits her mistake? And if he hears the bad news from his own wife?

I don't envy your situation though. But it sounds like you're trying to do the right thing.

But IMO, imagine what's going to happen if the husband finds out on her own, or from someone else. That can only be worse than if his wife at least admits her mistake."

EmergencyTaco,leagueoflegends,1389636703.0,"Honestly I no longer have any real hopes for this game's longevity. I thoroughly enjoy it but Riot just isn't taking the necessary steps **FAST ENOUGH** to satisfy a community as large as this one has become. Their game is getting too big too fast and their inexperience is going to be their downfall. The game is getting too stale too fast and this can be rectified by: 

A: Increasing the rate at which new content is added to keep the game fresh. (Patches, Champions, Items, Game Modes.)  

B: Having constant responses to community concerns to reassure us that things are coming.  

C: Working to respond to the top requests in the community. It doesn't matter at all what they consider to be important. If the vast majority of the player base considers something else to be important then that is what's important. Provided there's no game-breaking things that they're ignoring they need to focus on improving things like the client, implementing the replay system and fixing graphical bugs and lag.  

Riot is doing some great things don't get me wrong, but I think they're focusing too much on the pro scene and not enough on the game, and therefore they're catering to ~1,000 of the 35 million people that play."

Additionally, with a species as evolved as mankind (and I don't necessarly mean how far we've evolved, but in what direction), living in the kind of environment that we live in, natural selection isn't solely a matter of genes anymore. Maybe that girl had great genes, being fertile, passing on a strong immune system to her offspring, and so on. Things that still mattered a lot just a few hundred years ago. And while they still matter to at least some degree today, other things matter as well if not more. Things that decide whether or not you are capable of surviving in this day and age.

princesskiki,aww,1389637641.0,"OP is a brand new dog owner.  She will learn as she goes.  I'm not sure why you're fighting so hard at the idea that she may not know everything about the dog yet.  Her dog may be obsessed with chasing skateboards but that isn't exactly something most dogs see everyday and she should be cautious when approaching new situations.

People don't just adopt/buy puppies because they're cute.  They want to shape what the dog becomes.  Puppies have their own set of challenges (like potty training) but you end up with a pet that you shaped and created yourself.   Adult dogs are much easier IF they were brought up somewhat decently.  And we certainly hope, for OPs sake, that is the case.  

Uh sure...yes adopting an adult will tell you what size they'll be.   I guess one of the downsides of adopting/buying a puppy is that you don't know exactly to the lb how big it will be.  heh.  Maybe one day they'll find a way to predict how large a puppy will be.  I don't want to accidentally end up with a 50 pound chihuahua who only weighed 4 pounds when I adopted him.  Such a big risk.

EastBlackbird,lgbt,1389637844.0,"I don't really plan to put them in any adult situation regarding their relationship. What you said is very important.

The most explicit intimacy they will have is holding hands and some personal dialogue. For the greater part of the book, their most intimate conversations will be around their favorite colors. But I have some ideas to convey their closeness. An important part of the story is going to be about them playing some old games, and when they get to play some RPGs where all the characters are renameable, they will give their own names to the ""main couple"" of each game. But they do so without fully understanding this because none of these games are in languages they know. Also, they will often misname characters (when playing ""Zelda,"" they'll call the main character Zelda instead of Link and will believe he is a girl because he seems to have purple hair in the specific game.)

Also, the story is not narrated in the present. The main characters are retelling them to a nondescript listener, so they add some comments about what would happen much later. This helps a bit. Also, I find it is important to reiterate that, for the greater part of the book, the reader has no idea that main characters are boys. It is left intentionally vague so the reader can choose what to believe until the point where the main characters go through sufficient character development."

I wasn't there alone, there were several thousand people in attendance, all of whom were more entertained by that show than the last one that WWE had put on at The Air Canada Centre. What has happened since is that while the performances and writing have not gotten to the point of the Rock n Wrestling or Attitude eras in WWE, they've gotten a lot better. Their product got a ton better, and since then, TNA's has only gotten worse, especially (and shockingly) after Russo left. The TNA midcard and knockouts divisions, which were what was actually drawing money, got completely de-emphasized post-Russo, and I'm not a guy who sings his praises easily. The fact remains however that after he left, whatever business they were still doing, got even worse., and instead of upping their game to an emboldened and refreshed WWE, they regressed, and gave the fans watching at home and in those arenas, absolutely nothing to cheer for and nothing new and interesting to look at."

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389638320.0,"First, it's not really a quirk of translation, but it's possible that the word for ""honey"" refers to date honey, not that of bees.  Many references in the bible unambiguously involve bees, but other Semitic languages use the same word for both types^1 .  Additionally, later Jewish texts (the Talmud) seem to think that bees don't make honey, they collect it, so perhaps regular honey and date honey would've been thought to have been the same substance^2 .

Anyway, both items are used in the bible in other idioms.  Honey is often used as an idiomatic ""sweet thing""^3 .  Milk is somewhat less common idiomatically, but represent a generally tasty beverage whose abundance is symbolic of general bounty even when not paired with honey^4 .  Together, using these two foods as the representation of a land that's rich makes sense given use of two as idiomatic foods.

Sources:

It's cultural homophobia. Societal. ""That's so gay, stop being a fag, etc."" That these are common insults used without thought is a clue to how deeply ingrained homophobia is in our society. We're so used to using gay slurs that we don't even think about it anymore. Ditto for gendered insults like ""bitch"" or ""cunt.""

ThatCrankyGuy,AskTechnology,1389638904.0,"An OS is only as secure as the user operating it is smart.

If you run a Trojan on OSX, you'll find it becomes susceptible to the same weaknesses.

Having said that OSX has the BSD privilege escalation model, which requires a root/sudo'er-group member's password without which writing to certain places on the filesystem is forbidden.

Windows has a similar escalation model now, it is called the User Account Control (UAC) -- this is the pop up that shows up when you try to install some software, asking you whether you want to allow a particular software to escalate and perform installations and file modifications.

Windows, since version 7, has really improved the areas of infectious control. Behind the scenes, a lot has been done to ensure static injections attacks cannot succeed. Security has been made more tighter and convenient as the versions of Windows have incremented -- version 8.1 being the most secure and stable.

As the threat of infection has subsided, virus makers have turned to social engineer to get at your data. This is where viruses infections happen by tricking the user to install a piece of malware. And as I said before, the security of a system rests on the user's shoulders. Does not matter what OS you use, if you install something, then you could be using openbsd (one of the most securest and stable OS in the world) for all that matters and you could still end up fucking your system up.

Because Window still drives a very high percentage of the desktop market, virus makers still focus on it (again for social engineer). However as the usage of Mac laptops increases, we're now seeing [Trojans and worms](http://www.kaspersky.com/about/press/major_malware_outbreaks/flashback-mac) for them too. Most of these vulnerabilities don't exist in the OS itself, but rather the software that run on the OS. Java runs on a lot of devices and it was the main cause of infections in Macs this recent past. This is similar to Windows where the platform's conveniences are exploited by applications for malice.

In the past people would download screen savers and other crapware which would be riddled with toolbars and other grotesque things that would clog up the system. This would be the same on Macs unfortunately. Think about it like this: if someone wants to download a pretty screen saver, and once downloaded the installer wishes to escalate privileges, a casual user doesn't care why a screen saver needs root privs, they just go ahead and type in the password and a way we go -- infection everywhere.

Because bulk of the users are using Windows and because bulk of users are complete morons we always hear horror stories about how Windows is a pile of insecure filth. MS has put in a good effort to curb random infections that users have no control over (running high risk processes in isolations, shadow files, memory randomizers, etc, etc) but there's only so much that can be done without inconveniencing the user. the UAC itself was such a pain to people that they started clicking ""yes"" to everything, defeating the purpose of, well escalation confirmation. MS had to rework that too.

Having said that, the BSD privilege model is very simple and that's where its strength lies. SELinux goes beyond that and introduces finer level controls for ACL (because when you're running a server you want even more secure controls everywhere). Windows 7/8 have caught up to the security model and if you have 8.1 you're pretty much as safe on here as you are on OSX. The key is not to mess about with ""download this cool software in order to watch pirated movies streamed"" and avoid all sort of pirate software/media -- crackers aren't all good people. Some one those softwares can have nasty secret payloads.

So in short, OSX has been safe because of the BSD escalation model, and the lack of screen saver apps, as well as lack of software that can be pirated. 

Incidentally this is exactly why Android now needs a virus scanner - it is the windows 98 of mobile world."

Renner1,worldnews,1389639221.0,"&gt;  Do you think it's acceptable to physically assault someone for expressing their homosexuality in a loud or flashy manner?

Not especially, but out of the ""list of bad things the Putinites are doing in Russia right now"", this ranks pretty low as far as I'm concerned.

I also factor in that there's a quick fix to this one in the short term, and also the disturbing fact that foreign ""radical queers"" wouldn't give a shit if all of the ""evil"" Russians who were wierded out by militant LGBT movements collectively died off.

&gt; Yes, it might be wise to keep your sexuality a secret if you live in a country where homosexuality is a crime

Acting like a grotesque flamboyant cross-dressing buffoon is a crime there.

Again, I'll say that the best way for the LGBTs to gain ground is to lose the ludicrous flamboyancy and the attitude of ""if you don't want to see all my antics, then you must be a bigot""."

why do you find yourself needing this technicians licences? i got mine and it helped me land a position as a ugrad research/lab assistant, but once i got my job (state dot, desk job) i no longer needed it, and once i got my PE it became irrelevant.

Seems to me that you must oversee or train technicians that do this work regularly, if i had to guess. So what do you do and why do you need it?

cluberti,sysadmin,1389639264.0,"Not true - updates are not installed to the image when you push them as MSUs via DISM offline, they're ""staged"".  They're actually installed when the machine first boots, which can actually take longer than installing them while running.  The tradeoff is slightly smaller disk space being used, but when you're patching Windows, Office, .NET runtimes, etc. it's better to install the base products first (including any updates to IE versions) in the task sequence, then use WSUS to push the patches via the built-in pre and post-application install update steps.

Speaking from experience, trying to have the offline PE image figure out which updates to install (versus the WU agent in a running OS) ends up, eventually, blowing up entirely and causing issues such as this.

I pre-install updates like [2775511](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2775511) (and subsequent updates to [resolve](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2728738) [issues](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2732673) [with](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2878378) it), [VDI hotfixes](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20893.windows-7-vdi-image-hot-fixes.aspx), and [IE update prerequisites](http://www.cluberti.com/blog/2013/08/19/installing-ie10-into-your-windows-7-image-youre-missing-an-update-or-two/) into the base image, but never security-related updates.  Everything else happens during image creation via the inbox WU steps in the standard client task sequence, and this task sequence is executed quarterly to make sure the image is being rebuilt and patched every 3 months or so."

PokesHoleInCondoms,TheRedPill,1389639538.0,"It's a self-selecting group that goes for those guys which is why you get these reports of abundance back from expats.

The girls typically don't want anything to do with non-Chinese guys and the few girls who are adventurous enough to venture out of that dating circle still mostly end up with other Asians (Koreans or American born mostly.) 

It's honestly a major warning sign if the girl is insulting their own men like that. Remember that in a population of millions, there's going to be a wide variance of personalities and looks. If she can't tolerate men across that spectrum, then it makes her the only constant in the story. With girls like that, it's best to tread lightly.

MaeBeWeird,BabyBumps,1389639549.0,"The bleeding has nothing to do with your chances of it correcting itself, the bleeding is because placenta facing out away from baby is pretty much just blood in and out, when part of that is over the cervix, which is just a ""hole"", the blood is able to come out. This can happen from a complete previa, partial previa or even a near previa where the edge of the placenta is still close enough to the cervical OS (opening) to bleed out.

The chances of it correcting itself has to do with other factors, such as exact position (which you cannot guess by the amount of bleeding, any part of the placenta can cause bleeding, as all parts let blood in and out, not just the center, it's a blood transferring organ), whether or not you are a smoker (smoking lowers your chance of it correcting itself. I do not know why. This is just the info available) and whether or not you have had a c-section or placenta issues or other uterine damage from a past pregnancy.

Many more women start pregnancy with previa than end pregnancy with it. This is why the people who have the factors that can prohibit it from moving up (such as uterine damage) are at higher risk of having previa at birth, than other women who it moves up just fine for."

BadVogonPoet,AskReddit,1389639691.0,"I think the biggest things are how I value time and relationships. Sometimes the two overlap. 

When I was younger, I was so eager for people to accept and include me that I ignored signs that they kept me around for comedic reasons or that I was forcing friendships where there really wasn't a basis for one. I also kept everyone in my life, regardless of the negativity they brought to it. Now, I'm much more confident in myself and am selective about the people I allow into my life. I don't waste my precious time or energy trying to rationalize people's negativity anymore. I'm happy to give them chances and try to support them but some people simply aren't worth the little time that I have. Those people don't get to be a part of my life. I'm much better off both socially and mentally for being able to cut negative people from my life. 

Time wise, I'm so much more aware of how little time I really have to make an impact on the world. It's made me refocus my efforts on being a good person and helping other people as much as I can. I have a new appreciation for spending time with the people I care about and actively schedule one on one time with people so we can maintain our relationship. When I was younger, I was always quick to reschedule dinner or an outing when something ""more fun"" came up. Now that one on one time takes priority. "

* In my junior year of high school, I shadowed two NASA employees.

* In senior year, I did an after-school program that met once each week.  We learned about different computer-related tech stuff, robotics, etc.

* I did really well in high school and was involved in lots of things.  This was also really helpful in terms of scholarships.

* Went to college (Go Bucks!) for computer science, got involved in a few things (band! but not the marching band, because I play tenor sax) and did as well as possible in classes. I applied for NASA internships every summer.  You should apply at NASA and everywhere else you can.

* Finally got an internship!  Worked hard and got the internship the next two summers, including winter breaks in between.

* Applied for a co-op at the end of my first internship.  There were budget issues so I had to extend college a bit, but it was worth it.  Finally got the internship.

*  Did 16 weeks of the internship then was hired full-time.

NASA likes to keep people in their ""educational pipeline"".  The earlier you get in the pipeline, the better off you are.  Apply for all internships you can - other internships look great on your NASA application.

He doesn't give a shit about how you feel, either, so why would you? Don't take part in this whole powerplay shit. He shouldn't be able to control you.

If you want to bring your boyfriend over into your room, do so. What does your roommate care about your boyfriend in your room? It's your room, he has his own, he shouldn't fucking care about whoever is in *your* room. If he knocks on your door again, I'd personally(!) go up to him, listen to what he wants, and if it's anything into the direction of ""Please throw out your boyfriend"", just answer ""not gonna happen"" and close the door again and ignore him(although I liked your approach of inviting him into the room, too). Have you told him to stop knocking after you didn't come out? What was his reaction?

If you tell him you're going over to your boyfriend and he reacts angry, just ignore him. Don't argue with him, don't look at him, just leave(oh, and lock your room before you leave, obviously).

Basically, just start ignoring him every time he gets angry about your boyfriend. If this doesn't work, I'd recommend you to just ignore him completely, like others have said. If he asks you something, don't react, if he tells you something, don't react. No interaction at all.

Last but not least, I'd be interested in whether you've talked to your other roommates about this? Do they know about the situation(at least roughly?)? I can't imagine them just being okay with his behaviour if he's really that angry and petty about shit. Getting your roommates to talk some sense into him might work, too.

If you are feeling faint to the point of nausea, a headache, or passing out, you should see a doctor before continuing.

I have vasovagal syncope which makes me prone to passing out if I don't have proper nutrition, hydration, or I am in a very rapid spinning situation. I combat this at the gym by staying hydrated with G2 so that I get sodium which helps me stay more hydrated for longer and gives me B vitamins and potassium to keep my energy and strength from dissipating too quickly."

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389640077.0,"Well the government can and should be directly creating jobs - basically hire people to repair infrastructure that is long past due for upgrades.  But that would require more government spending, (which would be good) but guess who objects to that?  Republicans, and anyone who is confused  as to  the actual economic situation.  

And even then, it doesn't really make sense for the government to be hiring people to do a lot of things.  Yes, sure, the government could and probably should hire more teachers, more construction workers, more bank regulators and some things like that.  But the government probably shouldn't decide it wants to build a semiconductor foundry or an operating system company or an aircraft maker.  Other countries have done that, and done so successfully, but they've  usually done so when the private sector wasn't getting its act together, not in competition with their own businesses. 

With middle class unemployment you really need to ask why there aren't jobs?  Well, largely it's because there aren't jobs.  Wait, what?  It's a feedback loop.  Without demand for services no one is hiring, and since no one is hiring there's no one with the money to demand services.  Seems problematic.  Eventually (and the US is starting to enter this now) enough stuff gets old/damaged/ etc that  people who have money need to spend it, and the economy slowly recovers.  

Minimum wage is more of a coping strategy for everything  else, and it doesn't come off the US government balance sheet so it's something people think they can get political traction on.  


&gt;How does raising min wage not hurt everyone else that is currently making more than min wage due to inflation?

The US minimum wage is what, 7.25 an hour or something.  A bottom tier delivery driver makes about 20k a year (which is basically no skill other than being able to drive).  So as long as the minimum wage doesn't exceed 20k a year there need not be upward pressure on any other wages.   Basically pushing up the minimum wage squishes jobs together.  If you make the minimum wage 12 or 15 dollars an hour well then fast food, delivery driver, construction work etc would all end up at  roughly the same price band.  But the guy making 40 or 50 dollars an hour isn't going to care. 

Raising the minimum wage can actually create employment because the people who  make that money have more to spend, and will spend it, thereby employing more people.  As much as people complain  about 'everything' being made  in china, the vast majority of ones expenses end up being local, House, car, food, point of sale costs on all the other stuff, most spending is actually within ones own country (at least if you're in the US or Europe or Japan).   

&gt;The complaint seems to be that no one can live on min wage,  isn't the root cause the lack of middle class living wage jobs?

Related but separate issues.  If you think people working minimum wage jobs should be independent (which for a long time was not the case, minimum wage was more aimed at students and part time workers) then the minimum wage  needs to support that.  

The lack of middle class jobs, yes, it's pushing some people who should be independent down into the minimum wage bracket, but there are also now, particularly in the US, a large collection of people who have essentially no  skills and have 'finished' all of their education who need to live on whatever minimum wage will pay, likely for their entire lives.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept getting confused and asking what the hell he was supposed to do, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any jontron infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

Edgar_Allan_Rich,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1389640348.0,"There is one fundamental rule that must be kept in mind when embarking upon any career: If making money is a requirement for success and you want to have the best chance to succeed, you must treat the endeavor as a business endeavor above all else; otherwise your fate is 100% out of your control.

The bottom line is MONEY. Lots of people have a passion for something so they decide to do it as a career without understanding how to make money. They'll go broke diving in without having figured out how to recoup their expenses, how to feed themselves, or to make a profit. Many don't even know what they are offering to the people who they are hoping to extract money from. I did it. Three times. Three failed music careers, plus a 4th which I gave up because I didn't like it. If you haven't crunched the numbers and figured out how you are going to make and spend money, you are relying on handouts and luck and nothing more. That's a bad position to be in.

It's a career. Not a lifestyle. The goal is to have a good career which defines your lifestyle. I probably sound like your dad right now, but my dad was right and so am I. Trust us. You will get old. You will get sick. You will get tired. You will want the option to stop being a poor person eventually. If you don't believe me then you're a delusional asshole and none of this advice is for you because you're destined to fail anyway. But I believe in you because you're asking the right questions.

You sound exactly like me when I was 20. You haven't been specific about what role you want to fill in the industry, so the odds are against you that you will fail. You really want this though, so here we are. You are probably hoping to just shotgun talent out into the world until one day you are magically handed an opportunity, but that is not how the world works. The world doesn't give two shits about you and there are 500 other people out there exactly like you doing the exact same things. That's called a buyer's market, and it's tough to sell yourself with all those other options out there. Even if you are magically granted a career in this situation, you will fail in the long run without plan on how to stay relevant and valuable. 

How do you stay relevant and valuable? You have to know what you have to offer and how much it is worth. That's the beautiful thing about *business:* the same principals apply whether you are selling music, drugs, or vacuum cleaners. If you want to sell piano playing services for weddings then figure the rest out. If you want to sell songs to pop stars then crunch the numbers and read up on that. There are a million *things* you can sell, be they services or products. Pick one and be the best person in the world at creating that product or providing that service. Was Miles Davis known for being a painter? Fuck no he wasn't. He was known as a trumpet player. The best fucking trumpet player ever. His paintings and his chili recipe are amazing though!



The media loves to convince us that stars are born from hard work and that the best (and only) jobs are those with celebrity status. In reality, most of the money is made in their wake by lawyers and publishers and a huge collective of thousands of minimum-wage office workers. That's called ""the long tail effect"". These people have their jobs because of hard work and long-term business goals. They reach their goals by acting like adults, not like rock stars. But they have fun too, which leads me to my last point.

The unique thing about the music industry is that a lot of fun can be had along the way, and that's why it's so hard to break in. It's an industry surrounded by fucktards who think its all play and no work. Almost everyone in and around the music industry is a total fucktard, and fucktards are not self-aware. Chances are, you are a fucktard and the only cure for it is to realize you are a fucktard! So why does this matter? If you can convince hundreds of fucktards that you aren't a fucktard then you're in. Fucktards and non-fucktards to it all the time, but people-skills are required. Learn. People. Skills.

TL;DR: Be business-minded, patient, smart, reliable, social, and personable. If you do this your long-term chances go through the roof. Educate yourself as much as possible for as little money as possible, and work towards having something specific and definitive to offer. I also highly suggest reading the book ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" to anyone who wants to succeed in life.

Good luck

Sort of like some feminist came up with the ""ethics of care"" when women didn't do well on the moral tests of the 60s. 

It's relatively recent and substantial disagreement exists regarding the definition of EI, with respect to both terminology and operationalizations, according to wikipedia.

Furthermore, I don't think TRP and EI researchers mean the same thing when they talk of emotional intelligence. TRP means mostly ""controlling/repressing one's emotions when acting/making decisions"" and EI researchers mean ""social skills, ability to read and express emotions, empathy, etc""."

This is also one of those issues most people only discuss with people who already agree with them, leading to an increased perception that everybody here is pro-choice.

I'm personally pro-life but politically pro-choice, which means that I think abortion is wrong but ought to be available as an option. I'm in favor of increasing sex education and access to birth control because I believe those things decrease abortions, and I think we need better safety nets and options for expectant and new mothers (which can include access to high-quality adoption services if that's what the mother chooses). I think outlawing abortion has dangerous consequences, though. I'm also ideologically comfortable with the idea that the mother's body takes priority, especially before the fetus is viable and can live on its own (which is when most elective abortions take place anyway), which means it's her choice whether to be pregnant or not - I just don't happen to think it's a choice people should make outside of certain circumstances like rape, incest, medical reasons, etc.

So I don't really know which label to choose, as I tend to have some sympathies on both sides and lots of extremes that I don't want associated with myself."

CadHuevFacial,AskReddit,1389640994.0,"In our society, women are generally conditioned to believe that men will think they are 'crazy', 'clingy', 'overly-emotional', or 'unstable' if they display heightened emotions. By default, the societal standard of what is considered to be an ""acceptable level of emotional display"" widely mirrors the typically male style of emotional display, that is, as little emotion as possible. The thing is, intense emotion is *a perfectly human characteristic*, but it is not respected as much as cold logic in patriarchal societies (anger being the exception) because emotional attributes tend to be acceptable only among women, or feminine men (and 'feminine'/feminine adjectives like weak are the worst things a man in our society can be called).


Anyway, we've learned that we will be taken less seriously when we are 'emotional' or when we talk about our feelings, even though emotions are weaved through all of our experiences. Oftentimes it seems as though any less-than-ideal (by societal standards) emotion displayed by a woman is immediately dismissed by men as proof that the woman is crazy or unstable, thereby relinquishing any responsibility by the man making the claim. It is infinitely infuriating to try as calmly as possible to talk about why I'm upset and have my feelings all but completely ignored because I'm 'not thinking logically'. Well, emotions are not logical, but just because emotions are not logical *does not mean emotions are irrational*. When I'm upset, my biggest concern is communicating why I am upset, and it is totally unnerving to be met by a counter-effort meant to convince me that my *emotional* feelings are valued secondarily to the other party's *logical* disagreement regarding those very emotions.


As unreasonable as it is for anyone's emotions to be dismissed as unimportant, women are constantly tiptoeing around which feelings and qualms are and are not worth disclosing (to men particularly) at the risk of being dismissed as unreasonable and unworthy of consideration. 

I sometimes need a long while to ruminate over why I feel what I do when I'm upset as a result of something my SO has done. I then need to decide whether or not I am overreacting or overstepping my boundaries when commenting on my emotions, and if I come to the conclusion that I'd like to share what I feel, I finally have to plan out the most effective way of communicating that feeling in language that will do justice to what I'm trying to say while respecting my SO. This is why I personally tend to say ""I'm fine"" in regards to pettier annoyances before disclosing the real extent of my frustrations later. When something serious has happened, there is no mulling over whether or not I should share what I'm feeling, I just do (still as effectively as I can under the circumstance). 

If women and their emotions were met with sincere concern and consideration instead of disinterest and blame, we would probably feel more comfortable in knowing we'll actually be listened to instead of lectured or later described as hyperbolically unreasonable. "

Renner1,worldnews,1389641173.0,"&gt; The Neo-Nazis in Russia are causing a lot of problems. I don't really rank the problems in order of severity, because anytime people are being physically assaulted, that's wrong. 

Ethnocidal thugs trying to murder people is a lot worse then the riot police beating up transsexuals or lispers, in my opinion.

At least the authorities have the presence of mind to go after the neo-nazis when they try to pull off something ultra-violent.

&gt; Some gay rights activists are kind of xenophobic. They assume that because Russia passes a homophobic law, the whole country is full of bigots. In reality, Russia doesn't have truly free elections, so you can't blame all Russians for the actions of Putin.

Or they think anyone who doesn't want to see a bunch of dicks waving around and hear a lot of inane screeching is malevolent and bigoted in general. They are pretty xenophobic, too, and they're one of the groups that's allowed to get away with it.

&gt; It might be a crime in Russia, but it is considered a human right. Freedom of expression has to extend to everyone, even the forms of expression you don't like. 

Here it comes into the reason why I labelled myself as a partial fascist, at least on the propaganda posters sub.

In this regard, I just find militant LGBTism to be extremely obnoxious, distasteful, and actually very counterproductive to one of the main stated goals of the movement-- to completely normalize their sexuality in society.

&gt; I think in Russia, their best strategy is to work quietly and secretly, and figure out a way to get someone other than Putin and United Russia elected. And they have to form a coalition with other groups suppressed by United Russia. If they had a leadership that cared more about human rights, they could have more gay rights legislation passed.

They could. And they could show the Russian people in general that they weren't characterized by surreal fairground freaks as well."

The past historical oppression of non whites, gays, and women continues to resonate in our culture. Institutionalized sexism, racism, and homophobia didn't magically disappear when women got the vote or the slaves were freed. 

There is a famous study known as the Clark Doll experiment. In it, white and black children are given white and black dolls and are asked which ones are ""good"" and which ones are ""bad."" Both a majority of white and black children categorized the black doll as bad and the white doll as good and nice, even when the experiment was conducted again in 2005. Are these kids racist? Where did they learn this? 

You also have the luxury of not having your sexuality be important to you, in part because while you identify as straight with bisexual tenancies, your heterosexuality is the ""norm."" The ""default."" You've probably had to defend your bisexuality, as a lot of people don't believe that bisexuality even exists. People who are gay are not defined solely by their sexuality, but their sexuality is a large and important part of their identity, in part because of how our society views and treats gays. Such as using ""faggot"" as a casual insult.

Additionally, why is being politically correct an insult? It's a bad thing to be considerate of others, especially whose society has always treated like shit?"

I worked in the ER for years, and the amount of  pain and suffering I've seen from young girls with clearly ""pro-life"" parents is heartbreaking.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389641340.0,"Germania - the roman (Latin) name for roughly the area that became the Holy Roman Empire that was destroyed by Napoleon and then became the German Empire in 1871. 

Basically, when we discover or name a place we try and get the name into whatever our language was at the time - and remember the language of Civilized people was either French or Latin for centuries, so a lot of French and Latin have crept into english over the years. 

Over time how we say words changes, (sometimes), what a country calls itself changes, and English never bothered to keep up.

Take for example Korea  - which is illustrative because it was actually discovered by europeans at a discrete point, unlike Germany which has just  kind of always been there. 

Marco Polo (the explorer) heard the name for Korea from the Chinese, who were talking about a specific Kingdom  named something that sounded kind of like the word Korea, and that Kingdom controlled most of the peninsula.  Since then Marco Polo's  writings as well as Persian transcriptions from the same period ended up in England, and the english tried to figure out how to pronounce the ~~portugese~~ italian words they were reading, as they would have in 1600's English (Marco Polo having been from the 1300's).  And came up with something which has morphed into the word Korea.  North and  south Korea have their own words - Choson in the DPRK and Hanguk in the south, Choson  refers to the country of North Korea, Hanguk refers to the Korean penninsula.  So  400 years ago some kingdom with a name that when written in ~~Portuguese~~ Italian seemed to become something  that kinda sounded  like ""Korea"" in  17th century English entered the language, by the 19th century, when British and Americans were  dealing with Korea and Korea  as a puppet of Japan the name had already stuck.  Even though the relevant Kingdom has been gone since 1374.

So 700 years ago a  ~~Portuguese~~ Italian guy talked to a Chinese guy, and wrote it down, 300 years later someone tried to take those writings and figure out how to pronounce it in 1600sh English, which has then had 400 years to morph into what we would say today.  And all of it based on the name of a Kingdom that disappeared about 70 years after ~~Portuguese~~ Italian guy talked to the Chinese guy.  

And that kind of story pretty much applies everywhere.  "

wacky,relationship_advice,1389641374.0,"**Ask her to tell you the whole story.** What you posted up there is not enough. How did the walk start? Were other people there? What were they talking about? Try and get the whole sequence of events. Try and be patient and understanding while it comes out - whatever happened, whether she's guilty or not, its probably going to be very difficult for her to tell you, and very upsetting for you. Be prepared for that and don't flip out, that won't help anyone.

There are a lot of possibilities: she could have been sexually assaulted (e.g., he groped her without her consent) and now feels dirty about it, or maybe she willingly went into it and feels reasonable guilt. Maybe it was just a kiss on the cheek, and ended there; maybe it was far more. Who knows. Until she tells you, its hard to know what to do.

If she was sexually assaulted, you will probably feel very angry and upset, but *don't take that out on her*. She will need your support.

If she shares some (or all) of the guilt, try to keep calm. You'll need  to decide whether you think its something you can work through (probably not a good idea), or whether its worth breaking up over; in either case, getting angry is just going to make everything worse.

Don't confront the guy. He may be a slimeball, or maybe not, but confronting him won't help anyone."

It's not an excuse to eat poorly or under-eat. Rather, it fills in the gaps in nutrition. If you are a little short on B vitamins one day, the multi will fill in the empty space. Generally, vitamins are considered to be subpar to obtaining the nutrient through food as with food is more readily available and more of it is usable (fully absorbed and not discarded) to your body.I get my protein needs for the day by having yogurt, a large sandwich, a salad with meat, and a glass or two of milk daily. It makes meal time less of an adventure, but eventually many lifters begin to see food as fuel.I'm not really knowledgeable on protein powders to give that advice, but there are plenty of posts here on Fittit to that point and I believe a section in the FAQ/wiki with links to quality, proven products.EDIT ADDITION: If you are new to lifting, remember that diet does get easier after a while. Your hunger will increase as your body adapts to using more energy. At first, many don't eat enough because of not having a large enough appetite. Eat smaller portions throughout the day even if you don't feel very hungry. Avoid junk foods and stick to fuel. Gradually, you will find it easier to eat and find you have a specific taste for quality meals due to reward it gives to your body."

EastBlackbird,lgbt,1389642062.0,"There is no furry community in my country, as far as I know. But I am aware of these connotations. It's just that if the characters were really human it would be practically impossible to execute the idea of not mentioning their gender. My language has characteristics that really make this an almost impossible task unless I refer to the characters by animal names or some kind of similar thing. And the choice of animals wasn't to make them cool or anything like that; the two species I chose have the specific characteristics in their nouns that give me more freedom. Specimens from these two species are always described with feminine articles, which effectively makes it impossible to safely distinguish their gender.

If the public was older, I would gladly do something better out of this. I dunno, maybe I could use atoms as characters or quarks if I was feeling like it. Heck, I could some real crazy stuff like Italo Calvino or Alan Lightman did. But them being animals is, really, the only practical way I know that can be done in the little time I have left to deliver this.

But I guess these characters being, technically, furry, won't be a problem. Talking animals, as far as I noticed, have some different connotations in Latin literature."

CrazyPlato,changemyview,1389642132.0,"You forget that he's not being judged for his ability as a fighter. He's being judged as a bounty hunter. Ultimately, what gives him acclaim as a bounty hunter is his ability to retrieve people and turn them in for profit. Your argument that ""he didn't catch Solo himself; he let the empire do it"" assumes that this diminishes his ability to do his job, which it doesn't. Having powerful contacts who can help him catch the people he wants to catch is a useful skill, and ultimately what matters is that he got the results he wanted. In this situation, he seized upon an opportunity (the empire wanted Solo's friends) and struck a deal with them (he tells them where to catch the group, and in exchange he gets to walk away with Solo, whom the empire doesn't really care about).

With regards to the breakout over the sarlac pit, I would argue that Fett's motives would be pretty lackluster then. He turned in Solo to Jabba, got paid, and that should have been it. If anything, I'd argue that his presence at the execution was largely circumstantial, maybe he was hoping to get a new bounty, and his involvement in stopping the breakout would not have been expected (he's not Jabba's bodyguard, he couldn't be expected to help Jabba keep Solo once he claimed the bounty). That, in my mind, helps a bit with the fact that he clearly didn't being his A-game to the fight. As for his death, well...bad luck. He's a man in a shady profession, and in reality bad things sometimes happen. He got caught in a scuffle in which, purely by accident, his equipment malfunctioned. It doesn't mean that he was less of a bounty hunter (again, meaning that he wasn't less able to retrieve people and turn them in for money), just that he could have been better aware at the time."

No, I know where you're coming from. I still support the members of the FSA who defected due to Assad's ridiculous mishandling of the protests and in the days where he had no leg to stand on, unlike today.

Any FSA in favour of a pluralistic, non-sectarian Syria are fine in my books.

&gt; but the thing is, democracy is no longer an option. The ideal future that they still cling to has long disappeared, and they should realize it. This is no fun and games when they go out in demonstration. This is serious business and they must understand that they're raising propaganda as much as they claim their enemy is doing the same.

I agree. I think the only positive outcome in the near future is that Syria will become a grinder for the aggressive Salafi Jihadis and the takfiris that are flooding into the country. If the legitimate FSA doesn't want to associate itself with the SAA overtly, then I think they should retire from the field and focus on protecting civilians from the draconian and malevolent practises of the takfiri, especially Nusra and ISIS.

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1389642493.0,"My appraoch to the infringing the rights of the argument is this: 

- Most games, particularly AAA games are not done following any artistic integrity, let alone the artistic integrity of one person. So any of those arguments flat out don't count for the vast majority of AAA games or even any games by a larger group of people. (there are some rare exceptions that's why I say vast majority)

- It goes into deeper things like this like financing. Because we KNOW games that had playable female characters as part of their artistic vision and were pressured to change it. 

- I don't think that the request for female characters is in most cases fundamentally different from ""hey, I want a PC port of this"" or ""hey, I really hate that game mechanic"" or ""gimme a better save system"". It is the job of the dev to evaluate requests like these against their resources and their personal vision (aka is my main character just a meaningless sprite or are they actually essential to some kind of story or meaning?) and then reject them as appropriate. This should be a normal part of life as a game producing person and just the act of asking for it should not be seen as some kind of insult. In fact in many cases any request of ""It would be so awesome if it had a choice of gender"" should be seen as a compliment, as a version of ""I really like your game, I would really like to relate to your game in a way that I can put even more of myself into the game"".

They're a really amazing brewery that's under 3 years old and it's safe to say that they're the next big name in Boston beer.  If not- just keep an eye out for their beers in the area.

[Harpoon](http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/) has a brewery and tasting room in the seaport... and so does [Trillium](http://www.trilliumbrewing.com/wordpress_blog/beers/).  These two are a short walk from each other and are fairly accessible by public transport- though you might want to take the weird Silver line which are like these underground busses.  Don't be afraid.

[Sam Adams](http://www.samueladams.com/) does tours/sampling in Jamaica Plain (a neighborhood in southwest Boston) and is accesible by T.

In Cambridge you have the [CBC](http://www.cambrew.com/), again T accessible.  In Somerville you have [Slumbrew](http://www.slumbrew.com/) which doesn't have a tasting room but does sometimes do tasting events.

[Mystic Brewing](http://mystic-brewery.com/) is a very short drive or quick train ride from Boston, in the neighboring town of Chelsea.  [Night Shift](http://www.nightshiftbrewing.com/?) is in Everett, which neighbors Chelsea to the north.  [Idle Hands](http://www.idlehandscraftales.com/site/visit-us/) is also in Everett.

Also in there area is [Pretty Things](http://www.prettythingsbeertoday.com/wp/) which has no formal location but brews at a few different breweries in the state- their beer can be found in most stores and in a good amount of bars in the city.

I'm definitely missing some names because new ones are popping up all the time and there are breweries all over the state but these are all the ones close to Boston that came to mind at the moment

And if you don't want to go on a million brewery tours- maybe just set up camp at a great beer bar, of which we have many.  [Mead Hall](http://www.themeadhall.com/) in Cambridge (very close to the CBC) has an amazing selection of brews from around the world and represents the local scene well.

Normally in dungeons like this guy was running, there are a lot of individual groups of enemies (average of about 4-5 per group, some have more, some have less).

He was an amazing tank because he was supposedly just eating all the enemies shit and not dying, while still holding the enemies attention (large amounts of damage can sometimes pull the enemies away from the tank and onto the squishy casters/other DPS that are playing). the healer was also probably doing a good job to help out.

But it really does make me cringe to watch liberals talk about rights as if they are sacrosanct, when they quite clearly do not care at all about the constitution if it does not serve their precise social agenda.  For my part, I think the 2nd amendment is really silly and ought to be repealed and replaced with something much more sensible for the modern age.

* Have your friend locate the bony bump at the base of your neck, where the slope of your shoulder meets your neck. This is your 7th cervical (or C7) vertebra. Tilt your head forward to locate it more easily. This is the top of your torso length.
* Place your hands on top of your hip bones (also known as your iliac crest), with fingers pointing forward, thumbs in back. This is the ""shelf"" on which your pack will rest. The middle of an imaginary line drawn between your thumbs is the bottom of your torso length.
* Using the tape measure, your friend should measure the distance between the C7 and the imaginary line between your thumbs. Be sure you stand up straight when being measured. You now should have your torso length.

This number is important, as it helps you size your pack - since you want your hips to carry most of the weight and your shoulders to carry less, you have to have a pack that is the right torso length to do that. 

Osprey packs list the Large size as being for people who are between 20"" and 23"" of torso length (for the majority of packs - I'll double check in a bit to make sure the Aether uses this measurement...).


From what you said, it sounds like your hipbelt isn't actually on your hips. Is it? Do not release your load-lifters out - they aren't doing their job then. Your brain is also too far forward - just readjust it and you'll stop hitting it with your head. If all else fails, you can always slice the brain off

With somebody like Kratos or Dante or Nathan Drake or Ezio or Duke Nukem you at least feel like some thought went into inventing and designing a character or maybe a bit of an arc or something. To me it's all those no name white rugged guy heros that are the bigger annoyance to me because they really are white male just because and not because it adds anything to the game/because being male is one attribute of a larger character. 

I don't mind playing male characters if the characters are actually memorable and I feel like they actually add something to the experience. The big problem are games that think ""white gruff male"" is all the characterization and design you need when in reality that really makes them blank slate only. At which point they might as well go full on blank slate and most games like this wouldn't be hurt by this one bit. "

boxotimbits,conspiracy,1389643398.0,"I have to disagree with most things that you said.

2) The article mentions ""In the majority of cases, traditional law enforcement and investigative methods provided the tip or evidence to initiate the case."" 

I think most people would agree that these two facts mean that if the NSA *has* helped prevent acts of terrorism, we still aren't able to see or measure those results. (By definition this means there are no discernible impact)


Furthermore, if the real purpose of the NSA information gathering is to make communication more difficult for terrorists then why was it ever a secret? I agree that disrupting communications is an effective strategy, but how does secretly stealing all of our phone records help disrupt their communications? 

I don't doubt that the government would happily use this information to stop future terrorist threats, but you have to be naive to believe that is the only potential use of this information at any point in the future. "

wrathfulgrapes,evolution,1389643516.0,"Many things have become less necessary over time for many species.

Consider the appendix. It's a part of the intestine that was useful for our ancestors because they consumed a ton of vegetable matter (containing fiber) that's impossible to digest without lots of gut bacteria. That gut bacteria would hang out in the appendix, so having a large appendix would be important for survival. Animals like Gorillas still have large appendices because they still depend on large amounts of leafy matter for energy.

Humans, on the other hand, started to rely on fats and carbs for energy, which meant a large appendix was no longer necessary. So while it hasn't disappeared entirely, it's size has greatly reduced.

Another example are the hip and leg bones of whales. Whales evolved from legged mammals, but the didn't need legs because they don't walk. So large, strong, energy-needy legs were no longer helpful, and they shrunk down to their current size. They're not gone altogether, but they're barely there.

These features are called vestigial structures; they're bits and pieces that used to be helpful but have become obsolete and have diminished in size to the point where they're out of the way.

Kalivha,chemistry,1389643599.0,"For the specific bit of theoretical chemistry that I've focused on most recently I read papers by a few groups I was aware of, then tried to find papers that answered questions I had, and also asked people who knew more than me what I should look for. Actually it turned out that most of the useful information was in review papers from the late 80s and early 90s, in that case.

For relativistic quantum physics stuff, I actually started out with 2013 review papers and then moved onto textbooks and now I'm reading a graduate level one. Where appropriate, I also used lecture notes (mostly from maths courses, actually, and some of those were graduate ones).

Similarly, I'm doing nanophysics now for extra credits and all the papers we read for that are less than 15 years old. The undergrad textbook (such as there is, it's really just one chapter) is much older.

I think what is really helpful is to figure out what the standard literature for the field is (ideally at both undergrad and graduate level!) and then to use that alongside whatever reading you do. Also, for finding papers, learn to use databases. For Chemistry I prefer Scifinder (for being specific and having a lot of chemistry-oriented functionality) and Jstor as a supplement for the things Scifinder doesn't catch (which for me is mostly original papers on ""old"" topics; Pauli's stuff on QM and such&amp;mdash;I often find them much more comprehensible than newer papers because people back in the day actually gave philosophical background!)

Edit: TL;DR: It varies a lot. Using databases helps."

sparklekitteh,bipolar,1389643803.0,"Personally, I'm very skeptical of holistic/alternative/complimentary medicine, as it's often considered pseudoscience by the medical community. However, as a research geek, I've dug up some notes:

There's [next to no research](http://032912b.membershipsoftware.org/libdocuments/Bipolar_Disorder_CAM_Review.pdf) on most of this sort of thing with bipolar/major depression save accupuncture, and the results are inconsistent on that one. Additionally, ""natural"" herbal treatments like St. John's Wort may increase the risk of mania in bipolar patients.

Any studies I've seen related to yoga or meditation are linked to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, which seems to be useful for those whose depression is in remission, but is rarely recommended as non-medication monotherapy, particularly for those with severe bipolar. However, [it can be helpful in preventing relapse when used in combination with medication or other therapies](http://medind.nic.in/daa/t10/i1/daat10i1p117.pdf).

My personal opinion? The research data on complimentary medicine ONLY as a way to yank yourself out of a deep depression or head off/stop serious mania is not encouraging. Medical research, on the other hand, shows many possibilities for improvement on a variety of psych meds, and an experienced psychiatrist can help figure it out, and if you'd like to hook up with someone for meditation/therapy/etc. in addition, a good doctor should be able to help out with that.

In the end, it's your body, your treatment, your decision. But it would really suck to spend months (or longer) trying to think your mania away and suffer through it, when a doctor might be able to do more good for you sooner."

tightlikehallways,AskMen,1389643864.0,"I do not like the tone of many of the messages you are getting. You have not done irreparable damage to your future here.

1) You DO NOT HAVE TO tell some hypothetical future partner how many people you have slept with. Clearly it is something you are worried about so IF anyone ever asked, say something like ""I think the past should be the past and I don't want it changing how you feel about me, so I would rather not say."" If says he does not care and asks again, say the same thing. If someone is willing to break up with you because you will not tell him your lifetime number he is an asshole and should fuck off.

2) To put it mildly, you clearly have very mixed feelings about all of the casual sex you are having. Not getting pregnant or STDs is the biggest deal, but this is clearly causing you a lot of guilt and you should definitely ease up on the causal sex for that reason alone. You need to figure out what you want to do and it ain't this, at least not right now. Try saying no and taking it slow, see how it feels for you.

To state the obvious, there is a huge double standard when it comes to sexual partners, so I feel for you. As a guy, I would not have thought twice about my lifetime average if I was sleeping with 3 girls a year in undergrad. That would have been great!

TLDR: Your number of partners and sex life are your business. If you don't want people to know, don't tell them. If you feel bad about having casual sex, don't have it."

Paying content creators is the goal.  Distribution is practically free now, and unstoppable.  So don't depend on restricting distribution to get money to the creators.  Create a channel for the artists, musicians, writers and actors to get paid which does not go through the distributors.

I don't know what that would look like, but it's the exact opposite of DRM.  Give everyone the right to view it, and require them to pay for it based on how useful it is."

werewolfchow,AskReddit,1389644049.0,"While I was visiting Japan by myself a few years ago, I was in Kyoto at the Kinkakuji Temple (the gold-plated one) and I met a nice white couple at one of the observation areas. Now, if you've never been a white guy at a national historical site in Japan, let me tell you that all sorts of Japanese people want to take your picture. Kids, mostly, some teenagers. 

Well, this couple and I were both getting pictures taken with middle schoolers on a class trip, and we made eye contact, and afterwards we hung out at the temple and talked about our trips. It was nice to speak English again.

A few weeks later, I decided it was my day to visit the Ueno Zoo, so I naturally got off the train at Ueno Station. While standing in the station trying to decide if I should eat at the bakery, the white couple from Kyoto walked right in front of me. I remember being annoyed that I couldn't read some sign because someone walked in front of me, and it was them! Turns out she had been visiting him, as he actually lived in Japan, and she was now on her way back to the airport. 

But I had caught them as they were on the Ueno platform changing lines. They had just gotten off and were walking straight to their next train. I only was in Ueno Station that one day of my whole trip, for maybe 20 minutes, and they were likewise only passing through. 

It was crazy. Also, they gave me an umbrella."

Being able to say to my husband, ""you were right all those years ago"" was wonderful.  Being able to then say, ""I'm going to be getting help now,"" its just indescribably awesome. 

A diagnosis is hope that I won't ruin my marriage.  It's having information I can use to avoid hurting my daughter. It's an opening into sanctuary. It's always lingering,  and when I'm about to climb up into my Tree House Of Insanity, it's the locked door that tells me to climb back down.

Before my official diagnosis, all we had were symptoms and a suspicion. We were poor. So. Fucking. Poor. The luxury of a doctor to diagnose me was laughably out of reach... I might as well have wanted to buy a tropical island. But all of the research we did together in the beginning of our relationship is a huge part of how we are still happy 10 years later. Without our amateur hour dime store psychology,  I'd be his crazy ex and he'd be the one that got away.

No, she wants a new burger cooked. I explain that it will take about 20 minutes for a new well done burger and she says that's fine. When I bring it out and she flips. ""My food finally came out and my kids are already done, this is unacceptable..."" etc. I say I'm sorry, get the manager and get it comped even though she was already well aware of how long it would take.

When they leave (after lying to get the free birthday sundae I might add) I go back to the table. It is **trashed**. There is a $1 bill in the middle of the table (my tip) with drinks poured on it, food/condiments cut up and put on it, trash beneath the table, etc.

Unicornrows,AskMen,1389644800.0,"Speaking as a guy who's had sex with more than twice your number, I would be fine with your number, because I understand the desire for sex and I would hope that it made you experienced enough to not be like a leaf in the wind, sexually. I think a lot of guys would be afraid of you cheating, and I've seen some statistics that the more partners a girl's had, the more likely she is to cheat, but that is probably correlation, not causation. I think a high partner count could mean that someone is experienced and knows what she wants and is less likely to cheat and more likely to be satisfied because you've already slept around enough to know what it's like. Either way, I would not judge you on the number alone. 

I agree guys might get upset that you make them wait because they want more than just a hookup whereas if you were just hooking up you would sleep with them quicker. It seems unfair; that is why I think you should hook up with everyone at the same speed, whatever speed is comfortable to you (you might require an exchange of STD test results before sex, for example), regardless of whether it's casual or relationship material. However, people change over time, so you don't have to hook up with someone as fast as the fastest hookup you've ever had. Just because you slept with someone the same week or day that you met them in the past doesn't mean it's unfair to make someone wait now. You can say that you were experimenting, etc. Honesty goes a long way also; if you can't share honestly with a guy the way you communicated in your post here without being judged by him, then he is probably poor relationship material anyway."

gooeyfishus,backpacking,1389645005.0,"I find my hipbelt most comfortable if I have the middle of the pad slightly higher than the top of my hips. However, I am a man using a womans hipbelt because I don't have a lot of meat left on my body and the women's belt has more padding/curves more - so your mileage may vary.

The best way to find your optimal hipbelt area (in my opinion) is to put the pack on with weight in it, and then buckle the hip belt on while standing straight up. When you feel the shoulders taking too much weight, move the hip belt up slightly until you feel the weight on the shoulders reduce to something you are comfortable with, and cinch it up. I've seen people wear packs high on their hips, low on their hips and everything in between - its all about how YOU like the feel - so play around with it.

Gl33m,childfree,1389645052.0,"His source is heavy anecdotal data. He's interacted with a lot of women who never wanted kids, but ended up having them. His wife was the same way. It's the same old, ""Women hit a certain age, and they just have to have babies.""

The difference is, the women he interacted with never showed a clear analysis of their life, their wants and desires, before saying something like, ""I don't really want kids."" A lot of people in general will say, ""I don't really want kids,"" and what they really mean is, ""This isn't the point of my life I'm making a decision about kids."" And that's all there is to it. As opposed to myself, or the people of this board. We have (or I presume we have, there are a few that pop up ever now and then that haven't) put a lot of time and energy in deciding to be child free. There's real soul searching involved. We've thought about what life is like with and without children. And we've come to the informed decision that, no, we do not want kids.

But it's pretty clear my boss has never interacted with someone like that. So to him, yes, he's heard from a lot of people they, ""Don't want kids."" But the people he heard it from made an empty statement, with no weight, meaning, or substance behind it.

In some ways, I'm one of those people that do think, ""Yeah, you'll have kids some day,"" when I hear someone say they don't want kids. It isn't because I don't believe people can be child free. I believe pretty much everyone on this board when they say it. But you can usually tell who says it and means it, and who just kinda says it and means, ""I'm just not thinking about it right now.""

I kinda went all over the place here... but TL:DR people my boss has heard say they're never having kids, ended up having kids, so that's why he thinks it's unavoidable.

Edit to clarify: I'm a straight male. I want to be in relationships with women. Since women all want to have babies, it means I'll have to have some one day if I want to be in a relationship with a woman. I realized that wasn't clear initially."

But there's no ""over the back"" foul, and if you can reach over someone's head from behind and steal their rebound it's not illegal. So stop bitching.

&gt; Life teaches us that everythibg has a beginning and an end

This is a claim, not a question. I'd shy away from absolutes; only a Sith deals in them ;)

&gt; If you say that the universe has and end, what's beyond it?

""We"" don't say anything. The studies that have been conducted drew conclusions about our universe. Science is a wiki, anyone can do the tests themselves. In fact, science wants to be debunked. That's how we keep it honest.

In answer to your question. There probably would not be anything ""beyond"" the universe. That is to say, if I understand it correctly, the universe is not expanding like a balloon filling with air in a room, but rather think of the universe creating the space as it expands. The big bang ""created"" time and space. That is, before the big bang, there was NOT some big black room waiting to be filled. A heady concept.

The show did a great job of establishing their banter in season 1, but Jaime's been missing since then and the audience may need a refresher that one of Tyrion's relatives doesn't treat him like total crap.

s32,poker,1389646538.0,"Somebody who doesn't know how to play poker very well. Your usage of the word fish was fine there, since the other players are getting their hands in worse than you. I said it sounded like you were the fish because you weren't playing a certain game due to bad beats. If you are getting bad beats, consider it a good thing since you're playing optimally and getting your hand in when you should. 

You should note, however, that some hands that you're thinking of as bad beats are expected every once in a while. Getting it in as a 60/40 favorite, you're still losing a decent number of times, and even something as ridiculous as AA vs 27os AIPF (all in pre-flop), you're gonna lose that hand a bit more than 1/10 times. This, combined with the fact that some of these tournaments are decent sized (180 mans for example) leads to the fact that you usually end up getting it in a *bunch* of times on your road to the final table, so even if you are playing optimally, [variance](http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/other/variance/) hits pretty often. If you find that smaller games helps to reduce variance, that would be a good reason to play them over larger tournaments, but just getting bad beat isn't a good reason IMO to stop playing them.

psychicsword,AskReddit,1389646864.0,"In 3rd grade a teacher got angry at me and flipped a desk onto me. [It was one of those old 1970s desks that were clearly designed to stop a nuke fired by the Russians](http://i.imgur.com/MerAWag.jpg) as there were nearly solid metal. 

What happened is that my teacher, Mrs. H, was out for an early meeting and was running late. Us being a bunch of 7 year old 3rd graders with too much energy and watching too much tv, decided that we should throw a party. We were tossing papers all around and making a mess of the class room. I was assigned the lookout to see if a sub was coming. After 5 minutes I heard someone coming down the stairs and I yelled out that she was coming and I ran to my seat. Clearly no one heard me because they didn't stop making a mess. She walks in and sees everyone else destroying her class and me sitting there trying to act innocent staring at her. Now I was a trouble maker and I caused her a lot of stress over the school year but I was not the cause this time. Unfortunately all she could think of was that I was there and I was the little shit that just destroyed her class room for the 5th time and she released all her anger by flipping my desk over while I was sitting at it. My 15lbs desk and the 10lbs worth of shit I had stuffed into it came flying out of it and pouring all over with me just being stunned. 

I don't remember too much about what happened immediately after but I am pretty sure I ran into the bathroom and hid until lunch. What I do know is that during lunch she called my mom and told me that there was a mishap while trying to get a book out of my desk and when she pulled the desk flipped because it was so messy. She said that I then over reacted and told everyone she did it on purpose. This meant that when I got home and told my parents they didn't believe me at all. They thought I was just making things up again to get attention. 3 months later my mom finally hears the story from another parent and finally believes me but it is way too late to do anything about it. We talked to the principal and she told us there was nothing she could do because all she had was my word and the word of a bunch of other 7 year olds. It was too late to see that there was a bruise and nothing to disprove my teacher's story on why I got hurt anyway. In the end I had to suffer another month with that teacher hating every second of school. I stopped doing my work and I went from having a passion for math and science to not wanting anything do to with school. 

4 years later when finished 6th grade I confronted her and she told me her side of the story and didn't apologize once and made nothing but excuses. For that I called her a bitch and wished that she would die. 2 years later she retired and I honestly take comfort in the fact that she is probably dead by this point. 

I am just going to get this out of the way right now. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻"

And that's the senior league.

This is actually an extremely common fetish for entirely heterosexual males - The allure of trans porn has to do with the danger, strangeness or forbidden aspect of it, and it actually doesn't indicate any sexual preference for the opposite sex at all.

When I found this, I hoped this would be a place that would help me get in terms with my height and help me feel better but I was wrong. I was already down and this brought me even lower. Posts about height in subs like /askwomen or /seduction can cheer me up about my height a lot more.

Thornnuminous,childfree,1389648271.0,"Oh man, that's so rough. 

Yes, this is the right sub to be in. We're here for you.

You are not sick for wanting to not have a child. SHE however has some serious problems if she thinks emotional manipulation is okay.

This is absolutely one of the worst possible environments in which to have a child: one person who doesn't want to have one, and another person who is more than willing to twist up her partner to get what she wants, even though she knows it's hurting her partner. 

The number one thing you cannot do is let her control the birth control. An oops is way to easy to do and you already know she won't abort. 

Can you get her to go to marriage counselling? 

IF so, you should look hard to find a counselor who hasn't drunk the baby kool-aid and can remain impartial enough to help sort out the other tangles in your relationship. Or at least see if they are sort out-able.

Is divorce the only option? Not quite (see the part about counselling first), but it does sound horribly likely. 

I couldn't possibly stay married to someone who resents me for not getting her way. She'll hold it over your head for the rest of your married life.

Additionally, ignore what her family is calling you. Just because someone thinks you are crazy doesn't mean you are. Let that roll off your back. 

Also, there is no 'try it to see if you like it' with a child. You can't give them back if it doesn't work out. "

Maybe sometimes I'll feel like having an orange, and sometimes I'll feel like having an apple. Or I'll be fine with either, I just want some fruit.

Okay, the metaphor might not really explain anything, so I'll try to be more concrete.

People are all unique, and made from tons of different characteristics. One of them, I might really love his sense of humour, we work the same way, but then I don't really like the same movies he does.

On the other hand, it's not binary. I can be with a short person and a tall person, and like that the short person is short while also liking that the tall person is tall. There isn't one specific, imaginary person that everyone needs to get as close to as possible. You can love people for who they are, while still getting annoyed by some things in their personality, without having a strong, constant preference.

Then sure, you might sometimes feel like being with one of them over another. Or you're so frustrated with person A right now, you'd like to hang out with B to take your mind off of it. Really it's like with friendship... I know some people have best friends but I just don't work that way.

Inspired by such video games as Magic Sword, Golden Axe, and Revenge of the Metaknight, this fun game is played with (ideally) a standard (1"") barbell.


You begin with three lives.  Set weight on the bar to determine if you're playing on easy, medium or hard.  (I'll be using 20 pounds for easy, 40 for medium, and 60 for hard.)  To play, you perform a barbell complex of four movements determined by character class (see below) and what level you're on.  For level one, perform one rep of each movement, 2 for level 2, 5 for level 5, etc.


If you don't keep moving, you lose a life (you may stop for six breaths, once per life.  Any more than that and you lose a life.)  When you complete a level (or lose a life) you rest for one minute.

**CHARACTER CLASSES / MOVEMENT SEQUENCES**


Crusader: deadlift, power clean, overhead press, squat

Gladiator: power clean, front squat, overhead press, deadlift

Barbarian: bent row, power snatch, full push press, kneeling squat

Thief: power clean, front squat, back squat, front squat; gets 5 lives, can elect to ""switch out"" any one movement of a level to deadlifts

Mage: push press, alternating back lunge, push-up, reverse grip bent row (only gets two lives)



When you save your game (paper is quite helpful for this), you save your actual lives and continues accumulated; to improve your resources you have to start again from level 1 (the town, moat bridge, etc. leading up to the castle I guess, lol) or a previous save point.  You cannot start a new game from a save point.


On easy, the game finishes at level 27; medium goes to 32, and hard adds a boss encounter at every fourth level.  A boss encounter is a fifth movement, either: burpees, bicep curls, or a static overhead hold for 3 seconds per level.  (You may go through them in sequence, or determine randomly, or simply choose one before you begin the level.)


Try to dress for your character, at least in color or style of clothing: dark green shirt with a red wristband for archer, Oxford University shirt and frumpy pants for wizard, blue and white Nike shirt for a valkyrie; maybe a Coast Guard hoodie for a knight, or shirtless and with tiny shorts for barbarian.... you get the idea.  More ornate dress-up might be fun but probably just interfere with the workout.  The important thing is to do *something*; dressing up a bit can even help you distance yourself from your normal day-to-day self, which will help with the workout.


If you vomit, restart the level (even if you finished it.)  More likely just call it a day.


I want to make a few more refinements before posting it, but the ""alpha"" version looks like fun so far.  You may have to extrapolate for your equipment (pushups, inverted row, holding dumbbells and stepping up onto the bench?) but the initial framework may help guide your logic.  And don't cheat or it won't be fun!


Have a blast =)



**Edit:**  Oh one more thing!  (probably several more as I flesh it out but this one's important.)  You may earn additional continues by completing a two-mile run.  This is like putting more quarters into the machine: you can pretty much make things as easy as you want if you're sufficiently commited to spending the resources, and you really can't make it through the later levels without it."

Jimbabwe,AskReddit,1389648959.0,"My (super intelligent, no sarcasm) friend needed money, so he offered to write a bunch of people's term papers for cash. Well, the first one was a little bit like his own, but not too much. The second a bit like the others, but not *that* bad, but well, as you can imagine, after writing a dozen or so of these he started to get lazy/repetitive. The teacher, being no fool, noticed something was up. The first girl questioned spilled the beans on the whole operation. Everyone got zeros on their papers, except for my friend, who got expelled.

Well, the real ""scandal"" came after that. My friend took it in stride. He got his GED by mail in no time, learned web development, made a website chronicling the drama. The best part was when he published a letter his father wrote him, the tl;dr of which was basically ""I'm proud of you, son. If you had offered to take on more responsibility for more money in the 'real world', you'd be rich and have gotten promoted. But in high school, they punish free thinkers and creative entrepreneurship.""

It was a big hit among my class, and people would take to scribbling his web page's URL on the dry erase boards when nobody was looking. Eventually the school blocked it. Then came the first kid who they tried to suspend because a teacher looked over his shoulder and saw him corresponding with the rebellious ex-student... luckily it didn't take.

My friend got the last laugh, though, because his father was right. He flourished in college and graduated with a compsci degree well ahead of the rest of us. By the time we were done with college, he was already working steadily and making buckets of cash. I'm currently employed (also as a programmer) at one of the startups he developed for. He's since moved on, chasing bigger paychecks each time he moves. "

Not that it matters much, but AFAIK several of the largest Protestant denominations believe that, like the Anglicans and the Lutherans.  I wouldn't even call them the exception to the rule, since it seems to be the majority viewpoint to me.

&gt;we are now aware of its origin as a Gentile-&gt;Judaism conversion rite

I've never seen anything about this.  Sure, the Jews have ritual bathing to wash away ritual impurities, and AFAIK this is part of the conversion process, but it's dissimilar from baptism in some really major ways.  Paul affirms that there is only one baptism in [Ephesians 4:5 NRSV], which alone makes it too different from the Jewish Mikvah ritual to claim that they only intended it as a way to convert to Judaism, as the Mikvah is repeated frequently.

As for the claim that Paul did not mean water baptism when he said baptism, then why did he use the word baptism?  It seems extremely counter-intuitive."

Avistew,polyamory,1389649511.0,"I had never heard the analogy used that way. I've heard (and used) a slightly different version, in answer to ""but how can you love more than one person?"", which goes ""Well if you have one child, you can have another one without stopping loving the first one. It's possible to love two children at once. Same with friends, or family in general. Some people are that way for romantic relationships as well"".

I think, however, that not everyone has a favourite child. And some people might have a ""favourite"" that isn't always the same, or a favourite only in regards to something. For instance, favourite kids to play sports with, but a different favourite kids to talk about movies with, and so on. People are complex and chances are they have things you like and things you don't like about them.

Working hard on everyone ""being equal"" is, in my opinion, a dangerous game. People tend to try to make things symmetrical, so for instance if they see someone twice a week, then they'll want to see the other partner twice a week too. Nevermind that one person would rather see them once and the other three times. It's not symmetrical, so to them, it's not ""fair"".

But really, you need to take into account the different people. What do they want? What do they like? Will you take your vegan girlfriend to a steak house because you took the other one? Will you take your girlfriend to a haunted house even though she hates them, because the other one had such a good time?

Hopefully the answer is no. People are different. You should definitely treat them differently, and not all the same, like they're interchangeable or something. That doesn't mean one of them is better all the way around. It means some activities are better suited to some people than others.

Wanting to be special works well with that, too. Because you definitely are unique, and there are things about you that another partner will feel differently about. You can have a special date night, or a special activity that's unique to the two of you because other partners just aren't interested in that. But because he'll enjoy doing it with you, that makes it something that, without you, he wouldn't get to enjoy.

So when someone else enters the picture, I would say... get to know her if you can. People are less scary when they're real people than when they're idealised versions we make up in our heads. Then see what interests you have in common (which is good to get along), and which you don't (which is good to feel less interchangeable).

Jealousy is a strong emotion, and we've been told it's ""normal"" when it's romantic relationships. That's completely contradictory to what we're being told as kids: if we're jealous of a sibling or other kid at school, we're pretty much told to suck it up, and that jealousy is a bad thing. And usually we learn to manage that jealousy, especially people with many siblings who get used to sharing stuff for instance (or people, such as having to share your parents).

My point isn't that it's exactly the same thing, but that jealousy is not inherently good or bad, justified or not. It just is. Just like anger or sadness, it's an emotion, and whatever triggers it might be something that shouldn't happen, or it could be just your own insecurities. So it helps to try and get to the bottom of what makes you jealous, and figure out if it's justified or not.

Wanting to spend time with your boyfriend and feel unique and special is, in my opinion, normal and healthy. Some ways to deal with it are, in my opinion, only avoidance systems (he's not allowed to have sex with others/ date others/ hug others/ kiss others/ eat in the same restaurant we've been).

They're avoidance systems because they won't change at all whether you are special or not in their mind, and can make your partner feel controlled, which pushes them away.

Finding something that they want to do anyway, and that other partners aren't interested in, is a much better solution. Of course, ultimately, you wouldn't need external symbols of the fact that you're special, loved and unique, because you would be secure in that knowledge simply by the fact that your partner chooses every single day to stay with you."

Works like LOTR or The Hobbit should be able to stand alone.

Very few readers will read the background material, just as very few people will read the expanded universe works for Star Wars.

GuyWithNoHat,sex,1389650151.0,"Pick some days, and setup whose days they are.  Pick a time, too, to reinforce that *it's going to happen*.  If the time arrives and nobody is moving, announce that you're going to go get ready, or tell him to go get comfortable.

Ask him if he's comfortable with you dominating him a little bit with commands.  Example: ""Oh god that feels good, please lick harder!"" or ""I'm going to ride your face until I cum!""

This makes it sound less critical and more dominant.  Not sure if he's into that though, so good luck!

NOTE: I forgot your post was about *him becoming more dominant, too*!  Ask submissive questions, you can ""take control"" in a submissive way that prompts his dominance -- this will also help to ease him into the role.  If he sees your submissive side, he might step up to fill the void. (no pun intended)  Examples: Ask permission, or ask if you've been bad, or things like that.  Maybe play reverse psychology by agreeing that if you beg him *not to do something*, that he will turn around and do it -- thereby turning it into a fun little psychological game where you ask without asking and he dominates by doing something ""you didn't want""."

snorting_dandelions,relationship_advice,1389650588.0,"&gt; He has vocalized an interest in trying this in real life.

Yes, after **you** brought the topic up. You just told him you had a dream about a threesome with a tgirl, and if he afterwards says he *would consider* it, and that is if the tgirl was really hot, then you can't really hold that up against him.

But that's not even a major point: The major point is that just because someone would consider something, does not mean they want to do that instantly, or at all. I've told my SO I wouldn't have a problem with a FFM threesome, I sometimes watch FFM threesome porn, it's a nice fantasy, but really nothing more. I'm not hell-bent on having one, I'm just not uninterested. I'm 99% sure my partner and I won't *ever* have a threesome, and I'm completely okay with that.

Honestly, you sound like you're really insecure about your boyfriend and his sexual interests. I'd bet money you'd calm down so freaking much if you'd just talk to him about it openly. Think about it - if he is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, or at least a significant portion of it, is it really smart to have certain taboo topics? Wouldn't it be a lot cooler if you could just talk openly about whatever you want to? Just straight up tell him you stumbled upon the browser history and you'd like to know a bit about it. Why does it turn him on, does he prefer tgirls to real women or is it just a porn fetish(e.g. I really like dirty talk in porn, but I don't really need it all that much in real life).

You're upset about things you just assumed, without even knowing if there's any truth to these assumptions. Just go and talk to him about it."

People will have their preferences, which may or may not be, rooted in race. And this straight hair preference is something that our hair does not naturally do. So, is it our job to cater to the majority preferences especially when it costs something integral to our natural bodies? Frankly,  I don't think so.

dirtyewok,coys,1389650778.0,"Its news though....it will attract readers.

The stuff that is being said on the other boards is actually fairly entertaining....people are hell bent on the thought that Sherwood is trying to drive certain players out of the club (Holtby/Capoue are the prime candidates) and that he wants to do this because he wants to stamp his authority on being the manager of the club because he wants it to be more than an ""unofficial interim"" post. They talk about how he has Levy's ear and is ""Spurs Wormtounge"" whispering things to Levy and he will get his way eventually. That Levy listens to everything Sherwood says and is in agreement.

But then the same people will turn around and say the only reason TS isn't moving people is because Levy/Baldini are going to bring in Van Gaal/Pandelli/Simone in the summer and want whomever that manager is to make the decision.

Well....which is it?....either Sherwood is a super-villian who has brainwashed Levy and will be the manager forever or he is an interim manager.  If he has soooo much power why is there even talk of another manager?

It really is amusing to read.

Personally i think Sherwood has probably been told that we have plenty of players and if he can make it work then we will see in the summer, if he can't then we will opt for LVG with Sherwood staying on as part of the staff. TS is just trying to win games so he can either manage Spurs or get another job down the line.

Teeth are basically just exposed bone.  Expose them to acids, or otherwise muck with the pH in your mouth, supply the bacteria that cause cavities enough sugar and you'll wreck them.

bigtcm,AskCulinary,1389651103.0,"I was born, raised, and still currently living in Southern California to two Taiwanese immigrant parents. I think my experiences are typical of the kind you find in ethnic Asian neighborhoods.

&gt; What ingredients are worth making the trip for? 

* Some of the more common ingredients are so cheap at the Asian markets around here. I mean, I can stumble into any supermarket and pick up tofu, but at the Asian markets, I can grab a block for just over a dollar. Also being charged 50 cents for a bundle of green onions at the local market feels like I'm being cheated out of my money, because at the Asian markets I'm paying 10 cents per bundle. 

* Fish. Yeah I know it smells. But unless I feel like waaaaay overpaying by going to a fisherman's market, I can't get fresher fish. The fish at the 99 Ranch around here is usually fresher than the ones at the local Whole Foods. Also, I like to buy whole fish or fish heads - things I can't typically seem to get at any western market. And again, the price can't be beat - one big salmon head will be enough to make a huge pot of spicy fish head stew that will feed a family of four, and it would cost me maybe four dollars. 

* Then you get the more obscure ingredients that you can't find anywhere else. I'll just list a few of the things I picked up during my last trip there that I don't think I can find at the neighborhood Albertsons: Black wood ear fungus, preserved chili tofu, [kong xin cai](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KKEoZ0XG_oE/TlAHL1Sj-hI/AAAAAAAABeI/JYQjNAZ2eA8/s1600/DSC_1398%2B-%2Bedited.jpg), uncooked boba, [tong hao cai](http://www.agrohaitai.com/leafveg/tongho/oasis.htm) (which are amongst my favorite ingredients to throw into a hot pot by the way), spicy bean paste. 

* Baked goods. I'm a huge fan of various buns stuffed with taro, pork sung, red bean, and various custards and creams, and the coconut toast I can pick up at the 99 ranch makes for amazing French toast when dried out over night. 

&gt; Do you have advice on soliciting help from staff with whom you don't share a language? 

In my experience, you'll have better luck with asking other customers that look like they know what they're doing. If you know exactly what you want, and they can understand you, the employees will be more than happy to help you out. Generally though, if you're asking for help, one of the two above conditions won't be satisfied. If you ever find me in a Southern California market (hard to miss - skinny six and a half foot Chinese guy), you are more than welcome to ask me for help!"

The other day I made myself a list of all things I want to work on as far as working towards passing and am just going to try to gradually check them all off. It just seems more manageable that way and gives me a bunch of little things which I can work on, that will eventually add up to me being full-time.

Maybe you could also make a schedule where it's like 30 mins of voice practice this day, or 30 mins of make-up practice another, or go buy more feminine clothes this day.

However, if we remove the extra lights from the longer envelopes (as OP suggests) and remove the leading G light from each, that leaves 12 envelops with 48 lights, times 5 bits per light in baudot and that's 240 bits.

At the top, the Grand Mage's room stands, ruined (giant hole in the ceiling) in a way that the PCs must go around rubble to a dark, sheltered spot in the room, wherein a young dragon (spawn of the BBEG) is found. He is guarding the tomes that tell of his father."

Facial detection is just one of the composite techniques used to identify a person, gate, height, posture and body type are all other features that go toward confidence votes.

The biggest problem is scale. Pictures on fb are usually at a scale where facial features are visible and well lit -- they're usually hand picked byt he uploader to be the best pics possible. A creeper on the subway doing random look ups won't come near enough to get those sort of fidelity. The training set also has to be very comprehensive to compensate for the subtle differences in the facial variation between millions of facial structures."

CadHuevFacial,AskReddit,1389652780.0,"&gt; no one wants to deal with intense mood-flipping-headache-inducing emotions

The person experiencing those emotions does. Mood-flipping-headache-inducing emotions are NOT normal, I never said they were, but you are displaying exactly the kind of reaction and unfair interpretation/dismissal of normal emotions that make it less likely for many women to discuss their problems with their SOs. If I'm feeling angry, or hurt, or neglected in some feasible way and it is turned around and exaggerated to appear to be mood-flipping and headache-inducing, why would I ever feel comfortable or cared for in discussing my very normal feelings? 


How and why does your not having interest in another's emotions invalidate their experience? 

I never mentioned recurrent emotional extremes, but the kind of feelings/problems I was talking about are being misinterpreted as such, which is what happens in real life. I'm talking about someone being upset that their SO is late to pick them up/meet them or whatever for the 5th time because they got caught up with something else, and having their normal feelings of discontent dismissed as unreasonable and 'crazy' by the same person who upset them as a means of deflecting responsibility.


 I made sure to differentiate between *intense* emotion and *extreme, unstable* emotion. There is a difference. The former is in fact normal and, when influenced by the behavior of another person, *important to discuss for the person feeling it.* Just because it's not important to you, doesn't mean it isn't important."
