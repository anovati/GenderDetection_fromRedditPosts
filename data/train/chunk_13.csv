gooeyfishus,AskMen,1389223325.0,"You're a trauma survivor. Seek therapy. 

What I mean by this is that people who have endured trauma (and you have through your douchebag dad) will have a HIGH tendency to go after guys who have those same douchebag characteristics. Break the cycle. You've said you're in Uni, utilize their FREE counseling services and get help. Talk about the issues, resolve them and most of all, LISTEN and FOLLOW the advice of your counselor"

* you're reading too much into the lack of ""hello"" between classmates?
* your personalities just don't mesh and they just don't want to interact with you?

The point I'm trying to make is- **no one knows**.  There are literally hundreds of possibilities why they're acting the way they are and there are who knows how many ways that people misinterpret the behavior of others so there's no way to know what's really going on here.

If you want to be friends with these people, make an effort to be friendly to them.  If they're not interested- who cares?  You don't need everyone to like you.

edit: I just had a thought- if you're significantly older than them they might just assume that you're not as interested in being social or they might feel awkward about the age difference which I guess ties back to my second point"

You have essentially told him that he has to renegotiate the core of your relationship based on what you believe to be a core aspect of your being.  If you married a man, and years into the relationship, he revealed himself to be gay - very much in love with you, but also very much gay, and unable to be fulfilled with just you as a result - wouldn't you be hurt and upset?  It's a big pill to swallow.

Your husband comes across as pragmatic and kind, even when filtered through your anger.  He's right.  Poly IS a lot of work for often very little reward (do you read this forum?).  Poly can be incredibly dangerous to a preexisting relationship.  Jealousy is a constant issue.  And yet despite all these entirely reasonable objections, he's willing to take the plunge, but he wants to protect himself first in a practical way.  

That's smart and admirable, not manipulative.  He's expressing his boundaries.  He has reasonable fears, and also REASONABLY FEARS that going poly may irrecoverably damage your relationship but he loves you and understands that you need to try this so he's trying to find a way to negotiate it.  Instead you just whine about yourself and your own feelings, never once showing sympathy for the spot you've put him in.

In the military we have our annual physicals.  Before these physicals we fill out a survey that asks about our diet, exercise and general health.  Last year I answered these questions honestly because Integrity first right?  Under ""How many drinks to you have a day""  I chose 1-3 because that was my best option in the drop down.  ""How many drinks do you have on average in a week?""  My best option was 10+ so that is what I answered.   Another question, ""Do you have more than 3 drinks in a sitting?""  I answered Yes because like I said in my other post I'll have 3-4 beers if I'm watching football.  Within 15 minutes the nurse on duty called my phone because my questionaire flagged in their system.  I explained myself and she said, well I'll just adjust these answers then, so I didn't show up as a problem in their system.

I exercise 4-5 days a week and compared to most people my age am in much better shape.  I rarely drink till I'm drunk.  I just really enjoy beer.  In my mind drinking soda is way worse than having a beer."

On a similar note, I'm glad you went into the events of *Chain of Command*.  People eat up the idea that Jellico is the bad guy because he makes Riker and the crew uncomfortable in their jobs for the first time in a long time. The crew's, but mainly Riker's, dealings with Jellico is so extremely unprofessional that it's laughable.

People also seem to forget what Jellico actually did. He pretty much single handedly dealt with the situation with the best possible outcome. There wasn't any bloodshed, the Cardassians retreated, and he got Picard back. And he did all this with the crew virtually working against him.

* Lack of manners - because they don't want to be friends with you, they choose not to engage with you at all
* Insecurity - treating someone else badly without consequence proves their own social worth
* Envy - something about you reminds them of their own failings, so they ostracize you in order to avoid dealing with that lack
* Obliviousness - they are completely unaware that you perceive their actions in this way
* Offense - you did something that offended them, whether intentionally or not, and now they are either punishing you or just avoiding you

In your specific case, I'd say that if they're not going out of their way to actually *do* anything to offend you, there's no reason to perceive offense."

mr1337,Austin,1389224870.0,"&gt; In reality, the opposite is true. When users can see the current score, they can more intelligently vote with consideration for whether the comment is already overrated or underrated. Users will up-vote comments that were undeservingly buried, and not pile on more up-votes to comments that are already up-voted beyond their merit.


I disagree. Why does it matter to you what another person's score is on a comment? How does that change how you will vote on it? If it's a good comment, vote it up. If it's a bad comment, vote it down. Simple as that. Don't let other people sway your opinion of a comment.

I do believe that people will bandwagon votes. In fact, that's why the feature was designed in the first place. It gives comments a chance to reach their true score without you being psychologically manipulated into thinking the comment is good or bad. Just vote, no matter what the score is. No matter if you can see the score or not."

ruat_caelum,arduino,1389225058.0,"sure. [there is this or you could build your own library](https://github.com/Cathedrow/Cryptosuite)

The speed issue comes in to play in that you only have about 1k of ram on these chips for everything (your whole heap) so program space, variable space etc. Remember these are not von neuman architecture but [Harvard architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Harvard_architecture) so a lot of the memory is static at run time but still accessible to read from.

Because of the speed issue I would suggest some external memory to store the data before it is sent. This allows you to deal with the https error correction protocol in real time without having to deal with hashing AT THE SAME time. So either some volatile memory or a shield that supports more flash memory. You might also have to pass the data serially to a single ATTiny85 that asynchronously does the hashing to allow you faster computation along that memory space (less external reads and writes and more to memory.)

Can you select a better tool for this yup, but can you do it with this tech, of course."

I don't need protection from my employer. I voluntarily work there, they've taken on the overhead costs and risk so I can make money. If I found I was working too much, I'd leave. 


&gt; And still you worked way too much.

I worked as much as I wanted to. And who are you to tell me when I've worked enough? I enjoy my work-- and recognize that if I spend a few extra hours doing something I can make more money. It's rewarding and fulfilling to me. Who are you to judge?


&gt; You'd rather work more for the same money than to join a union? Now what kind of special idiotic business decision is that? To needlessly work more than one must?

I'd rather prove my own value instead of a union rendering my company bankrupt by negotiating unreasonable wages. I work in sales. I'm motivated to make money for myself, so why would I ever need a union? If I don't make enough, I'll quit. Why would I want a union taking money out of my check when I can handle it myself?

TL;DR: Be a fucking adult with some passion for work and you won't need a union or to be ""protected"".

Avistew,sex,1389225340.0,"Performance anxiety is very common on a first time. Basically, the more you stress out about not getting it up, the less you can get it up.

What you can do differently next time is just assuming you won't get hard, and not try to get yourself hard. You can still receive oral, don't need to be hard for that, but focus on her for the most part. Then you might realise you got hard in the process. And if you don't, how well. Try to relax about it and not expect to get hard.

I know it must sound crazy, or even more stressful, but that's the way it works. I've helped a lot of guys who had the same problem. And every time, once they relaxed enough and stopped thinking ""I need to get hard for it to be 'successful sex'"" (whatever that means), they had no problem anymore.

Porn is not very likely to be a culprit, but if you want, you can go without ejaculation (you can still touch yourself, just don't come) for a few days to a week. That should get you way hornier, and it might help. However if you do that, be aware that you're likely to come right away, possibly even before penetration occurs, especially since you say you come really fast through lapdances.

But once you've managed to be hard once, you'll probably relax enough that you won't need any ""tricks"". Just don't put too much pressure on yourself, I assure you, you don't need a hard cock to please your partner. As for your penis size, almost all guys think they're tiny, but only a small minority are. You might be average or even bigger than average. And even if you are smaller, size isn't that important... Most women get off with a finger which isn't very thick, and the sensitive area of the vagina is right at the opening, so length isn't required either.

Hell, even penetration isn't required, so you'd be fine without a cock at all. So don't fret about size, I know people make it sound like it's a huge deal, but it really isn't unless you're really extreme one way or the other (for instance so big that even with tons of lube, you're hurting your partner and therefore can't have any penetrative sex)."

We weren't to just drop literature and leave — we were supposed to actively try to engage the householder in conversation. If they had objections, we were to be prepared with topics of conversation to deal with those objections.

For example if someone said, ""I'm not interested"", we were supposed to say something like, ""May I ask - are you not interested in the bible or in everlasting life?""

Depending on their answer, we were to target our conversation on what they might have issues with so we could be persuasive.

These days, when JW's show up at my door I actually try to get them engaged in a conversation. But the moment I say something they just shut down and leave. They don't ask me any questions, just toss a tract at me and run.

cptn_garlock,EngineeringStudents,1389225823.0,"&gt;AP classes will not hinder your admissions. It's good that you got the basics down, english, chemistry, and calculus are traditionally the harder classes that freshman always complain about. Not having an associates can hurt a little, but if your write up is good you should be able to get in.

Would it be worth mentioning on the application that I was waitlisted when I applied before, as a senior in high school? I remember in the Common App had a place for mentioning prior admissions decisions, but IDR if the VT application does.

Also, do you know if the VT admissions committee accepts recommendation letters from professors? My physics 1 professor, Elena Ziu (she teaches at Annandale, maybe you know her?), apparently took a shine to me and offered to write recommendation letters for schools and scholarships.

&gt;Note that Linear Algebra feeds into numerous classes, if you don't have this class you will be held back (I made that mistake).

You're right, that does feed into several classes, even classes I've already taken - I took Statics last semester. If I get in, I'm going to need to have a *long* chat with an adviser about classes, because it looks like I'm going to be all over the place in terms of courses. 

I am actually in the middle of class sign-ups for Spring (very late, I know). I was planning to take engineering programming, but should I swap that out for Linear Algebra? Like you said, it'll feed into many classes (including my engineering programming class), and I've looked at the Linear Algebra/Matrices material before, it doesn't seem terribly difficult. 

&gt; The Capstone Design Project usually is done via a design team like Baja or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

I noticed you put usually. Is it possible to begin a new independent project? I mean, just on that page alone I saw plenty of existing projects that fall under the purview of what I'm interested in (the medical sim robot and the 3D printed AAV seem terribly interesting...), but just in case...? 

&gt;Chocolate covered peanuts

&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

&gt;The Baja group is big and they are always looking for more people. This means that you can come and go as you please, but it also means that you may not have much work. If you volunteer on a senior design project, you'll likely be their bitch (probably doing CAD). There are labs where you will get hands on work. There is one lab, the name slips me right now, where walk-ins are welcome and even encouraged. I believe this lab houses the Baja and Formula teams among others.

Well that's good, I have several years of CAD experience with Soldiworks and Inventor under my belt already (although I'm out of practice for the past 1.5 years), so even if I'm their bitch, I can still do something haha. Still, though, I'd prefer hands-on work (who wouldn't), so I'll definitely go look up the different facilities later. One of my best friends' at VT (she's a freshman ME right now), and she's in Baja, and said it's a lot of fun. I may not know a lot about cars, but I wouldn't mind getting involved.

&gt;Little known fact: course requests are prioritized by gpa, so do good in your first semester!

It's a fairly common sort of thing to be surprised that a guy finds you attractive, especially if you're her first boyfriend and treat her well. Depending on her personality, complimenting her figure could help or hurt. It's usually more fun to be complimented on something you have control over, but as her boyfriend more subtle compliments could work to your benefit. Her hair is a fairly solid bet, as might be outfits; my boyfriend calls me beautiful quite often and it gives me the warm and fuzzies constantly.

ballookey,exjw,1389226345.0,"144,000 because the bible uses this number. Most christians believe it's not meant to be literal, but the JW's have always thought it was literal. In fact, originally they didn't believe in a paradise earth resurrection at all. They thought 144,000 would make it to heaven and that's that. Only when their ranks grew WAY past 144,000 they decided they needed some sort of thing to promise to the bulk of their fellow believers, so they came up with the resurrection to paradise earth.

They celebrated birthdays in their early days - maybe to the 1950's, if I remember. But they then decided that because the bible only mentions a couple of birthdays and that at both those birthdays something horrific happened, that it was inappropriate for them to celebrate. I personally think it's because celebrating birthdays honors the individual and they try to stamp out any idea of self-worth.

The incentive to do good is so that they can make it to paradise earth. 

Personally I'm an atheist, and I have neither the carrot or the stick dangling over me: Neither hellfire or heaven. I believe in doing good because that's how we get along in a civilization. The more people believing this, the better the civilization, the better we all will get along. I don't think it's truly *moral* if one only does the right thing because one is afraid of a threat.

"
Maldevinine,australia,1389226628.0,"Welcome to Australia. Full disclosure, I have two family members at University of Wollongong, one as a lecturer the other as a PHD student.

The University of Wollongong (UOW) is a second tier university in Australia. Our most prestigious universities form an exclusive club and claim to be the best, but any university in Australia will give a very high quality education. UOW offers degrees in almost anything, with expertise in heavy industry courses. It also runs the country's only Rural and Remote Medicine degree.

It is a single campus university set right at the foothills of the escarpment. The campus itself really is beautiful with large well kept gardens around the buildings. The facilities that I have seen are mostly modern and well suited to the work. There does not seem to be a shortage of specilised areas like mech or computer labs. Socially the UOW is very active, with a good students association running both sporting and social clubs. Because the campus is such a nice place, most of them take place on campus outside of normal hours.

Wollongong itself is a major port, coal mining area and steel works. The steel works has been dying for almost as long as I have been alive, but the coal mining in the area is strong. Wollongong is one of the three largest cities in New South Wales (there's an old joke that NSW actually stands for Newcastle, Sydney, Wollongong) so if an activity is not offered in Wollongong it's probably not offered anywhere. Physically the city is a long north-south line bounded by the beach on one side and the escarpment on the other. This makes it quite far from one end of Wollongong to the other, but you are never more then about 10km from the beach. The beaches are nice and much less touristy then further north. It's Australia, so you will still get 30+ degree days to enjoy the swimming. I can't comment on the quality of the night life but the pubs are not as good as you would find in the more serious drinking towns.

The only other comment I have is to get used to calling the place ""The Gong"". Everybody else will."

ProtoKun7,doctorwho,1389226666.0,"&gt;Healing is what regeneration is for; he regenerated in order to get a new body, one which hadn't just been shot. The Doctor counts it as a proper regeneration, why wouldn't we?

It used up a regeneration, except he didn't replace his body with one that hadn't been shot; he healed the damage to his current body caused by the shot.

&gt;As soon as he had regenerated, he didn't change having decided he liked his current self.

Decision has nothing to do with it; the body changes whether he wants it to or not. Siphoning away the energy was the only thing that prevented it.

&gt;""to stop the energy going all the way""
Stop the energy, not stop the regeneration. We don't know what all the way is exactly, we don't know how far it actually went. For all we know the change in appearance and personality is a separate, last second process (which is more or less what we saw on screen; regeneration with a last second zap to the hand).

He stopped the regeneration completing *by* siphoning the energy before the process completed. The two things are directly related. Fuel a vehicle before a trip, but if the fuel is siphoned, it goes to power something else (the separate, duplicated body) before it can be used for travel to a new destination (or body). Both cars do not end up with an equal amount of fuel.

&gt;""siphoned off the rest""
As above; we don't know what the rest is.

The rest of the regeneration energy which completes the process.

&gt;""I'm still me.""
Yes, but he got a new body, hence he wasn't dead. It was just the same as the old one.

It *was* the old one; it was the same body.

&gt;We will only ever be able to enjoy our own theories when thinking about such minutiae; Moffat certainly isn't keen to explain in any further detail. Never apply logic to Who.

ajdeemo,DotA2,1389228016.0,"&gt;The more you have to wait, the more the algorithm is increasing the range. Let's make an example: before there was 1 pool with an average of 5'000 players waiting to get matched. By adding Ranked, you now have 2, now you can only form the teams by chosing from 2500 persons. The MM has therefore a few options:
1. Wait longer, without increasing too much the variance.
2. Be less strict, admit larger variances, higher pings etc.
Now, on paper the first option is clearly better. ""I'd rather wait 25 minutes instead of 5 if it means I will have a better game"". The fact is, you can't even grant that. The longer you wait, for instance for the 10th player, higher becomes the chance one of the 9 the MM already found will drop out, so you have to start from the beginning.
By itself, this is already a problem. By adding solo queue you would be would end up not with 2, but 4 pools, increasing the issue even more. At the current state, it simply isn't an option. In the long term, when there will be more concurrent players it will be more feasible.
So yeah, they could add solo queue, what you'd get however is most likely: wait a lot, people that constantly cancel and requeue when it takes too much (so, even longer waiting times) and when you finally manage to get a game it won't be balanced anyway because there are so many pools that each pool, by itself, has such a small number of players waiting that the algorithm has to accept higher variances in skill in order to give you a game. By consequence, no matter how long you waited, it will be a crappy game nonetheless.

this is pretty much the same argument against solo queue when it first came out. and it never happened

i'm not saying it won't happen, but there's a good chance that waiting times will still be okay (at the moment, I usually wait less than 30 seconds for a match, so I highly doubt it'll skyrocket from there). and if we implement solo queue and they're not okay, then they can revert the change."

I think he would have been able to move past it over time. I did. I went through a painful breakup, and it hurt for years, but I'm over it now.

 I don't think I'll ever forget him, although I can be happy without him. His family will have a harder time moving on, but they will do the best they can, as I'm sure he'd want them to.

hylandw,DnD,1389228748.0,"First, Inspiring word - Class features are not powers. Well, they are, but they're free. If simply being a warlord gives you a power and you didn't choose it out of the powers list, it's not a power. Inspiring Word is free - just as clerics get free healing lore.

Second, rituals - The game makes you gain a ridiculous amount of money. The only way to balance this is for the DM to rule that you spend your money on stuff. Between adventures, I roll a d10 for days, write down costs of meals and such, and then add each player's respective costs. Ex. the paladin pays for weapon and armour upkeep, as well as donates to the temples. The wizard pays for ritual components, and only components - they're expensive enough. A city would have everything, and even tiny towns have apothecaries - enough for basic rituals. A rogue would buy poisons and do weapon and armour upkeep. I typically ask less-than-noble characters how they would like to make money on the side - cheating at cards, pickpocketing? If you want to balance, other characters could be paid for other things - wizard can do cantrips for young children at parties, clerics and paladins can be paid to heal people (by the church - these characters wouldn't ask the people for money). I especially love rolling tables for random events. You might arm wrestle, get in a bar brawl, get locked up for drunkenness, go on a date, learn spells... I also, occasionally, accept requests too study a skill, and enough of this lets them take training as a feat. Down time can be fun time.

Cities and large towns have wizards' associations, who would deal in all types of components. Some components are mundane, such as candles and herbs, and would be sold in small communities. Druids can forage for components, and clerics can get things from the church. If you're in your home base town, the wizard is probably a member if the mages' guild or what have you, and will get a discount on ritual components when they perform it at home. Maybe they take the opportunity to teach a fledgeling wizard!"

Seriously, pause the video at around 11:50 and look at the graph. Just look at it. If you can't immediately spot what's wrong with it, you have no right to call yourself a skeptic.

For starters, why in the hell does the blue overlap the red fill? Weird choice designed to make it look like there's more cold than there is. But the main thing - see what date it cuts off at.

Ask yourself - why did he do that? What would the graph look like if he hadn't cut it off?

Easterbrook knows what it looks like, and chose to hide that from you to intentionally mislead you.

Don't believe his lies.

[edit]

13:53 - Wow, this is the dumbest argument ever, are you really falling for this?

Easterbrook is saying that the temperatures were hotter in the past because there were more record hot temperatures set. Well duh - the further back you go, the more likely you are to set records, because you have **less** preexisting data. You **expect** new records all the time.

Again, Easterbrook knows this. He just assumes you're too stupid to see through it. You're not too stupid to see through that, are you? 

[edit]

I love how - when called out on the fact that what he's saying about temperatures cooling since the 30s doesn't match the temperature record in the published literature - Easterbrook claims it is because the temperature record has been manipulated to cool the 30s, and that he's analysing the raw data. Utterly shameless.

[edit]

Oh brilliant, at 12:30, he lies again. ""Present"" in that graph of the GISP ice cores is about 150 years ago. All warming since the mid 19th century is omitted, yet he keeps talking about ""present"" temperatures."

DrPepperHelp,electronic_cigarette,1389230051.0,"Depends on what you call ""Premium Juice"" MBV is NOT a premium juice vendor. Think of them as Wal-Mart.

Now we branch out. Some vendors are better at different PG/VG mixes.

High PG flavors will be harsher on the thought, but carry more flavor. Good in cheap clearos, Protanks, cartos, and cartotanks. Basically your lower wattage devices at one ohm or above.

Higher VG means smother thought hit, and has less flavor. Good in drippers and rebuildable atomizers. So this is if you vape at 1 ohm or lower. Works well in higher heat.

Now I told you this because i want to know if you are still above 1 ohm or below. I have different vendors for different devices. This is largely due to how the vendor flavor tests the ""alpha"" flavors."

As a parent who's gone through the unexpected loss of my young son about two years ago, all I can say is that the feelings you're having are normal.  It may not help you to know that, and you'll find (if you haven't already) that you'll have to get through this in your own way - just try not to go about it on alone if you don't have to.  No one talks about it, because no one wants to think about burying their own child.  However, it does happen, and there are folks out there (professional and otherwise) who can help.  If you find it's too much, especially if you find yourself alone for long periods at a time, make sure you seek out help.

A positive - a good number of memories do stick after the initial disappearance without your son there to remind you of them regularly, especially keeping a picture of him here or there around the house, or in your wallet, or one in the office.  Also, after awhile, it's nice to be able to disappear into the memory for a bit versus it being something painful."

The latter part of your advice is great not only in this context, but for challenging and enhancing your skill and dexterity in any form of writing.

The most challenging but most rewarding advice I could give is to find someone versatile and creative to form a familiar bond with, someone who (as Rachel said) put you out of your comfort zone at times, or surprise you with something you never really thought you'd like at others...and the reciprocal benefit of trying to do the same from them. You will be rewarded with their insight and the pleasure you get from satisfying your partner and helping them to improve; and your quality will surely improve much faster than with the classic sexting one-night/one-line stands.

I'm not petite, and my first few sex partners were significantly smaller, penis-wise, than my husband, but PIV sex was excruciatingly painful because I had this condition: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginismus

For me it was likely the result of childhood sexual abuse.  Without getting too TMI, I still have vaginismus with regards to penetration by almost anything OTHER than a penis.  But I really like sex and wanted to be able to have PIV sex so I was able to get myself mentally comfortable with penises, but I haven't quite got there with tampons or speculums or fingers.  It's not voluntary.  Lord knows my life would be easier if I could use tampons.

My point is that if she has had discomfort with PIV she probably has the condition, and it's probably a result of her upbringing.  Being petite has nothing to do with it.  Even the tiniest women are able to give birth, after all.

Unfortunately, vaginisumus is not easy to treat.  I'm a pretty rare case in the fact that I was basically able to to train myself to not involuntarily clench when a foreign object entered my vagina.  Most women have significantly more trouble treating it.  But it's really worth looking into.  It's very painful so it makes sense that if her experience with sex has been this kind of pain, coupled with her negative views about sex, that she'd end up as an ""LL"".  Sex is terrifying when it's painful."

jgunski,vmware,1389231437.0,"Here are some technical differences: 

* 1 Linked clones consume disk space in a more efficient manner than full clones (similar to snapshots). They are essentially a linked snapshot of the parent disk + a delta disk, registered as a new VM. Snapshots are simply delta disks of the same VM's disk.
* 2 Linked clones allow hardware customizations per linked clone, such as a unique uuid for VM disk (so linked clones can power on at the same time)
* 3 Linked clones are managed as separate VMs vs a single VM with multiple snapshots. Clone them to a separate disk, folder, whatever.
* 4 Properly configured Linked clones will perform better than snapshots and especially nested snapshots. It has to do with how the VMs filesystem is read through the various VMDKs on your host filesystem (VMFS or NTFS), as it reaches the final snapshot to get the desired block of data at the required state.

Using the image of snapshots you provided, consider ""Base"" as your parent VM and 2010, 2011, 2012, etc.. as linked clones of ""Base"".
I would then full clone ""Base"" for a new Parent ""Base with Office 2010"", and linked clones 2010 (Office), 2011 (Office, 2012 (Office), etc... just don't do linked clones of linked clones as they are bad for disk performance."

The current way lockons are allows for bad pilots to be more easily punished.  Flares, stealth, and running behind things are supposed to be the counters to A2A/G2A, and they are (mostly).

Overextending yourself, flaring and then just hovering around, and having bad situational awareness *should* be punished hard.  I don't use A2A much, but nearly every time I've gotten an A2A/G2A (I use G2A Annihilators a fair bit) kill, it's been because some pilot flared as soon as I started locking on, and then just *sat* there until I got a lock again, or never tried to break my LOS (fly behind building/tree/hill/etc).  These haven't all been low-level players either, I've caught BR 100s out of position.

A2A is a crutch (a good crutch), and they do that well.  Just before PU02, people were constantly complaining about how the air game was too brutal to noobs, and something needed to be done to balance it out a bit.  The complainers got their wish."

1) don't worry about protein. You don't need nearly as much as you think you do, and your body doesn't use significantly more protein when you work out than when you don't. Getting 10% of your calories as protein is plenty, and most people really only need about 5% of calories as protein. If you look up the protein content of most vegetables, you'll find it rather difficult to construct a diet in which you DONT get enough protein. I know this goes counter to everything you've probably been taught, but protein requirements are one of the greatest misunderstandings of our age.

As far as cooking, I personally make a ton of seitan. I love the stuff. It's easy to make and can be flavored in so many ways. You can make anything with seitan. A great source of many delicious and free recipees is [The Vegan Zombie](http://www.youtube.com/user/ZombieGate). I love that guy.

RBGolbat,TumblrInAction,1389232487.0,"&gt;I Don’t Care About “Frozen”
&gt; 
&gt; This is but it isn’t a rant. I’m not hating on the movie especially since I haven’t seen it yet. I’m actually pretty sure I would absolutely adore the movie. However, I refuse to see it in theatres. I also refuse to buy the dvd when it comes out. 
&gt; 
&gt; Why? I mean, I’m pretty sure I’d like it a lot and I wouldn’t regret spending my money to see it. It would be a fun and entertaining movie and who knows, depending on how the ending works, I may even tear up a little at the end. I love Disney movies and hell, I even love the Disney Princesses. I have nothing against princesses at all.
&gt; 
&gt; But with Frozen, I’m very disappointed in how they based the film on a story where most of the characters were women. What also bothers me is that two of the male characters that were introduced weren’t even human. So the excuse of keeping the female models pretty (regardless of the context) falls flat when the snowman and reindeer could have just as easily been female and fulfilled the exact same roles, without worrying about their precious models or the amount of hair they were covered in.
&gt; 
&gt; They had a story with a wild cast of female characters, and exchanged them for a snowman and a reindeer. Why? This would have been a great opportunity for a different type of princess movie, one that showcased women adventuring together and the strength of friendship. If you look at most Disney movies, a lot of the relationships are male/male ( some arguably bromances) and female/male (almost always romances or budding romances). I think I can list three films that focused on women/female characters and their relationships: Brave, Lilo and Stitch, and Home on the Range.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m not going to assume I know anything about animating because I don’t. I don’t know the technicalities of 3D modeling and facial structure and whatnot. What I do know is when there’s a blatant cop-out. Fine, if it was too hard to animate more than two female human characters, why not make the rest of the cast female animals, right? How different would it be to animate a male squirrel from a female squirrel or whatever? Why did they have to take a predominantly female cast and make it mostly male?
&gt; 
&gt; And despite the title and marketing to make it appeal to a broader audience, I bet you most of the sales from the movie are going to come from girls and women. Whether they’re toddlers out for their first movie night, 7-8 year olds who plan on having a princess sleep over party after the movie, mothers who are taking their daughters to see the film and then the young adults who still love Disney films despite their age. 
&gt; 
&gt; They, I mean we, have been watching and supporting the Disney princesses for a long time, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t get a theatrical released film consisting mostly of women whether it’s about princesses or not. But I guess I should just be happy that there were even two female leads in one film at all!

Suing other people is a shit process that is emotionally draining. Maybe you can work really hard to fix the process to be less burdensome on someone who is already dealing with overwhelming grief?

Dancing: If you don't like to dance, that's fine. Don't do what you don't enjoy doing. However, if you think you might enjoy it if you're better (or drunker), then it wouldn't hurt to improve. Otherwise, why train yourself on something that's not applicable. Dancing is definitely attractive to the ladies though...so don't necessarily dismiss it. It can be great fun.

Commuting...yeah, always a tough one. Feel free to make an approach (definitely shows balls), but don't expect a high accept rate. 

Multiple Women: I wouldn't really ask in front of other girls...reserve it for a private moment, or get ALL of their numbers (use the ""we"" context) and text the one you like. Asking one out in front of another, only to ask that one out later if it fails is a bad idea. It'll be a blow to the 2nd choice's confidence. Cast a wide net, then pick the fishing line (rad: phone number) you wanna catch.

Coed Sports: Again, definitely shows balls making an approach, but it'll be tough, especially when she's surrounded by male friends. Your best bet here would be to invite several members of the opposing team out after a game and focus in on the girl you like. Post-game stuff is usually so harried that I doubt most/any girl would give you the time if you just up 'n asked her out on the field.

If you enjoy those things independently, keep them. Find someone new who also likes those things and continue to grow your interests independent of your past relationship.

IBiteYou,Conservatives_R_Us,1389234725.0,"Your second source is NOAA and is the most recent.  From it:

It is premature to conclude that human activities--and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming--have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane activity. That said, human activities may have already caused changes that are not yet detectable due to the small magnitude of the changes or observational limitations, or are not yet properly modeled (e.g., aerosol effects).

Anthropogenic warming by the end of the 21st century will likely cause hurricanes globally to be more intense on average (by 2 to 11% according to model projections for an IPCC A1B scenario). This change would imply an even larger percentage increase in the destructive potential per storm, assuming no reduction in storm size. 

There are better than even odds that anthropogenic warming over the next century will lead to an increase in the numbers of very intense hurricanes in some basins—an increase that would be substantially larger in percentage terms than the 2-11% increase in the average storm intensity. This increase in intense storm numbers is projected despite a likely decrease (or little change) in the global numbers of all tropical storms.

Anthropogenic warming by the end of the 21st century will likely cause hurricanes to have substantially higher rainfall rates than present-day hurricanes, with a model-projected increase of about 20% for rainfall rates averaged within about 100 km of the storm center.

That's not very concrete.

If you look here, the numbers seem all over the place.

FeatherDie,AskReddit,1389235216.0,"I have some breathing exercises that I used to reduce anxiety. They can be paired with some meditation exercises, or be used to get you focused enough to try meditation.

It was explained to me like this :

One of the first reactions when a person gets anxious is for the body to close itself up and take shallow and short breaths. Unfortunately for people with anxiety, the prolonged feeling makes them feel more anxious or just bad in general.

I do one of two things if I'm not able to control anxiety, or even just to gain some clarity and focus. All breathing exercises should be in through the nose and out through the mouth.

1. Ten deep breaths in and out. You can do it anywhere, you can think about anything, just take ten deep breaths. Hold it when you breathe in and out for a short pause to make sure you're taking your time. (If you're at work and something stressful happens, you can do this as much as you need for a short break right at your desk)

2. The second practice requires closing the eyes and breathing in and out as deeply and as quickly as possible about 50 times (maybe for 1 minute). Don't strain anything... You might feel like you're not getting quite enough oxygen, but that's why you don't keep doing it for a long time. After your 50 times (1min) are done then you practice the first breathing exercise. Rinse and repeat 2-3 times, or if meditating you can continue either exercise."

femanonette,norfolk,1389235677.0,"Press can get slightly pricey if you're doing date night due to the menu item prices and some of wine by the glass pricing, but I do think this is an A+ date place. It's easy to go from a reasonable check to suddenly $100+. The atmosphere in there is vibrant and social, and even though people are less than 3 feet away from you, you still feel cozy and private at your table. The desserts there are also always made in house (which trust me, is rare for many restaurants though they claim otherwise), so you could always go somewhere else for dinner, and then finish up with wine and dessert there :) If you took the gal somewhere prior and had a private table, I'd suggest sitting at the bar for wine and dessert (unless you don't think it'd fly with her). The other guests there have always been enjoyable to talk to and the bar seems to encourage everyone socializing with each other.

I also suggest [Crackers](http://www.littlebarbistro.com/crackers-about.php) if you're looking for a ""hip"" date night feel. They have tapas and a great beer menu (their wine menu has always lacked slightly, but one can get by). They also have half price bottled wine nights on Tuesday I think.

Another place for dates: [Bardo](http://www.bardoeats.com/). Pricey, but definitely an interesting menu at all times; portions are on the larger end of tapas. They do carry interesting wines, a few great beers on tap, and sport a very diverse liquor drinks menu.

A very low key, eclectic, ""let's just go out for one more wine/beer or coffee"" is [Cafe Stella](https://plus.google.com/117022357500408933172/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en). You'd have to call about their hours though. They only recently started staying open later and having some live music. Again, low-key and casual, it's primarily a coffee house. I find the place very charming myself.

As far as building a date night for you? That's difficult. I don't know the girl so I couldn't tell you what she'd be into :/"
whoremongering,gaybros,1389235680.0,"&gt;without having to resort to this study

You are choosing to ignore other relevant data that consistently demonstrate protection due to circumcision. This is also what Boyle and Hill do. I can’t make you face facts, but it weakens your argument when you refuse to consider them.

&gt;the aftermath of these circumcision experiments

Your past post cites a single, qualitative, cross-sectional, retrospective study of just 20 sex workers who derived their knowledge “primarily through informal sources, with very few FSWs reporting exposure to MC educational campaigns.” Do you think this study accurately portrays the effect of the circumcision campaigns? Did you consider that men may have an aversion to condoms regardless of circumcision status, which is a separate and larger problem? Did you notice the article you provided yourself states that ""according to the 2010/2011 Zimbabwe Health Demographic Survey (ZDHS), 14% of circumcised men in the country between the ages of 15 and 49 years contracted HIV as compared to those uncircumcised.""

&gt;the sheer number of studies, it is not significant to me

But it is *statistically* significant, and hence likely to be true regardless of its significance to you.

&gt;You can look up Brian Morris

Why? I’m concerned with the science itself, not ad hominem attacks. Your criticisms of the science are lacking. Though irrelevant, your page provides no substantiated claims condemning Brian Morris himself—but if you were concerned about biased sources, why cite “CircLeaks”?

&gt;The day we start routinely removing breasts from girls

This is not an apt comparison. The timing of these disease processes differs greatly. HIV is mostly acquired in young adulthood. Clinically significant breast cancer mostly occurs much later in life; the main risk factor for development of breast cancer is older age. Prophylactic mastectomies are performed ‘early’, [especially for familial cancers with greater risk at younger age](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/angelina-jolies-prophylactic-mastectomy-a-difficult-decision-201305156255), but for this biological reason are not needed even for young adult women.

&gt;a natural part of the male anatomy was inherently responsible for HIV transmission which I consider pro-MGM propaganda.

Why does it surprise you that *sexually transmitted* diseases have evolved to exploit the natural structure of *sexual* organs? Foreskins happen to contain a [higher number of target cells enabling HIV infection](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1867269/). Circumcision does not just protect against HIV, but [also chancroid, syphilis, and possibly herpes.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16581731) This is not propaganda, it is [well supported science.](http://www.circlist.com/considering/why-circ-protects.pdf)

&gt;This microtearing problem

In fact, uncircumcised penises [have been considered to be more susceptible to trauma during intercourse because of the vascularity of the frenulum.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127372/).

&gt;Notice the 'not statistically significant"" in the conclusion.

Notice that you have cited a single underpowered study, which still noted trends towards protection which did not reach significance. Notice that [meta-analyses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11089625) with much greater statistical power do demonstrate this difference. Finally, notice that your single study was still already considered within the original Wamai review, which extracts this factoid:

&gt;A subsequent study of several countries in sub-Saharan Africa…found women to be at 38% lower risk of being infected with HIV if their male partner was circumcised.157
&gt;157 Baeten, Donnell, Kapiga et al

Most airbases had darkrooms for surveillance and gun cam footage. Might have had one of them do it, or even had it developed at a local shop since he was based in a friendly zone (More than likely England).

For ground troops, film was sent to mobile processing units used by combat correspondents and Signal Corps photogs. Average GI's and Tommy's could have the film developed for a price (typically paid in material goods like Cigarettes, Ration items, loot from dead or captured enemy soldiers or hell...if the guys nice, for free). After the film was developed and any prints were made, the soldier could carry it around or send it home. Developing film, including drying it in the drying cabinets, can take around 40 minutes - depending on development and drying time.

Cameras were often frowned upon or prohibited items to carry as if the camera and film were captured, it could reveal things to the enemy that we didn't want them to know. However, the average GI didn't give a (to put it frankly) shit about that. When you could die at any minute, it puts certain parts of life into perspective.

If you meet some dude on craigslist selling a phone that he doesn't have a receipt for, or some way of proving he owned it I wouldn't buy it. Given the prevalence of credit card fraud (e.g.; where someone steals a CC, buys an ipad, sells it on CL) I wouldn't even buy it unless I could prove the story of why they suddenly need to sell a brand new iPad. 

You can be held criminally liable for buying it, you will lose the item, and you'll lose whatever cash you paid for it.

FeatherDie,AskReddit,1389236956.0,"My biggest problem starting weight loss was having to rethink everything. People who are naturally fit usually don't eat the same way or the same things. They eat junk food at parties and say they eat anything they want because the rest of the week they are being active and eating salads/lean meats/veggies/fruits. In my house you cleared your plate, it was a meat/potatoes kind of diet, and I'm not a naturally sports oriented or outdoorsy person. I love to learn, and most of that is done by reading or sitting to listen to others.

It's still my problem thinking this way. If I get in a rush, I go back to thinking about eating chips from a bag instead of slicing an apple. If I feel bad, I just want to curl up on the couch with a book. I'm not a picky eater, just not always conscious of healthy eating.

If I were going to start over, I would ask for ways to change my mindset. How would I change my instinctive thoughts to choose healthier options? That's usually where the most damage is done. Eating a friends house, vacation, in a rush, etc. 


Things that help me now :

Strict diet time-wise. I don't skip meals, no matter how small they are. It gives me anxiety and puts me on a starvation/binge cycle. I can eat whatever I want on my approved list of things, but I need to eat at certain times. 

I'm also trying to find an exercise program that fits. Haven't found one that adjust to how I feel every day yet.

EvanYork,TrueChristian,1389237051.0,"1.) The cycle of daily prayers in the Catholic church.  I believe they are typically only read in group settings by monastic communities.  Similar practices exist in Orthodox and Anglican churches.

2.) They used to measure the timing of the different prayers by hours since sunrise.  Third, Sixth, and Ninth hours were all marked with prayers, hence it became the liturdy of the hours.  ""Breviary"" refers to the book in which these prayers are printed.

3.) Structuring time around prayer is seen as a way of offering the day to God and centering your life around Him.

4.) Yes and no.  Is it a command in the same way baptism and charity are?  No, but the daily prayer cycles commanded in [Exodus 29:28-30 NRSV] set the basis for the Jewish daily prayers, which inspired Jewish daily prayers.  [Acts 4:25-26] shows Christians praying the psalms, which are today the bulk of the prayers in the hours kept by every church that does so.  I would also add that the keeping of daily prayers was included in the Didache, a Christian book older then some books of the Bible, so it's pretty clear that the concept is something that has existed since Apostolic times.

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389237079.0,"I'm lucky enough to have a hospital that has it and it is my pain relief of choice for this go-round.

Many hospitals use a low dose epidural that allows you to retain some feeling and allows for some movement, that's what I had last time.  So I was required to stay in bed and couldn't change position without assistance, but I was physically capable of moving.  I could feel the nurse poking my thigh, but couldn't tell she was doing it with ice.  I was able to walk without difficulty within a half hour of delivery and did do some wiggling around under my own steam even though I wasn't supposed to.  My son flopped sideways in my belly and my labour stalled, and after my doctor said the C-word I had my hubby help me roll over to my hands and knees to shake the beast back into position.  I wasn't supposed to, but I was physically capable.  So that dosage is somewhat similar to the Ambulatory Epidural.  If I'd had the ambulatory (walking) version, I would have been allowed to move with assistance from the nursing staff instead of doing it behind their backs!

A few things to be aware of, ""able"" to move doesn't mean ""allowed"".  One of the requirements for the hospital to offer the walking epidural is specially trained staff, you don't just get to wander around with it, you can move with appropriate supervision and assistance, which will limit your options more than going epidural free.  Your freedom of movement will depend on hospital's policies and likely the availability of staff.  You do still have something sticking out of your spine after all.

For me, its not &gt;that I don't believe I am absolutely right, its because I have respect &gt;for peoples beliefs, even though i cant see how they can possibly &gt;believe in it.

It's never about being absolutely right. Only the religious believe they have ALL the answers and the absolute truth. For the rest of us, it's about evidence and observations and the search for the truth.

I'm completely against this idea that one MUST respect the religious beliefs of others. Faith is not to be respected, especially when it leads to beliefs that contradict reality and logic.

If I have one major recommendation, it's that where you move to in LB matters quite a bit. All of the districts have their own character. For a guy in his mid 20s who enjoys the bar scene, I'd recommend checking out either 2nd street/Belmont Shore or Downtown (stick to west of Alamitos and south of 7th). They're both really fun areas to live in, and Downtown includes the police department and the convention center, so the police presence is pretty heavy, which keeps crime down for the most part. I never felt any less safe in downtown than I did in any other city, and that included frequently walking to/from bars at 1-2am."

Tannekr,DaystromInstitute,1389237508.0,"&gt; Additionally, while the Enterprise was lost at Veridian III, it was Riker who identified the flaw within the Klingon's ship with the plasma coil. Something that Data or Worf should have been all over. Without his actions, this battle would have been a catastrophic loss. Riker scored a victory against a foe that should have been tactically superior in all aspects, with Enterprise's shield out of the equation. 

I have two big issues with your interpretation of the scene.

1) His actions *did* result in a catastrophic loss. Trying to find an alternate solution to defeating the Duras' sisters at the expense of basic tactics is what results in the destruction of the Enterprise. He didn't order a rotation of shield harmonics (the one time it would have actually been effectual) and he didn't bother returning fire, two basic actions that most likely would have saved the ship. He shouldn't have had to figure out anything besides those.

2) The bird-of-prey *isn't* tactically superior ""in all aspects."" Even without shields, the Enterprise has more than enough fire power to inflict heavy damage and even destruction of the Duras' sisters. Instead, Riker ordered what appears to be one, solitary phaser blast. *That's it.* Where is the constant barrage of phasers and torpedoes we've frequently seen in the TV show?"

The_White_Baron,learnmath,1389237907.0,"Careful! 2*2 = 2+2 is a coincidence. Consider, for example, 2^(3) = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 != 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

The reason why 2^(1) = 2 = 2 x 1 is because 1 is the identity multiplier, and 2^(1) by definition is ""a product of one two"" (whatever that means). 

Multiplication is related to addition, but not in the way you've listed. For example, 2 x 2 means *two groups of two*. However, 2^(3) means *two sets of two sets of two*, in a sense. Let's say you take marbles. You'd group them as two sets of two, side by side, and then below them, two sets of two, side by side. When you combine them all together, you have 8 marbles. This is different from 2*3, which is 3 sets of two marbles, or 2 + 2 + 2.

How does 2^(-1) = 1/2 fall into this scheme? Division is always less intuitive, so if you're familiar with laws of exponents, I'd say that x^(a+b) = x^(a)x^(b). So let's say 2^(1 - 1) = 2^(0) = 1. Then that means 2^(1)2^(-1) = 1. Divide both sides by 2^(1) and you find

2^(-1) = 1/2^(1)! This is a nifty little result, and it works for any exponent. 2^(-4) = 1/2^(4). 

So, back to why 2^(-1) = 1/2? I view it as saying ""Split it (whatever it is) into 2^(1) equal pieces."" Or 2^(-3) = 1/2^(3) = 1/8. ""Split it into eight equal pieces."" "

Mongoosen42,vegan,1389238228.0,"Not really. Here's where this information comes from.

Back in the 1920's at the very beginning of nutrition science, they did an experiment where they fed rats different diets and compared their growth rates. The rats who were fed a diet of meat grew the fastest. Over several decades this experiment was repeated and altered and different combinations of amino acids were compared and it was discovered that a diet with an amino acid combination most closely resembling that of an egg caused the fastest growth. This is where the idea that having this specific combination of amino acids was best nutritionally came from. However, the side of this experiment that most people don't know is that while the rats given this combination of amino acids did grow the fastest, they also died the youngest.

So a couple things to note: 1) to my knowledge, this experiment was never done on humans, so anything we take from this is an extrapolation. 2) Even if we do extrapolate exactly, all we know is that from that precise balance of amino acids we get explosive growth, not optimum health. Of course, a lot of people equate growth with health, but that may not always be wise.

Now I KNOW I'm not going to buy the I'm Watch(I didn't realize the Bluetooth connection/tether drains both ways)! Thank you for that. I myself have a metawatch strata (it was cheaper at the time of purchase than a Pebble). Personally, I'm torn between the Meta and the Pebble, the both offer great features but they don't come in the same package. Meta (for me) is great if you can handle a rough end-user experience (not quite as developed as the Pebble in terms of apps/widgets), however, I love that everything is accessible through the ""hub"" widget screen.

The Pebble, however, has it's own features that I like, one of which is the diverse amount of apps and watch faces and such and the fact that the end-user experience is more polished. It looks cleaner and more user-friendly(not that the meta isn't user-friendly, just that the Pebble looks nicer for the average, fancy watch-toting person).

**TL;DR** (in the eyes of the average end-user) PEBBLE &gt;= metawatch strata(don't have a frame, too expensive and not my style) &gt; I'm Watch

(For me) PEBBLE = METAWATCH STRATA (can't say I'm Watch because I don't have one)

EvanYork,TrueChristian,1389238519.0,"What will happen if Ken Ham wins?  Literally since he started challenging Nye to debates people have been saying he'll get trashed, so it would be truly monumental if he actually wins.  

A lot of people are saying this debate is unfair since Ham is obviously wrong, but I would argue that Ham is actually an acknowledged expert in his field (Sort of like saying someone is the world's foremost chiropractor) whereas Nye is an engineer, not a biologist, and is perhaps less familiar with the material then Ham is.  I don't know if this is going to be a good debate, but I don't think it's such an obvious victory on Nye's part as most people seem to think it will be.

FWIW, I hope Ham wins.  Psuedoscience is an interest of mine.  I imagine this debate will have the same appeal as ""Ancient Aliens"" or ""Ghost Hunters International"" has.  Also, for the sake of a good story I'd like to see the underdog win.  Watching Ham win would be the equivalent of seeing Lex Luthor kill Superman - It's illogical and wrong, but we all secretly root for the villain.

**Tl;DR: Ken Ham is an ideological supervillian, and that's why I want him to win this debate.**

EDIT: I found [an interesting article](http://ncse.com/cej/3/2/creation-evolution-debates-whos-winning-them-now) from Nye's side of the issue that argues that such debates should not occur.  I don't know if I agree with it, but I thought it would be an interesting thing to bring up."

xenvy04,TumblrInAction,1389238687.0,"It depends on the game. There are some games where you're supposed to be able to customize your character as much as you'd like (MMORPGs). There are other games where I just expect to play as whatever I'm given.

For the latter, little to no fucks are given. But with the former, I don't like when I have constraints on my character customization. It annoyed me that crossdressing wasn't allowed in Pokemon (I chose a boy, and I wanted him to have a scarf, goddamnit!) and it annoys me when female characters in MMOs only have the option to wear tank tops and short skirts (to make them look sexy, I guess).

It's not going to stop me from playing any game. Like I wouldn't just not play Pokemon due to my lack of scarf, or in the case of an MMO, I would just play as a male character if I realized I didn't like the girls.

tl;dr It depends on the game and the way things are done. Some games are clearly catered to a male audience and make the female characters really unappealing to anybody who isn't craving attention. Other times, rigidity in character customization is annoying (though this is probably irritating to both men and women)."

I recommend the following to get better at roamer (loosely in order of importance):  

*   Just play more 6s. (PUGs/scrims/whatever)  
* Watch demos of better roamers and see what they do (and try to figure out why).  
*   Watch your own demos and look for mistakes you make and figure out how to not make those mistakes.  
*   Play jump maps and jump around on stock maps.  
*   Play SOAP-DM. (I find it much harder to fight multiple targets, therefore I put this above MGE)

&gt;[1](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006009). [[S] Cascade: Can it really be beaten? All that work and creativity coming together? If it can, I will proudly crown Andrew Hussie the greatest artist of all time!](/spoiler)

&gt;[2](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004827). [[S] Jade: Enter: Such chills, such epicness, it wasn't easy for number 1 to beat this.](/spoiler)

&gt;[3](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003840). [S] Descend: I find it funny this made it this high. I think this was the moment the Homestuck really grabbed me. [Until now, I expected them to gradually complete the game and come together at a final fight against the black king, following a set storyline of something like say Avatar: The Last Airbender.](/spoiler) This showed to me that the story in itself was not going to follow it's own rules and anything could happen.

&gt;[4](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007138)/[4](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007152). [[S] Dirk: Synchronize\Unite (Counts as one): I love the way Hussie is able to make these connections and let everything flow together, it's a really amazing thing](/spoiler)

&gt;[5](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003049). [S] Enter: OK I'll admit when I first read the story I wasn't really involved in it (I skipped the Midnight Crew Intermission :$). This finally got me to say, huh this looks like it could be pretty interesting.

&gt;[6](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006290). [[S] END OF ACT 6 INTERMISSION 1: I love this one because it's pretty much foreshadowing Act 6 and in a really beautiful way.](/spoiler)

&gt;[7](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007161). [[S] Caliborn: Enter.: And the big bad wolf is revealed. This was a really sad moment for me, mainly because this is the planet from [S] Roxy: Sleepwalk and, to me, it has the same connotations as burning a book. That instantly made me hate LE. Well played, Hussie, well played.](/spoiler)

&gt;[8](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004987). [[S] JOHN. RISE UP.: One of the prettiest songs I've heard in Homestuck, this flash really evokes emotion in you.](/spoiler)

&gt;[9](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006386). [[S] Roxy: Sleepwalk.: This one is really cool beacause it pretty much shows all the places the story has brought us, makes you realize just how big paradox space really is...](/spoiler)

&gt;[10](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004888). [[S] ==&gt;: The Forst and Frogs introduction. It's just beautiful.](/spoiler)

&gt;[11](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007338). [[S] ACT 6 ACT 4: Another storyteller flash. This one pretty much sums up all of the B2 kid's session in just a few minutes. And only using imagery. I find it fascinating how artists are able to do this sort of thing.](/spoiler)

&gt;[12](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002926). [S] Jade: Dream up extra arms and play advanced bass solo.: This one pretty much made me remeber that these kids are into something really big.

&gt;[13](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006472). [[S] Prince of Heart: Rise up.: Really good animation in this one, made me realize how much Hussie's skill has been improving over the past few years.](/spoiler)

&gt;[14](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=008178). [[S] ACT 6 ACT 6 INTERMISSION 1: Another great example of how Hussie's art is improving. Really make the comic feel alive](/spoiler)

&gt;[15](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003701). [S] WV?: Rise up.: We finally get to see the battlefield and the big war that's happening. A really good worldbuilder flash.

&gt;[16](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003500). [S] John: Reunite with your loving wife and daughter.: Does this really need an explaination? HOW DO I LIIIIVE WITHOUT YOUUUU???

&gt;[17](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005660). [[S] Flip.: A really really cool showdown. The glitches just make it more epic IMO.](/spoiler)

&gt;[18](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004478). [S] Make her pay.: A really cool summation of the [A2](/spoiler) troll's session and a great interpretation of Vriska's revenge. Amazing artwork as well, the differing styles are a really great supplement"

It is fine to look, but at some point it can and will start to affect you. Some therapy as you have said would not hurt either. Some counties or cities will have free therapy for people in your position. Just don't jump into therapy because you think you need it though. Start therapy when you are ready for it. When that gray haze you are in right now starts to darken, and the weight seems unbearable. When you start to feel that and feel trapped is when you want to get help. When you feel that you really do need some sort of help..

Yes, I am saying that things could be worse. They may go that way for you emotionally. Just try to keep your wits about you.

I would tell you my story, but it has gotten old and stale. It is finally a burden that is no longer a weakness, but another chapter in my life that is closed. Good for the annual remembrance of the event. Things will get better. One day.

Sharkictus,DCcomics,1389239374.0,"It switches back and forth for me.

When I was a kid, I liked Batman and Spider-man equally. When I was in Junior High I liked Marvel, and Spider-man specifically. I got to caught up in the hype about Spider-man 3, and engrossed myself into Venom wikipedia articles. It was in 8th grade when Iron Man came out I think, and I remember reading about the plans for the Avengers. 

Spider-man had a a spectacular cartoon running. Iron Man had a decent. 

Then it switched around when Geoff Johns started revealing new lantern colors. I was fascinated by the wikipedia's section on the emotional spectrum. Around the same time the Dark Knight came out. I was pretty Bat-obsessed for a while. Arkham Asylum and Arkham City did feed it. 

I was pretty hyped about Captain America, but I forgot about it shortly before it came out. Avengers came out, and I loved it, but I didn't actually feel much research-y hype for it. The only MCU movies I had watched were iron Man 1 and Thor before Avengers. 

Then Injustice Gods Among Us came out. Reading it's prequel comic solidified me into the DC fan I am today. Green Lantern #20 actually is what kept me in. Trinity War starting soon after...and here I am. 

I love the men as gods aspects DC has, and it better unified universe while keeping the worlds separate enough to enjoy. I prefer it's time passes strategy, reboot instead of floating timeline.  

Marvel right now, I'm still too burned out on Brand New Day Spider-man...I probably won't be into Marvel until Quesada leaves. I think the yearly crisis crossovers, and having awesome consequences for a while until the crossover after next. Just became too much, they needed a cooldown year. 

Actually what Marvel did is what happening to Batman for me, it's just too much going on, I won't jump in, and even if I did, when I take my break, it'll be too hard to jump in. "

The right says, ""The left spends big.""
The left says, ""They are grinches.""

There are a number of ways to approach this.  How many jobs are unfilled in the USA?  I know people are going to say, ""There's X amount of applicants for every single job!""  But are we talking EVERY job?  Or just the ones people think would be ideal.  The ""Help Wanted"" section of the paper has not gone away.

So conservatives say, ""We'd like to see the spending offset somehow.""

Perhaps continue it IF people agree to enroll in continuing education to learn a new skill that will help them in the job market.

If a person gets a part-time job... but it doesn't pay the same amount as unemployment...then maybe have a rule that says, ""You can work, but we will also *augment* your income with some income until things get better.""

Perhaps make it available in particular for those who are older and who have been laid off.  It's harder for a 55 year-old to find a job.

Let's look at other cuts to offset the massive cost.

Let's take a look at THIS...because it shouldn't be happening:

http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/10/thousands-of-millionaires-collect-unemployment/

Because saying, ""Those mean Republicans..."" won't solve the problem of accruing debt that will be the responsibility of future generations.

And let's quit blaming the GOP for the state of the economy and the jobs market.  There are many jobs bills stalled in the House that the Senate won't entertain.

The guys I go to take their time to develop flavors to their personal style of vapeing. So I know of a few vendors that vape similar gear to me. They also run cols that are in the same ohm range as mine.

So what makes a juice premium is that the owner or flavor artist of the company gives a damn about end product and would vape it them selves."

im_eh_Canadian,WTF,1389240122.0,"as a fire sprinkler fitter who  accidentally flooded an airport i find this hilarious.

 the area i flooded was an addition to the airport and i didn't ruin anything but i did set off flow sensors that triggered fire alarms and the entire airport began to evacuate.

man did i have to go through a lot of paper work after that one, even though it wasn't my fault 

id also like to say that this is 100% user error.

i have seen 30 year old sprinkler systems with 150PSI on them that didnt leak a drop. they were full of gunk but the pipes were not rusted at all.


after reading the article and watching the video its pretty clear what happened
 
some one didnt tighten a victolic coupling enough on a main line. ive never seen/heard  this happen because before a building can be legally occupied the system has to be 100% tested and ready to go. if you properly tighten a coupling there is no chance in hell it is coming loose. i have put my full weight tiny 1 1/4"" ones, a 6 or 8inch coupling can hold a lot. 

maybe something fell on the pipe or maybe a riser clamp was installed wrong but whatever the problem is its fucking hilarious because the same thing happened to me

Alkalannar,cheatatmathhomework,1389240227.0,"log_2(2x^(2))log_2(16x) = 18log_2(x)

Use log(ab) = log(a) + log(b) and log(a^(n)) = nlog(a) to get (2log_2(x) + 1)(log_2(x) + 4) = 18log_2(x)

Now let y = log_2(x)

(2y + 1)(y + 4) = 18y

2y^(2) + 9y + 4 = 18y

2y^(2) - 9y + 4 = 0

By quadratic formula, you have [9 +- (81 - 32)^(1/2)]/4 = (9 +- 7)/4.

The possible solutions are y = 4 and y = 1/2

But y = log_2(x)

So x = 16 or x = 2^(1/2)

Check both of these possible solutions to see if they work"

Seems that that is only setting up a Family View where only some of the account's own games are visible plus restricting some other stuff like community posting and you have to leave family view by entering a pin to see everything on the account. 

To me that kinda clashes with setting up dedicated child accounts, like they talk about here since this concept of Family Games really only makes sense if you aren't using the same account as your child. (and what if you have more than one child? With one being older and one being younger and they should see different games?)

For my wife, her iPad is great.  We have three in the house.  She uses it to browse the web, do simple email, all the things an iPad is good at.  But, I've invested time and energy setting up my laptop exactly the way I want it.  I have my PaperWhite for nighttime reading.  I have my TV hooked to Netflix and Amazon Prime.  I have ChromeCast for anything else.  I don't just browse the web, I have a routine of checking RSS feeds, my favorite news sites, and Reddit using RES.  I even have a way I like to use RES to browse.

I think it's more than just that I'm perfectly happy with this setup, a la your dial-up connection analogy.  I actually feel like the iPad is going to be a step back for me.  Why would I want to hold an iPad to watch a movie, when I can just use my TV natively?  Why would I want to use Alien Blue when I can have my big laptop and my DarkField mouse and be all comfy in my recliner?  Why would I want to play an iPad game when I have my XBox and my gaming laptop?

I really wish I could find some kind of use case that an iPad met where it did the job not just as well but better than my current setup.  I'm not adverse to adding a device to my stack.  I just can't seem to find a good use for the thing aside from portability outside of the house.

I guess I was hoping for some kind of combination of apps and workflow that was much better with the iPad.  As it stands, I think I'm going to keep my current setup, sell the iPad and buy a windows tablet or XBox One with the money.  I just think it's a better use of my money."

If Nye uses only standard pro-Evolution arguments, Ham will win, because he argues against those for a living.  If Ham uses standard Creationist arguments, he will lose, because if he uses the expected arguments Nye will have rebuttals ready.  If Ken Ham is any good at debating, he'll skip the obvious crap arguments (""The fossil record is inconsistent, etc) and go for the lesser-known crap arguments (""Domestic dogs have less genetic information then wolves,"" whatever that means).  When you're working with extremely obscure, pointless ""facts"" to support your position, it becomes really difficult to argue against you.

Basically: Debates aren't about who's correct, they're about who can win.  And, more often then not, that involves being able to use fallacious or non-factual arguments in subtle enough ways that your opponent cannot argue against them.

What joxeankoret said about holes is true, but what you can also do is hijack extra space in other data sections, such as music or video data. That way you have lots of room to work with. In theory you could also mess with the size of the DOL sections (below) but your IDA plugin will likely not help you with that and you'll have to do it by hand. Not the end of the world, but not ideal.

Arguments are passed [left-to-right in r3 through r12](http://hitmen.c02.at/files/yagcd/yagcd/chap3.html) and then onto the stack from there. The caller cleans up the stack. That website is incredibly helpful, by the way, for both hardware and software. To call a function would look something like this in assembly:

    # save previous register values
    stmw r3, 128(r1) # r1 is stack pointer

    # arguments
    li r3, 45 # first argument
    lis r4, 0xDEAD # second argument, high word
    ori r4, 0xBEEF # second argument, low word
    ...etc

    # call function
    lis r0, 0x8134 # upper word of fn address. In this case it's __card_read
    ori r0, 0x45e0 # lower word of fn address
    mtctr r0
    bctrl # this is the actual call instruction
    
    # restore previous register values
    lmw r3, 128(r1)

You will need a compiler or at least an assembler, unless you feel like self-assembling (I don't recommend this). I recommend [DevKitPPC](http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitPPC).

I'm not entirely sure how to find the input handling routine. [Here](http://hitmen.c02.at/files/yagcd/yagcd/chap9.html) is the relevant YAGCD section for that. Look around for those addresses in the code, or break on memory access in Dolphin (You may need a DebugFast build for this). Keep me posted on this one when/if you find it.

The DOL format *has* been reverse engineered, by the way. [It's very simple](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/DOL). DevKitPPC also has an elf2dol executable you can use to convert ELF files to DOL files, though this won't help you much.

You'll be reversing PowerPC code and you probably don't know PowerPC since it's not 2005 anymore, so I would recommend this IDA Pro extension: [PPC2C](https://www.hex-rays.com/contests/2009/PPC2C/readme.txt). It converts stupidly [long and convoluted PPC instructions](http://imgur.com/I75Nkah) into their [C equivalents](http://imgur.com/jd0SIrY).

Once you have this worked out in an emulator, by the way, you can convert it to an ActionReplay code if you have one, so that you can run it on the console."

The whole spiel is at JWfacts.com, but essentially the bible only mentions paradise in four scriptures. Three of the scriptures refer obviously to heaven and the Society agrees. The fourth is when Jesus was speaking to the man nailed to the next cross over and says ""truly I say to you, you will be with me in paradise"". 

So just on the face of it, it sounds like here too paradise refers to heaven, where Jesus is. But the watchtower says that Jesus would *hardly* invite such a sinner to heaven, therefore he must mean earthly paradise. 

There are other scriptures that described things like the meek inheriting the earth, and the wolf and the lamb, but I direct you to JWfacts for more. 

Once one gets away from the thought control and direction of the Watchtower Society and re-reads those scriptures objectively and WITH the context instead of out of context, it becomes pretty clear they don't mean what the Society says. "

daisyismydog,RandomActsofMakeup,1389241239.0,"Okay, first off we gotta narrow down your definition of cruelty-free. It means a lot of different things to different people and here are some of the aspects that people use to define it:  

1. The company (not including parent company and other ones owned by parent company) states on their website that they are cruelty-free or are certified by PETA.  
2. The company (not including parent+) does not test any of its single ingredients, unfinished products, and does pay another independent company to test the products for them.  
3. The company (not including the parent+) is verified by Leaping Bunny (PETA = [bunny heart](http://shopkaunis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/PETA_logo.jpg), Leaping Bunny = [leaping bunny](http://leapingbunny.org/images/lbLogo-facebook.jpg)). This can sometimes be tricky because Leaping Bunny can only certify companies that produce products that can be used up so they don't certify some brands like Real Techniques if they only produce brushes but sometimes the bristles can be natural hair/sourced cruelty-free/not sourced cruelty-free (although I find it hard to verify this and prefer synthetic bristles anyway).  
4. The company (not including parent+) does not sell in China because the Chinese government requires testing for products sold (but not the ones only manufactured) in China.  
5. All of the above, but extended to ingredient suppliers (which is really difficult to do and most of the time you just have to take the company's word that they're trying to buy from CF suppliers).  
6. All of the above, but extended to parent+ (e.g. Urban Decay is CF and certified by Leaping Bunny, but its parent company--L'Oreal--is not...Also goes for The Body Shop).  
7. All of the above, and the ingredients used to produce the products are not derived from animals (silk powder, beeswax, carmine, etc.).

Let me know which category you're using as your definition of cruelty-free and then we can go from there! :) "

davinox,writing,1389241515.0,"I graduated a few years ago. I was also a creative writing major.

Being an English major gave me the time and place to read novels, poems, and short stories for several years.

It also made me extremely disillusioned with academia. When I applied to college, I assumed literary academics were interested chiefly in what made literature great. For example, I assumed we'd read Shakespeare and discuss why his metaphors were beautiful, profound, etc.

Instead I went to classes that talked about gender in Shakespeare. Politics in Shakespeare. Race in Shakespeare. What Shakespeare ""means today"" in our society. Etc. etc. Never once did we break apart a beautiful metaphor. Never once did we dare talk about the style of Shakespeare, the strength of his voice, the depth of his characterization. Literature was a vehicle for second-rate sociology. Many times I felt like I was in a book club. Again, for the MAJORITY of my classes this was the case, and I went to a highly acclaimed school, although I had a couple of professors who bucked this trend.

The English major didn't really help me as a writer, either. It taught me to write in an ""academic"" style, which is a kind of obfuscation. You can't believe how poorly most literary criticism is written. Sure, when you first read it, you may believe it's ""over your head."" When you break apart a critic like Barthes, however, you realize that, besides a few nuggets of gold buried deep in a few papers, it is very much ""under your head."" 

[This Calvin and Hobbes strip sums it up perfectly.](http://fearfulfantasist.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/calvin-and-hobbes-the-purpose-of-writing.jpg)

There are some good moments. The epiphanies that come from understanding a beautiful work are fantastic. The small number of literary criticism that is well written is enjoyable, and you won't ever have the time later in life to read it. (Almost all of the great stuff, in my opinion, has been done by great writers themselves, not by professional critics!) 

But ultimately, I'm not sure how much it teaches you in terms of writing, and I'm not sure it teaches you critical thinking, either. I've seen some extremely POOR writers graduate as English majors. How? Because when you're writing an English paper, it's not necessarily best to value clarity or style. In fact, if you are too direct, too interesting, too ""out of the academic mold,"" your may be penalized. Professors aren't teaching their students to write essays fit for the New Yorker; they are training students to write for obscure journals. It doesn't make any sense.

3^(3) → three sets of three sets of marbles, at this point, all clumped together, compactly, in a nice group.

(3 x 3) x 3 → Rearranged to a more suggestive form

(3 x 3) + (3 x 3) + (3 x 3) → Suggestive form tells us there are three groups of equal size, and we separate the one group into three.

(3 + 3 + 3 + .....) → We split each new group into a group of three, and notice that each group now has three pieces. We've decomposed the set of 27 marbles into groups of three.

****

3^(2) → One solid clump of marbles

3 x 3 → Rearrange to more suggestive form

(3 + 3 + 3) → split into three equal groups of 3

****

3^(1) → one solid clump of marbles.

3 → Hey, it's already a group of three! Nifty.

****

3^(0) → ??????

Brick wall. Let's try working backwards to see what was happening. 

When we had 3^(1), we noticed we have *one* group of three.

When we had 3^(2), we noticed we had *three* groups of three.

When we had 3^(3), we noticed we had *nine* groups of three, or three groups of three groups of three.

So 3^(0) tells us we have *zero* groups of three, whatever that means. This is where it gets tricky. That's ambiguous, right? Certainly 2 marbles is zero groups of three. 5 is zero groups of three. We know it has to be less than 3, because of our pattern of losing marbles by losing exponents. 

However, we still have a *group*, so there have to be *some* marbles. Zero tells us that we want the *fewest amount of marbles without breaking them.* This is accomplished by taking one marble. Evidently, 

3^(0) → Zero groups of three marbles → 1 marble.

Now let's keep going, and things get even stranger.

****

3^(-1) → ?????

Brick wall. We know a few things though. Since we lowered the exponent, the number of marble has to decrease, right? Well, we already hit the smallest number of whole marbles last time with the zero exponent. Evidently, we need to start *breaking* the marbles to achieve this.

What should we break it into? The negative exponent means we *took away* from the marble. We got that far. We also noticed that we need *some* amount of marbles. We can't have *no* marbles. Finally, we've noticed that since 3 is the number we're taking the exponent to, we've seen some symmetry pop up with the number 3. *How many groups of three have we been making?*

Evidently, 3^(-1) means *how many pieces should we break this marble into so that if we took* ***three*** *pieces of of these shards, we obtain the whole marble?* Almost tautologically, we need three pieces if we break it into three pieces. But wait! This is 1/3.

3^(-1) → three shards of marble → 1/3

Does this idea of 3^(-1) even make sense? I'll try sketching an idea of why it's plausible. 3^(-1) is **kind of** like 3^(1), right? Only difference is a negative sign in the exponent. We also know that 1 and (-1) are linked in a fundamental way, so we expect 3^(1) and 3^(-1) to be linked in a fundamental way. And we noticed that 3^(1) was  *one group of three marbles*. Surely 3^(-1) should be somehow linked to 3^(1). From 3^(-1) we got *three groups (shards) of one marble*

Look at that symmetry!

3^(1) → **One** group of **three** marbles.

3^(-1) → **Three** groups of **one** marble.

imnotminkus,personalfinance,1389241880.0,"http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service

&gt; What loans are eligible for forgiveness? 

&gt;Only loans you received under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program are eligible for PSLF. Loans you received under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, the Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program, or any other student loan program are not eligible for PSLF. 

&gt;If you have FFEL Program or Perkins Loan Program loans, you may consolidate them into a Direct Consolidation Loan to take advantage of PSLF. However, only payments you make on the new Direct Consolidation Loan will count toward the required 120 qualifying payments for PSLF.

&gt;For a payment to count as one of the required 120 qualifying payments, you must be a full-time employee at a qualifying public service organization on the date that your federal loan servicer receives your monthly Direct Loan payment. 

&gt;Qualifying employment is any employment with a federal, state, or local government agency, entity, or organization or a not-for-profit organization that has been designated as tax-exempt by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The type or nature of employment with the organization does not matter for PSLF purposes. Additionally, the type of services that these public service organizations provide does not matter for PSLF purposes. 

&gt;A private not-for-profit employer that is not a tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC may be a qualifying public service organization if it provides certain specified public services. These services include emergency management, military service, public safety, or law enforcement services; public health services; public education or public library services; school library and other school-based services; public interest law services; early childhood education; public service for individuals with disabilities and the elderly. The organization must not be a labor union or a partisan political organization. 


Here's what she has to do in order to get qualifying loans forgiven:  be employed at a qualifying employer full time (annual average of 30+ hours/week) for a total of 10 years while making payments.

She should make the minimum payments possible on loans that you're sure can be forgiven.  This may involve changing the repayment plan.

Be sure to look into how marriage will affect the loans."

That cover would be a good avenue for determining the exact context, but the internet isn't telling me anything.

As an aside, it's generally very wise to display a healthy skepticism towards *anything* written about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, particularly stuff that's designed as easily consumable media such as this.  While that doesn't make it necessarily wrong, reading through its summary it uses evocative terms like ""looted"" and ""plundered"" to appeal to emotions, even though the books seem to have been put in the national archive, not taken by a mob looking for valuables (which is what those words suggest).  Nearly everyone writing has a motive (in this case, explicitly), and it's best to keep it in mind.

doc_birdman,batman,1389242729.0,"I think Keaton played a good Wayne, but not a great Batman. Val Kilmer.... No. I want to like him in that role but I feel like he failed. He tried really hard I feel though. George Clooney was a *different*. He didn't play the aloof and ditsy Wayne but the very cocky and arrogant Wayne. He did that well. But his Batman was almost exactly the same. Christian Bale is my favorite live action portrayal so far because his Wayne is ditsy, aloof, carefree, and irresponsible. His Batman (say what you will about his voice) is fucking spot on at times, and maybe a tad off at other times but I'll chalk that up to story writing. TAS is my favorite overall portrayal of not only Batman, but the entire Batman universe. It's pretty damn dark at times without making it unfit for kids. Conroy when voicing the character of Batman did an amazing job, and his voicing of Wayne was perfect. They basically became two separate characters *which they are*. Honorable mentions: the Arkham series has done a fantastic job of balancing realism and the fantasy elements of the series. Going back to that idea that Wayne and Bats are essentially two separate people, Wayne has a line that says (when talking about Hugo Strange): ""He knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman."" It shows a huge psychological disconnect with this character and is actually kind of horrifying and depressing if you think about the implications of that line. It's almost as if our hero multiple personalities. "

No one wanted to hear that we more than DOUBLED the food stamp rolls in the past five years.

They just wanted to screech, ""GOP wants to starve babies!""

Even Obama wants to lower the corporate tax rate.  Why aren't we doing that?

Look... this unemployment and food stamp culture is NOT a boon to the economy.  JOBS are a boon to the economy.

Get the government out of the way.

Liquid/Cream: NYX, ELF, Physician's Formula, Mineral Essence, theBalm (cream), Jordana, Tarte, Too Faced, Lorac (liquid and cream), Illamasqua, Hourglass (liquid and cream-to-powder)  

Powder (some repeats from first list, assume pressed unless stated otherwise): NYX, Physician's Formula, Mineral Essence (loose), Milani, Too Faced, Hourglass  

**Indie brands**  

Assume loose powder unless stated otherwise: Aromaleigh 2.0, DreamWorld Hermetica, Meow Cosmetics, The All Natural Face (cream, liquid, and loose powder available), Lucy Minerals, Performance Colors (cream-to-powder) 

This is definitely not meant to be an exhaustive list and while I can't guarantee the accuracy of each company's status all of these do fit your definition as far as I know. Companies can change their policies quickly though, so be sure to double-check before you purchase. 

I know you mentioned that you want something suitable for dry/flaky skin, but I thought I'd throw in some recommendations for powder in case anyone else is interested :) I also have dry/flaky skin and I find that indie companies offer the widest selection of colors so I've gone ahead with using loose powder foundation but moisturizing a bit extra beforehand. I've been successful with this approach and I know at least one other person on /r/indiemakeupandmore does this!

Specifically for you &amp; without knowing your budget, I think I would check out NYX's foundation. I don't have personal experience with it, but /u/Sssamanthaa submitted a great B&amp;A using their foundation. I know she can probably make anything look good, but it might be a good place to start. If you're looking at more mid-range products, I'd definitely go into Sephora and ask for some samples. If you're looking at indie brands, they have samples available for a nominal fee and they often offer color-matching services where you can send them a picture of your face (no makeup, indirect sunlight) and they can recommend some colors for you to try.

1.  Don't buy weed from any one that says they're ""90% sure its weed""

Happened to me once or twice when I first started smoking a lot,  I literally thought I would die.  All you need to fix that is lots of water and some OJ (for the sugar).

I've never heard of someone getting that sick off just weed.  You may want to consider getting a new dealer.  If your friend laced your weed (either gave you a laced bag by accident, or maybe just did it to be funny),  then you should consider not smoking his bud anymore.

Satherton,AskMen,1389243587.0,I had a issue in the last year or so. premature ejaculation which i never had a problem with ever in my life it just like went loopy. I was with two new girls after a long period of being with no one so that messed up my stamina. Iv gotten over it but god damn that was stupid. i was use to lasting as long as i wanted to not being able to control myself vaginally. I changed my masterbatory habbits as well as something i figured out worked for me. Holding the base of my penis while in side of the women while thrusting worked soo great. after i got past the first min or two i was in the clear.

what do you not like having a spammable 220 hp shield

do you enjoy not dying


i've always liked phoenix better because it's harder to itemize against since it does magic damage and you can circumvent pushing too hard by throwing it in turtle and last hitting with that but tiger is really good for cheesing and bullying; a double tiger strike is absolutely brutal as far as damage is concerned. That being said, udyr has more than enough sticking power to kill someone straight up or seriously hurt them with phoenix, it's just tiger gives more brute force faster. Also, phoenix can play the pressure game way better than tiger can later on because your proxy is so strong it's ridiculous. I can often force enemy laners to give up their tower by proxying behind them so they have no minions to back them up at their turret while my team pushes in.

ALSO: Udyr is a god at proxying BECAUSE he can tank so well. My usual jungle build when ahead is Golem/tabis/triforce/fh/banshees which lets you tank like a monster. You can 100-0 any turret with no minions around you with that build and solo baron as soon as you have your frozenheart. Make sure you get the tabis at least and if you need to towerdive a chain vest and you can tank easily. Just not tanking more than 1 or 2 hits is also good too; just use turtle to absorb the hit and then clear the wave with a couple of flames (lifestealing some hp back with turtle also works) and then you can pincer them for the kill if it's safe or just zone them from defending the tower if you feel running in to engage would probably kill you. Remember that playing the pressure game doesn't mean you go ham for kills when you don't need to.

ALSO ALSO tiger stance doesn't draw turret aggro when you push, while phoenix's aoe burn and flame procs do if an enemy champion is nearby, so that's another reason why I love getting one point in tiger at level 10. Maximum pushing pressure and they can do nothing to stop you because tiger+turtle just makes you unkillable while you tear it down in front of them."

Frank obviously hit for more power based on his natural size. Edgar never tried to hit for power. outside of the home run numbers, their stats are nearly identical, and if the mariners weren't stupid (as they still are) they wouldn't have blocked Edgar's major league progression by Jim Presley. 

Don't get me wrong, Thomas completely deserves to be in, even on the first ballot, but Edgar needs to get in, and he deserves to be. Look at both their numbers side by side and you'll see they aren't that different, Thomas doesn't blow him away outside of RBI's and HR's, and their is more to baseball then just power hitters. Edgar wasn't given an opportunity to become a full time player until he was 26 even though his minor league numbers priced he was ready. Frank was at 22. He was cock blocked getting into the majors and still produced hof numbers, now he's getting cock blocked again. hopefully in a few years voters realize the error of their ways just like the mariners did in 89.

If you're having pretty regular sex you could be desensitized to the softer pressures of masturbation, unless you're ramming something into your vagina at maximum speed. 

Sex can also cause tissue damage if there isn't enough lubrication, which I would think could cause the same desensitization, making it impossible to orgasm at all.

Your intimate bond with your partner could be intensifying your orgasms, whereas personal masturbation doesn't really offer you any surprises.


If you aren't able to have an orgasm on your own or with a partner for an absurd amount of time, you might consider stopping sexual contact and setting an appointment with your Gynecologist. Female sex organs are both super tough and super sensitive."

Aprikoat,summonerschool,1389244933.0,"Never ever get bear stance level 2. I main phoenix udyr jungle but even on the offchance I lane him I never ever get bear level 2. Sure, there are instances where you might want the stun for a possible gank or catch or something, but what happens if it fails or if you don't immediately get level 3 off of it? You lose all of your sustain until you get that level 3 which could cost you the lane, in this case. 

If tiger, go Q-W-Q-E then max Q-W-E-R.

The only reason I get the point in tiger at level 10 when I go phoenix is because the flame proc doesn't work on towers, but the aspd from tiger helps shove them down way faster. Phoenix at level 1 doesn't offer that sort of utility so I would ignore it outright.

Also I think since targon's got nerfed duo top fell out of favor immediately and even then I never liked it. By not having a jungler you're basically forfeiting any and all global pressure that one offers. Your buffs and camps are free reign for the taking and while both top laners are sharing gold and levels the other jungler just gets fed off the free camps and snowballs his other lanes easy+has all the dragon and baron control and can easily contest it because there are 2 people top (and he has smite). Plus, the jungler is actually probably going to be strong enough to 2v2 you the more time they have to ramp up, especially if their solo top can just freeze and cs under turret or something."

There are people who are selling real money for bitcoin and vice versa. The exchange rate changes based on what the market will bear. This is the same as any other currency.

People trade in this market for the exact same reason they trade in most other markets - they believe the value of x with respect to y will increase on some timescale. The more people buy bitcoins with dollars, the more bitcoins are worth with respect to dollars. Naturally, this would be because it represents a market demand for bitcoins and bitcoin-accepting services, but the idea of bitcoin being a 'bubble' is predicated on the idea that people are buying bitcoin because *they believe* it's a good investment, not because *it is* a good investment - not because there's real demand but because speculators keep buying and the value keeps going up. Speculators tend to purge an investment as soon as it reaches its maximum, and this rapid sell-off causes a drop in bitcoin which is also *not* proportional to market demand, but can sink the whole market if it drops so low that the non-speculators sell out too."

She's also interesting in that despite her image as a Southern Belle, and her desire to be seen as such, she's really the opposite of what Southern women (and women in general) were supposed to be at that time. 

As for the book in general, it absolutely does glorify slavery (and the Confederacy, and the KKK). It's part of a ""Lost Cause"" revival in the 1930s that portrayed the antebellum South as a noble, chivalrous place and that saw slavery as a benign institution wherein slaves were happy and loyal to their masters. There is a lot of stuff in *Gone With the Wind* that is ridiculous, ahistorical, and just straight-up incredibly racist. 

That said, it's also quite well-written, the characters are complex and deeply flawed, and it's one of the most popular novels in the American canon. So I would say it's both a classic masterpiece and ignorant drivel, all in one. I really like *Gone with the Wind*, I think Scarlett is a brilliant character and her relationship with Rhett is one of the funniest and most interesting in literature, but nothing bothers me more than people who blindly love GwtW without acknowledging its awful ideological underpinnings."

I populate all the basic tag info including the record label if I have it. I rename my files as artist-album-track#-title. Each album is in a folder named album artist-year-album, nested within a folder named album artist, nested within a folder named after a particular genre subset like Gothic - industrial - dance. I don't include the year in the file name since it's in the tag and on the folder. 

For compilation albums I set the album artist as Various Artists. The files are renamed as Album-Track#-Artist-Title. The folder is named Album artist-year-album, inside a folder called Various Artists, inside the genre subset folder. 

I always use a two digit track number. I also rename multiple disk albums as 1 album with continuous track numbers. I differentiate between disks with a disk number tag. 

I use a program called Tag &amp; Rename to do everything. I have used it for at least the last 10 years now and have been unable to find anything that I like better.

then i have to get a witness usually the site foreman and test it at 200PSI for 2 hours.

if it holds for 2 hours the foremen will sign off and its tested.


a building is split up into many different zones. so usually you test 1 zone at a time making it easy to locate a leak.

ive never had a sprinkler head leak on me. they are made of brass and the threads seal very well.

its couplings, Mechanical tee's pretty much any fitting with a rubber gasket, this is were you will get your leaks. If done properly a thread will never leak.

if their is a leak that's big enough you can hear the air pissing out and just fix it but if you cant find a leak but you know you have one.

We picked one substance on one planet under ""standard"" (read: arbitrarily close to the average) conditions, changed its temperature (which is a *really* arbitrary measure because it only has meaning, in this sense, for systems of a certain size) by 1 degree Celsius (the Celsius degree being arbitrarily sized). And how did we pick this measure? Arbitrarily. You could argue it was a *good* pick, but there's no way you could prove it's the *best possible* pick.

I felt like I breathed a sigh of relief because in comparing myself to my peers, I never understood why I felt different and the description for INFJ made me realize I'm not a freak, there are many more people who think the same way! And the idea of this really comforted me. It really was a game changer, after I took this test I slowly started accepting myself for who I am and my strengths.

Yea, it'll be harder. It'll make your diaphram ""work"" harder. But you don't need to spend $80 in order to do what a towel and some duct tape will do equally as well. And either way you look like a fool.

It isn't going to ""stress"" your lungs. You should learn how breathing works (specifically how the diaphragm works).

In no way will training with one make you run ""faster"" - it may decrease the effort you need in order to breathe without it, but no more than any other deep breathing exercise.

ajdeemo,DotA2,1389247724.0,"you only have so much control over the game. you cannot control your teammates. as they say, hindsight is 20/20. don't assume that your teammates are bad from only one game, and there are often various circumstances as to why they are doing bad that you could help. 

stomps are just a thing of dota. you'll have to get used to it. it's very easy to get ahead with a few mistakes from your opponent, and most players aren't good at all when it comes to playing from behind. 

take it as a learning experience. losing is the best way to get better, because it's a lot easier to analyze a game where you're losing rather than one you're winning. take a good honest look at the game and ask yourself what you could have done. 

here are some common examples:

1. did you feed in lane? dying isn't as easily preventable as the average pub player will have you to believe. sometimes the enemy mid will tp to your lane and instantly kill you before your mid has a chance to alert you. if you're dying in lane repeatedly, consider leaving the lane to try helping out other lanes. alternatively, you can also try to hide in lane, only leeching exp from the enemy creeps and sacrificing last hits for safety

2. is your teammate feeding? if they're mid, try ganking the opponent mid (unless you're a carry and need to farm). are they in a side lane? you can try helping them there by ganking as well. you can also try to carry a tp in case the enemy tower dives your allies. it's quite potent and can turn around into kills for your team. 

3. are you a carry and your team is feeding? there are a few things you can do: if you can split push, that can prevent the enemy team from pushing for a while, allowing you to farm more. you can also try to go for more early and mid game oriented items so that you can fight early; this helps to prevent the enemy steamrolling you with their advantage. finally, you can simply try to farm as much as you can and try to catch up. only recommended if your team can turtle well and their team is trying to push early. also works well with split pushing mentioned earlier."

This is just me as an ex-mormon living in Utah talking, though."

eighthgear,asoiaf,1389248263.0,"I think it comes down to the fact that most people would rather live under a King Renly than a King Stannis. I certainly would. Renly's claim wasn't just weak, it was pretty much baseless. Of course, without Stannis's shadow magic, Renly would have taken King's Landing and crowned himself by Right of Conquest. Regardless of the weakness of his claim, Renly was able to bring together the Stormlands and the Reach, and was in the process of conducting negotiations with Catelyn, representative of the North and the Riverlands. As King, Renly would have been able to bring an effective peace to much of the realm - the Westerlands may have tried to hold out, but that is about it.

On the other hand, we the readers know that Stannis's claim was what was rightful, since we know that Joffrey and his siblings were born of incest. The Westerosi don't know that. Stannis claimed it, but considering that Stannis was the individual who stood the most to gain by the delegitimization of Cersei's children, any right-minded individual would suspect whether Stannis was telling the truth. Anyways, Stannis had a very slim basis of support, and his only really loyal followers were members of a religion foreign to Westeros. Had Stannis of taken King's Landing, years of civil war would have likely continued (war that could very likely lead to a Stannis defeat).

So, do you support a man who could have lead a (relatively) peaceful Westeros, or do you support the man who had the right to lead Westeros? It isn't an easy question to answer, but I would choose the former."

No_Inside_Voice,Entomology,1389248542.0,"I don't feel it is necessary to go into detail with people who do not know the intricacies of insect physiology.  By your definition we should just get rid of all sub-reddits dealing with insects since there are exceptions to literally every ""rule"" of science.  Or, we could just assume that they don't care about the exceptions and want to know a simple ""rule of thumb"". 

I guess I'll get more specific since my generalized answer wasn't enough for /u/quaoarpower.  Tenebrio is the AFP (anti freeze protein) present in beetles.  Just in case you weren't already aware, beetles are the most diverse order of insects making up about 40% of insect species.  

The other AFP is Dendroides which is found in Lepidoptera, the second most (or third depending on source) diverse order of insects (comprising over 11,000 described species).

Coleoptera and Lepidoptera are considered two of the ""big four"" (or ""big five"" as I've also heard it called).  So essentially over half the insect species described currently have one of these insect proteins.  Typically when something comprised over half the community we call it a ""rule of thumb"" but I guess that's not the case here.  "

**Disclaimer:** I'm not trying to defend her publicity team's actions in all of this bullshit *at all*, just want to point out that comments like 'I didn't even know she still had fans' are juvenile and irrelevant to the situation.  Lil Kim is arguably the best female rapper to ever make it big.  She was picked up by Biggie in the 90's, and her first record release was when she was a part of Junior MAFIA.  She's a legend in the hip hop industry and has worked with some of the greatest names out there.  Shit, she's worked with Beyonce, Nas, Diddy, Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliot multiple times, T-Pain, even motherfucking [Phil Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flugsxgtD8k).  She has a mix tape coming out featuring Miley Cyrus and French Montana, so whether or not you're into hip hop, it's kind of hard to just disregard her relevance as an influential musician whose career has been going for over a decade and a half, so enough with the juvenile ditches at her.  (And to people scoffing at the mention of 'Queen B', Lil Kim's record company is called Queen Bee Entertainment, just FYI.)

THAT being said- I think the actions of her publicity team are incredibly trashy and inappropriate.  /u/Sssamanthaa I'm so sorry that you have to go through this, I really hope you reported those Twitter users.  I'm considering making an account just to do it myself, because that's something that should never be said to anyone.  Stay strong girl, I'm more of a browser here and don't wear much make-up but your tutorials and posts are always awesome to see, you got some serious skills and it's not fair for someone to claim your work as their own.  Please keep this community updated as things unfold!  I don't think I only speak for myself when I say we're rooting for you.

edit: **tl;dr**- Lil Kim's publicity team **fucked** up and /u/Sssamanthaa deserves to win this lawsuit hard.  Wondering how Lil Kim still has any fans in 2014 is stupid and not relevant and makes us look like hateful assholes."

I love the green and gold on it with the silver case, as well as the shape of the hands. To me, this is one of the most stunning watches I've come across. And I thought it was really cool reading about the japanese ""Yamaotoko"" (mountain gentlemen) in [this] (http://www.wristreview.com/?p=3823) review of the watch. Though I don't think I'll ever remember how to actually use it to find north...

While I was waiting for my watch to ship over from japan, I started reading about it and found most people didn't like the strap. So I decided to splurge a bit on the Hirsch ""Rivetta"", kind of expensive but it looks awesomely like a pine tree, which I really think fits the theme of the watch. It's a bit big when using the deployment clasp, but luckily the very tightest hole of the strap is a great fit.

Do you use a salt water solution on it? Don't pick at the scabs and crusts (hard for me not to do that), put band-aids over the piercing if you're afraid of it getting snagged or caught. Try not to touch it, especially if you haven't washed your hands. What kind of jewelry was used (titanium), and hopefully have you still kept it in without changing it? My navel ring took about a year and a half to heal, my nipples took about the same, sometimes you just have to wait it out and try not to irritate it. Make sure to eat protein to help the healing process along! 

Also, if you go to the beach, do yoga, or have sex on your stomach, try to cover the piercing as much as possible. Irritation through movement, infection or foreign objects (sand) can delay healing quite a bit :(

socalgrrl,AskReddit,1389248698.0,"As far as social life, living in the dorms can really make you feel included OR excluded. People always assume the dorms make it easier for you to make friends, which is true, but for introverts it's really difficult either way. So here's some of my experience/advice to you:

1. Your bubble: Yes, you're giving up privacy, silence, and space BUT it's pretty easy to tolerate as long as you and your roommate are respectful of each other. That being said, there will always be differences as far as when one person wants to stay up late with the lights on and the other just wants to sleep, etc. but you compromise.

2. Your roomie: You may or may not become besties with whoever you're paired up with, and that's fine if you're not. Just try to make an effort to get to know them and if doesn't work then it's really not that awkward to be casual friends/roomies. Some people are disrespectful or crazy so hopefully you don't get one of those haha. On the other hand, some can turn out to be great friends and THOSE are the ones worth giving up your bubble to live with.

3. Other dorm people: Try to get to know the other people in your hall! Or even in the other dorm buildings! The most fun part about dorming is that all you have to do is walk back and forth whenever you feel like it to hang out with your friends!

4. The dining hall: The MOST AWKWARD THING EVER. The FIRST thing you need to do is find people who have the same schedule as you and can regularly go with you to breakfast/lunch/dinner. Nobody likes going alone to the dining hall and it's super stressful. :( So establish a few friends or a group you can always hit up that will hit you up to when you get hungries.

So I learned these things from a terrible first year of dorming and an amazing second year of dorming. The first year I didn't try hard enough to make friends and I even pushed away my roommate (unintentionally) because I went home every single weekend to visit my bf and friends 30min away back home. My head was at home, not at college. When I went back to school I would sit in my dorm with the door closed by myself thinking about how lonely I was and how everyone made their friends already so I felt excluded. My roommate was never around because she developed her own social life without me (my fault).

At the end of first year I joined an on-campus social club and made new friends, though I didn't know them well enough to hang out with them. I ended up dorming with 4 of them in a suite and it was awkward at first but I became close with them and it was the best year of college of my life! I was never alone because we always had our doors open to visit each other.

Sorry this was so long, I hope it helped you in some way. Basically, YES it is worth it! If you can afford it, do it! I would not have made friends as easily commuting from home or off-campus because it's so easy to just leave campus after class and go straight home. At least living on-campus leaves you with no escape so you have to at least TRY to hang out with other people haha.

Yeah you might get tired of a bunch of people being around and want some alone time, but once you get close to them it no longer becomes a problem. Being with people you're comfortable with is just as relaxing as alone time. :)"

Buggarz,relationships,1389248997.0,"This hits so close to home. I almost thought you were my ex-best friend.

I was in a near similar relationship with my ex approximately a year ago. I lost my best friend. However, I was made out to be the bad guy in the situation, her getting none of the blame at all. (So I'd be your friend in this situation. Yes, I betrayed my best friend, and went behind his back right in front of him.) I definitely didn't make the right decisions, however, I know full well now that my ex was a complete and utter compulsive, sociopath liar. Also, she loved the attention of two guys fighting for her.

I have a gut feeling that your ex is similar, if not the same. Manipulating the both of you. She bounced back between the two of us about three times (I was stupid and immature to let that happen, but it did). Your friend will learn and regret his decision one day, much like I did."

The sad thing is she otherwise isn't for equality-- like almost all self-identified third wave or ""sex positive"" feminists in North America and Western Europe-- all the rest of her articles spout the same rhetoric and have the same attitude and mindset.

So the person who posted the comment is wrong in the sense that the author is not for true or sustained equality, despite having one piece that is actually readable.

I agree that this one is far too vague an assumption and obviously isn't something that can be quantified or proven in any objective way. Would be for the most part accurate if it were changed to ""third wave feminists like the author"" or something.

There's a feeling of being left out when everyone's pregnant but you, but you also see everything a pregnant woman ""gets"" from society. So many people praising her, wishing her the best, congratulating her, buying her (the baby) presents. There is a jealousy we all feel for attention, and a desire for that attention.

People who leave abusive relationships often act in ways to get people to be abusive to them, especially their new SO when they enter a new relationship. There's nothing logical there, but they can't even stop themselves. Or kids who do things knowing they'll be punished just for the attention.

I'm not saying that pregnancy and childrearing is inherently negative like the above. It can be, but it certainly isn't always the case. My point is that you can have these extreme desires for attention, and that is also a large part of it.

Th3Gr3atDan3,gallifrey,1389249471.0,"Lost really only messed up when it turned its back on its sci fi roots and tried answering things. Season 1-5 were gold, solid gold (The Constant anyone?). Up until that point I never felt I was promised answers. Sure, a bunch of fans wanted answers, media wanted answers, and a couple of writers started shifting towards hinting at answers, but by and large they just rolled with it and gave us well thought out characters. It was not until season 6 the show became self aware and started promising answers.

Doctor Who since season 6 and 7 has been the same way. It does nothing but promise answers, when I honestly don't care or want answers. As long as my suspension of disbelief is maintained, nothing else matters continuity-wise. It feels like a waste of 50 minutes when the episode has an ending tacked on about ""oh, who is Clara, why is she impossible? Remember that storyline everyone? We will answer it!"".

Maybe this is just a symptom of all Sci-Fi/Fantasy that goes beyond 5 seasons. Supernatural, Doctor Who, Lost, Stargate SG1, Star Trek, Red Dwarf, X-Files, they all got caught up in their own continuity and became lousy after season 5. Once you start trying to explain your own continuity, and stop expanding your mythos, it devolves into fan fiction."

eighthgear,asoiaf,1389249552.0,"Justice is an interesting concept in Westeros.

Westeros does not have any sort of legal code, as we would recognize it. Nor does it have any sort of permanent courts system. It isn't like ancient Rome or pretty much any modern-day state.

Justice is based on practice and precedence, and is carried out by the nobility (and, at the highest levels, the crown). So, if Stannis believes himself to be King - and he does - justice is whatever he decides it to be.

People often conflate justice and enforcement of the law, because we live in a society with a set legal system. Justice in Westeros, however, is about judgement based on personal values, not the law. Robert Baratheon's justice is different than Stannis Baratheon's justice.

That's why I am suspicious of nobles who talk about justice in ASOIAF. They are often the ones deciding what justice is."

ulvok_coven,TrueReddit,1389249766.0,"&gt; It was at a humble benchtop with cheap, improvised equipment that he discovered the structure of the atom, then proceeded to split it.

That is a damned lie. Rutherford didn't improvise his equipment, he had most of it specially made. Hiring a glassblower to make precision tubes is not 'improvising' - glassblowers are extremely skilled at what they do. And splitting nuclei is not done on a benchtop. The first time he did it - or rather, his students did - it was in an accelerator.

&gt; Between the basic idea and a working device, however, lay an incredible amount of practical expertise — sheer craft — allied to rigorous thought.

No, what it took was a great deal of fine tools to build teensy precision elements you can't see with your eyes. Also, this is the second case in a row where the author lauds the *invention of the tools they later insult.*

&gt; Strangely, they all asked to remain anonymous, as though their thrift would mark them out as second-rate scientists.

Of course they did. Perhaps you made them up. Perhaps you're putting a lot of intent on them that isn't native to them. Perhaps they're anonymous because when you say something in the press you represent the institution, and you can get in trouble if you say something administrators are not happy with, regardless of what actual scientists think.

&gt;  Authors were often affronted

Because they want to be paid.

&gt;  Robert Aymar, former director-general of CERN, was flirting with this idea when he called the Large Hadron Collider a ‘discovery machine’. He was harking back

No, no he fucking wasn't. CERN represents a case that has never been studied with the same depth in reality. They were going to discover *something* sooner or later by virtue of being in unexplored territory.

&gt; to pile up facts in a Baconian manner while postponing indefinitely the framing of hypotheses to explain them

Because you don't want to *make shit up.* The phlogiston theory is used as an insult in the modern day despite being a pretty solid idea at the time. Newton actually relied *very little* on past facts to do his work - his *invented an entire branch of mathematics* to prove his theories about dynamics.

&gt; have already far outstripped not only our understanding of how genomes operate but our ability to formulate questions about them

How is that, dear idiot author? No? Just gonna leave that unqualified statement out there?

&gt; If, however, we wanted to know how cities function, creating a map of every last brick and kerb would be an odd way to go about it. 

Because, idiot author, *that's nothing like mapping the brain.* They're not mapping the brain's bricks and curbs, which would be proteins and transmitters, which are already understood. They're mapping the roads and the buildings. They're mapping where the pathways are and trying to figure out what they do.

&gt; ‘It is a chicken and egg situation. Once we know how the brain works, we'll know how to look at the data.’ 

I love people speculating about data that hasn't been generated yet. It's so useful. No, the map won't make perfect sense right at the start. But who knows what we'll turn up. Probably a lot.

&gt; data sets of any complexity will always contain spurious correlations between one variable and another

That's just bullshit. It doesn't make any sense. Illusory correlation doesn't have a relationship to the complexity of data. And the way to prove a correlation *is* illusory is often to compare to other data - that's right, more data.

&gt; But it also fails to acknowledge that science is driven by ideas, not numbers or measurements

Physics is a science of big ideas moreso than biology or chemistry is. And let me tell you this - it's all data fitting. Quantum physics? The result of two sets of data-fitting - Einstein saw a distribution that looked like gas particles, and Planck figured out quantized energy would fix the ultraviolet curve. Gravity? They rolled balls down hills, and both landed at the same time, no matter the size. The big ideas usually came from finding weird data and trying to solve problems.

&gt; Indeed, it faces the opposite problem: a consensus around a single idea, into which legions of workers burrow single-mindedly. 

Physics is like this because we have *good predictive capabilities.* Other sciences don't always have first principles to work from. We do. We found the Higgs Boson because the standard model *is right,* at least to the resolution we can measure. When we generate a good idea, we go and prove it. We don't need to argue about it because *if the prediction is good,* then there's only two options - the data doesn't agree and so the framework is wrong, which hasn't happened in near enough a century, or the data agrees and we're right.

&gt; Only by getting out of that racket did he devise his Nobel-prize-winning technique for spotting new particles.

What did these things have to do with one another? Oh, right, the article is chock-full of unqualified statements.

&gt; ‘Because instruments determine what can be done, they also determine to some extent what can be thought.’

And Hegel was saying long before that only the thoughts which *can* be thought in a given time are thought in a given time. If we can't measure, we have no proof. We still think - and that thinking created string theory, which people laugh at because *we can't prove it.* The instruments restrain how deeply into the framework we can delve. We lit a candle with our match, and the fireplace with that candle, but outside that firelight it's still dark. We need more things to burn if we want to look further.

The author might have a point somewhere in there about instrumentation. Maybe they could articulate it if they knew anything about real experimental science.

More data is good. Data allows us to ask questions - if we're in the dark, we light a match. If I think ""huh, I wonder what part of the brain does x,"" then it might be helpful to *look at a goddamned brain.* Thinking about stuff is what Aristotle did, and look where it got him. Thinking is fine, but data is what we think *about.* Excessive levels of data give us the clearest picture and the best way to ask questions. We gather more data so we know what questions to ask."

120 million x 1000 = 120,000,000,000 , which would make Kid Buu's power level **120 billion**. Which would make BASE GT Kid Goku's power level at the very very very least 120 billion.

Now the multipliers

SSJ1 for GT Kid Goku = Base power, 100 fold (Rhildo says this)

SSJ2 we'll assume that multiplier stayed the same, so it's 2x SSJ1 or base power, 200 fold

Again we'll assume SSJ3's multiplier stood the same throughout the years so it's ssj2 x4, or base times 800

And finally, SSJ4 which is SSJ3 times 10, or base times 8000.

SSJ4 Goku at the beginning of GT, not counting the zenkais and powerups he received throughout, is at the very least **120,000,000,000,000, or 120 trillion.**

I'm actually scared to try to figure the math of SSJ4 Gogeta level..."

&gt; There's many examples of cities in US that have 10x the gun related homicides that Toronto does, with similar populations.

Of course an area with more guns is going to have a higher percentage of criminals choosing a gun as their weapon. Why do you focus on gun-related homicides? [Why does the tool with which one does violence make it any less deplorable?](http://i.imgur.com/Oqpt0h4.jpg) And how does gun ownership correlate to violence? Every Swiss man is issued an assault rifle (for use as a militia) and yet you don't see the nation running red with blood.

Even when both of them are off form (which is incredibly rare), they still massively contribute to the team. How many games in a row is it that LeBron has got at least double figures? 

Those are players who have the talent to be the stars of their entire sport, and we've seen enough evidence that KP could fit into that bracket too, yet they constantly prove it to the world by putting in great performances.

I once held her so she wouldn't  fall in the engine compartment while changing a starter. One Valentine's day I bought her a floor jack, filter wrench, case of oil, etc. Everything she needed to change her own oil. She LOVED it.

Unfortunately though, she had an altercation with my favorite mechanic. She knew what she was talking about. I knew she knew what she was talking about. Unfortunately he was a dick to her and treated her like an idiot. All she could do was get in her van and drive away, after he said that van wasn't able to go anywhere.

James_GAF,Chattanooga,1389251220.0,"How much do you use the phone and for what? 

If you're very low use and use wifi for data, prepaid plans from Page Plus using verizon towers on a 3g verizon phone can be had for $10 + tax every 120 days for 100 minutes as an emergency/lifeline phone. Spot Mobile using T-mobiles network with a SIM is even cheaper for that use at $5 + tax every 90 days($0.10 talk/ $0.05 text). That leaves WiFi for your data because data is pricey through most prepaid plans. Add a google voice number and you have free wifi texting. 

Really though, the best value for your money is always going to come down to how much and what you use the phone for. "

The heaviest coverage foundation that I've ever tried (regardless of price range) has actually been a mineral powder foundation, Meow Cosmetics' Flawless formula.

When I do that, i tend to start projecting my sadness onto him and things he does, even when they are great things!

Of course, if your relationship has other problems, then thats something different to consider altogether. but generally speaking, if this is new and not preceded by something, try and look at it from a different perspective. Do you still love each other? Are you still okay with doing long distance? If so, then make sure you're not just pushing your bad feelings into your conversations with him

sockmonkeysaurus,relationships,1389252081.0,"Ms. Unpopular-Opinion here. 

I think breaks can be ok in relationships. You take breaks from work, you take breaks from school, you take breaks from certain things in your life that become tedious and stressful. Sometimes, even in the best relationships this happens. To me, there is nothing wrong with taking a step back and evaluating the whole situation. True, you should work on issues in the relationship together, but sometimes it can be better to look at the issues in the relationship by yourself, then come back together and decide whether or not the relationship can continue. 

To me, taking a break is putting things on pause and allowing things to settle down a little. There's nothing wrong with wanting to take a little time to yourself sometimes. Even in the best relationships, you can still go through periods where sometimes, you just want to be by yourself for a period of time, and take a vacation, so to speak. Taking a break does not necessarily mean one person is going to fuck around on the other; it can be a chance to re-evaluate things and work on yourself as an individual, rather than the couple.

But what works for one couple may not work for another. And obviously, if you're taking an extended break from each other every couple of weeks, there is something fundamentally wrong with the relationship. I can understand though why many people are averse to taking some time apart, and would rather go the full way and break up. But this is just my ramblings."

MisterScalawag,offmychest,1389252487.0,"I don't think you read my comment clearly. I didn't say sex was a necessity, I said abortion exists because it is a necessity meaning something that needs to exist to solve a problem. The problem is people are going to have sex whether you personally don't want them to or not, and from this a percentage of people are going to get pregnant and not have the means to care for it (or they don't want to care for it, which is perfectly valid also). So because of this inevitability, it is a necessity for something to exist that makes a woman who is pregnant not pregnant--aka abortion.


Like I said previously, in a perfect world abortion would be no unplanned pregnancies and thus no need for an abortion. In a perfect world people would be able to have a much sex as they wanted without fear of getting pregnant or catching an STI, but we don't so that is why there are penicillin shots and abortions. And hey if you don't want to go around having lots of sex because of personal morals, this world also accommodates that as well. Just follow whatever beliefs you have, and find someone else that has those also.


I think its a safe assumption that your personal perfect world would have people who waited until they were in a serious relationship or married to have sex. You have to realize not everyone has the same values/morals/etc and this isn't realistic. People are going to have casual sex, or just sex that is more freely given that what you are describing.

It also features lesser camera quality, although that may or may not be important to people.  The HTC 8XT boasts even more middling specs, so I guess the Ativ S Neo is the ""high end"" Sprint WP and the 8XT is the mid-range device???

If you're in the market for WP devices, Sprint is definitely not your carrier of choice.  Even T-Mobile has an arguably better option in the Nokia Lumia 925, and the Lumia 928 from Verizon is almost the 920 and 925, minus some quirks thanks to Verizon.  I think the reason most Sprint reps don't hear anything about WP is because of 3 major reasons - first, I've never, ever seen Sprint push any of their WP devices; second, finding one when using their website to look at the available devices you can acquire requires going at least 6 rows down in the list of available devices until you hit the HTC 8XT (not even their best WP8 device), and another 2 rows down before you see the Ativ S Neo (looking an awful lot like a Galaxy S4); lastly, as I've harped on before, both of the WP devices they have available are basically not as good, both spec-wise and brand recognition-wise, as the ones you can get on the other 3 major carriers in the US."

rassae,LongDistance,1389252849.0,"Ah! I was your girlfriend one year ago :) me and my SO are in a (what I like to think) is a very successful LDR.

Tips before you go: TALK ABOUT IT. Not everyday, not so much that it drags you down. But you both will have worries and fears and sadnesses- get those out and discussed before you go. You don't have to solve them. But be willing to listen to each other. Some things will be hard to hear.

Here's some weird advice- be comfortable with the idea of breaking up. I'm by no means saying you should, or you will. But if (in your discussions) you talk about what would happen/what you'd do/ how you'd deal if you two broke up, it can bring a lot of peace. Me and my SO are going strong, but we discussed that and it helped me a lot, just knowing what to expect IF that were to happen. It seems weird but it helped a ton for me.

Be open to her sadness. Know that she (most likely) isn't mad at you for leaving, and is really happy that you are going to be happy at college. That is valuable. She will be sad, but it is not your fault that she is sad. It might sound like it but she probably isn't. She is sad at the situation, not at you. Just keep that in mind because thats a yucky mindset to get into.

With the other guys? Unless it gets out of hand try to let it go. It's normal to be jealous. Just try to not concern yourself with it unless necessary (easier said than done)

SEND HER STUFF. Not expensive gifts or anything. But letters, notes, pictures... physical mail is SUCH a valuable thing. Could you arrange for flowers/gift to be delivered to her school on her birthday, your anniversary or other special date? That would be really cool. It's all about the little things. Show her that she's on your mind, be it through text, Skype, or whatever.



For encouragement, thats a hard one. I'd say instead of promising it will work out, promise that you will try your hardest to make sure it does. Make sure she knows that even in your absence you are not gone from her life, and that you are as dedicated to the relationship as she is.


Don't get caught up in being away to the point where you ignore her. it is SO easy to do; just consciously try not to. It's hard to be the one left at home.

A LDR is very rewarding and good when done right, and its not too hard to do right. And the feeling you get when you see them again is... indescribable. Sorry for the wall of text, hope this helps! Let me know if you have other questions, I'm doing nearly the same thing you will be doing!"

Many times, when the show has been on for only 4-5 seasons there is a risk of writers loving their past work so much that new material devolved into fan fiction.

We tried Asset Library, but it still has a file size limit of 2GB, and the video files we stored were sometimes larger than that.  Wanting to be consistent, we went with IIS media services servers hosting the files, and links from SharePoint itself instead to present the videos.  You may need to convert your video files via Transform Manager, but it's free and can help you support Apple and iOS devices if necessary, which can be useful.

73 Vega wagon with a 231 V6. $200 plus about $150 for the engine I put in it. Closest thing to a ""Hot Rod"" I ever owned. No top end but DAMN was it quick. Fun to drive but a little scary at times.

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1389254056.0,"&gt; The payroll tax holiday was an important factor helping the workweek recover after the recession, but the holiday is over and new public policies are pushing in the other direction.

That happened end of 2012. My self-employment tax went up in 2013. That makes it read like a repost since this was an event from two years ago.

&gt; A higher income tax or payroll tax rate tilts the balance toward part-time work because it reduces an important benefit of full-time work: extra income to spend. A lower rate does the opposite.

This is nonsensical conflation of the problem. The payroll tax rate is flat up to the cap in excess of $100k and there's no differentiation between full and part time status at play there. After the cap the effective tax rate goes down until the the next marginal rate which is near $200k in taxable income for an individual.

That's a means testing penalty and not terribly relevant to today. SS benefits are exposed to taxation at the usual marginal rate for Income tax only after going through a worksheet to determine how much is taxable based on income these days. I've had the pleasure of doing that calculation for a few years now as I do my mother's taxes. That really doesn't factor into the present as a work disincentive. Kind of needlessly inserted into the posting/article really.

&gt; Between 2007 and 2010, expansions of the food stamp program, known as SNAP, made part-time work increasingly attractive for those who would face the program’s income limit if working full time.

Right it's a means testing issue where the benefit is rapidly removed effectively as a high marginal tax rate on those benefits. 

&gt; About the same time, federal mortgage modification guidelines acted as income-tax increases on homeowners who owed more on their mortgage than their home was worth, because the more the homeowner earned, the less the mortgage balance was reduced. 

Yes, more means testing effective marginal rate issues.

&gt; But a year ago the payroll tax holiday expired and, more important, beginning this week incomes earned will reduce the subsidies that families might hope to receive as part of the new insurance plans created by the Affordable Care Act.

Correct. We've heavily means tested benefits. I've done the calculations myself with an app I built to compare ACA plans since I'm in the individual market for insurance currently. 

A Silver plan if you make between 100-150% of poverty level is about the best insurance you'll ever find as the actuarial value is guaranteed 94% which is better than Platinum options. This cost sharing reduces deductibles toward $0 and similarly the out of pocket maximum. For something like a surgery it dwarfs the benefit of the premium support tax credit.

The actuarial cost sharing benefit drops pretty steeply. Between 150-200% it's at 87% for a silver, then down to 73% between 200-250%.

We have a means testing problem and it's almost entirely a result of right wing anti-tax and anti-government sentiment making the systems we get in place overly complicated. Universal systems including in healthcare pretty well eliminate all such problems. "

christian-mann,ReverseEngineering,1389254132.0,"How much assembly do you know?

What that instruction is doing is complicated, but it's pushing the stack pointer onto the stack (saving it) and also decrementing the stack pointer by a certain amount, to leave space for local variables. But that's for function headers, if I remember correctly, not function calls. Yeah, a compiler would be helpful here, to determine the total size of your local variables and arguments.

I experimented with compiling C, but for what I needed it was too heavyweight. Since I was injecting very small amounts of code, all I needed was an assembler, which it provides. If you are creating a function of size, you can get it to compile your code if you want, or get it to compile into assembly, which is about as good.

Honestly, I don't really know how AR works. Apparently it doesn't work quite the same way that I thought it did.

What you could do is put a memory breakpoint on that address and just see what subroutine tries to read from it. Again, you may need a DebugFast build of Dolphin for this.

If you want to write ASM to disable something, the easiest way is to just overwrite it with NOPs, i.e. `0x60 00 00 00`"

After playing Skyrim, Tomb Raider, and Fable III, I finally started dipping my toes into games where there was a male protagonist, like Borderlands (where I played as Zero) and Bioshock Infinite.  Now I have like 20+ different games on Steam.  Still, I feel a disconnect between the character and myself, and it's a bit annoying that the voice of the character is a male one.  I don't *mind* it, but I would **MUCH** rather play as a female than a male.  Always.  It just doesn't feel like it's *me* in a game otherwise.  It breaks the immersion."

Could be cool, but they probably need some sort of reputation system to actually make it work, otherwise there isn't really much reason to implement it. I would like it.

&gt;different game modes (including an open world mode)

I could definitely see this happen.

&gt;longer quest chains

The longest current quest chain is the one for unlocking [the crystal cruiser](/spoiler), and that's a pretty hard one to pull off. Having more of those? I don't see that working very well for a game like this.

&gt;traitorous crew members

You mean having my precious crew turn on me and kill my other loyal crew members? No thanks. I can see why some people would like this, but I certainly wouldn't.

&gt;multiple ships in battles

Likely? No. Hopefully? Yes.

&gt;a Starcraft-like station invasion simulator

I don't know much about Starcarft, but it does sounds cool.

&gt;giant 100-person ships

8 is more than enough to crew pretty much anything in this game. Maybe cap it at 20? Much more than that and it would be anything but clutter.

&gt;multiple ship paint-jobs allowing you to pass freely amongst enemy factions

I honestly don't know about this one.

&gt;special encounters that riffed off Alien or tribbles

Same response as to the Starcraft thing.

&gt;a huge variety of extra weapons like rail guns that fired scrap and various gas weapons

The flak cannon already uses scrap, it wouldn't surprise me if there's also a weapon that uses fuel for ammo.

&gt;a crewed fighter

See my response to multiple ships in battle.

&gt;additional alien types that could teleport or walk through fire

We already have the rockmen to walk through fire. A teleporting alien sounds a bit OP in my opinion.

&gt;crew spacewalks

I honestly think that would add nothing but unnecessary micromanagement.

&gt;more subsystems (like hacking)

Pretty much confirmed already :P

&gt;crew equipment and weaponry

Could be cool, as long as it doesn't add any unnecessary micromanagement."

There are a number of ways to approach this. How many jobs are unfilled in the USA? I know people are going to say, ""There's X amount of applicants for every single job!"" But are we talking EVERY job? Or just the ones people think would be ideal. The ""Help Wanted"" section of the paper has not gone away.

So conservatives say, ""We'd like to see the spending offset somehow.""
Perhaps continue it IF people agree to enroll in continuing education to learn a new skill that will help them in the job market.

If a person gets a part-time job... but it doesn't pay the same amount as unemployment...then maybe have a rule that says, ""You can work, but we will also augment your income with some income until things get better.""

Perhaps make it available in particular for those who are older and who have been laid off. It's harder for a 55 year-old to find a job.

Also, just so you know, Kukkiwon and the ""World Taekwondo Headquarters"" are the same thing. :) What happens at Kukkiwon is essentially the research behind the style of Taekwondo that is represented by the WTF. This includes technique development, the spiritual side, poomsae, among various other things. 

What is the WTF? It is an international sports federation representing the style that Kukkiwon represents. This is the governing body that is part of the Olympics, meaning that WTF is the style used during the Olympic games. 

From a political standpoint, the two majors federations (WTF and ITF) are completely separate. For example, a 1st Dan in WTF is not a 1st Dan in ITF. So a 1st Dan in ITF would not be able to test for their 2nd Dan in WTF without having a 1st Dan in WTF.

eighthgear,anime,1389257336.0,"All of the three main girls are voiced by fairly new voice actors. I think that they all did a great job, though.

Overall, this episode met my expectations, and then some. It is natural to compare this series to other Doga Kobo works, such as YuruYuri, Love Lab, and GJ-bu, and if the first episode is anything to go by, I do belive that Mikakunin de Shinkoukei can live up to these past series and then some.

Kobeni makes for a fine MC, considering that the MC in most romcoms is generally quite ""normal"", compared to the people around them. Mashiro was absolutely hilarious, in my opinion. I am always worried when a series introduces a character such as Mashiro. Reading the premise, I worried that Mashiro would be some sort of token loli character who would be obsessed with her brother. That doesn't seem to be the case. She's a bit of a rube, like her brother, but otherwise she seems like an actual character, rather than just a walking brocon. Oh, and she was absolutely hilarious. That always helps. Benio, the older sister, seems to be the weakest in terms of characterization out of the three girls so far, but we are only one episode in.

This isn't a harem anime, despite the premise, which is always good. However, I am glad that the guy isn't completely ignored. He plays an important role without having the entire show centred around him.

In general, I really enjoyed YuruYuri, Love Lab, and GJ-bu. However, I thought that they all had significant flaws. The jokes in YuruYuri often felt repetitive, and the overall series ended up feeling somehow really long (despite the fact that each season was of a normal, 1-cour length). Love Lab worked well as a comedy, but it suffered a bit when it focused more on drama. GJ-bu was certainly very well made, and deserves kudos for having a proper ending, but it really wasn't very memorable - it felt a bit bland.

It is obviously impossible to say how Mikakunin will compare to those shows. However, I can talk about the *potential* I see in it. I see the potential for a series that can deliver a well-rounded variety of comedy (more like GJ-bu, less like YuruYuri) *and* perhaps a proper romance (unlike any of those three Doga Kobo shows). *If* it can do this, then this series may outshine those other works, in my opinion.

Of course, we are only one episode in. I guess what I am basically trying to say, and using far too many words to say it, is that I really liked this episode.

And that's where you're wrong. Because what Easterbrook says is that it is a natural cooling/warming cycle that is **comparable to the warming since mid-century**.

One person's 10/10 may be another's 6/10. Your friends' 10/10 certainly isn't *your* 10/10, as you said yourself. So why should all ""men with muscles"" share the same idea of what a 10/10 is?

There were like two people on tumblr who used it unironically - one even got a tattoo. 

Then it got posted on reddit and turned into A Thing. 

Many, many, many words were spent debating whether it was a legitimate expression of anger, a useful rhetorical tool, or a horrible thing, or terribly counterproductive. 

But it still wasn't a real thing, that people were discussing. It was being *mentioned* but not *used* (do a quick Google search if you need a primer on ""use vs. mention""). 

*Then* a bunch of mad cis people who hate things like feminism, or trans people, or ""political correctness"", or ""SJWs"", or any combination of those things, convinced themselves and each other that it *was* a real thing, that people *were* saying it and doing so in earnest.

Then it became a buzzword and a shitty circlejerky in-joke. 

See for yourself, above. I'd be surprised if you find even *one* person saying that in a serious and unironic way. Certainly the vast, vast majority are not.

&gt;6 . The Second Amendment exists to prevent tyranny

&gt;You've probably heard this. It's listed because this is one of those things about the Second Amendment that many people think is made up. In truth, this is not made up. The Court explains that in order to keep the nation free (“security of a free state”), then the people need arms: “When the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny"" (p.24-25). The Court states that the Founders noted ""that history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people’s arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents"" (p. 25). At the time of ratification, there was real fear that government could become oppressive: “during the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive"" (p.25). The response to that concern was to codify the citizens' militia right to arms in the Constitution (p. 26).

But some ideas that I can give: 

A counter to show how many people actually chose to buy a certain gift. This would make it easy to browse and see what's popular. 

Change the font. Using too many fonts will always look tacky and unprofessional. I personally hate the use of ""handwriting"" fonts because it falls in the uncanny valley for me. I find it disconcerting to see something that appears to be handwriting, only for all the ""e""s to be the same, etc. Maybe have a specific logo made for the site that's prominently displayed. 

Perhaps, subcategories for fandoms. Maybe not ALL the fandoms (although it would be interesting if users could submit a fandom to become part of the categories and then a library could be built for things in them). A lot of times for gifts like this you know they like a certain fandom, but you don't really know much about it and you just need a little help.

axehomeless,Android,1389263557.0,"The reason is differentiation,brand loyalty and familiarity.

1. Familiarity: You can make your (you being the OEM) user experience, the stuff people that bought you before, maybe a device with a different OS (Bada, Windows Mobile), maybe a device that isn't a phone or tablet at all (TV) and you want your customers to feel like they know it already. They like you if all of your stuff looks and works more or less the same. With a shared UI, you can make the UX more constistent between your products that don't nessesairly all run android 4.x. Even works on the same device with the same core OS. For a Samsung Customer, the jump from 2.3 to 4.0 wasn't big because it all looked more or less the same. My dad going from a Desire on CM7 to a Galaxy Nexus was horrible for him at first. That also gives the OEM a great deal of independence over the UX, regardless of what Google does.


2. Differentiation and brand loyalty. As a hardware OEM, you have a vertical business model, that means companies like Samsung and Apple (unlike Google who is a horizontal company that uses services on many platforms for reach) do everything on the software and services side to lock you in so you buy their hardware again. That's why iTunes on Windows was a big deal at the time and that's why there was no Final Cut Pro on windows, even if you could make more money with it. It locks you into buying something with OSX again and that's were the 30% margins are. Hardware is hugely bigger than services, just look at revenue and profits from Samsung and Apple vs. Google and Microsoft.
So Samsung wants to lock you into their version of android, because if they don't and you can get the exact same experience softwarewise on hardware from other OEMs, what's stopping you from buying LG, Asus, or Noname-chinese if Samsung drops the ball on hardware for one year? But if you are dependend on Apps that use the APIs from touchwizz, or KNOX features, or Samsung hub, or even just how touchjizz looks and feels, you go to a story, take the new galaxy device 7, play with it, play with an HTC and think ""I know this one, I don't know that one, I'll take Samsung."" If they both would look like nexus, you only had the customers that care about your support and brand name or if you are the best hardware manufacturer. A position that isn't sustainable.
Samsung roughly pays 10 billion dollars a year in sales commitions, means they give 10 **billion** dollars a year to guys so that they are selling you an S4 rather than an HTC one. That is an investment so people really do depend on S-Pen apps, and the way Touchjizz looks and feels so the next time they purchase a phone and Samsung stopped paying the sales guy that wants to sell an iPhone or Sony ""No, I want the Galaxy.""

**TL;DR** People like what they know and if that's different from all the others, they're likely to buy you again, that's why Samsung invests more money in sales commitions than some small OEM has revenue."

erinhasguts,AskModerators,1389265193.0,"Can you show me where exactly one of the mods is telling you that ""it's okay to make reasonable counter offers""?

I think the question was answered quite clearly by /u/LadyDrac [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ACTrade/comments/1urulu/psa_changes_to_actrade_please_read/cel2w0w)... ""Intentionally offering low value items and bells below the asking price when you have made it explicitly clear in previous posts that you know better will be considered trolling and will net you a strike on the caution list."" 

Basically I would interpret this as meaning that if a poster makes a post saying for example ""FS golden furniture, 1 mill apiece or items of equivalent value,"" then those are the offers that the poster is open to- 1 million bells or miscellaneous crap totalling 1 million bells. Not 300k bells, not 2 lilies or whatever you offered someone else. Only what they're asking for in the post. You might think that the price the poster is looking for is outrageous (maybe it is outrageous!) and, as the mods pointed out, you can politely tell them so, but it's not your job to police the sub. 

Also, even though you might not be willing to pay 1mill for a duped piece of golden furniture, there are other people who would be perfectly fine paying that. You may have a problem with duped furniture, but there are lots of people that don't and are willing to buy it. I personally agree with you and feel that duping is wrong, but everyone plays the game in their own way, you need to just ignore those posts if they bother you.

If you want to buy golden furniture for 300k bells then you should make your own post saying something to the extent of ""LF golden furniture, willing to pay up to 300k apiece.""

I think they banned you because they were answering your question over and over and over again, maybe you didn't quite understand it, but really i'm not sure how much clearer they could've made it for you. Maybe instead of continually asking in that thread you could've messaged the mods and talked about it privately. Or just step away, go have a sleep or something and maybe things will become a bit clearer?

Edit: formatting, added a little bit."

behindtimes,movies,1389265394.0,"I think part of what makes remakes like Scarface and The Thing decent is that they weren't well known movies, at least by the generation that they came out for.  Sure, the originals were well renowned in their time, but they can come off cheesy by people who weren't alive at the time, and have no context to appreciate the originals.

I don't necessarily think though that a remake needs to just update a classic for the sensibilities of the times though.  The problem is, a movie like The Day the Earth Stood Still, still had a message that could be appreciated by todays audience, even if the original message was different.  And unlike The Thing, while both originals can be cheesy, the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still stripped away what made the movie great for a fluff piece.  It's why I don't trust the upcoming Robocop.

Point Break on the other hand is a movie I could see being remade.  And yes, I'm aware of The Fast and The Furious, which was decent in it's own right.  The thing is, it's a movie which has potential to be better, and there's little to lose if you mess up."

RBGolbat,stunfisk,1389267704.0,"&gt; **OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT**
&gt; 
&gt; I'm revising the original plan of 0 bans until we go official in favor of a more fluid system where we can use the beta period to start kicking stuff into BL.
&gt; 
&gt; **Reason**: For one, I'm worried that if we ban everything at once when we go official, we will miss stuff that needs banning and that will complicate things with the new system. If we start pushing stuff into BL now, we won't have that problem.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clarifications**: Decisions on what will be sent to BL will be 100% up to me and the council I'm putting together in the upcoming days. Sending a Pokemon to BL is not a big deal because every BL Pokemon will be retested in the future unless it rises to OU due to usage. Therefore, we will be sending Pokemon to BL quickly and very liberally.
&gt; 
&gt; **When do we go official?**
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the nice thing about this revised system. It gives us a very clear line as to when we go official, that being once we feel that there are no more Pokemon in UU that need to be tested.

prot3llo,relationships,1389267762.0,"&gt; My inclination as a father is that I probably have to stay and try to make it work. 

As a child of divorce I can tell you this is bullshit. If you want her, stay and if you don't then divorce her. I saw pretty quickly that the divorce made both of my parent happier, my dad found a new girlfriend and my mom got to focus on her job which she loves. I couldn't care less that they didn't have any romantic interest in each other, and even though it sucked at first I'm happy they were brave enough to do this. 

&gt; Kids do best with a mommy and daddy who love and respect each other.

This doesn't mean they have to be romantically involved, and even if you pretend to be infront of your kids they will figure it out eventually. If you harbor resentment towards her this will be painfully obvious. My parents get along even after the divorce, they never talk bad about each other or fight anymore. The fighting actually stopped after they split up, so you could say that their divorce taught me more about love and respect than their marriage ever did, through which they did fight alot. And if you did mean that kids with a mommy and daddy who are romantically involved actually would do better then I'm offended and shocked at how ignorant you are. Kids have to learn that break-ups happen, because they will probably live through a couple themselves. And who better to teach them than you guys? Your kids want you to be happy to, you are not doing them any favours.

You're still allowed to make counter offers, just reasonable ones.

It's practically impossible for someone without such a huge backlog of data and experience to come in and build a better machine. 

You can actually see this in LMP1 right now, where the old Toyota F1 team now competes. Toyota are far better at aero than Audi, who had to resort to a hot-blown diffuser to reach Toyota's downforce levels. Audi has won LeMans so often on the strength of their drivetrain (especially their turbo-diesel engine) and their racecraft. Had Toyota not gambled on more rain, they would have put up an even harder fight in last year's 24h du Mans. As it were they got a very close second place and have had the superiour car during the later part of the WEC season."

EaglesOnPogoSticks,Fitness,1389270639.0,"&gt; I've received several replies but each one digressing from the actual question and criticizing me, or my diet (even though it was completely out of the topic)

I don't think criticizing diet it out of the scope of the question at all. In your OP post you wrote:

&gt; Any suggestions? I'm aiming for fat loss and general fitness

You're stating two different goals here: fat loss and general fitness. The meaning of ""general fitness"" is quite nebulous and in my personal experience, people asking for this are usually satisfied with any moderately exerting physical activity. You could for example start lifting weights, do calisthenics (bodyweight training), start doing a sport, keep doing Insanity, start running etc., it doesn't really matter. Some people define ""generally fit"" as being able to run 10km or being able to bench your own weight. Or both. Or something completely different. If you don't have any particular goal then try out different things until you find something you think is fun, that you can see yourself doing for years.

Fat loss however, really is 80% about your diet. It really doesn't matter that much what kind of exercise you do. Therefore it is crucial to emphasize the importance of diet whenever anyone asks about fat loss."

skgoa,formula1,1389271136.0,"The big problem I see Indycar having is that it has one owner who is personally and financially involved in the commercial side of the sport as well. It's designed to fill the bank account of one guy alone and that guy is calling all the shots, which means that there is little incentive to improve. NASCAR has the same problem, as do GP2/3. 

Most other motorsports series exist as a plattform for teams and manufacturers. This is especially true in F1, where the commercial rights owner has almost no say on the sport itself.

The *Global Race Engine* was being pushed by the FIA and certain manufacturers (chief among them Volkwagen) but it died when the different series couldn't agree on an engine format. It is rumoured that Honda will use some of their Indy experience in their new F1 engines, though. 

Indycar needs an infusion of money and it needs a more exciting car driven by more exciting drivers on more exciting tracks. There is currently no reason to watch it over say GP2 or one of the many many Touring car or GT series.

Then Schumi won the 94 championship. Suddenly F1 turned into a household name. Germany had a new national hero and millions watched him win at Hockenheim in 95.

Tapering off with ecigs is easy. I started vaping to save money, not quit smoking. My nic intake has cut in half in the last 10 months though many people cut off completely in just a few. I went from smoking over 2 packs a day worth of hand rolled non filter to one cig in the first 5 months. The only reason I have smoked any is due to running out of juice, though I will wait a day or two before getting tobacco. That was never an option when I was a full fledged smoker. The most important part is to stop inhaling the other 89 hazardous chemicals that are in cigs, 84 of which cause cancer. I was having chest pain almost hourly. That stopped after 4 days of vaping.

b00tler,beyondthebump,1389272589.0,"I second the water: try to drink two 32 oz containers / day.  After about 3 days you will get used to it and stop feeling like you're constantly peeing. This will help in several ways--replaces calorific drinks, helps you avoid eating when you're actually thirsty (we can get those signals mixed), even speeds up your metabolism if you are borderline dehydrated. Also helps with milk supply if you are breastfeeding.

Crunches, etc., and other core exercises are beneficial because your core probably lost a lot of its strength during pregnancy, but the idea of toning and shaping certain areas is pretty much marketing fluff. Weight exercise IS extremely helpful in weight loss because increasing muscle mass means your body burns more calories all day long. To get the best bang for the buck you want to build your major muscles in your arms &amp; legs.  For this reason, with limited time for exercise, I personally would choose weight routine over aerobic exercise if weight loss was my goal. But in addition to the weights, you can at least get some long walks done wearing or pushing a 5 month old (unless you are polar vortexed at the moment!), which will also help.

A simple body weight routine 3x or more per week that includes 2 or 3 sets of 3-4 core exercises (not only crunches!), plus 4 or 5  exercises to work your big muscle groups, would help with weight loss.  Some basic body weight exercises include: push-ups, dips, squats, chin-ups, plus wall/sits, lunges, &amp; box steps - you can google for instructions in how to correctly do any of these. If you can get your hands on some small dumbbells (8 or 10 lbs) that would give you options for a few more arm exercises. But equipment and videos are just bells &amp; whistles, you can cover the basics with no equipment and just looking up the info you need online.

Lastly, tracking your diet (honestly) is a great way of helping to bring it under control."

&gt;we say 'these are the statistics, what do you think?'. Response: 'Well, personally...'

Wouldn't the interesting follow up question then be things like: 

- So why do you think does your experience differ so much from what the data says the majority thinks? (who knows, maybe they grew up in a particular style of household or whatever; or maybe that they are in your course already means that they are more likely to be open minded about gender things. Or maybe they are studying computer science or game design and that already makes them a ""poisoned"" sample because maybe that means that they would be more likely to relate to games on a mechanical level rather than on a story level, but people who don't have that particular interest are less likely to appraoch games this way)

- Or bring up what that bigfish lady said about the theory that it is a social thing, do they think that there's any validity to it? Or does it have to do with men being more visual oriented than women? [like the default is identification with the character, but visual joy is an alternative, if women are less likely to get as much out of visual joy they have less reason to pick male =&gt; but if women indeed strong prefer picking female, more so than men picking male, wouldn't logic dictate that there should be more games with playable women since women supposedly strong prefer female and men are more flip the coin? Or that it's actually discouraging female players from buying more to not offer female options?]

- Or bring that women on the cover story as an example and let them speculate on why the company acted that way. 

&gt;Edit: concerning your idea - that seems like it could be interesting! If I'm lucky enough to ever have a class with a gender balance that's a bit more favourable than 35 males/2 females, I'll try that out.

Maybe force them to find somebody of the opposite gender in their life (mum, sister, friends) and do the same for their gaming list as the second part of the assignment. :p Yes, even if it just means scouting their mobile phones (and yes Solitaire counts it's No Protag ;) Candy Crush is probably the same :D ). 

You could also have them track the let's say last 100 releases from various platforms (like mobile games or bigfish games for more female oriented games vs. steam vs. the playstation and xbox release lists) and see if there are any trends (like maybe games being more likely to offer either options or no/abstracts protagonists if the audience is expected to be mixed or expected to be female). 

And then have others do the same release lists only 2 and 5 years ago and see if there's any change in trends. 

Or maybe there is data for most popular games for women and for men of the various age brackets in the mobile market. "

They do have a sense of morality running through many songs (not all,  of course), but it's conveyed in a darker manner.

skgoa,SocialEngineering,1389273849.0,"As others have said, knowing what to look/listen for helps a lot. As does taking a moment to think about what is being said. I very often spot it immediately when something isn't quite right or when someone is being disingenuous. Not because I can read minds but because what they are saying or the way they are saying it doesn't make sense in context. E.g. when someone is giving a non-answer to deflect a question or brings something up again and again. They can be as smooth about it as they want but it does mean that there is something about that topic that they are hiding.

I always try to think about why someone would be saying exactly what they said. Even if it were true, what motivation would the person have to say it? If the answer is that you wouldn't say it unless you meant to somehow profit from it (e.g. complaining about a third party) it's safe to say that the speaker might have embellished or omitted, which happens subconciously in normal conversation quite regularly. 

Another good strategy is to look for discrepencies. Did the story change? Did the speaker gloss over certain parts that normally would have been mentioned in detail? Does the whole story even make sense in the first place? Is it more likely that the person even knows the things they claim to know (or be ignorant of the things they claim to be ignorant of) than it is likely that they are lying? People who lie regularly tend to be unable to make these distinctions. Unfortunately many trusting people also just ignore the tells if you don't point them out. "

atheistium,ffxiv,1389273855.0,"30 days free with purchase of game on PS3 or PC.

If you wish to play on both versions (with one account) then you need to register both serial codes to one service account :) yes, that does mean you'd have to buy it on both PC and ps3 if you didn't play 1.0.

The subscription options differ depending how many toons you want. Character can level every class and job type so you'll rarely need to make another character until you really want to :)

Subscription billing
-  60 day time card (can be purchased from a variety of online outlets)
- credit card (30, 60 or 180 day batch) though this will only charge you once you've ran out of time. 

There is only a 60 day version of the time card. No 30 day version yet. Only way to add 30 days is via automated billing when your time has expired.

You can only store a maximum of 180 days onto your account with time cards. You need 120 days or less to use another 60 day time card.

Veteran rewards (which give items, minions, mounts etc) require time to have passed with automated billing or days credits if you go with the time card option. It only counts subscribed (paid for) days. 

So if there was a 90 day reward you'd need 90 total days paid in total via 2x 60 day time cards or have 90 days pass on your account with automated billing. If you do not subscribe for 30 days within those 90 days it does not count :)"

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1389274844.0,"&gt;  (if we don't head down the 'but males are the majority of gamers!' path, which is a whole 'nother set of literature on its own).

Which is fine and dandy, but that still only works if males having a preference for males protags is true. If males were the majority, but were all indifferent to playing male or female or looking at male or female then it shouldn't make a difference who is on the cover either. 

Especially, one would think that majority male audience + males being visual would speak in favor of putting women, particularly good looking ones (since Bioshock Infinite I believe was also affected, and maybe Remember Me as well?) on the cover. 

&gt;I think asking them an open-ended 'why does your experience differ from the majority?' could be an interested way of getting them to actually think about this on a deeper level. I may try this and see how far down the rabbit hole I end up falling.

Mandreotti,AskMen,1389274906.0,"Don't worry man, you're making a lot of solid points.

&gt;being overweight is unhealthy and if people don't care about their own body, I wonder what else they don't care about, hygiene, punctuality , and generally trying to constantly grow as a person, how can I be with someone who will drag me down, how can I trust them to raise any children we have?

The first part is exactly the mentality that I have. But I also know that just because they are overweight, it doesn't immediately mean that they also have poor hygiene, growing problems, etc. You obviously can't know until you try. 

It's not your fault you feel this way, you were raised believing a certain thing, and it's very hard to completely erase the idea that you were raised on. Even if you did try to date a bigger lady, you might notice her slugging along (as overweight people tend to), and you may find yourself disgusted. It wouldn't be a good relationship if you're battling with their lifestyle. You would really have to come to terms with their obesity and either help them grow healthier, or ignore it (although I wouldn't be able to ignore it, I can hardly ignore my extra 30 lbs).

Either way, you're right, people shouldn't be down-voting you. You're looking for someone who has their life together, and to you, being healthy is having your life together."

Ghettowarlock,Accutane,1389275106.0,"I heavily suggest getting a titanium piece ASAP, especially if you've been having a reaction to watches. That irritation and inflammation will change your body's mindset from ""heal mode"" to ""get it out, get it out, get it out"".  Not to mention titanium doesn't need to be removed for MRI's! :) If you get another piercing in the future, ask for titanium. Costs a few bucks more, but there's a very, very low risk for an allergy developing. 

Keloids suck!  Mine were bloody fluid with a little pus when they developed on my ears for my triple helix (3 cartilages). You can try compressing them to help get rid of them, which was easy for me on my ears, but you might want to google how others dealt with abdominal keloids. The shot glass is a good idea. Saline sprays will also help pull gunk out of the wounds. If you can't use band-aids, perhaps try gauze and paper tape? It's good you're not snagging it, and honestly you might not need to cover it anymore. I would for a week once you change out your jewelry. 

I suggest you have a professional put the titanium jewelry in, but if you decide to do it yourself, put a little lube (ky jelly packets, clean stuff) on the holes for insertion and removal. Helps it go in smoothly and easily. Hope this helps!"

The insult, albeit funny, is my friends (and maybe yours) way of saying ""nice guys (or for you: girl) finish last"". Now the thing is - while I am a romantic and I do believe in a little chivalry or what not, I swear and cuss and yell and aren't very gentleman-like.

scottious,getdisciplined,1389275975.0,"Well first of all I think you're thinking about it wrong.  Even disciplined people are still prone to procrastination and bad habits.  We're all just human, we all have our vices.

I think a better way to approach it is to view procrastination/bad habits/vices as just a part of life.  They're not necessarily a *bad* part of life, but a part of life nonetheless.  Don't beat yourself up over bad habits, because that'll only make it worse.

Instead, try to slowly replace bad habits with good ones.  Incrementally try to make better and better choices.  You will never be perfect, and it's unfair to expect yourself to change so drastically in a short period of time.

I became a very disciplined person and I still have my vices.  I still procrastinate some things some times, sometimes I eat poorly (though I'm getting better!).  The big thing that changed for me is that I now no longer procrastinate things that will be massively detrimental for me in the future.

I'm not sure I agree with your approach of using punishment as a motivator.  I'm sure it works short-term but for long-term commitment you have to actually *want* and *like* to do these tasks.  Easier said than done, for sure, but it's much easier to not procrastinate if you actually want to do it.  Many people argue with me that they can't change what they want.  I call shenanigans.

I_FUCK_UP_RECIPES,Xcom,1389277142.0,"Because that sniper almost always would be more useful targeting a different enemy, that assault could probably kill his target anyway with rapid fire (the chance of a miss is still significantly reduced with rapid fire, and the chance of a killing blow is greatly increased whereas flush won't kill anything)

My main use for flush is weakening a target for capture without killing it.


But the biggest reason for not taking flush is so you CAN take rapid fire.  Rapid fire is the main tool of the assault.  It allows you to stop worrying about whether you'll get a critical hit because you KNOW that muton elite is going to die.  It doubles your damage against hard targets like sectopods and mechtoids.  It is an assurance that RNG causing you to miss won't result in an easy flank for the enemy.  It has NO cooldown.  It literally doubles the killing power of the unit that most needs its killing power doubled.  When you use your assault, you'll probably never use the regular fire button again.  Why bother when rapid fire only uses 1 ammo if the first shot is a kill?  
  
It's all around one of the best abilities in the game and giving it up for the minor advantages flush offers just isn't worth it."

This is what I consider a mistake. I would rephrase that as ""so that all of the class understands"" or ""so that all of the class will understand"" or even ""to make sure that the whole class understands"" (the whole class sounds slightly better than all the class, in my opinion), making it therefore something that happens repeatedly. ""So all the class understood"" seems like something that happened once in the past.

As for the books, what I mean is read a bit more ""refined"" literature, so to speak. Try books like ""Catcher in the rye"" or ""A tree grows in Brooklyn"" (to name a couple that I enjoyed). Challenge yourself! Then again, not all books written nowadays are that easy, I found Game of Thrones to be quite complicated at times, and I am a native speaker!

sunglasses619,EatingDisorders,1389279236.0,"Hi :) So from what you've read, it seems like the depression and suicidal thoughts are the major problem. You mention developing food issues (BE) as a result of the depression, and then talk about worrying about AN. In this case again AN looks to be something you are exploring to negate depression and the food behaviors it has influenced. Remember that AN will make things a lot worse, because it will malnourish your brain and cause greater emotional and rational instability -- or it will just further complicate your BE problem by worsening unstable blood sugar and physical trauma. It will also make everything seem more hopeless. 

Talking to someone would be what I would do first (don't know if you're doing that now), and approaching the emotional dysregulation. The symptoms should ease when the depression eases and everything seems more positive and manageable. There are supplements you could try, like St Johns Wort, which are said to lift mood if you want to try that alongside whatever treatment you choose. Good luck.

Kalivha,languagelearning,1389279498.0,"I'll try and describe why I think this is the wrong approach, somewhat. 

Outside of mandatory lessons in school, I've learned Mandarin (6 years), Dutch (my transcript says 4 years, really just 1 year and a bit), Urdu (1 semester) and Hebrew/Aramaic (3 years/1 semester). 

Mandarin has been the least fun, I learned the least that I can actually use nowadays, it's been the least relevant to my life and I never really wanted to learn it when I was a kid; it was my parents' decision. Because so many people speak it and China was a rising star when I was little. 

Dutch and Urdu have been really relevant because I spend a lot of time in the Netherlands (and might move here permanently in a few months) and I ended up having to pick up Bengali along the way which would've been impossible without the Urdu lessons.

Hebrew and Aramaic were really useful for just being able to understand basic Arabic without that much effort. I knew the script somewhat from Urdu and everything came together fairly nicely, with that. 

So in conclusion, the languages I really fancied doing at the time are also the ones that have been the most useful to me. And they were easier to learn, because I really really wanted to. "

Nirgilis,Anxiety,1389279544.0,"I'm a biomedical students so I did a quick search for you. There is evidence that benzodiazepines increase odds of dementatia in the long term. Most of this comes from a study published in 2012 by BMJ: http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6231

This study followed over a 1000 elderly people, who up until then did not use any form of benzodiazepines. They compared the onset of dementia in these people and found that people that had started to use benzodiazepines during the study showed increased odds of developing dementia. 

So yes, it may be that Clonazepam increases the odds of dementia. I do not currently have the time to analyze the entire paper, but BMJ is considered one of the most prominent medical journals, with many high impact publications and all publications are peer reviewed. One thing I can not find right now though is if they have controlled for confounding. As it may be that other factors that lead to use of benzodiazepines also increase the odds of dementia.

You should thoroughly discuss your options with your doctor. I understand that going cold turkey is not favorable for you, and I assume the doctor did not initially perscribe such medication while you didn't actually need it. There may be alternatives he can help you with. It is also important to note that the findings discussed are dementia and not specifically alzheimers. Alzheimer starts at a younger age than most dementia and dementia is generally less severe. In fact, another (though older) study, suggests a protective effect against Alzheimer specifically: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9539405"

- If you can get in on some games or whatever, that is a great starting point for conversation. 

- If not, see if someone else is standing alone and go up to them. That usually works for me because just about everybody wants to be talked to at a part.

- if you overhear someone talking about a topic you're interested in (make sure it's not a private conversation) then you can just walk right up and ask something along the lines of ""hey, I heard you guys talking about x... Did you see the game last night?"" Anything along those lines and you're in already because you've forged a connection immediately with these people. 

- if someone needs a picture taken, offer to take it. You come off as a nice person and can strike up a convo.

Place a chicken breast (or two) in the crockpot with the following ingredients:

* 1/4 cup of bottled salsa (optional) = $2-3
 
I left mine in on low for maybe 5 hours. You could speed it up by putting it on high for 2-3. It's done when you can shred the chicken with two forks.

&gt;...falls into that category.

So that makes me an asshole? Because I stand against racist comments in whatever form they are made, with no regard for who is making them?

Listen. My husband lived in one of Ontario's biggest native reservations for four years. He was one of the few white kids on the entire place. He had no friends. The native kids didn't want anything to do with him and his brothers because they were white. The girl who lived next door had been told by her parents to stay away from them because they were white. But that's not real racism, that's some kind of white privilege, right?

Are you one of those people who thinks that racism is prejudice plus power? Because I think that's b.s. I think that it doesn't matter what colour your skin is, and what colour the skin is of the person you dislike - if you are judging a person because of their ethnicity, *you are racist*. Whether your people have historically been oppressed or not is irrelevant...that doesn't give anyone a pass to be an ignorant bigot. "
greeklemoncake,magicTCG,1389280228.0,"The mana base is designed such that each land can be sacrificed for two mana rather than one. This both ramps you into a cascade spell, and provides the devastation that comes with a Restore Balance. 

So basically, you play your lands, maybe suspend a whatshisname (black creature, cbf rereading primer). Then you sacrifice all your lands for max mana, then cast a cascade spell, which is guaranteed to cascade into a Restore Balance. You have no lands, which means your opponent has to sacrifice all of their lands too, and probably have to sacrifice their creatures and discard some cards. 

Now, all this sacrificing has awoken the suspended guy, and he pops out. Now you both have an empty board (including lands) and some bland hands - except you have a 4/4.

UglierThanMoe,GrandTheftAutoV,1389280318.0,"1. Use a comparatively small and narrow car like the Sultan. When cops or other players chase you, you can often lose them by going through narrow alleys where they either become stuck or at least slowed down enough for you to get away (vs. cops) or gain the advantage (vs. players).

2. Get rid of weapons you don't need. There's no point in having four different pistols, three different assault rifles, three different shotguns, etc. That just slows you down when trying to pick the weapon you want to use (especially while driving) or makes you accidentally select the wrong weapon. Keep the weapons wheel open, select one you want to get rid of, and press Y or triangle on Xbox or PS3, respectively, to drop it; rince and repeat until you've reduced your armament to only those guns you actually need. You will have to repeat that whenever you've collect enough unwanted weapons, however.

3. Body armor is pointless, even the best one you can buy. The overwhelming majority of weapons deals so much damage in short time that a full body armor buys you maybe half a second of time before you die. And considering that going for headshots is better anyway, body armor becomes even more pointless. Save yourself $500 over and over and don't buy it.

4. There's basically only four weapons you need (not counting grenades and sticky bombs, which are a must-have): one you can fire while driving (AP pistol or micro-SMG), a sniper rifle (preferably the heavy one), a shotgun for close and personal business (assault shotgun FTW), and an automatic weapon with a decently sized magazine of 60+ rounds for everything else (can be any SMG except the mini-SMG, MG/combat MG, or assault rifle). For example, my personal armament is the AP pistol, carbine rifle, heavy sniper, and assault shotgun.

5. Know the streets. There are countless small alleyways where you can run and usually also drive between buildings that don't show on the map. More often than not they provide multiple ways in and out along with a lot of cover."

Kalivha,chemistry,1389280554.0,"I think it depends on university quite a lot.

I'm at uni in the UK currently, and for the BSc in chemistry at my uni, you get away with next to no maths (and don't even have to take it at all, although many people do). For the MChem, you suddenly need to know all the maths anyway, so it is really worth learning it from my perspective. 

You *can* do chemistry with really basic maths, but I would argue that it's much nicer with the maths if you take the time to learn it all.

I'll briefly go into how my dissertation is different due to maths. It's highly mathematical anyway, but I've learned random bits of maths over the past year or so and *the only major one I am not using in my dissertation is category theory*. I could probably use it, even, but I never got very confident in it. 

And I've literally learned completely random mathematics. It is *really* good for perspective and tends to make life a lot easier once you know it. 

I don't know if this will still hold as much if you go into synthetic chemistry, and I don't know how much difference it's going to make, but Dutch universities are pretty decent at letting you take remedial classes where necessary, anyway, so you can catch up at the start if you need to. "

OriginalStomper,writing,1389281343.0,"&gt;English is good in pre-law because it introduces you to the practice of reading what dead white men wrote as if they were oracles whose words contained the Key To Everything ... Of course, feminist, postcolonial, queer, deconstructionist theories, &amp;c., all challenge the value of the default western authorial tradition

That's a very narrow and gendered approach to E Lit.  There's nothing about Shakespeare (for example) that prevents the student from applying a feminist perspective.  The whole point is that no lit is set in stone with only one official interpretation -- the correct interpretation is whatever interpretation you can defend.  Want to make the case that Romeo and Mercutio were gay lovers, but Romeo was conflicted by oppressive social values and everything else flowed from that relationship?  Go for it!

A good E Lit student does not require a writer who caters to the student's agenda.  Rather, the student's agenda shapes the student's reading of the writer's work.  It is fashionable to dismiss ""dead white men,"" but I don't buy it.

I have been a lawyer in a very competitive market for more than 25 years, and my E Lit degree has provided huge benefits.  There are a number of attorneys here in town who pay me to do their writing for them."

In hindsight, I think we can see the problems this is causing. As you keep helping the underdog from suffering a major defeat, you are also keeping the winning players from achieving a major victory.

I can definitely see the benefits. You don't want losing players to quit your game and you want them to buy the DLC and sequels. 

I think comparing GW1 to GW2 is in order here, because basically the sequel totally neutered all of the powerful, game changing mechanics that were in GW1. Mesmers and rangers are relatively generic RDPS compared to their GW1 predecessors.

In the GW1 days, everybody acknowledged it was not fun to get steamrolled by good players using strong builds, but victory was much, much sweeter. Victory could only be had after making hundreds of correct strategic decisions.

In GW2, victory is more like ""Oh hey, some points. I guess we were better at doing our skill rotations and milling around the capture points for the past several minutes."""

Phaedrus49er,Charlotte,1389281485.0,"&gt; I have a tmobile family plan and a separate phone number through Google Voice that gets forwarded to my cell (for my business). I plan on porting my main number to GV.

So that I'm clear, you use GV for business already, and you're planning to port your personal number to GV as well, meaning you will have two GV numbers. Then, you're wanting to go to the pre-paid TMO plans and use GV as a handler. Are you planning to have two separate physical phones, one for personal, one for business? If not, there is a [tedious workaround](http://itpixie.com/2011/09/linking-2-google-voice-numbers-to-one-phone/) to have two GV numbers go to one physical phone. I have not had to deal with this setup.

&gt; What should I do first? Sign up at Wal-Mart?

Nah, order a compatible SIM card from TMO online. It gets to you in a day or two, and you can activate online. Besides, we need to resolve the above hodgepodge first.

&gt; It doesn't use your cell minutes, right?

WRONG. GV is only a call handler, not a stand-alone VoIP option. There is a way to use Hangouts as your call handler, thereby only using data, and if you're (a) using more than 100 minutes/month and (b) always in a data-covered area, this is an option. I have not tried this with multiple GV/Hangouts accounts, though, but technically, it seems as if it should work since Hangouts supports multiple accounts. This might be possible in the two-GV-one-phone setup, provided you use different Gmail addresses with each GV number.

&gt; How much data does GV use per month (roughly)?

Depends on your usage. If you're going with the $30/month unlimited text/data, it doesn't matter. The other $30/month gives you unlimited talk/text, but the 500MB data cap is paltry. YMMV.

&gt; This works for Android as well as iOS?

So far, yes. I have a Galaxy S3; my wife has an iPhone 5s. Both work. One consideration is wifi calling: TMO Androids have this feature natively (if you leave the phone stock, no custom ROMs like Cyanogenmod), but iPhones do not and cannot (currently) have this feature natively--you have to use the Hangouts workaround.

I know I've left out some things, but let's start there."

This is why I don't give a damn about ""prejudice plus power"" - because it's just wrong. And you wind up defending ignorance, prejudice, and bigotry as long as it's coming from the right mouths. I cannot and will never accept that definition as being correct or worthy of anyone's respect or support. It should not matter which ""group"" you are in - if you are spewing hate and judgment against another human being (because we are ALL in *that* group...and when you get down to it, the genetic differences between racial groups is infinitesimally small) simply because they are different than you, it is indefensible and wrong and should be soundly condemned.

marinersalbatross,Futurology,1389281853.0,"&gt; Airships are hardly agile (in most instances) and for things such as warfighting or crossing the atlantic, they're not the best option.

They were the main long distance bombers in WW1, allowing Germany to bomb England and vice versa. At that time and all the way through WW2 we had airships crossing the Atlantic. They were sub and ship spotters, and they were very effective.  Unless you are talking agile in a dogfighting capacity, then no they were more like ships since they were hundreds of feet long. And the first airplane would not have given anyone a foretelling of massive future changes.  It was a few hundred feet long at an altitude of a dozen feet, and although ground breaking, I doubt it would have had that effect on bystanders.

Kalivha,AskAcademia,1389282043.0,"Since I am also still an undergraduate, I've not really made it but there are a few other things you can do (depending on budget) that I know about and that people seem to confirm are good.

I've done internships both summers; since you're using UK degree classifications, I'll go on the assumption that you're in the UK system, might look for UK based academic internships (which are limited to 8 weeks total in academia), *and* have the 3-4 month summer holiday. This means that there is technically enough time to do summer schools (Utrecht, Cambridge, Oxford being the major ones that do things in all sorts of different fields in Western Europe&amp;mdash;Utrecht has the lowest fees and best funding in my experience, the teaching quality is about the same as Oxford in my experience, but you get more free stuff; I've not done anything at Cambridge officially). Summer school is another thing that can help your CV.

The maths department at Oxford told me to put my reading list on my CV. Like, Coursera courses, textbooks that I'm reading that aren't on my official reading list, lecture audits, all the stuff that's on no transcript. They didn't give me an offer in the end, so it didn't work for them but it seems like a good idea, anyway.

Also, networking is really really important. I'm in comp chem and just by having done one internship at Warwick I've now got contacts at a few UK universities and one Chinese one, a reference from an additional UK university and I somehow worked out half a PhD proposal in the process. And e-mailing people who are interesting is a good thing!

Also, no matter what they tell you, you *can* get extra credits during the semester in the UK, it just takes more effort to get enrolled in those. Some departments will be cool with having students audit their lectures regularly, and some doctoral training places are cool with admitting undergrads and giving them official transcripts for graduate modules. It just takes a lot of digging and a fair bit of luck to find these things.

Also, one thing, go look at CV templates and spend like 20 minutes on coming up with or finding a decent layout. 

I've seen postdocs with just really badly formatted CVs that were a pain to read through. Don't be that person, even if it makes next to no difference."

It's a cheap fallback to jabbing at someone with the hopes of leaving their target troubled and violated, relying on the shield of anonymity behind a computer screen.

There's another camp who are seemingly of the mindset that words can be detached from their history and connotation, arguing that their usage of the term in game has evolved to mean something more neutral like ""losing very badly."" I've unfortunately heard the same sort of argument as an excuse for throwing out homophobic, racial or gendered slurs. It's my guess that most of these people have never been the target of sexual violence or are not in minority groups, otherwise they may seriously reconsider their choice of language. On the other hand, I would also guess there are some who were the direct target of bullying at some time in their life--all too often, a very common response is to ""pass the pain"".

From my experiences, the opposite of this statement is true, but then again it's a following with hundreds of thousands of fans and neither of us can honestly judge them all based on the couple dozen we've met over the course of our lives. Sounds like you were unfortunate enough to interact with a bunch of losers and jackasses that just happened to bond over liking the same band. Chances are, if they never discovered ICP, they would've been drawn to something else to identify with.

Unless you're the FBI. Then you can clearly assign them whatever criminal classification you want.

Juggalos are not a solid hivemind block. I've seen Juggalos that support the Shangri-La album's claim that the Carnival represents God and His judgement. I've seen satanist Juggalos. I've seen Hot Topic ""goth"" Juggalos that generally listen to rock. I've seen hip hop heads that view the ICP primarily as a rap crew. I've seen tatted up, white trash skater Juggalos. I know a Juggalo that has zero ICP tats or shirts, lives in a highrise condo and runs a finance firm.

Here's a [bonus picture](http://i.imgur.com/uTETeat.png). Amazing. And here's the recipe:  
  
2 tbsp butter  
2 eggs, beaten  
1 1/2 cups almond flour  
2 tbsp garlic powder  
1 1/2 tsp italian seasoning  
1 1/2 tsp onion powder  
1 1/2 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp salt  
1/4 cup shredded cheddar  
  
Preheat oven to 375. Melt 2 tbsp butter in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, beat 2 eggs until frothy. Add in almond flour then slowly add in melted butter. Add in all the seasonings and baking powder. When thoroughly mixed, fold in shredded cheddar. Use a spoon to drop onto a parchment lined baking sheet. I made 10 biscuits with this batter. Bake for 15 minutes until lightly browned. Cool for 10 minutes before enjoying.  
  
Nutrient info (per biscuit):  
Cal - 139, Fat - 12.4, Sat Fat - 2.8, Sodium - 4.7, Carbs - 3.7, Fiber - 1.8, Protein - 16.8

aDDnTN,personalfinance,1389283155.0,"get a joint mint.com account and start accounting for everything together. plan for goals and savings then create a budget that both of you can agree on and then revise that budget and the goals as time progresses.

You don't have to have a joint account for this, just trust and openness. You don't really even have to assign roles if both of you check in and help with the finances, then imo there will be less arguing about spending and the budget.

Firstly though, if you both still have this ""quid pro quo"" outlook on spending, aka gimme gimme or ""fairness"", you are gonna have some trouble. 

It needs to be about ""we"", ""us"" and ""our"", try to stick with that when things get rough. Basically, what i find happens is that i spend $100 on something, so sweetheart doesn't care that that $100 i spent (out of subjective necessity) has run us over the budget or that there is only $40 left in that budget item, ""You spent $100, so i get to spend $100.""

That shit doesn't add up, unless you just throw all the discipline out the window whenever it becomes inconvenient. And if that's the case, why even bother? Pain will become a part of learning good PF behavior and will make life more unpleasant for both of you.

That being said, if you ever find that you both are always fighting about the budget or spending, then maybe, just possibly, you may wish to consider loosing it up a bit. Or in the very least, just attempt to see things from the others perspective.

Remember that learning discipline and training behaviors takes time and effort. Effort can often become pain, especially if too little time is allowed. 6 week rule is very applicable, but if you are changing stuff every 8 weeks, then you will almost never feel like your spending is under control and chasing down every cent is an exercise in diminishing returns. Running like that for &gt;6 months will be taxing on your relationship, in the very least. Call it a marriage test run, if you can get through it and be better (or personally broken, but still together) then you will probably have a successful marriage.

It is 50/50 with everything. I buy him flowers, he buys me flowers. I get an engagement ring, he gets an engagement ring. Just do whatever you want and she'll reciprocate in ways she finds appropriate. Don't follow gender norms since she clearly seems to reject them. Doing ""feminine"" things is not a bad thing, nor is doing the ""manly"" thing. And why do you think she's sexually aggressive? Because she asks for what she wants? Because she tells you what feels good or how she wants it? If she was male, would you still consider her sexually aggressive?

And the whole ""traditional male"" thing is not going by the way side. Plenty of women still want a man that takes care of them while they take care of the house and there is nothing wrong with that. If that's what you want you should find a woman who would support that dream. "

You're wrong. People do throw their kids out. Read this sub for a while and you'll see it happen.

It's true that sometimes kids are afraid of a consequence that will never happen, but regardless I think it's sound to advise someone to be *prepared* to live on their own before lobbing a bomb that might get them tossed out of the house.

Additionally, getting thrown out of the house is only the most extreme consequence. There can be other consequences that make life extremely difficult - more than it needs to be. For example, one person said their parents confiscated their car, put them on a tight curfew. 

Those sorts of limitations on personal freedom can inhibit the exJW from being able to build up a life in the world that they can flee to.

So even if they're not thrown out of the house, deciding to tell ones parents is not a decision to be made lightly or without any preparation.

Everyone that comes here has the right to post what body acceptance means to them, or articles they find relevant. Also this particular discussion is about how thin people also face adversities, and get bullied about their size. No one is derailing a discussion and trying to say ""yea well I have it bad too!"" Most everyone is sharing their experiences, and offering what they have observed on the topic given. 

You are the one being sarcastic and rude, and you are the one that is derailing it and making it about something else. If you don't like what this thread is about, go comment on one the many many other posts on this sub.

Also, most posts that I have seen on here about recovering anorexics, where they share that they reached a very low weight (not that she is, but its just an example) end up with plenty of rude ""go eat a sandwich"" comments, and worse.

I haven't ever been bothered by it, but I haven't really been in a situation where I was looking to date and ran into it so I'm not sure.  I think if I was otherwise interested I would probably be undaunted and simply ask them to define crazy when we got together.

I_FUCK_UP_RECIPES,Xcom,1389284267.0,"&gt;Do you have anything to detect lurkers?  Do you have the damage output to take on a Mec?

I only play EU up til now.  I noticed EW multi is far more dead, although with the update maybe it will come to life.  If so I'll need to reorganize.  My thoughts on that:

With the update, in EW 3 psi guardians with skelly/lpr/medkit (2200+600+250+100) with one hypersense (400) and one berskerer (100).    Poison immune, STRONG psi resistance, two kinds of psi defense, protection from lurkers, 12 heals.  Can perpetually be under the effect of psi inspiration and almost perpetually be under tk field.  

Totals to 9950, so usually moves first too.  What sucks is the total firepower is going to struggle to keep up with the new mutons.  But they'll hit *way* more often.

Alternate gene mod choices: 3x watcher or 2x bastion.  Would be weak to lurkers, but with lurker costing 1200 it's probably not going to be a popular choice anymore.

&gt;What about Mutons and AoE squads that can ignore your smoke-grenade defense?

Legit question.  Main response is that up til now AoE units with long range (heavies, muton elites) had to be mostly alone on their team, so I would focus fire them as I'd usually see the enemy first and get the first salvo, which usually hit.  With their explosives gone the rest of the squad was just a mop up.

Now, I don't know.  It will be about staying at maximum range to deal with the new cheap mutons, and being able to tactically retreat and heal to deal with the elites.  Vs 4 muton grenadiers or 3 muton elite grenadiers I'd really need to have everyone equipped with medkits to soak the grenades, but once it's used up the threat is over and I've won.


&gt;Considering the already high aim of medics, I wouldn't bother with so many scopes or the combat drugs

There is a reason--this is not a build based on flanking up close.  It's based on flanking WIDE around, at the edge of vision--where I'm safe from being flanked in response.  I need those flanks to hit.  With the scope, I can reliably predict when I'll get hits, as it takes the RNG god out of the game.

But the risk of being mind controlled and then poisoned+grenaded is too high to ignore.  "

better to even create a joint email (imo, gmail) account and use it for all joint business from this point forward.

this has the added benefit of keeping your personal inbox clear of whatever you end up getting signed up for together, like registries and joint websites (like for weddings, etc). Wedding contacts can go with this accounts contacts list, then you won't have a bunch of random extended family/friends in your phone's contacts, but they will be kept safe, for xmas cards, baby announcements, etc.

Bonus: we used a blogspot website setup via the joint email to manage our wedding webpage (which was parked at a rented domain for 2 years, $10/year). 

PS: if you start paying bills out of whatever account has the cash to cover it, or set up some paradigm that works for you, i think you will probably want a ""cash flow"" sheet that covers your main accounts running balance daily that can view precisely what a few months future estimated expenses and earnings impact on the cash flow. I used google docs spreadsheet and share it between our accounts. Then you can create sheets for each sub-account, and have them be listed at whatever interval works best for tracking that lesser cash flow.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,feminisms,1389285679.0,"&gt;And all those words you think are coming out of my mouth right now? You put them there, not me.

You have stated that prejudice from an oppressed minority is not on the same level as prejudice from the oppressive majority. You have also indicated that believing that any kind of racially prejudiced remark is actual racism makes someone an asshole. I have taken the words that you stated and followed them to their logical conclusion - namely, that as a white kid with all kinds of social privilege and power (let's not forget he has a penis too and that means even moar power!!!), what happened to him was, well, not such a big deal and shouldn't be taken as seriously as if it were the other way around. 

&gt;Of course it shouldn't. But it does.

Don't backtrack. That's not what you've been saying.

And the reason it matters is because people like you perpetuate the idea that *it should and does*, what with your attempt to redefine the word ""racism"" to suit your ideology/politics.

&gt;Because some people are oppressed for who they are. 

And some of those people are white. And when it happens to them, it should matter just as much as when it happens to a person who is not white. Racism and racial tension will never end until we start treating absolutely all racial prejudice as equally bad and equally unacceptable. If you want to eradicate it, that's the only way - defending some prejudice as being ""understandable"" and ""less serious"" because of who is saying it will only serve to perpetuate it and keep it alive. It's the same with things like sexism - if you want it gone from your society you have to condemn all of it instead of just getting angry about sexism leveled at women while rolling your eyes and dismissing sexism against men. All of it has to be seen as equally repugnant, because in truth, all racist remarks spring from the same place of prejudice and anger and the same need to feel superior, regardless of the colour of the person it comes from or is aimed at. Until it's all seen as equally wrong it won't end.

&gt;And to make matters worse, the people with power engage in system justification rhetoric just like you're doing now

Where the hell did I justify people with power oppressing those without? By saying that *nobody* should be racist, and by saying that prejudice from a minority group is just as wrong as prejudice from a majority group, I am denying that inequality exists? Give me a break. I think this is a huge problem with blind ideology: once you get to the point where it has seeped into every corner of your mind, and colours every interaction with other people, you lose the ability to think critically about your beliefs and it begins to damage your ability to be logical. You aren't making any sense.

I'm not saying that there is not a history of oppression in Canada - there is, and it's obvious. If you read what I wrote you will find that I have in no way said otherwise. 

What I *am* saying is that belonging to a group that has historically been oppressed does not excuse hating someone else because of their skin colour. It doesn't render that hate or prejudice any more acceptable than hate and prejudice from a majority. I don't see why you are defending that and saying that their prejudice is somehow less prejudicial because of what their ancestors suffered, or because of whatever lingering inequalities remain.

&gt;to pretend that majority people being treated badly is exactly the same as generations of oppression.

The racism that motivates both of those comes from the same place. Hate is hate, whether it's taken far or not.

&gt;Hah. Because I believe in kicking out people who perpetuate oppression, I'm against equality?

The way it was worded made it seem like there are some people who don't deserve to be there because they don't believe the right things. Reading your further remarks, I still feel the same way: you have to have certain views or you aren't welcome.

OP did not want to start a subreddit for bigots and dingdongs - she wanted to start a sub where there are no sides, where people can discuss things like adults that they are not allowed to discuss in other gendered subreddits. You cannot have a forum like that if you're going to censor people's views and kick out everyone who doesn't tow the line. That's why OP is here - because so many other subreddits operate in precisely that manner, and it hinders honest discussion.

&gt;When you invite an abuser and their victim to the same party, that's not a neutral ground.

Abuser and victim...? You realize we're talking about a subreddit, right?
