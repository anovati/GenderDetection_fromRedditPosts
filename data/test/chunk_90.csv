scarlettenoir,Atlanta,1390924834.0,"We hit the cap this weekend and the following happened:

1. We were throttled down to .10mbps d/l and had non-existent u/l speeds.

2. Called Comcast yesterday morning at 10am because our internet was now 'unusable.' It took me over five minutes to load www.google.com and my phone labeled the Wi-Fi as 'unstable.'  

Comcast first stated the data caps had always been in place, and were in fact 250gb, and they had raised it to 300gb to be customer friendly (as everyone knows, this is bullshit, we were sold UNLIMITED internet when we signed up last January). They denied I was being throttled and claimed I just needed a signal refresh. When that didn't work, they suggested a hard reset. When that didn't work I was rushed off the phone with the promise of a technician coming out and then hung up on.

3. Called Comcast back at 2pm and went straight to retention. This rep was very helpful and sympathetic. She did some research regarding the caps and anything to help the throttling, and her only suggestions were switch to business class or try calling 'customer security assurance,' where they could ""extend or even remove the data cap for certain scenarios."" I was very excited at this prospect, so I took the number and asked to be transferred. Once there, the rep flat out denied that he could do anything with the cap. He also told me ""many customers like the data caps because they can stop their kids from using the internet too much."" To which I replied something like ""so all consumers should be limited and penalized just because you think a few parents are too lazy to monitor their own kids?"" Yes, I was snarky, but I'd been on the phone with them for over an hour at this point, and you all know how soul crushing that is with them.

Anyway, he dodged the snark and looked into my account. When I mentioned my suddenly bottlenecked speeds he adamantly denied that Comcast did anything to affect connections or speeds. He was evasive when I countered that my speeds tanked the day I hit the cap, and ended up claiming I had 'bulletins that hadn't been cleared' and that they were tanking my speed. I asked what these bulletins were and he explained they are prompts from Comcast that inform me that I am close to the cap, have hit the cap, am over the cap, etc. So I say ""logically, this means Comcast is causing my speeds to slow as a direct effect of approaching and then passing the data limit, correct?"" No answer. Literal silence on the line. After a very awkward pause, he finally says ""I'll clear the bulletins and you should see improvement within ten minutes, thanksforbeingacustumerkbye"" hang up. Ugh.

4. 5pm, no change. 

5. We receive a courtesy call at 6pm from a rep in retention checking that our issue has been resolved. I told her no, that our internet was still unusable, and that we'd just have to wait for the technician to check it tomorrow. She looks and sees that one was never even scheduled, even though I'd been given an appointment time and a ticket number. Ugh, I hate this company. So we reschedule the appointment and get a new ticket number, and once again threaten to cancel if this isn't resolved by the next day.

6. 10:30 pm, I randomly check my Ookla app to see if there is any change and holy internet batman! We're back to 50mbps! 

7. Today- we still have our normal speeds so I cancelled the technician. I can't help but feel that if I hadn't called as much and gone through as many reps, that I'd still be sitting here relying on my phone's 3G to access the internet. "

Either way there's really no way to empirically prove one of these arguments to be exclusively correct, so it's a waste to continue stating our disagreement.

&gt; Henkirikollisuuden yleisrakenne on rikollisuuden vähenemisestä huolimatta pysynyt muuttumattomana. Tyypillinen suomalainen henkirikos on yksityisasunnossa tapahtuva ryyppyriitatappo. Aseena on keittiöveitsi ja tekoajankohtana viikonloppu. Syyllinen ja uhri ovat vanhoja tuttuja, keski-ikäisiä, yksin asuvia, työelämästä syrjäytyneitä, alkoholisoituneita miehiä, joilla on takanaan useita aiempia väkivaltarikostuomioita. Tekohetkellä osapuolet ovat yleensä 1–3 promillen humalassa.

Translated:

&gt; The general structure of homicidal crimes has remained unchanged despite the drop in criminal activity. The typical Finnish homicide is a drunken brawl killing in a private apartment. The weapon is a kitchen knife and the time a weekend. The perpetrator and victim are old friends, middle-aged, living alone, unemployed, alcoholic men with several previous convictions of violent crime. At the moment of the act, both parties usually have a blood alcohol content of 1–3 per mille.

Also, some general points regarding the statistics:

* The blue graph depicts male and the red one female victims of homicides, per 100k inhabitants. Men are more prone to drunken brawls...
* The numbers have dropped 40% in the last 20 years. We're improving!
* The huge spike in 1918 was caused by a civil war. (Post-independence, when we were basically trying to decide what kind of a state to start and there was a ""slight disagreement"" between the parties...) 1809 is a similar situation, though the details of the statistics back then are even more ambiguous as the real war was between Sweden and Russia.
* The higher levels in the early 20th century were at least partly related to alcohol prohibition."

They will look up your information and tell you the good, the bad, and the ugly.  And they're state employees, so they'll do it all with the flair of a robot with 3% battery life left.  

Even if they say you have some warrant or whatever, you already told them you're out of state.  They're not going to send Tommy Lee Jones after you.  Just ask them directly what you need to clear everything up, and they'll tell you directly.  It won't be pretty, but you'll know where you stand.

YOUR_VERY_STUPID,asoiaf,1390924985.0,"I'm not really a literature analyst or anything, but in my opinion, he's just trying to write from too many different perspectives. I really dislike the writing in the Asha chapters, for example.

Most writers that are universally acclaimed established their own signature voice, which is usually what separates them from everyone else. For example, from Dickens, the first sentence of A Christmas Carol is ""Marley was dead: to begin with."" Anyone else would have written that differently- probably in reverse order, or using a comma instead of a colon.

GRRM doesn't have a single style- he tries to write differently from each POV. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't work very well. His habit of putting character thoughts in italics is also a little annoying to me. Regardless, he's still one of my favorite authors.

Art is subjective. There is no one to arbitrate what is or isn't great literature, and my opinions are nothing for you to base yours on. If you like it, that's fine. If you think it's the best out of everything you've ever read, that's also fine. I just personally don't rank it in my top 5, though I wouldn't even know where to begin on that ranking."

I'll probably keep it long until I notice that my hairline start the inevitable retreat and then I'll just stick to being a beardy mofo.

As for the opinions of others? The vast majority seem fine with it, and my last GF went after me because I had the beard/long hair combo. The closest thing I come to opposition is from my dear mother, who begin to grumble about it as soon as it goes past my ears (then again, she always had a very set idea of what kind of look I *should* have, doesn't matter if I'm 3 years old or nearly 30). My father is a traditionalist (short hair looks more professional which makes people more likely to employ me) but only gives his two cents if directly asked.

As for the debate of practicality and upkeep I really don't know which is more preferable. It's just different kinds of upkeep, shorter hair seems to warrant more regular visits to the hairdresser and longer hair demands more daily attention and a bit more discrimination when choosing hair products."

The first thing I would determine is whether it's actually only leaking once in a while or if you only notice it occasionally. You can try putting a rag under the drain plug and check it every hour, if it's a slow leak the petrol could be evaporating before you notice it except on hot days when the problem is exacerbated.

If you can take them off the bike and get a closer look at the problem area, maybe the threads on the bowl are damaged? Heat would make the metal expand possibly opening a passageway for the fuel to leak out? I'm just brainstorming at this point."

&gt;
    She is possibly with a friend, but not in a group of three or more.
    She is not currently checking a smartphone (thus forcing her to be social).
    She is sitting next to an empty seat, with just enough other seats occupied that it won't seem intrusive when you sit down next to her.
Just so you know, this scenario is easiest to find at wine bars, fancy cocktail bars, and upscale craft brew houses. If you don't see the proper setup, leave the building and go somewhere else.

First off, OP is in college. I don't know how many fancy cocktail or wine bars you're going to find in a college town. And if you do, I doubt how many are going to get visited by broke college students.

&gt;If you don't see the proper setup, leave the building and go somewhere else.

What the fuck? So that's it, it's now mission impossible just because you didn't see this scenario that rarely happens. Better hope you have other cocktail or wine bars close by otherwise you're going to taking a taxi all night. 

You also better hope you came alone because your friends probably won't be happy after you wanting to leave the moment you walk in the door and scan the bar. Hope you didn't spend the whole night planning on going there.

&gt;Walk up to the empty seat at the bar and sit down. Smile at her and ask if the seat is taken, but do not try to chat her up. Order a drink from the bartender and watch whatever is on TV. Engage the bartender in polite conversation if they're not too busy. Do not check your cellphone, as this will make you appear isolated and unavailable. While you drink, hopefully the woman will talk with her friend, the bartender, or other patrons. Listen to what she is saying, and wait until she talks about a subject you are familiar with. At the right time, join in with an observation or a joke. You should have a few drinks under your belt by this time, so it will make it much easier for you to be gregarious.

I'll admit this could potentially work if you pull it off right but the chances of that happening are not good. It's just such a passive and roundabout way of doing things that it makes no sense. 

Here's most likely what happens in real life. You order your drink. If the girls notice you they wonder why are you alone. You sit there for god knows how long, completely leaving it to chance that they talk about something you like and not their boyfriends or their new haircut or personal stories you don't understand. So might be spending a lot of money on drinks waiting for that to happen. If the girls don't get up and leave or get approached by some guys with the balls to actually be direct, you're still assuming he won't freeze up when his topic of interest comes up. Anyone can speak words, most guys are just afraid to break that ice no matter what because they don't think what they have to say is good enough. 

And even if you do join in with a joke or observation, so what? You've been sitting there for who knows how long by yourself. The girls aren't just suddenly going to switch to being open to you. They'll probably just go back to their conversation. You're trying to presumably get one of their numbers but you haven't set the tone for that at all. 

I get that this is an ""easier"" and less scary way to approaching girls so it will have appeal but you're not doing the OP any favors. Sooner or later he's going to have to learn how to sack up and just inject himself into their conversation.

&gt;Alternately, if you're in a wine bar, a fancy cocktail bar, or a craft brew house, an easy topic for conversation is what she's drinking. Wait for her to order something new, and then inquire about it. Learn a few buzzwords about wine or upscale beer that will make it easier to compare tastes.

This is better but it's still passive and roundabout. How do you know she'll order another drink? A lot of girls wait for guys to buy them drinks. And a lot of girls have alcohol tolerances that will allow them to drink only 2-3 drinks before they're wasted.

The biggest problem though with all this is that you're essentially putting all your eggs in one basket. If it doesn't work out with these girls, what then? Do you just try another bar? Approaching is mostly a numbers game and you're killing yourself in that respect. It also puts you in the mindset of ""I have to make this work!"" which often leads to acting desperate. Desperation is the ultimate turnoff for a girl, especially when you first meet her.

dublos,OkCupid,1390925292.0,"**photos**

I like the main photo, if you can recrop it so the thumbnail doesn't end up with a big green button over your chin as /u/dontlet mentioned, you're main is good.   Camping is dark and the hat and glasses picture looks like you're moments from bursting into tears or rage.. I'd be interested in hearing a female opinion on whether your friends reflection in the costco photo strengthens it or suggests ""ex-girlfriend""  Sweater jacket/suited up picture is really just out of focus enough to be bad.   See if you can get suited up and replace it with one that is in focus and you're not smiling so wide that you squint.

**self summary**

You're brand new in *what* field you love?

You like making things with your hands like... Whittling, modeling clay, erector set, lego mindstorm robots, what?

You love to read.. promising, but I expect a good list when I get to favorites.

**doing with my life**

Again agreeing with /u/dontlet that you are coming off as over sensitive about living at home.   It shouldn't be that unique considering your age range, so I would mention it once, maybe in the message me if section in the context of not being able to bring a date back to your place if things move in that intimate a direction.

Now we actually get a clue about what this job you love is.. I think that's enough to leave good information on the table for them to as *what* you research and develop in later messages/conversation.

I'm not sure of the use of the word argue vs debate.   Argue sounds like there's anger, debate sounds more like there's passion/strength of convictions.

**really good at**

Excellent skill, unique enough to be highly memorable and a great hook for later conversation.  Either move the cheap shot about vodka and sunny D down AFTER the blood and sand sentence or lose it entirely.  Positive before negative, always.

**first thing**

You're wearing dress pants that often?

**Favorites**

Oh, man.. you copped out.   If you're a reader you must have at least a top 5 favorite book list.   Every other category you have at least one artist/selection but the one category you mentioned in your self summary not a single one?

Every other category.. pretty solid, lots of hooks for someone to start a conversation from.

**six things** 

Excellent!  Not only a list of things, but why.   scissors -- opening foil packets without spreading their contents across the table.   Work foil coffee packets for example.

Good mix of physical and non physical 6.

**thinking about**

Funny.  I like it.

**Friday**

Good list.. more than one option that a prospective date can mentally insert herself into.

**private**

good.. solid.

**Message me if**

Weak.. how about if they want to date you?  The way it's phrased now you're seeking a book club or exercise partner, not someone you want to date.

I do not agree with /u/drunkengobots on the length, I think you've made good use of white space and it's entirely readable at it's current length.  Then I have a bias for more information is always better and you did a really good job on leaving lots of information on the table so they can take the starting point in your profile start conversations in almost any direction."

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1390925422.0,"I really don't mind when people shoot for a sport at the range. When they shoot animals because it's required and approved requirement to do that (for example hurt animals, pests and etc) it's obviously fine. 

I don't find it funny when a person shoots a deer or other animal only for the ""fun"" part. If that animal doesn't have to die why kill it? Fishing is a bit different as firstly we shouldn't really compare a fish with for example a deer. Secondly, it's not as direct as with shooting (you just put a bait in the water and fish gets it). We live in civilised world, where you can buy meat at the shop, no reason to shoot a deer just to have some deer meat.

The whole problem lies with the approach here. It's not that ""I have to do it"", it's ""I like to do it in that particular way"". It's quite obvious that shooting is much less humane and is strongly connected with that whole approach of hurting a human/animal being and crime/wars as well.

P.S. Why not ""shoot"" animals with pictures? I remember there was a guy who even invented such weapon. Instead of firing a bullet, it made a cute picture of a deer. You have all the fun of being outside, of tracking an animal and even aiming at it with a shoot... which doesn't kill. At the end of the day, go to a shop and buy some deer meat if you fancy it so much :)"

Hell, at Nordstrom, I walked in popping out of my 32E, and she insisted I should try on a 32DD--a size *smaller* than the one that I was already wearing that was very visibly too small.

Texans refer to Soda/Pop as ""Coke"" for literally all types of soda, That was really confusing. Them: ""I wanted a sprite"" Me: ""No you said COKE""

Texans freak the fuck out when it comes to extreme cold weather. If it's snow/ice outside, they dont hesitate to hit the panic button.

Texas A&amp;M has a very christian/relgious undertone, which I don't mind because I am a believer, but just in case you didn't know

The women here are gorgeous! Although sometimes I dont really get the dyed super blonde hair with the bump it and lots of make up...Not my style, but hey everyones different.

The food is pretty good, thank god for Fuego, and amazing mexican food. BBQ is awesome, except they don't have anything like pulled pork or stuff which is my only compliant.

You'll see lots of kids driving overally sized jacked up trucks, makes absolutely no sense.

You will enjoy the politeness, how easy it is to meet people, the fall/spring weather, the food, the sunsets, the football, the culture, the atmosphere.

Oh and a word of advice, Classes at A&amp;M are on steroids. Physics/Calculus/others on other campuses/schools are much easier than at A&amp;M. But you definitely learn the material or struggle alot.

If you feel you can be direct, go for it - the shock value alone will get their attention, which is what you want.

However you are here because you have that bit of hesitation, so I suggest going by the indirect approach. What this means, in simple terms, is to get their attention without going head on. A simple compliment works as an opener, i.e. ""hi, nice shoes/coat/bag"" I would not recommend complimenting on looks, you risk putting the person on a pedestal and you wouldn't really go too far with something like ""hey nice hair ...""

You can also open with something about your surroundings, i.e. if you're in a bookstore or cafe you can say ""hey is that George R. R. Martin?"" or ""hey I can never get enough of their frapuccino""

Something like that. Hope this helps you ... good luck!"

Most Australian working holiday visas enforce a limit of 6 months with one employer in an effort to have you move along and see more of the country.

Targettio,Guildwars2,1390925830.0,"No I was comparing to other games I have played. 

For example FFXI, accuracy decided whether or not you hit the mob. So you needed high accuracy to ensure good DPS.

In league of legends you need to decide, based on your skills ratios (and a bunch of other factors) if you want to build attack speed or pure damage to do the highest DPS.

In GW2 skills are meerly 'empored Auto attacks' (gross simplification, but you know what I mean), so if your Auto attacks DPS is strong then your skills are strong. 

tldr; There is no mechanic which allows you to increase one damage source (skill or Autos) independantly of the other, so you can simpify the maths and only consider the autos."

itsmevichet,askseddit,1390926169.0,"Here's what you do:

1. Get into the mindset that socializing is just socializing. Nothing about these girls - especially the fact that they're ""traditionally hot"" - change a single step in your day to day mood and interactions. They're people. Sure, you may want to have sex with one or all of them on first glance. But if you make that the ""goal"" of all your interactions, I guarantee that you will fail. Instead, keep an eye out for opportunities to show your worth and escalate.
2. That said, **you have to make moves.** Having a baseline of neutrality and coolness as I described in point number one will make any moves you DO make very clear, and very genuine.
3. Don't be afraid to talk about anything. I'm not saying to force conversations, but push the envelope a little. Make jokes.
4. With all the girls, at least be friendly. Not ""bend over backwards and listen to all of her gripes"" friendly. I'm talking ""hey, there's a thing tonight. Y'all should come with me"" kind of friendly.
5. Kino. Kino kino kino. This should be easy, because you're going to be lifting them and showing them shit from your bboying. You HAVE to do this at the practices. So, be relaxed, and remember that touching is the norm.
6. That said, if you get one of them on a date, escalate. Since casual touching is now the norm, you need to step that up to make it clear that you're interested.

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390926197.0,"Whatever the levels of sexual activity, if two people commit to time and interactions, that is a committed relationship. Now if we want to say there are committed friendships and committed romantic relationships, both which involve the same level of commitment like celebrating holidays together, going to social functions together, planning for old age together, maybe raising children together, then yes, the distinguishing factor would be the sex. But that level of commitment transcends friendship as we generally think about it. I would describe that friendship instead as an asexual committed relationship, or partnership.  *(EDIT: As a complete sidenote: I sort of wish this kind of committed friendship was common enough that people considered it as a viable and respected option for a lifetime commitment. I think that it would be a commitment some people could keep more easily, as opposed to their sexual relationships. But that's just a wish of mine.)*

If you restrict they way you think about and define things to what has currently been researched thoroughly and well, you'll be very restricted in how you think about and define things.

There is a lot of variation in how people experience things. If you can not take someone at their word that they are describing, as best they can, what they experience, you'll have a really hard time thinking about a lot of different things.

There is lack of (good) scientific data on lots of things people say they experience *(pain, pleasure, orgasms, attraction, happiness)*,  and, at least currently, all we have to go on is observing them and listening to them.

If you don't accept that, then I encourage you to move from a position of ""doesn't exists until proven it exists"" to ""possibly might exist until has been discredited."" At least when there is social observation and credible testimony.

AssaultKommando,TiADiscussion,1390926221.0,"&gt;A source providing evidence for my claim that positions of power in human society have been traditionally been filled by males (and, indeed, maleness has sometimes been a formal requirement), making it more difficult for women to claim these positions?

No, a source providing evidence for the claim that ""the cards are stacked against any woman who hopes to hold power"" with a male-dominated leadership body. 

&gt;Actually, tribalism and the moralization of sexual purity are distinct psychological impulses with distinct anthropological roots. Jonathan Haidt has interesting research on this. Mate-guarding among primates (including humans) also has little to do with in-group bias, and seems to influence the extremely patriarchal honor culture that we see in some parts of the world. 

An explanation of their relevance to deliberate male exclusion of women from positions of power would be appreciated. I fail to see how mate-guarding and and the moralization of sexual purity influences the ability of women to attain leadership positions.

&gt;True. This is probably why boys, not girls, have been forbidden from receiving educations in many societies (and why traditionalists still argue[1] boys' educations should be curtailed).

College aside, that still leaves the formative years of K-12.

Additionally, I was under the impression that we were speaking of societal norms, not fringe lunatics that take the worship of invisible sky fairies to the point where the Bible is considered an authoritative guide to living life. Misrepresenting the rhetoric of cult-like groups as a societal norm when it's advantageous to your argument is disingenuous and intellectually dishonest.

&gt;As for in-group bias, the study you link is interesting. However, I wonder if the results would have been different if (1) the researchers controlled for homophobia among men, or for the fear that expressing affinity for males would cause them to be viewed as gay and (2) if they'd tested for affinity towards women not sexually desirable or sexually available.

I think homophobia is largely irrelevant here, since affinity in this context is not related to sexual attraction or orientation. 

There's some passing mention of the methodology [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%9CWomen_are_wonderful%E2%80%9D_effect) which leads me to believe that it's a text-based IAT. I'll see if I can get someone with journal access to look up the full paper since I'm not paying 12 bucks to win internet points in a discussion.

&gt;Anyways, is it your view that women ought not attain parity with men in high-level political and executive positions?

I believe any parity has to be earned and not artificially implemented, and that women should be scrutinized as meticulously as men are for bias. Women (Amanda Marcotte cough cough) are given a pass on their biases with distressing regularity, whereas men seem to be excoriated for even the slightest affiliation with bias (Larry Summers).

Young women already outstrip young men in earning power and graduation rates in many major metropolitan areas in the US (which seems to please certain gender partisans, specious claims that they work for equality aside), so it won't be long before they work their way into the top positions of these fields.

I literally walk around with a feeling of euphoria over the smallest things because the ""fear"" is gone. I didn't even realise that I was living scared all the time until I got to experience what life was like when there's no one screaming at me and no one trying to hit me for random things I might do. 

My boyfriend use to think it was strange--whenever I broke a glass while doing dishes at his place, I would freeze up and I wouldn't be able to look him in the eye. Breaking plates or glasses at home meant getting hit, and my self defense reaction to it was to just shut down entirely. 

He also noticed that whenever he raised his arms (yawning, or just reaching to hug me) early on in our relationship, I flinch involuntarily. It's things I never really noticed about myself before being with him because he was the first relationship I had where I actually spent time around the person. I was so riddled with intimacy issues that I only ever had long distance ""relationships"" with people I hardly ever met.


It's unreal to think that there were so many little things that were the after effects from the environment I grew up in. Being who I am today, I don't understand how lucky I was that I didn't end up being worse off. I don't understand how I came from that and ended up where I am today (I no longer flinch, and while I still feel really guilty for even the small mistakes, I no longer freeze up). "

What I'm saying is this: 
 
* The landlord ultimately determines the rules of the property s/he rents out. 

If that property is the home one grew up in, the dynamics change even more in favor of the landlord. ""You don't like it, you can move out."" is a perfectly valid move for OP's mom - because it's her house. Unless mom needs that rent money to survive, then OP has a bit of a leg to stand on. 

tl;dr 

 * OP's bro made a dick move. 
 * If mom (landlord) 1. says that OP's bro can stay and continue to act like a dick, and 2. doesn't strictly require the rental money OP provides as a means to survive... then mom can do whatever she wants with the situation. 


I hope that's not the case though. I hope that OP and bro can sort things out and that it can be a peaceful household. "

Rojugi,AskReddit,1390926637.0,"*Edit for clarity:  in the UK, torch is the word we use for what Americans call a flashlight.

My boyfriend and I had his dad's house to ourselves one night.  My boyfriend was upstairs playing Skyrim, and I'd gone downstairs to get a drink.  Then I heard a noise from the bathroom, a sort of creaky squeak ending with a hiss.

I stopped, and waited to see if I heard the noise again.  I edged towards the bathroom, stopped a few feet from the door and peered into the darkness.  Then I turned around and ran up the stairs to fetch my boyfriend.  When I told him I'd heard a sort-of cat-like kind of noise, he sighed and rolled his eyes and heaved himself out of his gaming chair.  I followed him back downstairs, and as we neared the bathroom door, there the sound was again.  He froze.

""You're not crazy.""

""What?""

""I thought you were imagining things.""

He took a torch out of the cupboard and I took one too, and we pointed them into the bathroom as we edged towards it, him in front, me behind shoving him and telling him to man up while using him as a human shield.

As we stood in the doorway, shining our torches around, we couldn't see anything.  I reached in and pulled the light switch, and he gingerly nudged the curtain with his torch.

Thoughts were racing through my mind.  Was there a bat hiding somewhere, or a huge bug?  Was there a terrified little kitten that had wandered in from the cold?  Redditors are always finding stray kittens after all.

We kept looking around, poking at various fixtures to see if they made a noise and then all of a sudden, from the corner of the ceiling.

""CREEEEEE-hisssssssssssssssss""

We both jumped and looked straight to the source of the noise.

Khatib,Games,1390926775.0,"To build off the other guy's answer to you -- if you're in a supercarrier, you will be privy to certain channels of info about supercarrier operations and practices.  Fleet times, ship fits (equipment people put on them), all kinds of stuff.  Which would be a giant gaping hole in opsec where you could report on the supercapital movements and allow enemies to plan ambushes of your biggest strategic assets.

So having a titan out of the blue would not get you preferential treatment at all.  You'd be a massive, massive liability as a character of untested loyalty.


Also as a further reference that will be almost pointless with as buried as it is -- in EVE, giant ships are balanced.  It's not like in a fantasy MMO where a high level character can just swat at a low level character and one hit kill it.  

In EVE, ships have two major stats.  There are other things that make this way more complex (missiles, etc), but I'll keep it simple with just a few numbers.  Scan resolution, and tracking speed.  The smaller a ship, the smaller it's scan res.  Bigger ship, bigger res.  Certain mods will blow up a scan res as well, but we'll just leave those out for now.  All guns have tracking speed, which is how fast the gun turret can pivot to follow a ship.  Bigger guns, lower tracking speed.  Which makes sense, right?   You can't pivot tons and tons of hardware crazy fast with pinpoint precision.

So you have these massive fuck-shit-up ships.  But they can't track and hit subcapitals.  Now, subcapitals can easily hit these ""broadside of a barn"" sized ships, but they don't do a lot of damage.  So it takes a big balance of ships to fight each other.  But the smaller ships can keep the large ships pinned down and vulnerable.  Which is why a lot of the other posts are talking about needed subcap support for your big capital fleet.  Also, lots of small ships will be able to kill a big ship, given time, but that also takes a huge numerical superiority.

Anyways though, that's why having a giant expensive ship isn't an I win button, and why they can still be very, very vulnerable and why OpSec is really important and spies are a huge deal.

I haven't played in over a year, but the game is still just straight up fascinating.  I actually found it pretty enjoyable, but all the RL friends I was playing with have their schedules off of mine by a couple hours, and it just wasn't as fun to play without them, so I quit playing."

I went to a shop because my brakes needed replaced. They insisted on looking at them before they give me a quote. That's fine. I'll be back in thirty. When I came back they gave me a ridiculously high quote. I told them my mechanic in my hometown would do it for a third of that price and that I would just take it to him the next day I was off. They told me it would be ""incredibly unsafe to continue driving like this"" and that if I didn't replace them that day I was running the risk of an accident. I told them I just didn't have that kind of money, but would handle it in a few days when I went back to my hometown. They tried to me to finance it. Eventually they gave me my keys and my car and I left.

Now here's where it gets horrible. Before I went to my shop, my brakes were bad. Not ""sliding through a stop light"" bad, but definitely needed changed. When I left it felt like I had no brakes at all. I had to use the emergency brake for every stop. I told my dad and he didn't want me driving like that, so he came and switched me out cars so that he could take it to our mechanic to get it fixed.

When my mechanic looked at it, one of the brakes had been completely removed and never put back on.

jenniferocious,femalefashionadvice,1390926857.0,"This is a hard topic for me. I just turned 29, so I'm getting to a point where I'm starting to think certain things are too ""young"" for me, even though I may like them. On the other hand, I *look* young, so in theory I could wear clothes with a younger vibe without looking too disjointed. But as a general rule, I don't try to dress overly young, because I don't like getting mistaken for a high school kid (still happens).

For example: I wasn't allowed to wear short dresses/skirts/shorts when I was a teen. Then I was college age, and I was super insecure about myself and felt horribly uncomfortable showing *any* skin really other than my arms. Now I'm starting to get more comfortable and I feel like I missed the boat age-wise on shorter skirts and things. Not talking like mini skirts, but stuff shorter than or around mid-thigh.

It is difficult to shop in the area I live in. Everything is either junior's department, or stuff that my mother would wear. There isn't much around for people who are in between. I have a hard time figuring out what I *should* be wearing, because I can't try a lot of stuff on to figure out if I like it or not. So my default style these days has been like... colored skinnies, a sweater and maybe a button up shirt under it. Pretty boring, but my options are limited.

But yes, I think age affects the appropriateness of an outfit, but at the same time I don't think we *always* have to abide by that rule. Something a little cute or twee or whatever can sometimes be balanced out in an outfit by pairing it with more subdued/mature items. Or if you really adore those [fox shoes](http://www.modcloth.com/shop/shoes-flats/clever-so-sweet-flat), who has any right to tell you that you can't wear them? Basically I think that as long as it makes you happy, you can wear whatever you want, regardless of age. It doesn't mean that I or anyone else will necessarily think it flatters or suits you physically, but that isn't always the be all and end all. "

&gt; I'm not arguing that there are no sorority girls in the entire world that are like this, but once you delve further into the Greek system, you find out that the girls are much more HUMAN than you would ever expect. 

I know exactly what girls you're talking about, but those girls are a far cry from OP's description:

&gt; They were just your typical sorority girls. Always craved drama and ALL they cared about was how to make their boobs stick out more or how to make their hair blonder.

Boobs stick out? *What?* 

The way you described the sorority girls you know is on-point. If OP was really involved with girls in sororities, you'd think she'd be be able to describe them as well as you did. Instead, she used very common (and very inaccurate) tropes to describe them, which is what leads me to believe that this is a troll post. 

Furthermore, I haven't seen OP use her account since posting this…which is a pretty big indication that this is a troll. "

The valley is what most people think of when they think Oregon. It's the stretch on I5 from Portland/Vancouver to Eugene pretty much, and it has the 3 largest cities in Oregon inside of it. As such it's primarily a blue sector, has the most population in it, and is pretty liberal *for the most part*.

Once you get outside the valley though, Oregon has more in common with Utah and Idaho than the rest of Oregon. Even the Oregon coast is heavily red and conservative. Go look at a voting map for the 2012 election and you can see the divide. 

Most of the schools that people think of in Oregon(Linfield, Reed, WIllamette, Oregon, Oregon State, Portland State) are in the valley, and as such are progressive. Places like Eastern Oregon or Southern Oregon though, are outside of the valley, and are much more conservative than the others.

There could be openly gay active football players on those teams, but we really have no way of knowing without going around asking people the McCarthy-esque question of ""Do you know anyone who is gay? Would you tell us if you did?"""

You said your skin looks better if you miss a couple washes. Maybe you should try a week without cleansing and see if anything changes. I've heard of people having success with this (they call it the Caveman method), but I wear make up daily so I can't try it. 

Two or three times a week I apply raw honey to my face for about 30 mins in the morning while I'm getting ready for work. While it hasn't cured my acne, it has made my face much softer, and any pimples I have appear to be smaller and less red.

due to his popularity, he is made second in command of the fairly large high school's english department and is one of three teachers in the school instructing IB english (IB is essentially international AP).  his first year instructing advanced students he fails to enforce the necessary rubric for the IB world literature papers meaning a significant number of students must rewrite lengthy 10+ page papers a year later in order to receive IB credit.  this, in addition to complaints and rumors of his unorthodox behavior and overly-bro friendships with students, along with budget cuts, puts him on professional probation where he must defend his job within a year or lose it.

he decides he will not defend his career as a teacher and instead continues to damage his advanced students' prospects with off-the-records lesson plans, planning to become a professional full time slam poet with his performance partner when the year is up.  he attends a couple high school parties, makes a few inappropriate passes at his 16 year old students, the academic year ends, he is no longer a teacher, his son is born and he cheats on his wife (rumored with the babysitter) gets a half-sleeve tattoo, a divorce, and begins a long term relationship with a former english student of his who is now in college.

due to his connections with the local theater community (which is startlingly active in my home town) he manages to perform his poetry often enough (he is without question a talented writer and performer), while working a security day job.  he became EXTREMELY active on facebook posting lots of dramatic selfies of his tattoo and tons of digitial PDA with his various younger girlfriends all of whom look exactly like his ex wife.  he's now body-builder jacked and his linkedin says ""Social and Business Entrepreneur with a belief that our scars are actually our beauty marks.""

Once they're drained they get taken out and dunked in a steel basin that has a turkey burner under it to scald the bird so as to loosen the feathers. From there they get thrown in a [defeatherer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMydVdwmuws) that's basically a dryer but set on it's side and with rubber fingers in it. At that point they're pulled out and someone cuts their feet off at the knuckle and their heads. Last station is gutting. Usually you need two people here for a good workflow.

urfouy,xxfitness,1390927128.0,"I am trying so hard to get there.  I'm 5'2"" and 115 lbs, so I know that I'm not obese.  However, it's difficult to see myself as attractive when I hyperfocus on my flaws: the way the tops of my thighs jiggle, or how my stomach pooches when I sit down.  

I think a large part of it is that we are bombarded with skinny women.  The message in television and movies is that women are skinny and young.  All the time.  Even when the mold is broken for something like plus-size models, we ""average"" people still aren't represented.  Not rail thin, but not big and curvy either--just stuck in an invisible weight limbo.

It helps me to just interact in the world and realize that most everyone I see has an average body type.  I shouldn't waste my time perseverating on a few extra pounds when there is so much life I could be living instead.  I desperately want to get to a place where I just feel good about myself because I am me, but sadly it is a struggle."

One suggestion: Talk to everyone regardless of what you think your chances are. Worst case: You make friends/contact.

This is my impression of what's going on, merely an opinion: You're talking yourself out of doing things, and your mind is coming up with as many reasons for you to not do it. You're overthinking the situation, which is preventing you from doing anything. Act with confidence. You'll come to realize that the people around you judge you far less than you think, and that you don't need to concern yourself about how much of a fool you may end up looking like.

SoyBeanExplosion,Metal,1390927181.0,"Demigod is their most well-known album. Very straight forward death metal with a small amount of black metal influence.

*Personally* I think that'd be the best starting point, *but* that if you find it a little *too* straight-forward that you should give Evangelion a listen through as well. They brought back a lot more of the black metal influence and it's a lot more 'progressive.'

ActingPower,mylittlepony,1390927361.0,"Let's see, best I can do...

* If a card has a name, that means it's focused around that card. Rakdos, for example, is short for [Rakdos, Lord of Riots.](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253532) Aggro means you play aggressively, playing lots of strong attack cards. In fact, Google auto-suggested some ideas for Rakdos aggro decks, like [these](http://www.mtgtop8.com/archetype?a=286). And Emperor is a special version of MTG played 3v3. One player is the Emperor and the other two are guards.

* Most MTG decks stick with two colors. The Rakdos one was red and black, for example. Two is just enough to give you some variety without being spread too thin. Mono, by contrast, means you only have one color, in this case red, the most aggressive and power-based color. ""Burn"" usually means you discard or ""exile"" lots of cards (which is basically super-discard). Although now that I've looked it up, apparently it means using attacks that directly hit the player (as opposed to using monsters which can be blocked). I didn't know what Devotion meant, so I [looked it up](http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Devotion). Apparently it's a new mechanic based on the color symbols on your cards. If you have lots of red stuff out, some cards get stronger.

* Magic actually has this big metaplot going here and there. There's the Eldrazi that are trying to invade the main universe, the Slivers that are escaping their laboratory, and so on. Cards of a similar idea usually do the same thing (the Eldrazi are all about replication, the Slivers all give each other effects). [Orzhov](http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Orzhov) is one such group, apparently themed around white and black, and [The Gift of Orzhova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366339) is a card with pretty angel wings on it.

* Ah. I wasn't sure what P9 was, but now that I've looked them up, I know I've heard of them. [The Power Nine](http://mtg.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Nine) are nine stupidly overpowered cards which you're not supposed to play with because they're so broken. For example, [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=600) is basically a punchline: it gives three mana of any one color. Three! Pair that with the fact that she's only running blue to get extra focus, and you can see that this deck is ridiculous. ""Control"" is one of the two sides of a playstyle spectrum, with aggro being the other side. Where aggro decks attack hard and fast, control decks play carefully, playing card by card at just the right time. The name comes from the fact that they control the cards on the board. Oh, and that's basically what blue does, so it's particularly cheesy. (""Cheesy"" here meaning [this definition](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cheese&amp;defid=5487718).)

* [Boros](http://mtg.wikia.com/wiki/Boros_Legion) is a red/white theme, [Gruul](http://mtg.wikia.com/wiki/Gruul_Clans) is green/red. Stompy is just a slang term in Magic for strong monsters. The scale in Magic is by ones, so anything over about... 5, I'd say, is ""stompy.""

* [Selesnya](http://mtg.wikia.com/wiki/Selesnya_Conclave) is yet another theme in Magic, green/white this time. Green and white are what I'd consider the two ""nice"" colors, with white explicitly being the Lawful Good, healing/defense color, and green being the nature, growth, animalistic color. (This in contrast to red and black, the two ""evil"" colors, with black being the explicitly evil ""do damage to everything all the time, including yourself"" color and red being the ""attack all the time"" color. Blue is neutral.) Ah, [defender](http://mtg.wikia.com/wiki/Defender) is actually a specific term for certain cards. It means, just like those cards in defense mode up there, that they can't actually attack. (It's basically just put on walls so that you can't put a card on them that gives them +1 attack and have the wall attack people.)"

scarlettenoir,Atlanta,1390927367.0,"Basically, the only two options that a GA politician is suggesting at this point are:

A) Legalizing medical use to a very limited scope. Only the oil form, and one that does not contain amounts of THC that would have any side effects that would make a person feel ""high."" 

This oil, as the bill is written, would only be available to patient suffering from disorders that cause seizures. And from the statements I've read from Peake, this may only be available for pediatric patients.


B) The other motion mentioned in the article is for the creation of a committee that would evaluate medical studies related to the use of marijuana as a medication. The committee would then advise on the creation of bills related to medical marijuana.

See, I think the Burns comparison fits on a couple of levels. For one, it shows that it's possible to switch positions and be a good contributor in either one. It also fits because, as I said, Letang was a forward in his teens. Trying Letang at forward spontaneously mid-game is sort of the antithesis of giving the switch a legitimate attempt. Ideally he would get a couple of practices in and have a chance to adjust his game. Blowing an assignment when you get inserted into a new role at the drop of a hat isn't a surprising outcome, nor is it indicative of what you can come to expect in the long-term. 

As for the Norris? That trophy is almost exclusively awarded to the highest-scoring defenseman in the league. Defensive acumen is really only considered when you have two players with nearly identical point totals. Had Letang not been injured last year he would have absolutely won the Norris simply because of his lead in the points race. 

Our forward depth drops off precipitously after the top six. Dupuis is going to need to reduce his ice time as he ages if there's any hope for him to remain close to his current level of play, so he should really be moved to the third line. Adams' age is catching up to him this season, and the rotating cast of players not named Sutter among the bottom six are all bubble NHLers. Pushing Jokinen and Dupuis down into the bottom-six restores forward depth we haven't had since the Cooke - Staal - Kennedy line was still playing together. "

&gt; This is a different point entirely. The nature of subjective experience is not a scientific issue, but a philosophical one -- an immensely important and interesting one at that. But it cannot be confirmed or elaborated upon by empirical inquiry.

It has not YET be confirmed or elaborated by empirical inquiry (as currently published).  There was lack of study on biology behind homosexuality, until it was done. There was lack of empirical evidence on stress, until there wasn't.

I am part of an ongoing research study in happiness and pleasure right now. People have been so busy studying depression, they haven't spent much time looking at happiness, until recently. I don't know how much is out in publication yet, but there will be some empirical data soon.

Withholding judgement on something that is not yet proven is not the same as saying it can't be because it isn't yet proven.

Indeed:
&gt; taking this stance also prevents you from making false commitments without proper evidence. It's a tradeoff.

Most people walking around don't have much choice in what gets researched. And to discredit what people say about themselves simply because it has not yet been researched, despite social observation, isn't really fair to them. Or to yourself, unless you are going to take responsibility for research. 

EDIT:

And, to come back to the issue at hand: If we say that romantic relationships are commitment plus sex, than the choice to engage in any of them is hedonism + social norms. 

And whatever we call orientation, or how we define it, is irrelevant. It no longer matters at all.

We've established committed relationships without sexual acts (whatever we want to name them), sexual acts as hedonistic. 

Whatever the biology of the person is irrelevant. Whatever orientation they say they have doesn't matter. There becomes nothing at all to discuss.

All commitments are choice. All sexual acts hedonistic.

&gt;This whole rejection of me by ""the community"" if you call it that is based upon a meta sub witch hunt. SRD, SRS, conspiratard, and the badsub network really have a hard on for shouting people down if they don't agree with a few ideological anchors such as ""all conspiracy theory is stupid"" ""consensus = science"" ""the MSM is the gospel"".

&gt;I reject these anchors and allow people to think beyond the consensus. This obviously makes people uncomfortable and thus they hate me.

No, we don't want you because your personal beliefs conflict with Randall Munroe's, you have no respect for other people's intellectual property, you attempt to silence all dissent on /r/xkcd, and you consistently prove that you're a hypocrite. Other subreddits happened to agree.

&gt;Judging from the size of the xkcd alternative community, most of the existing community doesn't give a shit and you have a vocal minority who wants absolute control.

Stop removing links to /r/xkcdcomic for a week and see how big it gets. It's so small because you keep trying to hide its existence.

&gt;Wyboth obviously wasn't happy with having full control since soccer was still the head mod so he started this drama.

I'd hardly call what I had full control if I was removed for making a small change. Also, the drama didn't start until after I was removed. The community was okay with soccer being on top as long as he didn't do anything, like what's happening right now.

&gt;They are control freaks who don't want people to talk about taboo subjects, even in a sub that was created specifically for that purpose.

If we're laughing at /r/conspiracy in /r/conspiratard, it doesn't mean we think you guys shouldn't be talking about conspiracy theories, it means we think conspiracy theories are stupid. Besides, [the admins already addressed the issue of why certain subreddits commonly labeled as vote brigades aren't banned.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gloriouspcmasterrace/comments/1r01ny/glorious_masterrace_hear_me/cdi9ld6) (TL;DR, they aren't brigading enough to be banned.) Vote brigading subreddits get banned, as do individual brigaders. There's no reason to remove reddit.com links, and many reasons not to. I don't think the admins will accept your terms.

&gt;The CSS is part of the sub.

Amelora,raisedbynarcissists,1390927859.0,"I am not married, but let me tell you about my sisters wedding.

So my sister got pregnant while she was engaged. NMom did not want bastard children so to the alter it was. 

Nmom paid for everything - which seems nice until you realize the whole thing only cost $1,000. How you ask? Well sister had to use my aunts wedding gown, which didn't fit properly due to her being pregnant. This got Nmom a stab not only into my sister but also her (5 years dead) sister that she has always felt jealous of, as a pregnant woman could fit into her wedding dress (weight is a huge thing with my mom) 

My sisters flowers came from the local grocery store, sister was told she didn't deserve anything better. The ceremony was held on the beach as mother didn't want to rent a hall and didn't want anyone to see her unwed pregnant daughter trying to pull off a church wedding. Dinner after was at mothers favorite restaurant, sister didn't even know where ti was til the actual dinner. 

 Sisters friend did her hair, she did her own make-up which mom promptly complained about because it wasn't 'wedding' make up. Sisters friend was invited to the wedding, but not the dinner after because mom couldn't 'afford' it. There  were 20 people at the dinner after - ALL of which were either my step fathers family or my mothers friends. Some of the guests were people my sister had never even met, but they were mom's office friends. Sister was not allowed any friends and when she complained about it sister was bashed for being a selfish bitch. Also my sister was not allowed to have my dad there. We aren't that close to my dad, but a normal person would have sucked it up for a day.
So sister had one friend at the wedding, no friends at the dinner after; groom had no friends or family there because his parents were dirt poor and couldn't help pay, so he got no say in ANYTHING.

That was 10 years ago, sister is now divorced from that guy - but still bitter about the wedding."

It's not like the raise only triggers at a certain number of hours per week (contrary to things like healthcare mandates), the replacement employee would be paid the same.

Government contractors submit bids to get the contract. The lowest bid usually wins. If I, as someone who is attempting to get a contract, suddenly have to pay my workers 30% more but I still want to have the lowest bid, then I am going to either cut corners in other areas (BAD), or I am going to cut down on my labor costs in other ways--like by lowering the hours that my employees work. If I get an employee down to part-time, then I don't have to pay benefits anymore either, which further lowers my cost.

I tried joining a softball team as a kid, but I was one of the worst players and wanted to quit. I mentioned this to another girl on the team, and she told me that she's terrible at it too but that she finds it [softball] fun because she can be a part of the team and cheer for everybody. Her comment would have applied whether I was awesome or terrible-- I should do my best when I'm up to bat but enjoy being a part of my teammates' successes. As an adult, I can't tell you how much this has added to my life. When the people around you succeed, your life gets a little better too. I know it's hard to just turn off your feelings, so first try an economic mentality: If she's a rising star, it will help your CV to be on publications/projects with her. If she automatically gets a high social status because of her looks, yours will get a boost from hanging out with her. While you might force yourself to do this now, these perks will be reinforcing and eventually you'll start to automatically feel good when you see that the people around you are succeeding. "

LasherDeviance,TheRedPill,1390928042.0,"Work wise, Texas is the place to be. You will find a job here and fast. 

But Dallas blows as there is nothing worthwhile to do and most of the dudes here are ***blue pill as fuck*** hence the proliferation of strip clubs. When you meet a chick, check out the escort section of dallas backpage, because there is a high chance that she strips, has stripped in the past, or sells pussy. Sugar babies are common here as well, don't buy a dallas bitch anything.

Have fun trying to find dudes to hang out with. Most of them have been living with their GF since the end of high-school, so a lot of dudes 25 and older already have kids and no money. All they do is bitch about child support as well because if you aren't married and you and a chick have a kid, the state instantly put you on child support even if you live together and she doesn't want it.

Dallas boasts being racially diverse, but outside of common areas everyone sticks to their own. If you are Black, White people wont hang with you, period. If you are White, Black people wont hang with you and Latinos will suck up to you, but talk bad about you behind your back in Spanish.

You cant buy liquor after 9pm. Nor on Sunday except at bars.

There are more burbs than city, and anything south of Downtown is a post-apocaliptic hellhole AKA Oak Cliff/South Dallas.

There are a lot of fat women. **A LOT**.

Dallas boasts having the highest number of restaurants in the nation, but they are all variations of the same shit: sushi/Asian, BBQ, steaks, Fast food hamburgers, Tex-Mex/Tacos and shit, buffets, and India food. Try finding a legit Italian or French restaurant or a non-chain pizza... Won't happen.

You have to own a car here. Mass transit here is piss-poor. The only thing you can rely on are the trains, and they stop running at 12am. So if you want to barhopping past midnight you have to drive, and TX boasts the highest DWI/DUI rate in the nation because of it. Also if you get a ticket and forget about it/don't pay it on time, the cops will come to your house a/or job looking for you to put you in jail for a $50 ticket. If this happens, you will instantly be fired.

The night life is stagnant as no really good concert tours come to Dallas except the Really big commercial artists and Country music.

A lot of Texans have never left TX because it's so big, so they have a disdain towards people from out of town and they are very cliquey. If you didn't graduate high school here, you will never be fully accepted by Dallas dudes.

I've lived here for six years, and with the exception of like one 50-something year old guy that I get together with to BBQ, all of the people that I hang with are from other cities, and they all have the same feelings about it here as I do.

My sugesstion: go to Chicago, New York, Miami. It might cost more to live there but starting out fresh out of school, you might want to live somewhere more live, and you will make more per annum than you will here. 

Texas is where you come to settle down with a bleached-blonde fat woman that smokes cigarettes and drinks moscato."
tangerinelion,Homebrewing,1390928045.0,"Buckets are awesome.  If you ever want to know the true downside of glass carboys, look up glass carboy accidents on homebrewtalk and mentally take a note that nearly every person with a sliced open arm or leg, or in need of reconstructive hand surgery thought they were handling the carboy in a safe manner.  

Buckets, man, buckets.

Most folks on here are talking about using glass for a secondary.  IMO most beers do not need even need a secondary.  But if you do use a secondary then a bucket is not that good, because the headspace is generally too large.  It's possible you can find a small bucket for this, but a carboy is going to have a better seal on it.  I would really recommend a Better Bottle if you secondary, though, in the 5 gallon size not the 6.5 gallon size (that would make a good primary, but you still suffer from the relative expense compared to buckets *and* they're hard to clean because you have access to a 2"" neck versus the fully open top on a bucket)."

3. Eliminate some things with monthly payments that never end, like cable TV. 
4. Save 20% for a down payment on a house. If you can't even do basic saving, you have no business buying a house. 
5. Your resulting house payment (with insurance and taxes) should be no more than 30-35% of your take home pay. Assuming you have a 25% tax rate, your house payment should be no more than $1087/mo.

I disagree, because in some cases, these are still live issues.

Unlike the situation for the Jews or almost any other minority in Europe, it is still socially respectable to be racist with respect to gypsies.

To note these things - to stress that they are being ignored and that it has current relevance - does not diminish what happens to the Jews. But at the moment that one genocide does overshadow all the rest, and this remains dangerous."

White is ALWAYS in season it seems, and ivory + an aiding color(yellow, lavender, pink) would look so pretty lining the aisle and in the brides hand in that sanctuary for the ceremony. Other fun colors you might try could be light pinks &amp; yellows, or oranges and yellows and reds. Honestly, most colors are in season, it is just the flowers that vary.

Flowers to recommend that are non-allergenic, I will treat this as though your summers are catered to by wholesalers like ours... Things like daisy poms, carnations, baby's breath, and alstroemeria will keep the prices low, but to make it more showy for your venues, you should consider adding Stock because of how many nice colors it comes in :) Things like hypericum berries also are really awesome, add class, and are worth looking into for their ""non-floral/but-still-floral""-ness.

You see homemade shakes advertised a lot around here right? They aren't the most convenient but they are high calorie and they are actually healthy for you. Maltodextrin is literally sugar, you might as well put HFCS into your shakes. On the other hand, you could use a cofee grinder and powder up some oats, which are complex carbs ( They're good for you!), and make a far better equivalent.

Seriously, you can just throw some powdered oats, whey powder and some milk in a blender cup and you have a quick, healthy shake! It's also very high in calories as well man, trust me you don't want to be downing maltodextrin all the time, it's just like granulated sugar. It's processed garbage bro, it's not good."

Tenure helps bad teachers.  My uncle is a principal and he wanted to fire a math teacher who was just terrible.  The other teachers said it was obvious who his students were because they had no idea how to do whatever year of math they were coming from.  Kids were losing out on basically their entire math education because they weren't learning skills, moving forward, and then getting overwhelmed and failing.  It took him 2 years and a massive lawsuit to remove the teacher. 

Teaching is a job.  If you don't perform, you get fired.  That's how it is for everyone else.  "

If the wife needs some reinforcements, I'm there. If I've got five minutes, I can do some chasing or tickling. Not commuting those two days adds up quick on gas savings. I've been considering looking for a better opportunity as the job market is moving and shaking currently, but this perk is hard to let go.

Other perks include:

* Playing with the latest tech that can be found in a datacenter

* I get to access the systems of big name companies. The reality is everyone's shit is fucked up in one way or another. Seriously. No one knows WTF they're doing and I have yet to encounter a company that's got their shit together running like a well oiled machine.

* I have stumbled across the inventory lookup and pricing margin system of my employer. I work on the managed services side of things, but my employer also sells shit. It's surprising that at times a wholesaler like Ingram Micro sells us shit for more than what Amazon sells directly. So much shit where margins are super tight that it's a wonder how we're still in business.

* They pay for the cost of a certification exam if one passes. Training is some BS online library and only rarely do they actually cough up the cash for in-class training.

* My boss isn't on my ass all the time

* Within reason, I can come in late or leave early. As long as I've got 40 hours in and I was available when shit hits the fan, they're happy.

* I've got a pretty decent laptop that was brand new when I started; I've never encountered or expected this. I was able to convince them to pay for more RAM and an SSD. It drives four monitors natively when I'm in the office without the use of a DisplayPort USB adapter. They've got their heads on straight with lifecycle management and mine is starting to show its age so I'll be getting a new one later this year.

* Speaking of lifecycle management, we decommission things regularly for our equipment or customers. There are times when stuff is going to get thrown out or picked up by a recycler and it's up for grabs. I haven't scored anything super sweet yet, but there's a SAN shelf they may let me take that I can sell for a few thousand. I'm on the hunt for a power efficient and quite server (yeah good luck), but haven't found what I need yet.

But camos are only available through Station Cash, while most of the other stuff (like weapons) can be unlocked through playing. So if you decide later on you want Camos you will need SC again. Thats why people, including myself, spend SC mostly for cosmetic or stuff you cant buy with certs.

The biggest benefit by buying weapons with SC is that they unlock account wide (but some are bound to your fraction so be careful. If it for example reads ""Only for VS"" then only character at that empire can use them). So if you buy weapons i would suggest to buy only weapons that cost 700SC/1000 Certs as it takes some time to get 1000Certs ig."

It does seem most common for people to be making them as a DIY project, which I am not interested in.  There are some used ones out there for ~$5k that are the result of this and IMO are just an eyesore; the finished custom nice ones appealed to me but then you're getting as expensive as a 2br house.

There's an attenuated form of the guilt some German feelabout the Holocaust, as the French occupation govt collaborated with the Nazi deportation efforts. Arguably it also contribute to the current problems, as today's youth are tired of the guilt and see the special treatment Jews seem to receive (notably with specific hate-speech laws) as favouritism and the result of lobbyism."

When he first entered the wagon, seeing us with alcohol on every single one of the tables we occupied, he just laughed a bit. When checking our tickets, we were talking to him a bit, making jokes and everything. I asked him if he wanted a drink as a joke (although I would gladly have given him a couple of beers). He laughed and said, ""nah, don't worry, I'm already taken care of"", and takes a fucking flask out of his inner pocket and winks.

When he entered the next cart he shouted *""if anyone is thirsty, this is the place to be!""*. When he came back from his tour, he asked the group if anyone was single. A couple of guys raised their hand, and he said, *""well, go check out the next wagon, there's some cute girls in there who look interested in some fun""*.

We took a picture with him after the train ride (we had to go all the way to the last stop anyway)."

dan4daniel,politics,1390928831.0,"I have to ask? Weren't all those bad men with guns then stopped by other people with guns? Or in a few cases by themselves with a gun? I suppose in your perfect world no one would have a gun, which I assume could work. But then will you pass knife, bat, hammer and dare I ask, muscle mass control? I only ask because the most victimized demographics are always the elderly and female citizens who tend to be smaller and weaker than their attackers. Do you not want a woman or old man to be able to have a defense against their attacker just because that opportunity for defense could be abused by someone else? If we're going to use that logic we have a long list of things to ban, computers, cars, dry ice, ice picks, the list goes on. Now, perhaps you're thinking, ""No, we only have to ban guns, because only guns were orignally designed to kill."" Sadly, that's incorrect, swords, axes, javelins, bows, arrows, hammers, bats, knives, walking sticks and the Yo-yo  etc. etc. were all designed to kill so I expect you'll have a series of short bills, less than 300 pages if you please, ready to ban all of these devices and derivates thereof. Now, once you've done all that we can all sit down together and have a peaceful meal until someone picks up a rock and proceeds to beat someone else to death with it and then I suppose you can either ban rocks or perhaps in that moment of clarity while some poor defenseless bastard is getting his head turned into red pudding you can admit to yourself that disarming people in order to protect them from other people that would do them harm is never going to work. It hasn't worked in Japan, it hasn't worked in Australia, it didn't work in Britain and it definitely won't work here. Sure, their gun violence numbers are down, but each of those countries saw a gain in violent assaults and murder eventually returned to pre-ban levels, people just found other ways to kill each other.

Much better main photo, clear, shows your eyes, you look like someone I as a guy can have a conversation with, so hopefully you also look like a guy that a girl wants to chat up.

Lose the picture with the stain covering the bottom 2/3s of your shirt in the bar.. the other guys in the picture were a problem, but the drink spilled down your shirt is the bigger problem.

I like the suited up picture, bathroom selfie or not, it shows you clean up well.  eventually replace it with a picture of you dressed up that's out and someone else holding the camera, but this works in the short term.

**self summary**

Great, your self summary is that you like to drink, and it's awesome that the new town you are in has bars close enough that you can do that without worrying about getting a DUI.   

Who are you?
Where do you come from (big family, small family, big town, small town)?
What kind of a person are you?
Capitalize Philadelphia 

**doing with your life**

Cherry Hill also requires use of the shift key.  Otherwise pretty solid, you could fill in more with life goals here.. is HVAC work a job or a career.. what other careers interest you?

**good at**

Video games isn't a bad thing to be good at if you also like video games that can be played by more than one person in the room or co-op with a hot gamer girl when you're not together.  Emphasis on co-op, not vs.

Poker.. really more of a solitary pursuit, and if she also likes to play you're playing against her, not with her.. not ideal

What other things are you good at that might relate more closely to dating?

**see first** 

assuming twice in the sentence.. awkward.  How about warm eyes, welcoming smile?   Sure it's cliche, but looking at your pictures even I'm seeing your eyes first and thinking I'd like to share a beer.. maybe a woman sees the same thing and wants to share a date?  (Ladies?  what do you think?)

**favorites**

*honestly I do not remember te last time I've read a book in full. So there's that.*  Honesty is good, so is proof reading and spelling out the word the.   

Proper names (like television shows) also require use of the shift key.

*I could probably listen to anything but not a fan f heavy metal* of should be fully spelled too.

*go too* to, not too.

**Six**

Pretty solid.

**thinking about**

Not bad, shows you've got an eye toward the future.

And I'm pretty sure those folks are indicating you shouldn't *just* say what's up and expect the other person to carry the conversation.  Read their profile, look for hooks they've left to give you a jumping off point.

**Friday**

Again with excess consumption of alcohol.. are you trying to say you're likely to be at AA 5 years from now?

**Private**

Yes, so funny.. can't contain my companionable laughter.. not so much.

**Message you**

Sentences, not randomly having carriage feeds in the middle of them.

How about lose the 2 negative sentences spanning 6 lines and put in something positive.. Do you want a fellow sports fan to cheer with?  Do you want someone who has similar taste in movies?  Do you want someone who gives you something better to do on a Friday night than drink till you are drunk?"

kerofbi,UCDavis,1390928913.0,"So the problem with a lot of the discussion in this thread is that context isn't provided, so I'll provide some examples.

For most of the main roads within UC Davis, during rush hour, sudden slowing/stopping to yield to pedestrians is going to cause a lot of issues IF the pedestrians are crossing in the middle of the road/jaywalking. In these cases, the burden is more on the pedestrian to make sure they don't interfere with bike traffic.

However, at any place with a cross walk or on paths (not roads), the burden is going to be more on the cyclist(s), and so they should yield unless it is safe to go. 

So the context of the original post, by my guess, probably refers to pedestrians crossing in the middle of somewhere like California or Hutchinson. In those cases, suddenly noticing a cyclist and trying to dodge them is going to be more detrimental then helpful, as it will likely disrupt the cyclist's original path (which accounted for pedestrian crossing at a constant rate/linear path).

Of course, all of this is typical behavior, and in both cyclists and pedestrians you'll find people with unusual and/or bad traffic sense and practices.

In the end, my suggestion is that you should pay attention to the traffic (duh), but also try to avoid erratic movements.


Also, some of the people posting here don't seem to be very familiar with the traffic situations/conditions on campus."

CAUTION: you need to this these commands carefully and exactly or you can make your computer unbootable or erase data that you don't want erased.  Only do these commands if you are comfortable and understand what they do.

If you are not afraid of the command line and can follow instructions clearly, do the following.  Reboot the computer holding Command key and the S key.  It'll look like an old linux computer booting with white text on a black screen.


At the bottom of the text, it'll say something about to make changes to this disk, type these commands.  Type the one that says mount in it.  I think it is :


'/sbin/mount -uw /' without the back tick things and then press Enter

That command make the hard drive able to be edited.

type the following

 'cd /Users' and press Enter, and then type 

 'ls'

Look for your username short version.  Like smith.

This is to confirm your username.

type the following

 'rm -rf /Users/jsmith' replacing jsmith with your username

This removes all of your data.  Your Documents, Desktop, email settings, bookmarks, etc.  All gone.

crankypants15,AskMen,1390929024.0,"&gt; He mentioned his ex (they broke up a few months ago) once each date, but said he was over her, when cuddling he told me that he doesn't want me hurt, and that although he doesn't mind a gf he doesn't want something super serious where we're living together after 6 months *(I am NOT looking for that, just a fun, light relationship)* 

Then tell him that. Sounds like he wants a relationship but doesn't want to live together after 6 months. 

&gt;  he said I wasn't a rebound. When he left Sunday I stupidly over analyzed what he said and sent him a text about how I don't think he's over his ex, 

Yeah, that was really stupid. 

&gt; I went on to tell him that I am no where near ready for the type of relationship that brings marriage, moving in together, etc and how I don't enter a relationship looking for that, as that seems silly. I go in knowing I enjoy the persons company, and that's it. 

Sounds pretty clear to me. 

VERY quickly, call him, and tell him you want another date, or he will look elsewhere. Because you seem pretty wishy-washy. 

&gt;  I was thinking about calling him tomorrow night (that gives this 24 hours no contact from me) apologizing for my overanalyzing on Sunday night, and overwhelming, bizarre texts and just explaining that I like him, I think he's really quite a catch and that I didn't mean to scare him off 

Yes yes yes. Recognizing that you were acting stupid is about the only way a girl will recover this. A person who cannot admit their mistakes is a person with little potential. 


You're allowed to make mistakes. But you have to recognize them and TELL the person you know it was a mistake.

Ah yes I'm seriously white knighting here, how else do you expect me to get with all these maidens?? 

They take good pictures that provide quality content to the subreddit, nothing wrong with pointing that out.

&gt;I haven't been interested in pictures of tits since i was 12, hence the comment.  Every girl has them.  None are exceptional or some unicorn.  That goes for pussy as well.  My chances of giving a fuck about some random naked girl go up only when I have a chance of fucking her.  gonewild is not that venue, hence I'm indifferent.

That's you, you're in the minority. Most men enjoy nude pictures. It has no bearing on age or sexual activity. I'm sexually active and very much enjoy looking at naked women who I'll never sleep with, why? Because its fun to look. 

&gt;the reason for every post on gonewild is a misguided need for acceptance and approval.  Unfortunately, when you feel your best shot for that is by showing your asshole to the world, I find it a bit sad.  You are free to enjoy it as you will.

spiderspit,rage,1390929353.0,"What she did do is leverage her family name to catapult herself into the life she has right now. Would a Paris Smith sex tape have made headlines, intentionally released or not? Would tabloid editors run a story that began, ""Paris Porter, certified nurse, partying with friends""? 

Hotel heiress, heir to the Hilton fortune, sounds catchy and sells copies. So her fame and resultant fortune is directly linked with her family name, and while she didn't get any hard cash she did get a surname that was worth newsprint. People are interested because of who she is inspite of herself. People watch her shows not because she adds value to the production, like say a famous chef, or designer, or builder or David Attenborough or Morgan Freeman.

She worked with what she was given and if her intention was to make a living then you can say she has been successful, but in no way more remarkable than Patty Jenkins at the shop."

Trigger23,penguins,1390929365.0,"I think he's an elite *offensive* player. If he didn't put up points like he does, he's a 5h or 6th defenseman at best. I don't see any problem with taking a one-dimensional player and putting them in a one-dimensional position. It strikes me simply as setting him up to be more successful. We really need a 1st-line RW and haven't had a legitimate one since Guerin played there, and having  Kobasew filling in there strikes me as being pretty desperate. The guy barely belongs in the league, to say nothing of flanking the best player in the world. 

We may be playing as one of the top teams in the NHL, but the deficiencies in our forward corps will be exposed in the playoffs again if we don't at least keep the bottom-six caliber forwards in the bottom six. As it is, if we were out west we would likely be in the middle of the pack. Being in the east (and more particularly the Metro) inflates our standing in the league.

It's cool if you bleed after pulling the needle out after injection. It probably means you nicked something carrying blood. There will probably be a bruise there, but it's nothing major. You might want to look into the Z-track method, which essentially means you pull the surrounding skin to one side and hold it there before sticking the needle in and while giving the injection.

beanfiddler,AdviceAnimals,1390929568.0,"My mother had two children in wedlock. Before she and her husband turned 30, they were pulling down nearly six figures on his income alone.

And then he divorced her and sued over and over again until he could successfully hide his income, and she spent all of her alimony fighting his frivolous lawsuits. And he paid the minimum amount of child support mandated by the state -- which isn't a lot. It's set purposefully low to keep arrests down and give deadbeats an incentive to pay.

So my brother and I were raised on food stamps, and judgmental fucks like OP gave my mother no shortage of shit for it. They thought us bastard children (we weren't) and that my mother planned poorly and milked the system for aid instead of using birth control (she purposely got pregnant with both of us; we were planned -- and her and my father had a seemingly happy marriage, two cars, and a house when she had us).

Sometimes, your life goes to shit. And instead of people commiserating, and recognizing the futility of planning for every unforseeable outcome, they throw up insurmountable barriers to government aid.

I am wondering why, if you are *not* ""limited"" in your attractions (not the word I would choose, btw, it sounds a little judging, I'd probably say someone had a preference, or something), what is your issue with being referred to as pansexual/using the word to describe yourself? I mean, if you are honestly attracted to all people regardless of any gender identity/birth gender, that sounds like ""pansexual"" to me. I understand that bisexual is the more storied, older, and better known term, and I have no attachment to it one way or the other, and you may, thus I have no problem using the term pansexual beyond some minor cultural push-back sneering all neologisms must endure.

delanthaenas,TrueAskReddit,1390929721.0,"I said this in a thread just last night and I'll say it again here.  There is a predatory aspect (on the part of the sober person) when they have sex with a drunk person.  No one sits around waiting for someone to be drunk, hands them keys, and says ""Here, get yourself home!""  But there are plenty of people who wait for others to be drunk and less inhibited, or passed out and completely unable to consent, and then have sex with them.  

This is why we say things like ""people don't get raped because they were drunk or dressed scantily, people get raped because someone raped them.""  Because there is necessarily another person there, acting as a predator, who takes advantage of a situation.

That said, I don't believe all drunken sex acts are rape.  If two people get drunk, stumble home together, and regret it the next morning, we can't say they raped each other, because there was no predatory intent.  The reason though, that we say ""no one can consent if they're drunk"" is that it's so hard to prove intent.  Drinking and driving though, is NOT ABOUT INTENT OR PREDATION.  It is against the law to be drunk and to be driving your car.  It is not against the law to be drunk while having sex."

jubbergun,AdviceAnimals,1390929785.0,"&gt; It is extremely bigoted to assume that a child raised on welfare is any less valuable than one raised without.

Given that Reddit is a place where you constantly hear about the growing divide between the haves and have nots and the (alleged) lack of social/financial mobility, it's not at all bigoted to assume that a child raised on welfare is going to grow up to be an adult on welfare.  That's not to say that there is some inherent flaw in the child/person, but you either have to invest in the idea that the poor stay poor or the idea that everyone has a real chance to succeed and better their situation.  Leaving aside shades of gray, it's either one or the other.

What I think I'm trying to say here is that while it's ridiculous for people who think the income gap doesn't matter because everyone has an opportunity to succeed to express the idea that people on government assistance having children is a drain because those children will grow up to be on welfare, it's equally ridiculous for those who think there is no chance to better one's station in life to express the idea that a child that grows up on government assistance will become anything other than an adult who requires public assistance.

TioTaba,Equality,1390929850.0,"I'm really tired of that 'privilege' bullshit I've been seeing around the internet lately.

Why is it that people try to invalidate other people's opinions and points of view because of their race, sexuality or social status or whatever? Because I'm a white straight male, I can't empathize with anyone that's different from me? That's ridiculous. Seems to me that this is a teenager's attempt to win an argument when they just can't argue anymore. So they pull the ""privilege card"" to shut people up and come out on top.

Their basic point is that if you never went through what *insert any minority here* have been through, then you can't possibly understand them. Hell, I've never been a dog, but I can't stand the sight of an abandoned one. See, I have feelings, and I have a brain, so even if I never went through this or that, I can still be sympathetic toward my fellow human beings (or animals, as in my example) because I don't want them to suffer, or have their rights denied to them. To try to disprove someone's point of view because they've never been through some kind of situation is just absurd.

So, you wanna know why I belive gay people should be able to get married, adopt kids, and live their lives as normally as anyone else? Because there are a lot of them that I love (that includes you, /u/johnnybigoode ), and I want them to be happy and safe. I want them to do anything they want, and I don't want them to be discriminated because they love (and the key word here is 'love') someone from the same sex. And even though I can't say I have queer or trans friends, I do wish them to be happy as well, because I know that the people I love want that for them too, and if they're happy, I'm happy. So it's very plausible for me to pick up that fight. I want to take my kids to visit their two uncles or two aunts and I want that to be ok for them.

Speaking of kids, I want to be a father someday, and I sure as hell won't tell them they can't love someone from the same sex (or that they are obligated to identify to their gender and all that stuff). So I want THEM to be happy too, I want them to be safe. And above all, I want grandkids too, so if they're gay, they should be able to adopt.

So do not come and tell me that I can't voice my opinion because I'm white, straight, male and I have some money on my pocket.

I concede that I don't know what it's like to be gay, and all the struggles that comes with it, but that doesn't mean I can't understand someone that went through this. Besides, I've been a target of prejudice as well, and even if I didn't I'd still want to voice my opinions. My point is, you can't judge anyone because you'll never know their full story. What I do is, when I don't understand something, I ask my gay friends to educate me, and I think that this is something all allies do. I mean, if someone is considered an ally, it's because they want to understand, they want to help, right? Gay people shouldn't pick their allies. And if they are doing something that doesn't match the cause, they should be educated, not shunned. That's why I come to LGBT subreddits whenever something picks my interest.

The same goes for Macklemore. It's very stupid to discredit him because of his status. You don't know why he's doing this, you don't know where he's coming from and what he has been through. Besides, it's not like he's hurting the cause. He may not be talking about everyone that's under the LGBTQ umbrella, but I'll bet he's singing about what's real for him, his reality and what's familiar for him. For that alone he should be respected.

Recently I learned that there are a lot of narrow minded gay people, and there are even a lot of prejudice among them, and this baffles me. This is something very hard for me to understand, because it doesn't make any sense. And all that Macklemore bashing is proof of that. That's a personal opinion, but I think gay people should be the last kind of people to be narrow minded.

These people need to get off of Tumblr a little bit and check their reasoning.

The non-foaming Cetaphil cleanser is good (I like the CeraVe hydrating cleanser about the same), but I prefer using a foaming cleanser. I have found that the Cetaphil foaming cleanser leaves my skin feeling tight, but the CeraVe foaming cleanser doesn't.

I prefer the CeraVe moisturizer because it doesn't make me feel as greasy as Cetaphil. I have used the Cetaphil lotion in the pump, as well as the cream in the jar (for very dry skin this might be the best thing to use; my mother swears by it), but they were too oily.

You aren't always capable of noticing and executing the best move, but skill is what will give you the ability, not motivation.

Easy enough if the plank was dry - just don't stop halfway up!

At one stage I took the bike off the road for a couple of weeks to fix some problems, and make it into a bit of a caff racer. As part of the work, I fitted ace bars. The problem was that I didn't realise that the bars were a bit wider than the originals, so next time I rode up I clipped the throttle against the door frame. Rather than braking to go across the step carefully, I wheelied across the corridor and left a wheel mark three feet up on the opposite door.

ankylosaurus_rex,ABraThatFits,1390930524.0,"So the difference between your snug underbust and your three bust measurements are 3.5, 4.5, and 3.  A range of 3 to 4.5 usually indicates a cup size of C, D, or DD.  If we were to put this with your technical band size (which would be 26), we'd of course get 26C, 26D, or 26DD.  26 bands are impossible to find (no really, they're pretty much only custom), so we'd want to sister size up to 28 bands.  Which gives you 28B, 28C, or 28D.  Your 28B is too small, so that knocks that one out.

I really hate saying this, but this places you in a really, really awkward size range.  Most of the brands we see here only start at D cups.  The few that offer 28Cs, only offer A-C.  The only consistent brand I know of that offers 28C *and* 28D is Mimi Holliday - and those are so stupidly expensive to pin down a size on.

Maybe you should give M&amp;S another try.  They *tend* to run small in the band, which would be good for you.  They're horribly inconsistent, but you might get lucky.  I'd try to find some cheap 28C and 28D M&amp;S bras on eBay.  If you've got some expendable income, you could give The Little Bra Company a try - but they only offer 28C.  If you've got a lot of expendable income, you could try some Mimi Holliday bras off of Net-A-Porter.  Net-A-Porter has free shipping and free returns to/from the US.

tl;dr: Forgo the 26 bands for now.  Try 28C, but don't rule out 28D until you've tried them."

Unrepentant_Priapist,patientgamers,1390930527.0,"But, when I install on the PC, maybe I need to be connected to the Internet to do the install, so it can activate.  Then, does it remember my activation by my network interface's MAC address, or something else?  Because, if it remembers by MAC address, it isn't going to work, because my USB interface doesn't register with the system unless it's connected.  I have one game that has to be reactivated essentially every time I use it, because every time the network interface changes state (due to disconnection, reboot, whatever) it loses activation.  Or, do I need to keep the disc next to my computer because it wants me to put it in the drive before the game will agree to start?  Will it require me to be connected to the Internet the whole time I play, so it can continually validate that I bought it?

Regarding patching, why can't I choose when I want to install a patch?  If I have an hour of game time, I don't want to spend half of it watching a patch download and install before I can play.  Fucking Steam is the worst about this; it basically wants to patch every time I turn it on.

On the PS3, I put the disc in, and play the game.  That's it.  I'd honestly prefer to play it on PC, but GOG doesn't carry it.  If they did, I'd buy it in an instant, because I would know that I simply had to run the installer, then click the game icon, and it would work."

Ajax_Malone,nfl,1390930605.0,"5 years ago or so, when it was possible the Vikes may move my dad and I spent a little time at a holiday party figuring out how we would choose our next team (we weren't gonna follow the LA Vikings) using 5 basic criteria:

- Stadium 


- City Travel, is it a place I would like to hang out at when I go to see a game?


- City fans, do I identify with their fans (for me this is have they suffered and stuck with their team), both as fans and as residents of their city (for me, is their city tough, blue collar?)


- Uniforms 


- Ownership, the biggest key to long term success. I mate for life so once the bond is made I'll be around longer then the current coach and QB.  


We listed teams and gave them a score in each of these areas 1-5, 1 being the best, so overall the lower the number the better. We also threw out teams that we personally could never cheer for like Dallas, NYG, now the Saints would be on the list. We left GB on there just to see how they'd fair. A few teams got zeros in some categories because they are so strong there; Green Bay (Stadium), Radiers (uniform), Steelers (ownership), Cleveland (City Fans).


I feel that is a good exercise to help you pare down your choice.

jubbergun,AdviceAnimals,1390930615.0,"[There's actually some research on this](http://shriverreport.org/what-about-the-fathers-kathryn-edin/):

*Romance in the inner city typically proceeds quickly. Just six or seven months after they first begin “kicking it,” most of these couples “come up pregnant.” Usually neither he nor she explicitly plans to have a baby, but neither of them does much to avoid pregnancy, at least not for long. Inner-city youth often view condoms as a method of disease prevention, not contraception. They believe that ongoing condom use says you don’t trust your partner to be faithful, so as soon as there is a kernel of trust, the condom stays in the drawer—a ritual marking the transition to a more serious relationship.*

*Pretty soon, the women are skipping doses of the pill or letting the patch or other forms of contraception lapse. Why? In these communities, motherhood often exerts a strong pull on young women’s hearts and minds and weakens their motivation to avoid pregnancy. Being a mom serves as the chief source of meaning and identity in neighborhoods where significant upward mobility is rare. She realizes that her circumstances aren’t ideal, so she doesn’t explicitly “plan” to get pregnant. But she’ll readily admit that it wasn’t exactly an accident either. She’ll say she knew full well where unprotected sex would lead.*

Incorrect. OP says:

My point is this: Yes, he's avoiding emotional connections. Yes, he's avoiding commitment. **But he's 25** and that's perfectly normal behavior for someone in that life stage. 

What you're saying is equivalent to saying, ""This 9-month old baby can't walk or speak and has poor motor skills! We need to get him to a doctor!"" Well, no you don't, because those ""problems"" that you see are perfectly normal circumstances for a baby, and the baby will more than likely grow out of them.

Body products (for AM or PM shower, depending on the day):

* Alba Botanicals Acnedote scrub. It's basically the St. Ives scrub but finer and without fragrance. The essential oils make it smell fantastic, though. Yum! I use this to help with the KP on my butt.
* [Vanicream soap bar](http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=161743&amp;catid=182285&amp;aid=338666&amp;aparam=55461273765id161743&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=). I haven't seen this recc'd on SCA but I love it! It's wonderful for my super-sensitive skin, no fragrance or sulfates! A little drying but with lotion, perfect!
* Cerave in the tub. I used this on my face and it broke me out terribly. I grabbed it on a whim to relieve some of the prickly dryness from my soap (I never used lotion, it only led to more problems.) Ta-da! Magic for my body!

Face products (PM, I normally don't do anything in the AM but the occasional water-only wipe and moisturize):

* Jojoba oil as a makeup remover and to remove grits. Mineral oil broke me out like nobody's business, but jojoba is perfect!
* Cerave foaming cleanser. I use this to remove the oil and makeup from my face. Also a little drying but with moisturizer it's perfect.
* Whipped squalene. I get mine from [Chagrin Valley Soap and Salve](www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com). I mix this with their seabuckthorn/tamanu oil blend and the two are magic for my skin. It only takes a little bit and it sinks it fairly quickly so I can get to my makeup routine.
* Tea tree oil and neem as a spot treatment. Smells horrible, works wonders. The neem is basically to keep the tea tree oil from drying my skin too badly in the spot while helping the process along."

md619,AskMen,1390930696.0,"&gt; When you hang out with your friends you should spend time with them first. I've been barhopping with guys who spend nearly all their time ignoring their friends and talking to women, and let me tell you: that does not endear you to your friends.

You just have to have the right group of friends. Wingmen who understand what's going on. Not only will you have more fun because you're with your friends, but you'll do better with the girls because girls like hanging out with the guys who are having fun. That's just fact. It's also easier to hit on girls in groups because now you can pair off. You *can* ride solo but if you have solid wingmen I don't know why you would.

&gt;With respect to the common wisdom that talking to women is ""a numbers game"": that's only true if you're looking for someone to have sex with right now. If you want to actually have a conversation with a woman, and have her actually remember you afterwards, it is not a numbers game at all.

That's such bullshit. Why else are you riding out solo unless you're there to have sex with one of them or plan on at least getting their number to go a date? Either way, YES IT'S A NUMBERS GAME. You're never going to have a 100% closing rate no matter who you are.

&gt; I'll be honest: it sounds like you're not confident in your own ability to keep a conversation going, and that takes work.

Lol. I tailored my whole response to OP who, if you're on reddit asking for how to apporach girls, probably blows at making conversation. 

&gt;The crux of it is: you hang out in college bars, and I hang out in young professional bars.

The crux of it is: OP is a college student asking about college bars.

&gt;When you talk to a more mature variety of woman, she won't be into this kind of hard-to-get nonsense that you're describing. Picking up girls in college bars is just a horrendous experience, because they expect guys to hit on them. Leave the college girls behind, and find out where the career-track women hang out.

There's a reason aging, strong, independent business women no longer play hard to get. It's because they can't anymore. They simply aren't attractive enough anymore and know they should be settling down because it's ""their time"".

&gt;And of course, you never buy someone else a drink.

Buying drinks is a great way to be social and get people to like you. What you shouldn't do is buy a girl a drink just to try and talk to her. A lot of girls just take advantage of that and it will get you labeled a chump. But if you've been talking for awhile or if there's a good reason, of course you can buy a drink. It's all about the intention. Are you trying to trade drinks for sex or are you doing it because you're having a good time and you just want to drink?"

sprengertrinker,bicycling,1390930703.0,"So...watching this I'm disgusted, but entirely unsurprised at this kind of behavior by a motorist in a city with such a high bike population. I live in a college town where there is quite a high percentage of cyclists who commute regularly but have absolutely no motivation or interest to learn cycling etiquette or even follow the most basic laws (especially when compared to a city like Portland, OR where most people who cycle there are serious about it and usually stop appropriately and are fairly courteous). I don't know why the assaulted cyclist was not in the bike lane, maybe he had a good reason (turning? obstacle in the bike lane?) but what I'm getting out of this video is an example as to how not following the law as a cyclist doesn't just have an impact on you - it creates conflict with other people on the road who you are drawing the attention of or scaring with erratic/unexpected behavior. If that happens enough times to an angry sort of person it's possible they may lose their shit on some random cyclist who may not even be breaking the law, but is perceived as an enemy by all the other cyclists who are.
To be clear, that is just what this video makes me consider...the motorist in this story certainly deserves assault charges, and I'm not saying the cyclist was doing anything wrong in particular, I'm making a lot of assumptions about what the motorist may have experienced before to put him in such a ragey state. And I've never biked in Vancouver personally. /rant

So they updated it (the ACA) to say insurance companies absolutely could not drop a plan, but nothing about what they had to charge for it. So what they're actually seeing is their generally below average payments coming up to match the over-all average (which is a lot higher because on the average, Americans are severely behind in good health, so if you were in good health you were paying much less than the 'average')."

_Calamity_,AskWomen,1390930900.0,"I had a major burnout my senior year of high school. I was extremely motivated in high school, the type of student with perfect grades and standardized test scores along with a slew of extra curricular activities. Getting into a ""top"" college ruled my life from ages 14-17 and once I had achieved that, I was a little lost. I was in a weird limbo state where I knew what was coming next but I didn't really know anything about it. I worried that I wouldn't be good enough and that I'd fail. But more than that, I was exhausted from years of overwork when I should have been being a kid. 


I'll never forget the day I got into my first choice college. I cried and cried and cried. It wasn't so much happiness as relief - all of the work that had put me in that tired state had paid off.

As far as moving on, I'm only a first year at university right now, but I feel like I'm emerging from my burnt out state right now. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and underwent therapy and medication to treat it. But I think the biggest thing was just taking some time for myself. I spent four weeks traveling the east coast, which was important more for the time off of work than the actual traveling, I think. When I started college, I was careful to go easy on myself - I only took 12 units and I didn't work my first semester. Now, I'm back from winter break and finally feeling myself again. I'm taking a full course load and have just started a job as a research assistant. I think I really just needed time and medical attention - you have to take care of yourself. "

Kodiac34,beyondthebump,1390930928.0,"I had the opposite issue (oversupply and an extremely over-active letdown). Ellie screamed, fussed at the breast, would never eat until she was full... I swore a couple times she was going to tear my nipples off from pulling off the breast so fast when the milk hit the back of her throat. 


After hitting her 6 week growth spurt, I spent a week feeding her every 45 minutes to an hour because she would pull off and refuse to relatch after the first letdown no matter how much I expressed before getting her to latch. One night I had been awake for 27 hours because of this, and I broke down. I called Health Link (can talk to a registered nurse 24/7) and the nurse told me to give her a bottle of formula. She ate 4oz, and we both passed out for 9 hours. After that, I tried to exclusively pump, but found myself spending more time attached to my pump than I was spending being a mom to my baby. After three weeks of that, I started FFing E. She is a smart, happy, healthy baby who sleeps for 8 hours a night now. She has never been sick, she gets excited when she sees her bottle... I know ""breast is best"", however, your baby having a healthy, functional momma is much more important. 


My mom BF me until I was 16 months old, I BF for 6 weeks before switching to formula, my friend has FF from day one with both her first son and her new twins. As long as you are feeding your little gremlin, then who the eff cares?! You are doing a fantastic job whether you feed her straight from the tap or not. Moms need to stop bashing other parenting styles because it causes unnecessary feelings of guilt in moms who choose to parent differently. 



I cried the first time I had to give her formula, but I made the best choice for myself and my baby girl. There is nothing wrong with being sad about it, either. Take all the time you need to deal with all your feelings, but just know you are providing food for your baby either way and she isn't going to love you any less because you weren't able to breastfeed!

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390930964.0,"Squats absolutely make your butt look good, which is one reason I said not to be afraid of lifting heavy.  My girlfriend keeps saying that she has no butt, and I keep telling her that if she wants to fix that, she needs to lift some actual weight.  She's finally starting to listen - squats honestly make the best butts ever.

Bench will lift the pecs, but they're below the breast tissue from my understanding.  So they may lift your boobs a bit, but they aren't necessarily going to perk them up (although you may get a bit of that effect from working the pectorals and losing a little body fat).  

As for curls making your arms jiggle less...maybe a little, but what you're really looking to do there is lose body fat (and remember, there's no such thing as spot reduction!).  An increase in muscle mass may cause a little less jiggling by increasing the circumference of lean muscle mass (and therefore, stretching out the area of fat around the arms which would result in it being in a slightly thinner area), but fat loss is going to be your best bet there.

Depends on what other machines you're using.  And like I said, you really want to work your back if you can.  It'll help prevent back problems and even help your posture, which is something small that really helps people to look better.  And make sure the machines are working all the smaller muscle groups as well - for example, there are three different deltoid ""heads"" (shoulder muscles) - rear, side, and front.  Some people make sure they fit in their delts, but they don't work all three heads, and end up looking disproportional.  Some people work their upper back but never lower.  Just make sure you're not neglecting anything by accident.

If you want, check out this [bodybuilding thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/1waixm/critique_wanted_amateur_like_first_time_ever/) that was posted yesterday and check out what the comments were saying.  I follow that subreddit because it's filled with good info and the entire purpose of bodybuilding is to build an aesthetic physique (and depending on the type of competition, the level of muscle mass).  Now I *know* that a bodybuilder's body isn't what everyone is looking for, but they still know all the good areas to hit - you just don't have to hit them *quite* as hard, or eat as much, or get as lean.  And plus, unless you are *really trying* to get that size and leanness, it won't happen accidentally.  And this is for a bikini comp anyway, which is (to my understanding) less definition and less muscle mass, so if you follow their advice and don't cut (losing body fat) as much, you'll probably hit what most people would consider ""ideal."""

I'm looking at tiny homes, looking at rooms/apartments/houses to rent in the area, and had a lot of questions which is why I came here.  I love the idea of the tiny house but am not so proud as to not take advice!  I have a lot to learn and I have to keep my mind open.

I feel pretty good about the concerns you've raised - I am fortunate enough to have the luxury of time to give my dogs lots of walks, I am not concerned about them being in a tiny house with me, especially if I'm on a farm lot and could have them on a run outside part of the time.  I have spent time in boats/RVs and my dad lived for years out of tree houses/house trucks so I'm familiar with the minimalism/cramped space of a small square footage.

My concerns about resale value, parking, utilities, investment return, etc... have been addressed well here and in other forums/on other subreddits.  I appreciate the points you raise in addition to this and will be taking it all in to consideration.  I'm definitely in a research phase still and am not too proud as to not change direction.  I was told to never rent if I could help it and maybe that was bad advice."

C_Terror,magicTCG,1390931060.0,"Here's the problem; you're looking at him as a single card, and not as part of a deck. That's like saying Master of Waves is not a good card because there's so much removal that he'll be useless anyway. 

MBD: I'm not expecting Brimaz to beat MBD deck alone. The game plan against MBD is to overload their removal by having more creatures than they have removal. Creating the extra token gives you one more sac outlet against Devour, or an extra body, or a pump for VoR. If compared to Loxodon, you'd be crazy not to run Brimaz over him. Honestly, if Gary dropped onto the battlefield already, the damage is done. 

Mono U: Mono U does curve out nicely, but so does G/W, especially come side board options. Most decks run atleast 3-4 pro blue creatures in the board. Again, you shouldn't be expecting Brimaz to stop Thassa; nobody in the G/W Arsenal can; you should be expecting Brimaz to provide value by creating threats, or just sit there as a threat every turn. 

U/W Control: G/W is very much favoured against this deck. Like I said, this match up might be the only one where Loxodon provides  a better value due to counter. 

And it's not sometimes make tokens. You're putting a 3 drop 3/4 vigilance in a god damn aggro deck, you're going to make tokens or it'll die trying. "

The fact that they all adamantly condemned the judge's decision because they thought a hardly viable, deformed fetus should be born, and live what would probably be a terrible and short life, is disturbing.

I like the cooler master N200 and Xion 560, both are under $50 and sometimes as low as $30, have good design for building, good airflow, and don't take up any more space than absolutely necessary. There are plenty of excellent mATX motherboards which are also frequently cheaper or at least no more expensive than an equivalent full ATX mobo. The MSI Z87M gaming and the Asrock Z87M extreme4 are two of the best, great for overclocking, good layout of everything you need access to, and both have excellent implementations of on-board audio so a discrete audio card is not necessary. There are several excellent, cheaper, non-overclocking options as well. 90% of builders in this sub will be satisfied and save money with a mATX build. "

Florists are great because it is pick up and go and are always beautifully done with good quality. Grocery store flowers are more bang for your buck, you just have to do the work yourself, which is sometimes not worth it. And their quality can shift too, you never know.

Good picture of you, but you need more of them, especially including one that's full length and you're not bundled up against the cold.

**self summary**

Not bad.. but:

There are multiple flavors of vegetarian, expand a bit to mention how completely or not completely you avoid animal products.  This might be better expanded on in the favorites (foods) section or the what you are good at section since you can cook.

Berlin's a fairly big place.. what part of Berlin do you consider home and what else would a fellow Berlin resident want to know?   Since you're looking for girls near you, do you need to write the whole profile in English?   It makes it easier for me to critique but is your language choice intentional because of the type of girl you're seeking, required by OKCupid or some other reason?

**What I'm doing with my life**

The sole German word in your profile.. Google translates it as meaning full time job.  I presume any fellow Berlin resident reading will already know this and not need to look it up.

Otherwise well written and good information.

**really good at**

Expand.. you're really good at seeing in what way that most people aren't good at seeing?

Tinkering and repairing/making what?  Furniture, electronics, small appliances?  It's a hook for a conversation starter but doesn't quite give enough information to make it a really good hook.  Add a bit more.

**first thing**

Nice.. this section works for me.

**Favorites**

Very nice, this is definitely where to expand on the vegetarian cuisine.. and do you really want someone to look up the weight of an emperor penguin via the wiki link before they keep reading?   You lost something like half a person, that's impressive, don't hide it behind a link to penguins.

**six**

Good list.. and good reference to Maslow's needs hierarchy.

**Friday**
 
Pretty good.. but also the first mention that you have a roommate.  Will that effect your ability to bring a date home or is that something you and your roommate have worked out an agreement on?


**Private**

In the first cosplay picture the isn't a ""tall one"" per-say because one person is over the shoulder of the other.  Good action shot though.. not as fond of the second one.. too static and I'm not familiar with the game/movie/comic you're cosplaying.  Gives a very creepy vibe, which I assume is intentional and appropriate to that cosplay, but may not work well with a wider audience.

**Message me**

Short, a little too short.. say more about the woman you would like to message you?

**Overall**

Aside from one German word I would not have guessed that English was not your first language.

larrylemur,SubredditDrama,1390931269.0,"&gt; Laws, police forces, precedent, corporate practices, standards of beauty, basically any rules we get from the top down will usually favor white over minorities.

This is because whites are generally in power and in a majority, at least in America. In South Africa the majority wasn't the case, so majorities aren't really relevant.

Yes, the group in power will generally favor its own members over outsiders. That's injust and wrong, but to say that's exclusive to white people to lord power over others is offensive and just seems to drive a wedge between people of different races. We're all people and people have flaws that are exacerbated when they are in positions of power.

&gt;I'll simply say that ""whiteness"" was probably a poor choice of words because reddit has a huge white persecution complex

dmgb,xxketo,1390931294.0,"I'm so close to losing 50lbs that it's taking every ounce of resistance in me to not jump on the scale every two seconds. Trying to wait until Saturday. 

Keto's good. Looking forward to my dinner of garlic parm chicken thighs tonight. Fasting through lunch thanks to my fat-heavy breakfast. Should have brought a Quest bar with me. I think I'm PMSing. I have a sweet tooth like no other right now. 

**Edit: People are asking me for tips/food choices/etc. So I'll do that here! Thanks to your kind words. I'm really proud of my body for somehow super adapting to this diet.**

I don't think my food choices are too crazy/off the wall compared to a lot of other people on this diet. I aim for 1400 calories a day. My macros percentages are 70/25/5. I wake up in the mornings between 6-630 and depending on how much time I have before work I will eat either two eggs and four pieces of bacon or two eggs and some breakfast sausages (brown &amp; serve - cheap and full of fat!) or just breakfast sausage or if I'm really pressed for time I will make a batch of bulletproof coffee and take it to work with me.

I usually skip lunch unless I'm starving. I have some almonds at my desk to munch on if I feel the need. Sometimes I will run to A&amp;W and get a bacon double cheeseburger with just mustard and extra pickles and take that sucker off the bun and devour it in my car like some kind of animal. 

Dinner is usually 2 chicken thighs or a Flatout flatbread bacon cheeseburger pizza or a butter cheeseburger with bacon and an egg on top. Sometimes when I have extra money I'll buy steak. Sometimes if I'm craving them I'll buy some Johnsonville brats and fry them up in a little bit of bacon grease. 

For snacking I'm all about almonds, sunflower seeds, string cheese wrapped in hard salami, midget dill pickles, Quest Bars (if I can afford to not kill my macros by eating one that day) and sugar-free jello. Obviously there are more foods that I have less often that I'm not listing. Weekends I'll usually get a little more inventive and make almond flour pancakes or something like that. I just look up recipes for whatever kind of food I'm craving and there's usually a keto alternative.

Notice that I'm not really including any veggies in my diet. Every now and then I'll pick up a bunch of asparagus or celery, but not that often. I take a multivitamin every day and drink MioFit, those seem to help keep me pretty balanced. I also eat the crap out of chocolate peanut butter cup fat bombs. Just google it. There are quite a few interpretations of how to make them. Experiment until you find your favorite one.

I blame the weight coming off, though, on my quitting drinking. I was a 3-4 old fashioneds a day kind of gal. Mixed with Southern Comfort. The booze had sugar. The mixer had sugar. The fruit had sugar. And hell you are supposed to muddle in a sugar cube as well. Those things were basically turning me into a diabetic, according to my doctor. 

My mood has increased ten fold. I'm no longer depressed. I like going out without worrying about how to get home or making a sloppy asshole of myself. It's a really nice change. Those of you debating quitting drinking but don't think you can - it's not so bad. Really. I promise.

And as for exercise. It's cold-ass winter here and I'm poor as hell. So I can't really go outdoors and do much and can't afford a gym. I play Just Dance on my Wii a lot with my roommate and have a ton of sex with the manfriend due to a highly increased drive due to feeling way better about myself. But that's about it. Nothing too complex. Come spring, I'll go back to biking everywhere like I do every year. I tried taking up running in the fall - but it's just not my thing.

As for having ever stalled. I did for a about a week around Thanksgiving because I went from having a week off work and walking a ton to going back to my 8-5 desk job. I just upped my fat intake for a few days and got over it. Now I've been averaging about 3lbs a week loss."

I liked having a good amount of free time to do whatever I wanted. I was involved with some different organizations on campus with meetings and the like, but I never HAD to be at a social function or anything.

Some guy in my speech class did one of his speeches on why you should pledge a frat or sorority, and I talked to a friend from class about it afterwards (she was in a sorority) and she made me out to be this horrible antisocial person for not agreeing that ""going Greek"" was the best thing ever.

ForeskinsForever,askseddit,1390931332.0,"First and foremost, have a good time. Girls love a guy who can have fun with what they're doing, and the fun energy makes them want to have fun too. Introduce yourself immediately and be enthusiastic about it, show no fear, just because they're attractive doesn't mean they should intimidate you. You're a badass breakdancer who's being recruited, you're the shit and you know it, you deserve the attention of these girls. 

Also, don't try to bang them all or hit on all of them. That comes off as desperate and it's really easy for them to spot. Befriend the ones you're least attracted to first and friendzone them, instead of just taking whatever you can get. The prettiest ones are often well aware that men find them really attractive, so they'll notice when a guy doesn't immediately talk to them (in a good way). 

Finally, even if they all friendzone you, pretty girls have pretty friends AND hanging out with multiple pretty girls gives you incredible social proof.

I know this may not help you but your personality will make people pretty much unaware it's there. I realize strangers will always look or give a second look but you are also good looking and they are equally likely to do that because you are good looking.

The less importance you ascribe to it the less others will as well.

Sexual thrill from attention != need for validation. An exhibitionist doesn't need validation. They derive pleasure from someone watching that is not the same as a need for validation or thinking you gain value as a person for having an attractive body. You don't understand the concept. There are unattractive exhibitionists and male exhibitionists as well. Yes there are people who are exhibitionist that require validation but most people in life seek validation from one source or another.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390931719.0,"&gt;Am I being irrational in feeling a bit insecure about this?

First of all, you aren't being irrational since this is pretty common, but it's also unnecessary.  Either have the body type that you want to have, or work toward the one you want.  If you're happy with your body, then don't worry about other people's preferences.  You'll find someone that prefers your body. It's not your job to make yourself attractive to every guy, but to find the ones that are already attracted to you.

As for your first question...there are standards and then there are preferences.  I need to be with someone that is in decent shape and that exercises regularly.  My *preferences* are a little more extreme, but I definitely don't need those to be happy.  So long as someone fits my standard or ""baseline"" and everything else is good (personality, shared interests, similar values, etc.), we're all good. "

Reachforthesky2012,ShouldIbuythisgame,1390931779.0,"3DS or last gen PSP seem to be the two best options for you. PSP is obviously going to be cheaper, and it has a pretty sizable library of games at this point, which are all going to be very affordable. I understand you can also have fun with homebrew software, although I don't know much about that and it may not matter to you if you don't use it too often. Downsides are you'll have to dig through a mountain of garbage to find the good stuff, there aren't going to be any new games coming out anymore, and *some* people find it's not very comfortable use. Some would also say there's a lack of ""killer apps"" compared to the Nintendo line of handhelds, I'll explain this in a bit.

I'm not a fan of the XL, but the regular old 3DS is in a great spot right now. It's not absurdly expensive and it has a very solid line of games that's only getting bigger and better. It also has a much more experienced developer base, which is a much bigger deal than most people realize. Nintendo, Gamefreak, Intelligent, etc. have been making handheld games since the late 80s and it's really going to show in the difference in polish between the two libraries of games. Also, I think the games on the 3DS will lend themselves more to your 1-2 hours a day gaming habit. Downsides, console and games are both going to be more expensive. The 3D feature is like the Wiimote of the handheld world, it's not amazing and the fact that it's in its infancy really shows, but it's forced itself into almost every game and it often slightly *damages* the overall graphical quality of a game without adding anything at all. 

Basically, if you're fine with the cheapest *anything*, or are particularly fond of PS titles, or you aren't interested in playing the newest (and most expensive) titles à la /r/patientgamers then a PSP will suit your needs. Otherwise, I think the positives of the 3DS justify the extra expense."

They can always hire scabs, but you can't fire union workers for striking. Against federal law.

More like, an even playing field... right now the universities have all the power. This would swing the balance. That's the whole idea behind a union.

sleepyj910,DebateAnAtheist,1390931864.0,"Well, some proper experimentation could be done, using scientific tools to see if any impossible readings occur.

But really, what's the claim here?  What is a demon?  The human brain certainly has the ability to make him act like he was acting, and the simplest explanation is that he was either faking, or had an intense emotional but completely natural experience.

When it comes to this stuff, you have to show that it was necessarily a demon.  Otherwise the rational conclusion is that whatever he felt was natural.  Given the intense experiences human brains can produce, some on demand via drugs, or sickness, there is simply no reason to conclude that there is some evil force with intentions interacting with him, because there is no evidence that points to that as the simplest solution.

I must admit, it's certainly good ratings for him to act like it was real, because he doesn't make money if his findings aren't exciting.  

But if it was genuine, it simply falls under the category of 'humans can be induced into trippy situations through peer suggestion' category.

Basically, you underestimate the human brain when you make unsubstantiated claims of demons.  It's not different than the ancients claiming the sun is pulled by a chariot.  Initially it's plausible, but when you understand the mechanics of the systems involved it's silly.  

Demons require more evidence because they add a huge amount of complication (all physics suddenly wrong).  If the explanation can be 'peer suggested acid trip' then that fits what we know about the Universe much better than 'demons!'"

I do really like that if you just bounce the brush up and down on the spot that you're concealing, it blurs the edges of the concealer pretty well. 

Not a life changing product, but since I don't wear a ton of concealer, I think this was a perfectly fine product and it was only $5.29. I can deal with that.

**L'Oréal Youth Code Texture Perfector Serum Concentrate**

I've only been using this for a few days, but I swear to god it's already working. I was really put off by it at first and seriously considered returning it because it has fragrance in it, but I like it too much now to return it. I don't know what witchcraft is taking place, but I swear that this made the little bumps on my chin way less noticeable. It's the only thing I've changed in my skin care routine. I saw someone on YouTube use this and really like it, so I decided that it wouldn't be a horrible thing to try out (she had little bumps on her cheeks and chin and she said this stuff cleared it up immediately; same thing I'm rocking right now). I don't know if it's going to make me turn into a monster if I keep using it or create some adverse reaction, but 4 days in and I love it.

Also, I know that this item is not makeup, but I had to tell someone about this."

you can view the phenomena as a strict stereotype:  man has 30th 40th or 50th birthday, experiences age-related anxiety, copes by having sex with his secretary and buying a red corvette.

or you can recognize that a midlife crisis is a common occurrence where one realizes their current situation is ill-suited to their values and they take impulsive measures to change this fact.

the reasons you've identified for his midlife crisis's occurrence seem valid and correct, but i don't see how that would disqualify this from being a midlife crisis."

3. The site advertised is a Wordpress blog. Wordpress feminists are a cut above tumblr feminists because they tend to be better educated and much more eloquent, yet no less crazy. This makes them more dangerous because they risk having people take them seriously.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1390932051.0,"&gt; Virgin shaming is the sort of thing that advocacy groups based around gender have always historically drawn. You're probably familiar with this image against the suffragettes

That's something I noticed while searching and reading into ""virgin shaming"". Most political activism/awareness on the matter is specific to defending women. 

&gt; Also, let's be real, it isn't like TRP isn't participating in this cheap mud slinging as well. You think users there don't say things like ""pretty women are never feminists"" and ""feminists are just bitter post wall women who can't get laid""? They do. They virgin shame like the rest of the world.

Absolutely. A lot do. But they are not on trial here. I recognize that they use insulting language all the time, and it's practically part of their philosophy to be unapologetic and un-PC. It gets brought up all the time in PPD. Some members here demonstrated that they have entire lists of controversial quotes saved.

This is not just matter of pointing fingers and saying, *""Well, they are insulting too!""*

My point that even people who make it a political mission to fighting traditional gender norms rarely care about this and even actively participate in this form of shaming, despite it being *fundamentally counterproductive to their cause.*

I've been swimming in liberal ideology throughout my life, and I rarely hear about this issue even from the most PC-aware folk. Male SJWs are just too embarrassed or don't care (once they've left that status behind). Female SJWs unapologetically lack empathy for even the subtlest forms of machismo (like the pressures faced by virgins), which they feel is just superficial.

You are mistaken if you think I'm casting blame on ""evil women"". I recognized in myself as well as other men. When I had low self-esteem, I avoided this topic at all costs. When I pulled myself out of it, I initially became disconnected and unempathetic. *""Fuck you. I got mine.""*"

But even in Yonkers it was a showpiece.  The media were there.  They were ready.  And it still wasn't enough, they still ran out of ammo.  This was the beginning of the great panic.  People still hadn't gotten to the point where nukes were an idea yet.  They were trying to beat Zack, not lay waste to NY.  

Also the book makes a point about senior command not understanding the zombies.  They went to set up and fight like they were fighting people who would break.  And zombies don't break.  Yes the weapons blew them to shit and sprayed them but they kept coming.  And just like you can't believe it, nor could the soldiers and command during Yonkers.  That ended up breaking them instead.

Spikemaw,AskMen,1390932221.0,"I can understand where you're coming from, history and struggle and false accusations of bigotry (possibly, I honestly don't know the history of bisexuality, possibly that designation was put upon your group by outsiders). It's sometimes strange (to outsiders like myself) to think that labeling seems a very important thing in the LGBTQ(are there more letters now?) community. It's something that most binary cis-gendered, heterosexual  (are there more designations now?) people don't ever really think about. Having fought for recognition of a designation, and faced with (sometimes snotty) upstarts, I can understand the outrage.

I mean, personally I was raised to think that sexuality was a spectrum, with few people landing, *hrm* straight on either end, so I was afforded that internal conversation and struggle about sexual identity, though I've always just accepted my gender identity.

I do think that your explanation is very... nuanced, and maybe overly so, though maybe my attempt at one is likewise. As an outsider, I see it as a battle between a (perhaps older) paradigm and language focused on sexuality, vs a paradigm perhaps more inclusive linguistically of a spectrum of gender. Again, as an outsider, I can see that the arguments surrounding the perceived differences (or lack thereof) between pansexuality and bisexuality are unlikely to be agreed upon anytime soon by people with ""money on the table,"" as it were.

Can I ask, how would YOU define, and contrast from bisexuality, pansexuality? Would you argue that they are synonymous? Where then would you place someone that is sexually attracted to cis-men and cis-women, but not trans individuals or genderqueer people? Would you say they were just transphobic? Wouldn't that judgement then mean that all heterosexuals were homophobic and transphobic? I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, just trying to ask hard questions."

The problem was, when he switched doctors, his new one freaked out that he was on that particular medicine while his blood pressure was still elevated(not dangerously high, just enough to be watched) and took him off it, which is when things got bad.  Her reaction is understandable, because in 99% of cases that drug was a bad choice, but for him...it worked.

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1390932247.0,"&gt; If you are arguing that we may be over-emphasizing the need for college in the united states, I'm tempted to agree.

What I was thinking of was a cost-benefit analysis of college. The cost has simply exceeded the benefit. And many people saw their friends or parents lose their house during the last recession (around 2008) and just don't want the crushing debt, debt which equals risk. 

There is certainly a need for college, especially in the STEM fields in the US, regardless of gender. But some don't want to acquire lots of debt, and this discourages them from going to college. 

One isn't guaranteed to get an average paying job ($54,000 per year in the US) just because one goes to college. However, having an office job, and college degree, can help you keep your job during a recession.

brotherbock,triathlon,1390932527.0,"The problem lies in the calculating of caloric intake and expenditure.

My claim is that we cannot reliably make these calculations across wide ranges of people without taking into account far more factors than most people mean when they say ""Calories In/Calories Out"".

The typical gym trainer, for example, who says these things means that his clients should calculate calories eaten based on food labels, and calculate calories expended based on machine readouts or 'reliable activity norms' and that this WILL result in weight loss if followed. And then, when the client doesn't lose weight, the trainer is at a loss, and can only believe that the client did not in fact follow the plan.

But food calories are measured in a way that is very unlike how our bodies digest. Some people won't be able to take all the nutrients out of the same food as other people, some people's bodies will store that energy in more or less accessible ways. And expenditure is the same. Some people will expend more energy in a certain time than others, will expend energy from different bodily sources than others. 

And these factors are incredibly complex, and in large part unknown to us as the moment. 'What a calorie is' is a very vague notion, and counting how they are taken in and burned is so vague at the moment as to be almost pseudoscience. That's what I mean when I say ""CICO is a myth"". Because the people who say it say it like this: ""I'm having problems losing weight. I've always assumed it was a simple matter of expending more calories than you take in, but it's not working.""

It's *not* simple, very far from it.

Does it still make sense to say that eating less and exercising more is *part* of the overall plan of weight loss? To a degree, yes. But there are always conditions. Looking at the US, it's clear that the general concept of eating less and exercising is in fact not working all by itself. (Certainly not for people who don't try it, but also not for many people who do try.) 30 min of exercise a day has been shown recently to not, in fact, have any effect on mortality rates, and little effect on weight.

It's so complex a situation that it's wrong, in the end, to say it's 'simply a matter of calorie counts.'

What is optimal one week, or even one day, might be too much or too little the next.""

**Conclusion:** (taking full text here because it's great) 

""So how do we know what we should do? First, everyone must do some experimenting. See how 'you' respond to different variables. Your mind, your body, all of you. Do you enjoy it? If you do not enjoy your training, you will not put the effort forth, or stick to the program to even reap the benefits, no matter how well it 'could' work. What one needs to do, is pick a sane approach and perform that routine properly. Keep an eye on progress, how you feel, etc. Then, adjust one of the three main parameters as needed. Re-check results. Did it help? Did it hinder? No change even? From knowing the huge variety of methods used for success, instead of feeling confused, we should feel free. It's ok to train twice a week, it's ok to train once every 10 days. What ever works best IS best. The take home message is this: If anyone says you 'have to' do this or that to succeed, think if it's really true. Has everyone who ever succeeded, I mean EVERYONE, done this? If not, it's false information and should be disreguarded.""

""You may not be able to train at maximum levels. Train at YOUR optimum, set your program up so it works during all periods of your life. Don't be afraid to adjust as needed. Complete changes can ruin progress but adjustments that help you continue to progress are good. In fact, very rigid programs are one of the main reasons for so many failures with training. A rigid program dictates that no matter how you feel, or what your progress is like, you must stick to it. It becomes more imporant to perform it, than to make progress. We train for results, not to serve a program.""

On the other hand, if it's something you've thought about and would like to try, I have a feeling he'd still be down to do it too, considering the number of times he asked you about it that night. I am pretty confident he wasn't just going to do it to be nice; he would probably like it too and get something out of doing it. If it's something you'd like to pursue, go for it! If it's not, well, you didn't do anything you'd regret so no harm done. I wouldn't feel bad about saying no though, it sounds like you were very nice about it."

Borror0,TwoXChromosomes,1390932792.0,"A friend of mine has a body so outstandingly gorgeous that, whatever she wears, she looks stunning and extremely seductive in it. She has an amazing ass and plentiful breasts. Even if she tried to hide it, there is only so much she can do before she starts to be under-dressed for occasion. She looks like a model, like she's showing off, even if it's the furthest from her intent.

After a brief look at your latest /r/loseit progress pictures, I suspect you fall in the same category. You have an *amazing* body and that makes it really hard for you to not look absurdly sexy in any clothing. 

Basically, what I'm trying to say, I doubt you've done anything wrong. Both men and women are simply envious of your looks. Women wished they looked as good as you. Men wish they could sleep with you. My friend who is in a similar position than you has many girls belittling her intelligence behind her back, out of jealousy, despite there being no basis for this. Meanwhile, men she is nice to comment that they are growing tired of her games because they automatically assume that repeated niceness on her part is a sign of interest. 

It simply seems to be one of the downsides of being hot. It's an unfortunate fact that occidental society objectifies hot women. the friend brought at dinner to serve primarily as eye-candy, in spite of being a kick-ass accountant. My best friend, who is also ridiculously, hot, is the smartest woman I know. She had her intelligence belittled, to the point she doesn't believe in it.

What OP is trying to say (I think!) is that for the people who have children *because* they can get onto WIC, Food Stamps, and whatever other programs there are. I have a friend here who has had 3 kids in as many years. and PLANNED all of them. Not because she wanted 3 kids. No, because by spacing them out perfectly she gets the most benefits from the government because the father can't hold a good job, she can't work (three kids under 5), and neither of them have an education above high school.

She gets a nice cheque every month from the government. She has everything paid for pretty much by tax payers' money. Not because she ended up in a shit situation. But because it's so damned easy to fool the system.

The system is for people who, due to circumstances beyond their control, need some assistance. And that's what it should be, ASSISTANCE. Not a ""job"" and income. My mom told me a few years ago that during my life ages 8-15 much of my food came from food banks. We were a family of 6. My dad had been married twice, and had  two kids from each marriage.

donaisabelle,MakeupAddiction,1390932802.0,"I haven't seen anybody else say this, but I think it's important - you need to talk to someone (a teacher, an administrator, someone you feel comfortable talking to) about this. Bullying is serious, and if they're bullying you, they're almost definitely bullying other people. On one hand, they could be just mean, awful people, and they need to be disciplined for their behavior. On the other hand, one or all of them could be lashing out behaviorally because of unaddressed mental health issues of their own, such as eating disorders, other body dysmorphia, depression, etc., and your saying something could alert the school that there could be a problem.

You should not have to deal with this, and please do not let the peer pressure to not be a tattle-tale or a narc keep you from addressing this issue head on. This is definitely a better way to go about it than lashing back at the girls (which they may eventually push you to), as then it's possible you could be punished.

It's definitely true, as others have said, that you should do your best not to let other people control your behavior with their shittiness, but you should also not ignore it. Good luck, dear."

Also, I believe that both men and women aren't controlled by sex and thoughts of sexytimes.  Weird I know.

shytemptation,nonmonogamy,1390932865.0,"I told my boyfriend before we started dating that I would really prefer an open relationship so even though I agreed to remain monogamous initially it was something I had been upfront about before we actually had our first date. That gave him some time to think about it before I actually pushed to open up. At the 4 month mark I reached the point where the relationship needed to open up or else I was going to have to move on because we were long distance and he was extremely sexually inexperienced, so I was deeply sexually frustrated by then because I could only see him every couple of weeks and there wasn't enough time to 'practice' and really teach him how to please me.

He was still really nervous about the whole thing but agreed to it. I would say there was a lot of anxiety up until I actually went and slept with someone else. After I finished with that I came back and heaped lots of love and reassurance on my boyfriend (over IM) and of course I was very enthusiastic about sex with him when we met in person again to demonstrate through action that my flings on the side were a supplement to my sex life with him and not a replacement for it. Sex with my bf honestly got a *lot* better for me because I was no longer going into it dejected and worried that I was going to get turned on only to not get any release. I could enjoy whatever we were doing together and relax and really get into it whole-heartedly because even if I didn't get off, I knew I could just find a quick lay when I got home to ease the sexual tension built up by the bf. 

My boyfriend relaxed noticeably after that first outside fling and switched from being hesitant and anxious to openly encouraging me to go get laid. At first I would question it because I thought maybe he was just putting on an act, but apparently he was genuine about it. As a bonus, by a year into the relationship my boyfriend was awesome in bed so it was good sex all around for me, and the openness about our sex lives and preferences not only with eachother, but with other people too helped us to form an even tighter connection with one another. It felt like we could be open about anything under the sun. 

I took a longer time to open up to a non-monogamous mindset than he did, even though I was the one that sought it out in the first place. He's extraordinarily shy and pretty terrified of approaching women so while I wanted the relationship to be open for both of us because that was the fair thing to do, I knew in the back of my mind that he wasn't going to be sleeping with someone else any time soon. He didn't tell me when he made an AFF profile until about a month after the fact so I got upset and depressed when I found out. It wasn't the fact that he made the profile (I had encouraged him to make one when we became open), it was moreso that he didn't trust me enough to tell me he had made one. That made me really question the foundation of our relationship, which in turn made the prospect of him seeking out other women more intimidating and threatening to me. Eventually I got over it and I got a lot more into the idea of him meeting women too as I was more included in the process. I helped him with his profile and also put up ads on craigslist trying to help him out and then it seemed fun instead of intimidating and my jealousy faded. I do have the complication of having Borderline Personality Disorder, so I can be very overly sensitive to the fear of rejection by someone close to me compared to an ordinary person. For me it took maybe 3-4 months after opening up to feel steady and secure with my boyfriend and to feel fully excited and happy about the prospect of my boyfriend seeing other women rather than nervous and afraid of it.

Spikemaw,AskMen,1390932887.0,"I felt the panic for a long time (very much spend a lot of time alone). But having a couple of relationships (mostly short, one of about a year) convinced me that I was capable of attracting and pleasing a mate. I still spend much of my time alone, but I'm not panicking about ""wasting my youth"" or inadequacy anymore. I feel like I'm gathering myself from a quiet, strong place towards better interactions with the world, and have already started a new job and stopped doing drugs. Part of being alone a lot has been recognizing and cutting out co-dependence.

randired,Parenting,1390932903.0,"I would consider the paintings to be for the party favors and not for the birthday child. At a young age, they may not understand its for someone else and the child may want to take it home. You can offer a few canvas' so they can paint one for themselves and one for the birthday child. As for the adults or older children you can ask that the birthday child to keep it.

Just a note about asking for no presents: I have found that no matter how much you say NO PRESENTS you will be getting them anyways. It is something people like to do and like to pick out. Just keep that in mind.

I had a painting party for my daughters 2nd birthday. We bought bird houses for each child and they painted and decorated them. It was really a great party! We used sand pails from Michaels or AC Moore (dollar store or whatever) to put the houses in to bring home. They were wet and would need much more time to dry than the time at the party.

I would also buy glitter glue in bigger bottles and other things to stick on the canvas' like beads and foam shapes. Use tempra paints so they wash out of clothes and try to find different kinds of brushes, use sponges and cut them into different shapes to paint with, glitter if your willing (thats why I like glitter glue) Tissue paper...anything!

However the notion that being called a murderer if you have an abortion doesn't apply unless you live in Alabama or Mississippi is absurd. I had an abortion at the age of 19 in Michigan and was called a murderer by my own roommate almost immediately after it happened. I've been called a baby killer by multiple people across multiple states. You clearly don't grasp the stigma that comes along with that choice. I don't regret it and I was prepared for the attacks that come along with it but I was not prepared for people like you to deny that the stigma exists.

I really don't know how anyone could argue otherwise.

Okay, don't believe me, then. Why would I even lie about that? I have 3 pings I play at. 38, 68, and 90-115. The 2 former ones are my home Internet and depending on which riot server I connect to, it stays at 38 or 68 the whole game. The latter is my phone connection that I use when my home Internet is turned off for maintenance. I have to switch from 68 to to 90-115 about 4-5 times a week because my ISP is annoying and does maintenance like every 24 hours at midnight. 

It's a significant difference for me and I really don't know how I could show you that I'm not lying. 

I'd say that it's because I'm a pretty talented drummer but I know there are lots of people on this sub that have said the same thing and not all of them could be drummers. Although I guess they could just have a better sense of time than most people.

I'm not sure what you mean by the game has a form of prediction. There is no prediction that's server-side and I know that for a fact. There is an option to enable movement prediction when you have high latency so that your game client-side will look more like the server-side version if you had lower ping but that's basically just lying to you to make the game look smoother (although it really makes it worse, in my opinion). 

-----

Also, I'm not really sure what you meant by people saying their ping is up to 100 is nonsense. Do you mean that no one should have a problem with it or that you believe that everyone is lying and no one can actually tell the difference? I promise you people aren't lying. Maybe you personally can't detect it or have never tried to because you believe it's nonsense but there's no one lying here. There is a difference and we can feel it. Any ping increase 40 ms and above is easily detectable by me and, from what I've heard, other people can detect it as well.

AdamColligan,askscience,1390933134.0,"The waves that hit the shores of an ocean are not created in any one place in the middle of the ocean. They are created all over the place by wind, by the the sloshing of water that is moving around due to the tides, and by other objects and forces that stir up ocean water everywhere. 

In a simple case, this would mean that for any given wave that you see crashing on the ocean, you could identify a point of origin for it, but it would be a different point of origin for each wave. So this wave started 2 miles away to the west when a gust of wind slammed down into the water, and that wave over there started 4 miles away to the northwest when there was a lightning strike, etc.

In reality, the waves are not distinct from each other. They are ripples of energy that cause water to move up and down, and they are all sharing the same space. So when you see ""a wave"", it's really a place where the peaks of several waves are combining and overcoming the troughs of other waves.

Also, close to shore, there are structures like reefs and the rising height of the land under the surface that magnify and focus the waves into a more regular pattern. That's why it can look as though there is some factory way out in a specific direction that is sending all the waves toward the beach in a regular fashion. But the forces that are causing that impression are usually much closer at hand.

EDIT: A better way of thinking about ocean waves may be to focus on what the water looks like when you are out away from the shore on a boat rather than when you are standing on a beach. Here is a short [video of a pretty calm sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhMzYihk9yc]). See how chaotic all the little waves are? Nearby, on a beach, it probably still looks like there are sizable, regular waves coming in from some direction that was sending all of them, as if on a mission. But those waves are really the same waves as the ones you see from the side of a boat in that video: they are just being combined, channeled, and lifted as they encounter the land."

FrusTrick,svenskpolitik,1390933172.0,"Det här är ju löjligt. Visst skäms man över att bo här när man ser kommentarerna på Avpixlat men inte fan ska man åtala folk för vad de tycker och tänker? Om det finns något jag tror på så är det yttrandefriheten, en frihet som står sig fast i rikets grundlagar och som inte skall eroderas bort bara för att man råkar tycka illa om vissa kommentarer. 

Att personerna som kommenterar på Avpixlat är högervridna är sedan länge känt och det är också känt att de hyser förakt mot allt som är utom-europeiskt vilket klart och tydligt syns i deras kommentarer. Detta förakt har sitt utlopp i dessa kommentarsfält och låter rätt läskiga om man enbart kollar på kommentarsfälten i fråga. 

Börjar man däremot jämföra Avpixlats kommentarsfält med kommentarsfälten på andra sidor där folk kan uttrycka sina åsikter (Youtube, Reddit etc...) så märks en tydlig trend. Folk som älskar ett fotbollslag hatar ett annat och uttrycker med hot om våld sitt förakt mot motståndarlag och deras spelare. Folk som älskar speciella bilmärken grupperar sig också och hyser förakt mot rivaliserande bilmärken. Faktum är att det finns många rivaliserand e grupper, både politiska och icke-politiska som har medlemmar som med hot om våld uttrycker sitt förakt mot meningsmotståndare. Det vi ser på Avpixlat är inget annat än klassiskt gruppbetéende där folk tagit på sig en roll/image av en grupp och beter sig därefter. 

Det enda som skiljer grupper åt är resonemangen och målen men metoderna är de samma. 

Om man förövrigt ska kunna polisanmäla Avpixlat för vad kommentarerna säger så kan man lika gärna säga att vi skall kunna stämma alla andra sociala medium för någonstans i dessa gigantiska dataarkiv så har någon sagt något hotfullt och hatiskt om någon annan. Låter detta förslag löjligt? Tycker du att yttrandefrihet är en rättighet för alla? Då låter du dessa muppar babbla för det enda som biter på hat är inte cencur utan utbildning.

I agree with almost everything you've said.

The entire debate about the portrayal of women in video games is hilariously one sided. As *if* men aren't portrayed in equally unrealistic (I'd say personally, more unrealistic but hey) ways. 
Men get it and women get it. 

I laugh whenever some feminists try to rationalize that the way women are portrayed in video games is somehow worse than how men are portrayed because of some nonsense, made-up definition of 'power fantasy' or some bullshit. 


I'm surprised as a feminist you don't realize hypocritical they can be. Its slut-shaming if a woman is wearing slutty clothing in a video game, but its also slut-shaming if women are portrayed as 'chaste' and nonsexual beings in video games/film/the media.

ArcFurnace,askscience,1390933275.0,"Short answer: No, I don't think so.

Longer answer: most permanent magnets are made from ""hard"" magnetic materials, that require you to apply a very strong magnetic field opposing their inherent field to demagnetize them.  The Wikipedia page on [magnetic hysteresis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_hysteresis) show a diagram of the magnetic field in a magnetic material (y axis) when an external magnetic field is applied to it (x axis).  As you can see from the diagram, you apply an external magnetic field to the material in one direction to magnetize it, and then when you remove the external field there is still a substantial amount of magnetism in the material, and you have to apply a significant external magnetic field to remove this magnetism, or to magnetize the material in the opposite direction.

It is also possible to destroy a magnet by heating it above its [Curie temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature), above which the magnetic domains do not have enough force to stay aligned with one another against random thermal vibrations and return to random orientations that cancel each other out."

**Self Summary**

This needs something.  What you have is a pretty good start but it feels like you're glossing over a lot of things.. what minerals do you collect and what about them makes you want to collect them?   what kind of video games, are you a console gamer, PC, hand held?  Pokemon.. Gameboy?  Old school, or up on the latest release?

What makes you, you?

**doing with your life**

excellent!

**good at**

Also very nice.. lots of hooks for someone to start a conversation from.

**first thing**

You change your hair?   Really, I wouldn't have guessed from your pictures.  Aside from a splash of auburn in the picture you're balancing on a pipe in, your hair looks pretty consistent.

**Favorites**

Good use of white space, the book list I would expect from an English teacher.  

Food is missing.. you're mostly vegetarian, food is vital here, you need to let a potential date know what cuisies or dishes work for you so they could plan where to take you out.

**Six** 

nice list.  

**think about**

Not bad.. no real hooks to start a conversation off of, but not every section has to have them.

Scooping ice cream at work? *head tilt, raised eyebrow*  I would leave it at that, just because it just provokes the ""where do you work and can you get me free ice cream"" question.

But it's a fact that all places that start catering to non Asian palettes completely changes. I've seen it time and time again...for 30+ something years...Koreatown, Jtown, the SGV. I know, you don't want them to change...but you have to realize once you start going, no matter how authentic you want the experience to be and want it to keep, it's going to change. You may be in the know of how it *should* be, but there are others that don't/don't care. And that starts a snowball effect. Non Asians that care, come in...word gets out, and others who don't care as much/not as knowledgeable of how it should be, start coming in.  Sometimes it's also the restaurant's fault, because sometimes they even think they can start slacking because they know the non Asian palettes aren't going to care or be able to tell that it changed. 

Anyways, yes, I'm a little butthurt to see some of my favorite places change over the years. :\  So it goes.

pigeonburger,boardgames,1390933376.0,"&gt;Does not knowing the mythos make an impact on how much I would like the game?

No. I'm a big Lovecraft fan, and while it's a little bonus for me that I know what a Shoggoth is, the flavor text is strong enough that it stands on its own in making the game atmospheric.

&gt;Having never played AH means that I don't know about exactly what is ""streamlined"" from AH to EH, as talked about in some of the reviews I've read. Is the difference really that great?

There's a relatively large difference, but it doesn't feel like it's a ""lite"" version of AH. More like a ""better"" version of it.

&gt;Is the delayed mechanic of the game such a big hassle? If that's the case, is there any way to house-rule it out?

In the two games I've played, only once has a player been delayed. The other times it was avoided through items. It only lasts for one turn. Considering how we're usually deciding all of our actions together before the action phase, the delayed player is still strategizing and plotting with the rest of us, so he doesn't feel left out. Moreover, he still has his encounter at the end of the turn, so his turn is not a complete waste.
&gt;Number of Players: Anywhere between 3 to 6. If it exists a solo variant is a plus but not necessary.

EH fits great there.

&gt;Game Length: 2-3 hours. Some of my friends don't have much attention span beyond 2 hours unless the game gets really interesting. Less downtime between players would be nice, an example being Zombicide. My friends can zip through their turn because the rules and turn sequence is easy.

First game might be a little longer, but the game is pretty involved and gripping, so attention span will probably not be an issue. The games after the first one will normally fit in 2-3 hours.

&gt;Complexity of Game: A medium learning curve would be nice. Somewhere between teaching Zombicide (easy) and Last Will (complete hell because of the hieroglyphic-like card symbols).

EH has a easy - medium learning curve. By the time you've finished your first game turn, the players will usually be pretty acquainted with the phases of the game. After your first game, they'll typically know the rules they need to play quickly. Since it's a coop game, not *all* the players need to know *all* the rules (whereas in a competitive game, all the players will want to know all the rules so that they can't be used against them).

&gt;Your Budget: $60-80 (CAD, if that matters)

Pretty generous budget; I think EH fits there as well.

&gt;Genre: My group of friends and I are open to a bunch of different game types and themes, though some may drop-in and out mid-game. With EH, hopefully I can introduce them to a more thematic game. We like variety :)

EH is pretty friendly to player drop-in/drop-out, as the game is scaled by use of a reference card. If someone drops out of a game, you can either count him as eliminated and carry on, count him as eliminated and scale the game back, or have someone else/the group take his character's actions. You can also scale the game up if a player drops in.

&gt;Competitive or Cooperative: Cooperative. A traitor element is welcome as well.

No traitor element in EH. Coop with traitors, I'd say look at Battlestar Galactica."

Xaxziminrax,nfl,1390933406.0,"Ok, backstory here. 

Tony always used to come to Children's Mercy Hospital a couple times a year. I know this, because I grew up with a very sick sister that spent more time in the hospital than she did at school. 

Tony Gonzalez would always be in a room and sign autographs, and after a couple years of seeing him, he remembered me. So after he's done, he pulls me aside really quick and asks my name. I tell him, and he asks why I've been here each of the last 3 years. I kinda look up at my mom (I was 12 at the time), and she tells him about my sister, and the obligatory ""It means so much that you do this, my son is a huge Chiefs fan.""

Tony asks, ""Is your daughter, too?"" Mom says yes, even though my sister isn't that big into football. But it's freakin Tony G. So he goes in and sees my sister, and kinda gets blindsided when she says she doesn't care all that much about football (this is mid 2000's, before the down years we had). But he stays with her, and I tell him that she really likes animals. 

Tony G stays in the room for a good 20 minutes, just talking to my sister about her cat and dog. 20 freaking minutes. As with everyone famous, he has another appointment and has to go, but not before he pats me on the back, and tells me to stay strong for her. 

He also asks me to get something to write on, and gives me his autograph. Being a little kid at the time, I grab an old sticker of a clip art camera (swag). Tony laughs. Then he goes out into the lobby, and gets someone else to sign it (I don't know who's autograph the second is). 

My sister had a major auto-immune disease, and it was difficult for her to get through sentences. Not because she was slow or stupid, but because she was so incredibly weak that it was difficult for her to move her jaw. Tony G stayed in that room, waited patiently for her to finish, and then he would talk about our pets, and his too. 

This upcoming Friday is the 3 year anniversary of my sister's passing. Excuse me for crying a little bit when I got to see my childhood hero go out the right way.

md619,AskMen,1390933442.0,"&gt;The thing you have to realize is that not everybody is looking to go to poundtown in sixty minutes or less. Sometimes, it's great to enjoy the company of women just because you can.

Fair enough. But if you're just looking to make conversation then there's no reason to separate advice from men and women. You're no longer talking about dating advice, that's just social skills 101. Everything I wrote was assuming we're talking about dating advice. 

&gt;The reason a lot of redpillers don't enjoy the company of women is that they exclusively court women who aren't interesting to be around, whose only asset is a pretty face.

Male company is just more enjoyable because you can do male things together. A lot of the girls I talk to are more than a pretty face. Doesn't mean I want to just hang out with them.

&gt;I don't hang out with women who ""hamster"", so my opinion of female company is considerably higher.

""Hamster"" is just another term for rationalizing. Everyone does it, men included, so you'd be kidding yourself if you think they don't. 

&gt;Conversation is a skill that you get better with as you practice it. And nothing improves your self-confidence like the knowledge that you can strike up a conversation with a woman you've never met, and she'll look forward to seeing you again.

And this is where your self-confidence has lead you? What a joke. Your method shows nothing but low self-confidence. If you had self-confidence you would just walk up to any of them and be direct like I do instead of beating around the bush like a creep.

&gt;If you actually enjoy talking to women, instead of seeing it as a chore on the path to laying some pipe, then it's time to frequent some classier establishments.

Why can't it be both? Cold approaches aren't a chore, it's fun for me because I'm good at it. And I don't have to have some ridiculous plan to do it. Who really has self-confidence in their abilities?"

&gt; Which it doesn't unless you are specifically talking about anarcho-socialism. Marxism predicts a stateless, classless end of history (""communism""), but socialism does not demand it.

ichibanmarshmallow,AskMen,1390933633.0,"&gt;Tired of being triggered, unable to eat, and scared of my boyfriend about 25-50% of the time.

Honestly, I wouldn't keep someone like this in my life even as a *friend*. I'd seriously encourage you to leave. From a sexual standpoint, you've started a relationship with someone who directly reminded you of one of the worst parts of your life. Multiple times.

I know what it's like to be triggered by someone you're in a sexual relationship with. Unfortunately, you and I have similar pasts.

But. If you're set on making this work, if you *truly believe* that you can emotionally bond with someone who disgustingly crossed physical boundaries because **he** decided your body was ready, take as much from [this website](http://www.consentissexy.org/) as you want. Print it out, even highlight what stands out to you as most important and show it to him. Be confident, look him in the eye and say, ""My ex-boyfriend didn't appreciate what I'm showing you, and if you act like him -which you have been- I will leave you."" Proceed to tell him as much as you're comfortable with, then explicitly tell him what he *did* to trigger you.Tell him those actions are unacceptable. 

If he tries to defend what he did, do not just become quiet, shrug, and say ""okay"". Interrupt him, look him in the eyes, and tell him, ""this isn't a negotiation. I struggle from serious trauma in my life and if you continue to bring it up because you don't respect these important boundaries, then I will leave you."" Sometimes in a relationship, two people need to come to a compromise. Sometimes one of them is in the wrong, needs to shut up and listen, and make amends. Your boyfriend needs to shut up, listen, and make amends.

When you approach the situation, be confident and as stubborn as possible. But only if you want to stay.

&gt;I don't trust my boyfriend. How can I have a sexual relationship with someone I don't trust?

I'd dwell on this point, if I were you. How can you keep anyone in your life you don't trust?

Please, PM me if you want to talk. Even if you don't need advice but just need to talk about what's going on now or what happened then, I'll be more than happy to listen."

RosesWaterflame,ShitRedditSays,1390933672.0,"Hello person I would like to be the one to inform you that 'universal' does not mean 'on average.' Right now, a majority of those people would rate the thin person more attractive. That is true. It is also true that standards of beauty change over time, and that is just what is en mode right now. It is also also true that there would still be plenty of people who disagreed with the standard of beauty that the majority would hold.

I mean, I try not to do this because it's generally a creepy thing to just unsolicited share what you like, but I find large women very attractive. I always have. If I were choosing between a size 22 and a size 6 on nothing but looks, I would probably pick the size 22 every time. I love soft curves and rounded lines. And I'm not saying 'I like curvy' when what I mean is 'I like women with large breasts and tiny waists,' I enjoy a round soft belly and thick thunder thighs. Shrug. Again, it's creepy to just share this information but I feel it's relevant to illustrate the point at hand which is:

This is provably not universal! I have met plenty of other people in a spectrum of genders and sexualities who share my tastes. Of course, sharing that information always gets me ""well you're just saying that to blah blah blah"" or ""it's just a fetish blah blah blah"" and whatever. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

Also there is nothing wrong with being thin or skinny or hourglass shaped or anything, all women are beautiful in different ways and I'm only sharing this to prove my point."

sleepyj910,DebateAnAtheist,1390933816.0,"Well if demons did exist, yes they would be by definition natural.  But we're not just redefining schizophrenia as demons here.  Plenty of known bacterium can alter our behavior.  But those aren't demons either.

Demons are usually claimed to be intelligent forces that possess people.  They are not defined as naturally occurring mental disease.  So my point being if there are unseen powers at work here, we would have to rework physics to account for our new reality.

If the exorcism process affects the natural brain waves, that is interesting, but says nothing about demons.

Since we don't know what a demon is, it's not really a useful concept that needs to be conceived in any manner.  Maybe there is some natural process occurring in the brain that is interesting, much like how schizophrenia is interesting, but that's not what the religious believe.

If demons end up being a metaphor for some interesting neurology and some exorcists managed to trigger that neurology, then fine, but that's not what Bob Larson thinks is happening.  And we simply can't make any claims about reality without evidence.

A demon is a claim without merit, because those who claim it aren't using evidence, they are describing strange behavior in humans that they can't understand, and then misattributing that to an evil spirit that moves about undetected(which is impossible under current understandings of physics).  Once they jump from evidence of behavior to explanation, they are ignoring the scientific method.  There is no reason to assert a spirit because we know it's just not a necessary assertion.

What I am saying is that it's fine to witness behavior, but once you start trying to 'conceive' demons to fit natural processes, you are better off just dropping the concept and becoming a neurologist.  Exorcisms are interesting psychological experiences, but there's nothing to suggest that they are any more interesting than dropping acid, in that the perceptions and behaviors are controlled as always by the brain producing and regulating chemicals."

I haven't read the book, but 'settling for less' could mean 'not marrying a famous actor'.

redwhiskeredbubul,PurplePillDebate,1390933999.0,"I think this is an entirely legitimate and accurate criticism. In the abscence of any real knowledge about the person in question, leveling the accusation at a man that they're a virgin is pretty much the precise analogue to accusing a woman of being a slut. It's based on the same set of gender and sexual norms--that men want sex and women don't.  

The nuance is a little different, though. Put bluntly, a woman has to prove she's not a slut in order to demonstrate that she's not a whore. A man has to prove that he's not a virgin in order to demonstrate that he's not a fag. So the anxiety about women mostly orbits around male ownership; the anxiety about men mostly orbits around heterosexuality. 

Thus there's a weird set of mixed messages around the virgin-shaming thing for guys, too: the implication when you call somebody a 'virgin neckbeard' isn't just that they're hopeless with women but that they're somehow an abnormal perv. For not having sex. You can't win.  "

It's because of things like this that black people are so disproportionately targeted by police and that they have so much more difficulty finding a job or succeeding in academics. 

The idea of whiteness as a positive is undeniably embedded into the social fabric of our society (or, American society at least, I don't know where you're from).

But they do. What about when Calgary was underwater for a week? What if our oil stopped shipping out of here all of a sudden? Maybe a large break in the railways which ship you guys a lot of food and natural resources you manufacture? Oh geez how can you be an economic center without getting resources from the rest of the country...

&gt; ""Real winter"" is relative and a stupid arbitrary standard.

Maybe if you live in Ontario. Here two years ago it didn't get lower then -10 for most of the winter. I would not call that a real winter but it's subjective. That's just a bit chilly, not actually ""cold"" It may be relative sure but if you move to Canada you gotta figure out freak cold weather can and will happen even if you don't think it will.

&gt; We are actually, given the fact that we're an economic, research, cultural and commercial epicentre in this country. In fact, when we called in the army to help us years ago, it was partly because most of Canada couldn't get access to the blood bank here, which greatly decreased the ability of hospitals in Canada to treat patients needing transfusions. That's one issue.

But the rest of the country assists you guys too. Those nuclear plants, where does their fuel come from. The oil for manufacturing and other raw materials. Do you guys have a synchrotron there now too? What about other provinces with university s doing research as well which benefits the rest of the nation? There is the financial sector I give you that but lots of those things will happen the same in other places in Canada too. And calling in the army to clear out the city for blood ok well that's important but I don't know how to feel knowing that a large supply of such a vital resource is stuck in one place (which although it is populated largely other places will need blood too).

&gt; Did you have sheets of ice falling from buildings? Again, that's just one issue. It's a matter of safety, not just for the falling ice but for homeless people and those not used to this sort of weather. Being in the praries, you get it all the time (it's your own fault for living there) and you're prepared in various ways. We're not, and so warning is just smart.

Homeless people do exist in Saskatchewan too ya know. And I'm pretty sure blowing snow might have shut down a couple of highways and I KNOW there were many ditched vehicles, maybe even semis. I also imagine there was some ice falling with that, as well as a cell tower being knocked over and glass shattering in a high rise building. We might be used to it but you guys aren't the only special snowflakes getting shitty weather. Also remember not everyone has the resources to just be able to get up and go move wherever on whim. Did I chose to have my parents live in Saskatchewan? 

&gt;I don't and I don't care either. If you're too blinded by your jealousy of Toronto to be logical, that's your problem, Napoleon.

We aren't jealous of you guys, only tired of you getting attention for what is normal all over the rest of the nation. You guys just never seem to have a clue with whats going on in the rest of the nation from what I observe. Oh well at least we didn't elect somebody like Rob Ford (sorry that was a super low blow, total cheap shot)."

Menial jobs are not always assembly-line drudgery, and electricians and plumbers work in fields that are very technical and require more than a layman's knowledge of principles of science and engineering.

Edit - added more info now that I have a free moment:  To qualify this, pubic lice are extremely slow moving and they cannot jump (like fleas can).  They don't live long away from the blood they need to survive, a matter of minutes from the time they are away from their food supply.  Finally, they can't stay on smooth, hard surfaces as they are not designed to do so, they need to be able to grip.  All of these things above are the reasons why you can't get crabs from a toilet seat.

My clinic recently donated some pubic lice straight from a patient to a scientist who is doing a documentary on parasites.  When they came to collect them, the scientist removed them from the container and put them on their arm as a holding place.  They couldn't risk them dying as they needed them for whatever they are filming.  We had them off the donor maybe 20 minutes, the ride from us back to the lab was maybe another 10-20, so was too risky to wait much longer.  All in a day's work . . ."

ADC is still an important role, the role has just evolved over the past season or so. Id advise you learn it if you think youd be a liability to a team because youll basically lose without an ADC."

iheartennui,changemyview,1390934435.0,"&gt; I don't think however that a case has been made against the non-existance of ""Free Will"" because if the Universe is containing such randomness, it means when faced with the decision between a snickers or an apple, the decision is an outcome of statistical determinism AND the randomness of the initial states of particles. 

You're on track with this. This would appear to be the correct way to view things from the point of view of modern physics, as commonly accepted to be a good description of the universe, i.e. the results that support quantum field theory. Unfortunately, it seems every physical process is governed by probabilistic interactions at the quantum scale. This, though technically not physically deterministic, still affords us no means of determining our own future. If the processes are truly random, then we have no way in which to effect a result of our choosing.

The only solace I can offer in light of this viewpoint is that, while this seems to limit our freedom as physical beings, the mechanism of consciousness is still a complete mystery from a physical standpoint. However things work on a microscopic scale, our macroscopic impression of reality and our existence somehow gives us the illusion of freewill. So we should act accordingly and just forget the underlying truth :/"

I frequently get calls from panicked students who are on financial aid and failed two or more classes.  Financial aid will no longer pay for your classes if you fail twice, resulting in two 1.9 GPAs on a record or more preventing someone from qualifying and leaving them educationless for the time being.  I've had a student cry to me because they had lost their mother in a car accident recently and were unable to do well in their classes.  But rarely is that justifiable enough for an instructor to give a student an ""incomplete"" or second chance, and I have to be the one to say it.

I cope by trying to be the understanding, nice lady on the phone.  The bearer of bad news, rather than the source.  A lot of college employees treat students so casually and talk to them like robots, but I try to empathize and make them feel better about their situation.  I try to connect them with them and get them to as many resources as I can to help them out.  Sometimes, I can even get a laugh and a thank you from them.  It makes me feel good.

**TL;DR:** I'm the person who tells people when their requested second chance in a college class isn't going to happen, so I try to empathize and connect with them on a personal level in order to bring some light into a dark place."

New Year's Day   
Memorial Day  
Fourth of July  
Labor Day  
Thanksgiving (2)   
Christmas (2) 

Memorial Day, July 4, and Labor Day are awesome. It's nice out, you get a paid day off work, and you can have a get-together with friends and family, grill some burgers, drink some beers, and kick back, enjoying the fruits of your labor. New Year's Day I understand, because everyone is up late partying the night before. 

Two days for Thanksgiving? Why? What the fuck do you need the day after Thanksgiving off for? It's November. November is the XFL of months, and Thanksgiving is the BCS selection committee of Holidays. It's not even real! There was no big happy dinner between the Native Americans and the Pilgrims, they were too busy fucking killing each other for that to have ever happened. It's a romanticized version of history, which is bullshit. I would gladly trade one of those days on Thanksgiving for Super Bowl Monday. Or better yet, add the 9th paid holiday.

But no. I either have to take one of my precious vacation days or ""drink in moderation"" whatever that means. Over 100 million people have watched the Super Bowl in the last few years. That's 25% of the fucking country! You can't get a quarter of the country to agree on what to call fizzy brown carbonated sugar-water (pop? soda? coke? cola?) but a quarter of us can agree that this Sunday, come hell or high water, we'll be in front of a TV with a few of our closest friends, screaming obscenities at no one in particular, and consuming copious amounts of unhealthy food and booze into the last hours of the night. 

Our government has failed us. In a bunch of ways actually, but I'm not talking about those. I'm talking about adding the 9th motherfucking holiday to the US work schedule. I'm talking about Super Bowl Monday being observed by *everyone* as a holiday, a day of rest, a day where we spend the morning finding our pants and sleeping. A day where men and women alike can relax, knowing full well that they are being compensated for their patronage to the great sport of American Football. "

A few of the girls (which he refers to by number, and by a key characteristic of hers) actually start out as being ""naturally monogamous"" as you put it (a bullshit term, because none of us are naturally monogamous). And all of them end up maintaining interactions on the side just like the women who were more openly slutty.

You might be thinking, ""Well yeah, a girl's always gonna have male followers. Can't stop that from happening.""

Thing is, even the ""good girls"" were sending declarations of interest and longing back and forth between these men they were keeping at arm's length. Despite their self-proclaimed traditional values, these women could not resist the urge to seek that validation.

Now, I agree with the author of the post in the original link: 20Nation made some fatal mistakes which I believe led to these women continuously seeking validation. But all women are fundamentally capable and inclined to seek attention.

Good choice for primary photo.. would be better if you were actually looking at the camera, but the best of those you have posted.   I do question the fashion choice (hello 1950s?) of your glasses frames though.. the one picture they are not evident in (Las Vegas with the wookie) you look more attractive.

Why include a picture of you blowing your nose?

**self summary**

There is more to you than this, though that's a laudable skill.  If an answer is in the statistical stuff to the right, don't repeat it.  

**doing with my life**

Nice.. some hooks to start a conversation off off, like wft is a capstone project, systems engineer in what field systems engineer from a computer science perspective is entirely different from a systems engineer from an engineering perspective.  

**really good at**

Not bad..   wood working small stuff, wood working furniture, wood working houses?

Otherwise good hooks to start conversation from.


**First thing**

This explains the glasses, but not why they are on your face instead of in a memory case on the wall?

**Favorites**

Acronyms bad.. expand.

Food.. expand, if someone wants to picture herself out eating with you, what cuisines, even favorite restaurants will help form that image.

Movies.. nothin?

**Six**

Nibs is your cat?  OR you really like the candy?

**thinking about** 

Good with just enough humor and good hook.

**Friday**

Also good hooks.. assuming that a local will know what Burke's is?

**private**

Awesome hook, if that doesn't start a conversation nothing will.

You started in fashion design yet you're still wearing your grandfather's eyeglass frames?

**message me**

Meh.. fairly weak.   Maybe the same message in the form of ""You already decided to but you're just finishing the profile first to be courteous"""

My wife and several of my close friends are doctors, and the arguments for residents doing long hours comes down to training and experience.  The point of residency is to give a new doctor access to all kinds of experiences, and it's meant to cram in a lifetime's worth of challenges into a few years.

Plus, there is some aspect (according to one friend) of teaching a future attending physician how to work under adverse conditions.  Learning how to work under long, stressful hours is in many ways an acquired skill, so making sure that every doctor knows their coping mechanisms when they're tired and stressed out is in some ways useful if they ever need to do that later under some kind of emergency scenario."

ILoveBigOil,personalfinance,1390934910.0,"[Mint](https://www.mint.com/) is a financial tracking website; it is not a bank account. Setting up an account allows you to connect your bank accounts, credit cards, etc. to the account and Mint will automatically populate the data; it's incredibly handy.

I don't know how much you know about bank accounts, so I'll cover the basics of what the accounts are in case you need a refresher.

Checking accounts allow you to write checks out of the account or use a debit card to pay for things with the funds in the account. You can set up the account to prevent you from ever overdrafting by declining overdraft protection and informing your bank that you want the transaction to be declined if you have insufficient funds. This will protect you from having to pay costly overdraft fees (I believe my bank charges $28 penalty).

Savings accounts do *not* allow you do write checks or use a debit card for transactions; instead, you can have an ATM card that you will use at ATMs to withdraw money from the account, or you can go into the bank and fill out a withdrawal slip to get cash from the account.

Savings accounts will pay interest, albeit a **very** small amount. True checking accounts will not and cannot pay interest legally. There are types of ""hybrid"" accounts (my CU calls them ""dividend accounts"" that are transaction-based, like checking accounts, but pay ""dividends"" on the average daily balance in the account, again this is a very small amount).

Because you can't use a debit card or paper checks to move funds out of a savings account, this is primarily used for money you don't want to touch until a specific time. Checking accounts are used for regular daily transactions."

Mums are very commonly used in centerpieces for Thanksgiving and fall tables- so most florists will be able to makes these look extremely classy and good. Don't worry about that. If you are worried about how classy they are, add some things that add value as I have suggested in other posts. [These roses](http://i.imgur.com/7zqiTQ4.jpg) are amazing to add, they look fantastic. Aside from that, flowers like [gerber daisies](http://i.imgur.com/e0wSJAf.jpg), [sunflowers &amp; deep red alstros](http://i.imgur.com/KH4rjAB.jpg), [hypericum berries!!](http://i.imgur.com/gU5QXHk.jpg), raffia, curly willow, billy balls, and other woodsy-natural things are great... Please reference [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1wc8qw/im_a_florist_and_also_in_the_wedding_planning/cf0sbjw) post for some more links to what each looks like :D

Here are some lovely fall themed centerpieces you might be interested in looking at!

* [Basket arrangements](http://i.imgur.com/ZJxvDfr.jpg) are fun, easy, inexpensive and always look fall. They are more 'picnik-y?' but for certain weddings, this would work!

* [Lowset rectangular colored glass arrangements](http://i.imgur.com/Efl4iW3.jpg) vases are great and reusible, and flowers can look very classy!

* [Tin buckets](http://i.imgur.com/ijRErg4.jpg) are WAY COOL!!! They are fun, interesting, and inexpensive! :D They are easy to find at most craft stores! This one has faux leaves in it- which can either be really pretty or really tacky. It depends on the quality of the leaves that the florist uses.

* [Bowl arrangements](http://i.imgur.com/Rq406mu.jpg) This one has gerbs, roses, and tulips, but it's all up to you! THese are just ideas. :)

* [All mums, very fall, with river stones](http://i.imgur.com/PmRLxKK.png) I think this might be your favorite one :)

As such, the players choice to block them will have no real effect and will not force any introspection. Only the people behind the game have the power to put a stop to someone's rude behavior by temporarily refusing them from playing that one game.

Then there's the fact that their rude behavior will influence other players who are having a bad time to do the same.

Your speech to ""just putting them on ignore"" is pretty much assuming a perfect world that doesn't really exist. A lot of people get angry because of flamers and start flaming themselves.

shiroganeookami,changemyview,1390935095.0,"I saw you mention elsewhere that you're not a biologist, so I thought I'd take a moment and talk about this argument from the neuroscience perspective. Looking at things on the quantum level tends to become a bit abstract, and I think it's easier to consider this at a higher level.

First off, I'll start by saying that I agree with OP; that we do not have free will, at least as we know it. This results, as OP suggested, from a combination of genetics and environment, and on a molecular level things like quantum mechanics have next to no measurable effect. For example, consider [how a signal passes through a neuron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential). Unlike an electrical wire, this signal is not the result of electrons traveling along a conductor, but rather from the opening of molecular ""gates"" and the rush of positive ions into the cell. When the polarity in one area of the cell membrane changes, it makes neighboring gates open, and the reaction propagates through the neuron. This involves large numbers of ions, each of which is only minutely affected by quantum effects to begin with. In the end, it would be incredibly unlikely that some quantum effect would ever interfere with this process, and indeed, the signaling process is generally considered ""all or nothing"", and once it starts it will almost always finish.

Now, what causes the neuron to fire? For neurons in the brain, this happens when they get a big enough signal from the neurons that connect to them. This process happens on an even larger scale, with potentially thousands of different neurons connected to the same cell. Quantum mechanics don't play into it -- and why should they? Why would a biological system want something which only works some percentage of the time? Even if a system could have evolved at a scale that was susceptible to quantum effects, it wouldn't have been reliable. Things would fire when you don't want them to -- or not fire when you do. The animal would have died quickly. Instead, things happen on a scale which is large enough that quantum fluctuations are averaged out -- where any small changes like that will still be within the tolerances of the system. 

At the largest scale, we can consider our personalities, our thoughts, and our decisions to be an emergent property of the way our entire nervous system is interconnected. Some of these connections are pre-programmed into us and are created during our development. The vast majority, however, result from stimulation of complicated circuits within the brain itself. Different sequences of stimulation will cause different connections to be made, and over time unused connections can be broken. This is the sum total of our experience. Every single stimulus that we receive, from the second that our sensory nervous system develops to this very instant, is recorded in these changes to our neural map. Every signal that comes out, a direct result of the structure of those connections.

I've rambled a bit here, but I did want to make one last point -- that I think people have started to realize this already. Depression, for example, is gaining much more acceptance as a medical problem -- something that can't be helped by simply ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps."" This is true, of course. It's easy to imagine a scenario where the complex wiring of the brain arranges itself in such a way that no internal stimulus will ever lead to the activation of the ""happy"" centers of the brain. Combine this with lower levels of the chemicals that the happy neurons need to fire, and it's easy to see why even enjoyable stimuli can't break them out of this pattern. Of course, this is exactly the same mechanism by which some people are constantly happy, irritable, nervous, scared, stressed, easily distracted, and literally every other trait or emotion you can think of. Just like a depressed person -- and for the same reasons -- they can't help it. The only difference is that for depression, we've figured out how it happens. People can point to a test and say ""See? I don't have enough serotonin. I'm sick."" The problem is that it won't be long before such tests exist for every state of mind. The question that sometimes keeps me up at night is -- what happens when literally every thought we have comes with the knowledge that ""I can't help it?"""

jubbergun,AdviceAnimals,1390935103.0,"&gt; Whoa whoa, the last part makes it sound like all women try to leave it to chance.
&gt; I never want to get pregnant, nor did I as a youth

While I understand what you're saying, not every woman thinks like you.  I also don't think the author meant to imply ""every woman"" since she was talking specifically about the demographic of women upon which her research is based, and I'm sure even the author would agree that her finding is a generalization of the group and not an indictment of every single member of that group.

&gt; If you stuck it in there, you should remember to wrap it first and don't put full responsibility on the female.

While I agree that it 'takes two to tango,' I never hear this argument in the reverse (applied to women).  If anyone argued against abortion by saying that a woman should have taken proper precautions and she deserved to be pregnant because she didn't, I'm sure there would a very strenuous objection, and rightfully so.  I don't think it is reasonable to hold a man accountable in any way that we would not hold a woman accountable or vice versa, and in situations where a man has his partner's assurance that she's on birth control I think it is incredibly unfair to attempt to shift the blame for the situation to him.

&gt; Yes, I'm looking into other methods that will work for me with my doctor. He prefers I use the pill, I would rather have an IUD. BF is perfectly fine wrapping it.

I'm glad you're both responsible, but I think you're making the mistake of thinking that because you are, everyone else is or at least wants to be, as well.

&gt; -shrug- Downvoting me for saying you can't place 100% responsibility on one person that is participating in a 2 person activity is silly.

I don't think the downvotes are because you believe that responsibility should be shared, but because the way you worded your response gave the impression that, contrary to what you were trying to say, the male has a larger responsibility in the matter."

Doing pulls up till failure and climbing the next day is a recipe for being weaker and getting repetitive strain injuries.

6). Yes. You can either excel at lifting weights or excel at climbing. Pick one. You can do some light cross training but you cannot do both in the volumes you are talking about.

shattered_wavelength,relationships,1390935145.0,"I'm not married, and I'm not in your wife's situation... but what I can offer is growing up in a house that was, in the beginning, very similar to what you are going through.

My mom is a highly intelligent, highly motivated, reasonably well educated woman. She stayed home to raise me and my brother and it was SO BORING for her. We also lived in a rural area, where jobs were either a minimum-wage full-time gig, or nonexistent. My parents constantly fought, and while I think my mother had some underlying mental issues as well (incredibly abusive mother and a broken home back when that wasn't allowed socially, so she was with her mother 24/7 for 18 years growing up). She would lash out at my father, at me, and at my brother on an ongoing basis. There were other issues at play, but these are the bits that are similar to your situation.

DO NOT think that this doesn't affect your kids. I clearly remember being 5-6 years old and knowing that dad was home, so I better bundle off the brother to my room and play with him so they could scream at each other. When my friends at school said their parents never yelled and mommy never cried in the mornings, it shocked me. Trust me, a lot happens in front of your kids that you don't know about or think they don't understand, and those things probably aren't very healthy for them.

My mom ended up getting involved in our school. She became a teachers aide, something that allowed her to still do the mommy-duties while allowing for the schedule of having small children. Enroll the kids in a community group (4-H is AWESOME in rural areas, and it involves more than just animals and is fairly inexpensive). It will give her a chance to meet other moms without any of that weird PTA vibe, and maybe even get into a craft to teach the other kids. Have her taken an online course in writing, or a weekly pottery class while you watch the kids. Rework your budget using some of the techniques mentioned here so you can take her out a little more often.

Whatever you do, DO SOMETHING. If my father had been more proactive, I think that things would have been better. You might have to carry this for a while, make sacrifices like watching the kids all weekend while she gets to go on a hike, things like that. As for the house-cleaning, make up a chore list so she can visually see what you are doing, and then do those things. Again... you are going to have to carry more than 'your fair share' to fix this. That's how relationships are supposed to work. Sometimes you have to carry more. But if you love her, if this is the woman you still want to have around in 10 or 20 years, you need to fix this now. It will only become more toxic, and eventually she might seek out 'exciting' things like affairs and leaving you. If she refuses to change, she refuses to change, but you need to do everything you can  so that if nothing else, you can be certain that it's HER and not YOU. "

[this already exists on thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:88426) but I imagine isn't super stable, being printed out of cheap ABS plastic, etc.  It's probably also not adjustable enough since the position of the frame relative to the lens varies (some earpieces meet the lens right near the top, some in the middle, etc)...

$225 for frames still neglects the cost of lenses, too... so you're looking at another $75-150 for a pair of lenses, maybe more once you add all the features they add (anti scratch coating, etc)..."

&gt;A desire for God's power, it seems.

Surely this is a flaw in ones character? It is this same reason that God cast Satan out from heaven, is it not? And yet he creates two flawed people and then acts surprised when they act in a flawed way.

&gt;They were told exactly what would happen if they did it. They knew it was a bad thing to do.

The second sentence does not follow from the first. They only gain knowledge of evil *after disobeying him*. Therefore it logically follows that *before* they disobeyed him they did not have knowledge of evil, and could thus not have understood that it was evil to disobey him.

&gt;Precisely! So they knew they were doing something that was evil.

I thought you were arguing that they gained knowledge/understanding of good and evil *after* they disobeyed God? Now you're saying they knew it beforehand.

&gt;God didn't create Adam or Eve with any evil characteristics. The desire for power isn't evil, its good. Having more power means you can make more good than if you had less power

So why did he cast them out for exhibiting what you describe as a good characteristic? 

&gt;     

There's nothing wrong with exercising it. What's wrong is using it for evil.

But surely you must recognise that this becomes an issue when what is right or wrong is described in terms of obeying or disobeying? Why give people the option to *not* obey you when you'll just punish them if they actually exercise that? That sounds like a way of avoiding responsibility to me.

&gt;There's no test - the tree wasn't there as an experiment to see whether people would eat from it or not. 

When I'm talking about 'the test' I'm talking about the exercise of free will. Will you obey God's laws or will you assert your right to decide what is good and bad?

&gt;Like what?

Forgive me if this sounds impertenent but are you actually Christian? It's almost universal Christian doctrine that humans are *fundamentally* flawed beings. It was Christ's sacrifice that redeemed us, in the Christian view. Many denominations do not accept that any action can make you worthy of heaven, the only thing that can do that is to accept Christ's sacrifice and live in accordance with the values he set out.

&gt;Well when we keep in mind that the word's being used there in the sense of familiarity, of course God would rather we not have familiarity with evil.

&gt;A good being wouldn't want its children to have intimate familiarity with the things evil brings, like death and suffering.

Really? Surely if you're going to allow people free will then you should give them the tools to actually responsibly exercise it? Otherwise you're setting them up for inevitable failure.

I think Moyes might be seeing Cleverley isn't good enough, given he hasn't played much at all of late, Fletch isn't quite there yet, and Fellaini obviously isn't fit.

Although if Giggs has a bad game it'll be hard to watch. If he's on we should be comfortable.

Too many gyms nowadays don't have enough in the way dumbbells and barbells, as well as other additional strength training equipment. I'll use my current gym as an example, because I'm extremely happy with it: it has one set of dumbbells going up to 70 pounds, and another set of dumbbells going up to 100 pounds. They have 4 barbell bench stations (adjustable benches), 4 platform stations for deadlifts, squats, or olympic lifts (and they all have a pull up bar attached too), plus 2 random cages for squats or benches. They also have two different cable apparatuses with pullup bars attached. And then there's a couple  smith machines and a ton of different machines.

Unfortunately, I'll only be using this gym for about 5 more months, and then I have to find a new one. When I'm looking for a new one, I'll try to find one that has a wide array of equipment for strength training, but I very much doubt I'll find anything matching what I have now.

Reddit's mods are volunteer janitors, usually removing stuff because it doesn't fit the rules / content of the sub.

Yes, sometimes I disagree with their decisions on what they remove, but to suggest that Reddit is ""controlled"" in some fashion that has anything to do with trying to determine what information you should and should not see is disingenuous at best, and borderline lunacy at worst."

They are lazy, it's just the fat jokes on TBBT are so similar that they're lazy, and the whole show does that, but it's harder to see because they have such a rich vein of material to tap as things to laugh at.

Will_Im_Not,Seattle,1390935724.0,"&gt;Transit Score uses an algorithm that evaluates, on a block-by-block basis, how well city residents are served by public transit.  More than 300 U.S. cities were scored this year, including 20 in Washington. The company uses data coming directly from transit agencies, and its methodology weighs several factors, such as frequency of service, walking distance to transit stops, and mode of transit (bus, rail, ferry, and so on).

&gt;In September 2012, King County Metro rolled out RapidRide, an express bus network with some features of a Bus Rapid Transit system.  RapidRide entailed a host of restructurings to Metro’s bus service, and some local routes were lost. While selected bus routes saw improvements to frequency and speed under RapidRide, stops were consolidated in order to help increase efficiency.

&gt;Transit Score’s new results seem to suggest that, on balance, RapidRide changes may have actually done more harm than good

It all depends on how accurate the transit score algorithm is. I've cited Walk Score on this subreddit before and people told me that that site is inaccurate.

I can answer it for you: people who are simply bent on being catty and nasty to others. 

And something I've learned that is really, really hard to put into practice is: putting on makeup to feel good should be about making you feel fabulous for you. If you don't wear makeup? Fine. You're still fabulous. If you do wear makeup? Cool! You're fucking awesome. But it shouldn't be about those losers in the bathroom, it should be about empowering yourself- because in the long run, **you** are the one who matters. I know it doesn't feel like that right now because jesus getting made fun of sucks cocks but trust me, when you're as old as I am (lol 24 I'm so old) you will realize that all the makeup you do and all the stuff in your life should ultimately be for yourself and then the people you love.

If you aren't picky, just check the grocery store because that is how you will save money.

SoyBeanExplosion,Christianity,1390935829.0,"Thanks for responding. Some of what you said was echoed in another comment I responded to so I won't address those here, but in response to this point:

&gt;I think God created humans with free will because it was more interesting than creating robots or puppets. Our free will is exercised in all kinds of choices that we make, not only in choice-points of obeying vs disobeying him. 

So we're at risk of eternal damnation because God thought it would be 'more interesting'? That seems... unsatisfactory. It actually sounds fairly irresponsible of him, if I'm honest.

&gt;He doesn't punish us for exercising free will generally (e.g. choosing what to eat for lunch). He punishes us for sin actions, which we choose to do. 

So some actions are neither good nor bad, they just are?

Either way that wasn't really the point I was trying to make. My point was that it feels terribly unjust for God to say ""here is how you should live. I give you the free will to either live life like this, or not. However, if you do not, you will be severely punished."" So either you do exactly as he tells you and leave your *actual* free will to deciding what you want for tea, or you risk some kind of punishment depending on your interpretation of the bible."

Another way to flip ""He's dead"" is that New Banri is a body snatcher. The snatcher stole his body that is still alive and won't give it back, and is ruining the relationship with the love of his life. She is saying no, but her body language shows that it is a logical and that if body snatcher hadn't affect circumstances it would be yes.

Blacksheep01,totalwar,1390935906.0,"Yeah, you must luck out with having such a safe starting point as the Iceni. Once you conquer Britannia, you are mostly safe on an island and can choose who to attack. Unfortunately, I had to ally myself with Easterners as they were literally the only people who had not declared war on me and would trade with me, everyone else either declared war or hated me too much. But now I face the terrible prospect of fighting all of them. I'm saving it for last, gonna send in 4 full stacks to zerg rush Armenia lol. 

As for Rome, I do have some advice now that I've managed to conquer more of the map than any other faction. First up, diplomacy for the Romans is huge. One of the houses, Junia I think, has a diplomacy hit, I would not play as them unless you want a nightmare of difficulty, it's hard enough being any Roman faction already. In any event, you want to set up trade agreements/non-aggression with some key factions in Greece/Illyria as soon as possible. Ardiaei and Macedon most likely as they often seem to win for a long time (Macedon is still alive in my game, for example). You have to offer trade/peace and money or it won't work. I did not know this and had Ardiaei, Epirus, Macedon and Athens declare war on me, then the Daorsi (another Illyrian tribe) at the same time Carthage and Nova Carthago declared war on me!

It is too much! And angering the people in Greece/Illyria leads to a world of hurt, they are a short boat ride from Italy and will spend every turn blockading and invading. I sometimes sent suicide armies to raze their cities, and then those armies would be attacked by 5 Macedonia/Epirus/Ardiaie full stacks and they'd jump over and attack Italy again!

So you've got to fine peace on your east flank early, because Carthage declares war on you by default about 20 turns in and they bring their ally, Nova Carthago with them. 

On top of that, one or all of the tribes of Northern Italy will be your enemy. The Veneti are incredibly powerful. I managed to beat them with 3 full stack armies after losing an entire army to them, made them a satrapy, but they betrayed me in 10 turns or so. 

So I'd advise make friends of Ardiaie and Macedon if possible to protect your east. Take out the Cisalpanian tribes as soon as you can, but do not make them into clients. Then you can devote your might to eradicating Carthage. Nova Carthago is also no joke. I beat Carthage and then had to protect Italy for 50-100 turns and in that time Nova Carthage conquered all of Iberia and North Africa and they are a carbon copy of Carthage with equipment/soldiers, so you want to knock them out quickly.

You got something that others want. That makes them jealous. Jealous people let that feeling seep out, and it hurts you. But their jabs are only coming because you've succeeded! So accept them with pride, don't get upset, and roll your eyes. Trust me, nothing will get them to shutup faster than you just rolling your eyes and going ""Jealous, much? I can give you tips on how to bust your ass and get in shape if that's what you're looking for. It's not easy, but trust me, it's worth it.""

Rossegut,worldbuilding,1390935950.0,"Honestly they could possibly live in all kinds of wetlands. Unless there's some sort of nutrient limiting them to one specific area, they're liable to spread out and inhabit a wide range of wet biomes.

Take Humans for example. Our species originated on African plains, and that's what we're best suited for. We have minimal fur covering our body, the only place it's very thick is on top of our head. We also stand upright to keep ourselves cool, which in the early days of our evolutionary inception also granted us the ability to see over tall grass.

While Humans are biologically best suited for an African savanna, we can still survive very well in other areas. Woodlands, grasslands, and rainforests for example. This is because all these biomes have, more or less, similar temperature ranges and hospitable environments.

Assuming the Pargils don't require hypersensitive conditions to survive, they could probably thrive in all forms of wetlands just like Humans can survive in all forms of moderately dry terrain.

EDIT: I also think it could provide for some sort of regional conflict if that interests you. Marsh Pargils vs. Bog Pargils vs. Swamp Pargils. Something like that."

beanfiddler,AdviceAnimals,1390936058.0,"I grew up on the dole. *Nobody fucking does this*. The closest I saw was this one friend whose mom got pregnant while she was on assistance. Her boyfriend promised to stick around, do right by her and the baby. And he did... for four months. Then away he went, another check in the mail. And everyone in the neighborhood gave her shit for ""falling for it."" As in ""I knew that man was no good, and I told you. You should have had it taken care of. Now you got another mouth to feed."" So even the other poor moms were judgmental.

I heard rumors of a lot of teenagers and even their moms getting things ""taken care of."" I was fortunate enough to live in a big urban city with a Planned Parenthood clinic three blocks away. It was pretty much ""Poor 101"" for girls: you turn 13 or so, and everyone's going to tell you how to get birth control for cheap (and where to get free condoms) so you don't get in the family way and make your momma raise your kid. She's barely around to raise you, between those two jobs, come to think of it.

But nobody on the dole was like ""wow, government assistance is awesome (it's a fucking pain in the ass, actually), I'm going to have more kids to get more."" If you're on the dole, you know how much it sucks. So putting yourself in a position to need more of it, and be judged by the entire neighborhood, and have to apply for more of it, is fucking stupid as hell."
RubyChub,OkCupid,1390936059.0,"Overlap is inevitable when it comes to online dating.  

I know when I get a message from someone promising, I want to strike up conversation right away so that they don't think I'm pulling a ""fade out"" and get disinterested.  This might happen with a few guys all around the same time; nothing wrong with talking and getting to know each other.  When dates get scheduled, you shouldn't restrict yourself because you're already talking to other people, fit them in.  Remember, you don't owe anyone anything yet, and they don't either.  

I admit, that when I have multiple dates happening around the same time, it gets me nervous.  What if they both are really into me?  What if I'm really into both of them?  When this happens I do tend to restrict the messages I reply to only because I don't want to get overwhelmed.  But in the end, after having a few dates in the same week with different guys, there is always just one guy that ends up being the winner, as in someone I could actually picture dating.  

Just go with the flow, and you should expect them to as well.  If he ends up choosing you, then great, but if not, then he obviously sees a reason to not go your direction and you should respect that, even if it stings. Just be patient, and try not to rush.  Great first dates have happened to us all, yet we're still on here. "

As for Elayne, she has been trained her entire life as heir of a large and prosperous country to take the throne. Then it's discovered that she's one of the most powerful channelers to be born in millennia. Yes, she's arrogant and impulsive, but she's the heir to the throne and the consort of the Dragon Reborn. If you want to hate her, go ahead, but it's not surprising she has a major role in the battle. 

If you're the heir of a country, when that country's monarch disappears, you get to contend for the throne no matter how much experience you have. A major part of her story arc was dedicated to her securing her throne. I think she did a pretty good job. I also think she's not as stupid stubborn as people like to say she is. She knows she doesn't have experience, and makes the decision to depend on the great captains for advice after Rand puts her in charge of the armies."

But there are examples of moderators overruling whiners and re-establishing (somewhat) stricter standards for posting.  /r/atheism had that whole imbroglio over low effort posts which led to the whiners leaving and going to /r/atheismrebooted. /r/bestof made the very controversial decision to get rid of posts from the defaults, which led to the low effort posters creating /r/defaultgems.  /r/askreddit got rid of stories in the title and text of a post, which now have to go over to /r/self.  Now /r/askreddit is experimenting with getting rid of nsfw questions, sending them over to /r/askredditafterdark.

Strict moderation can and does work, and instead of having good commenters unsubscribe and leave, you see the exodus of low effort posters to smaller subs.

The question isn't, ""how and when should we just abandon the big subs?"" It's, ""how can we get moderation teams to recognize and remove low effort posts?"""

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1390936191.0,"&gt;Salvation might occur through that alone, much in the same way a Buddhist might expect to be transmigrate to a more favorable birth if he follows the rites and injunctions of his faith. However, like Buddhism's notion of a living Buddha or enlightened soul,

""Soul"" might not have been the best word choice.

&gt;Christianity also has room for an elite who achieve theosis or mystical union with God while living on Earth. This won't come about through communion and repentance alone, but requires ascetic striving, contemplative prayer, and personal transformation. 

The Orthodox nuns I met emphasized that all this was a way to aide repentance. There were lay and monastic/ascetic saints alike because this basic concept was salvific for them both. The monastic was just aided by stricter rules imposed on them, like the Philokalia and the pracrice of hesychasm.

&gt;Of course not every Christian is capable of achieving this, much in the same way not every Buddhist is capable of becoming a Buddha or enlightened master. 

Unlike Buddhism, Orthodox Christianity lacks a concept of rebirth, so there is no precedent of Christian institutions implying that only Christian monastics and ascetics could attain salvation. This has been the case with Buddhism with respect to enlightenment. Otherwise, the Christian laity would be screwed--they only believe in one life. So this comparison isn't accurate.

&gt;As the website Orthodox.info points out regarding the difference between Protestant and Orthodox theology: ""Protestants do not have a ""therapeutic treatment"" tradition. They suppose that believing in God, intellectually, constitutes salvation. Yet salvation is not a matter of intellectual acceptance of truth; rather it is a person's transformation and divinisation by grace. This transformation is effected by the analogous ""treatment"" of one's personality, as shall be seen in the following chapters. In the Holy Scripture it appears that faith comes by hearing the Word and by experiencing ""theoria"" (the vision of God). We accept faith at first by hearing in order to be healed, and then we attain to faith by theoria, which saves man. Protestants, because they believe that the acceptance of the truths of faith, the theoretical acceptance of God's Revelation, i.e. faith by hearing saves man, do not have a ""therapeutic tradition."" It could be said that such a conception of salvation is very naive.""

The writers of Orthodoxinfo are very reactionary and conservative; they aren't canonical Orthodox, but are like the sedevancists of Orthodoxy. So, they tend to overstate things. Most canonical leaders have a ""proceed with caution"" attitude about the laity getting info from that site, in my experience.

 This idea of a Protestant who believes merely assenting to dogma is enough for salvation is a caricature, even in ""faith alone"" sects. I haven't met a single devout Protestant who believes that someone is free to sin and not repent just because they agree with Christian teaching. 

Statements like at that site are just cultural pushbacks against the west as increased globalization has forced east and west to face each other.

After quickly skimming that PDF, I found the relevant section on pages 156ff (page 6ff in the PDF): ""Welfare Mothers Intentionally Get Pregnant in Order To Get an  Increased Benefit""

The author first brings up the same objections that I've had, and then lists some references to support Hello2reddit's claim that women on welfare do NOT have children for the purpose of gaining additional welfare benefits. 

She goes on to say that the marginal increases in welfare aren't enough to make up for the cost of an additional child, and cites some statistics that most of these families are living in abject poverty. 

**This is where the argument ends**

Alright. Fine and well. Point taken. I haven't checked all the references, but let's assume for the sake of the argument that this is all true, and single mothers on welfare are NOT having additional children for the purpose of obtaining additional welfare.

The question then becomes: why ARE these women having more children, even if that means they'll knowingly subject themselves to more poverty? 

And how is that a good reason, as the author of that paper seems to argue, to get rid of welfare caps, i.e. let these ""families"" that can't support children anyways, have as many children as they want, and have the state pay for it?"

I guess what I was trying to say is that friendships across the gender divide are different, and I think it takes most women longer to develop emotional intimacy with men than women. That isn't to say emotional intimacy never happens, but I think it generally takes more trust."

&gt; If it were up to nature and there were no doctors, medicine, or anything like that, people like me would have likely died before we ever got the chance to bear children. 

or this either:

&gt; If people voluntarily chose to not reproduce like I am doing, there would be far less people with genetic disorders.

And, of course, I don't want to go around convincing anyone to have children because I say it is okay.

But I don't agree that it is necessarily morally wrong, nor would I discourage it, and this is why:

We, as human beings have more to offer than can be singled down to any one trait, or possibly even set of traits.

Someone who is horribly unhealthy, and in great pain and misery because of it, isn't necessarily someone that has nothing to contribute to society. Stephen Hawking and ALS, for example. *And any other ""great"" person that had any other genetic disorder for however many examples you like*

It isn't possible to know, (at least now, and quite likely ever), everything a person can possibly contribute based on their genes.

In my own modest bad health experience, I have taken away that the pain and suffering I've experienced have in fact enhanced some of my positive characteristics, and help me contribute more to others. I think similar things could be said for pain and suffering of many kinds.

Now, if I happen to pass on my condition, (which, admittedly, I would think differently of, if it were known to be fully genetic and not a combination of environmental and genetic influences) I won't be happy about it. I'm sure I'll feel horrible when I see them in pain the way I am.

But I believe suffering is a part of the human condition. I believe it is meant to be. I believe we suffer for reasons, and learn from suffering. And I firmly believe people suffer in one way or another. When it isn't health, it's something else.  

And I believe that my husband and I have many positive traits, and that we offer quite a bit to society around us. And I believe that our child would be a good contribution for us to make, and have good things to offer, even if they also have health issues.

Now, I could be wrong, we might have crap kids that do nothing at all for society, and keep more bad health genes around.

But I don't believe that bad health and bad health genes or good health and good health genes are all people contribute to society and to future generations.

I don't know what all the traits are, or what order I might rank them in, but I know there is more than just health.

I don't know how it is for kids in middle/high school today but I feel like nerdism, for lack of an appropriate term, is becoming fetishized in popular culture. ""Nerd"" used to be a noun, and it's getting replaced more and more as the adjective ""nerdy"". I feel like it's easier to be a nerd in addition to other things these days, but I don't know if that's just because I'm out of school and am generally surrounded by people who couldn't care less if I spend my Sundays pretending to be a paladin, playing what amounts to be an advanced version of toy soldiers, or whatever. 

It causes a lot of confusion though, because you have a lot of vapid children slapping glasses on themselves or playing Call of Duty and calling themselves nerds, which just really pisses me off for some reason. I feel like I've gone through a ton of shit to be able to proudly call myself a nerd, and that these kids are misusing the term.

DieMensch-Maschine,AskHistorians,1390936340.0,"I have some expertise in this field, so I will attempt to answer as concisely as I can.  When it was founded in 966, the medieval Polish state accepted Latin Christianity as its state confession.  Until about 1340, Poland was a uniformly Latin (Catholic) Christian, uni-confessional state.  When Kazimierz III (the Great) acquired Red Ruthenia, the medieval Polish state became bi-confessional, with a sizable Eastern (Orthodox) Christian population.  This Eastern Christian population grew further when Poland and Lithuania entered a personal union in 1385.  However, despite a politically powerful Eastern Christian noble faction, the Polish king and the Grand Duke of Lithuania were required to be Latin Christians.  

This status-quo remained unaltered throughout the Early Modern period. When the Protestant Reformation swept through Europe, monarchs and dukes more than anyone decided on the dominant confession of their respective states (cujus regio, ejus religio).  By the middle of the sixteenth century, the Polish-Lithuanian state was home to many converts to Lutheranism, Calvinism and later, Anti-Trinitarianism, which ranged from wealthy burghers to powerful magnates.  Zygmunt II August, king of Poland from 1548-1551, himself flirted with Protestantism.  His second wife, Barbara, came from the powerful Radziwiłł clan, many of which were ardent converts to Calvinism.  Zygmunt even considered the creation of a national church, akin to Henry VIII's religious experiment.  At the height of the Protestant tide, Protestant nobility were even able to insist that succeeding monarchs make an oath of tolerance to any residents of the Polish-Lithuanian state who dissented from the official state creed (the so-called Henrician Articles (1573), named after Henri Valois, Poland's first elective monarch).  Zygmunt's successors complied, but simultaneously exerted a kind of soft power to promote Catholicism over dissenting confessions.  

For example, Stefan (Istvan) Bathory (+1586) invited the Jesuits, who through preaching, teaching and polemics were able not only to turn back the tide of conversions, but were highly effective at winning many nobles back to the Catholic fold. Jesuit colleges were particularly effective tools of reconversion. Political participation in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth required good knowledge of Latin, rhetoric and classical political texts.  The Jesuits did not bring the Renaissance to Poland - but they taught!  Protestant nobles frequently sent their sons to Jesuit schools because of the impeccable reputation these institutions possessed - and then were surprised when their sons returned home as ardent Catholics.  Jesuit polemicists were likewise effective in fostering a cultural discourse in which to be Polish meant to be Catholic (see especially Piotr Skarga (SJ) ""Parliamentary Sermons"").  In a political environment where state-issued political offices meant social prestige, Polish kings tended to distribute them only to Catholics, providing yet another incentive to be on the ""right side"" of the confessional divide.  Following the Council of Trent (1545-1563), the project of Catholic Reform offered a cohesive program of spiritual, moral and intellectual renewal.  In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, ""Protestantism"" was never a cohesive movement.  Lutherans tended to be urban and ethnically German.  Calvinists were usually nobility, later themselves divided by the emergence of an Anti-Trinitarian faction.  In 1596, the Jesuits engineered a confessional union with the Eastern (Orthodox) Church in the Commonwealth, the so-called Union of Brest.  These Greek-rite Catholics were allowed to retain their rituals, married clergy and communion in both kinds - while recognizing the papacy.  

Protestantism (in all its forms) and ""dis-uniate"" Orthodoxy (ie, those Orthodox who did not accept union with Rome at Brest) increasingly became confessions of ""the other,"" especially after the 1655 so-called Swedish Flood, which witnessed an invasion by Swedish Lutheran troops as well as by Orthodox Cossacks and Muscovites, who were eager to loot Catholic sacred spaces. In the aftermath, many Protestant nobles were accused of being in cahoots with the invaders (viz. Janusz Radziwiłł), further ""othering"" non-Catholic confessions.  Perhaps most crucially, Protestantism never managed to filter down to the peasantry, who remained overwhelmingly Catholic or Orthodox (and later, Greek-rite Catholic).  In peasant discourse, Protestantism (broadly labeled as just ""Lutheranism"") remained a foreign creed, that of the Germans or Swedes, while post-Brest, Orthodoxy was the faith of the Muscovite.  This narrative of Poles as Catholics continued to be perpetuated following the Partitions (post 1795), when the once-dominant state confession found itself under repeated pressure from Lutheran German and Russian Orthodox monarchs.

**TLDR:** The Polish monarchy (as all other Early Modern monarchies) was able to shape the confessional makeup of the state it ruled over (in this case, particularly through use of soft power).
The cultural definition of what it meant to be ""Polish"" changed from one that was confessionally broad to one that was confessionally exclusive.

HumanSockPuppet,TheRedPill,1390936344.0,"&gt;This isn't necessarily a red pill success

I'd say that it is. You don't have to be fully-awake to catch glimpses of the truth.

Sometimes the Hamster so self-entitled, so gorged on its own excuses, and so indifferent about hiding itself that it can be spotted by anyone. In those cases, the Hamster hopes that the general indifference of society which has saved it in the past will somehow save it now.

&gt;I had never been more disgusted with my mother in my life (and here's where TRP comes in to play) so I gathered my thoughts for about a week or so and thought about how to...adequately convey my disgust and make her realize what she was.

This is how it always begins. A feeling. A nausea, or bitterness, or anger so strongly-felt that it rises, fast and volcanic.

What you've just described is something that 99% of Red Pillers experience at some point, even if a full-awakening does not immediately follow.

&gt;She realized that she was indeed the bad guy in the situation, that she was putting her own vague selfish desires over the security of her young children, and that worst of all for her, nobody, not even her favorite child believed her hamstering. About a month later, she and my stepdad reconciled and they've been back together for four more years. She seems far more content with her lot in life and is more mindful of her obligations to the family.

That one thought helped me a ton and I never did drugs after that day. I also talked to him every day from that day on. He quickly became one of my best friends and was there for my when my boyfriend at the time broke up with me.

Not trying to insult you, but it's the vibe I'm getting.

That said, I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have about absolutely anything regarding transgenderism in the hopes of furthering both our understandings of one another. Just PM me, we don't gotta keep it PC in private. 

Regarding your questions tho:
&gt;How do you feel about the push to determine that being transgendered is present at a genetic or chemical level? Do you truly believe that it would justify your being as transgendered person? 

I believe more scientific evidence showing that transgenderism isn't just all in our heads would be wonderful in validating our existence to the medical community at large. It's a major pain in the ass in a lot of 'civilized' countries to get access to the care we need because a lot of Docs can be ignorant or intolerant about transgenderism. Us educating our medical providers is commonplace. Such evidence may help in educating more medical service personnel in treating us properly. 

Although, we shouldn't have to ***justify our existence*** to anyone. That's nazi shit. 

&gt;How do you feel about the liberal push towards getting rid of labels altogether, for example, ""we're all people, why can't we just be happy with that?"" 

I feel liberals should stop being fucking liberals; pick up a molotov, and march with us against the church, the state, and capitalism. Liberals are just as bad if not worse than US conservatives. They can all fucking die and we'd be a whole lot better off. 

Sorry, you pinched a nerve with me on that one.

Form is a big thing. Don't use thick or uneven soles. I squat either barefoot or with knockoff chucks. If you're tipping forward make sure you're actually sitting back into the squat instead of just crouching down. Your lower legs should be near vertical just like in deadlift.

In my experience, I have noticed the opposite: women objectifying gay men, not the other way around. It's fashionable to have a gay friend, and I've known quite a few women who brag about it all the time when they have one (""I was talking to my **gay friend** the other day, and he said...""). I've even heard girls say, ""I wish I had a gay friend so I could hang around hot guys all night!"" Then when they get a gay guy friend, they run around feeling him and his friends up all night. And as soon as gay friend has served his purpose -- as soon as he withdraws from the club scene because he settles down with a long-term mate -- the girl stops calling him. This might just be my own personal experience, but It's sad to watch. I would feel terrible if I knew people were only friends with me for the perks of my culture, not the singularity of my character.

anatomizethat,pics,1390936760.0,"I should have been more specific that I meant domesticated sheep  - for this reason I don't think my logic is flawed.

Domesticated sheep DO need to be sheared, and there are sources for ethical wool. For example, there's a yarn store near me run by a woman who owns her own sheep; she shears, spins, and dyes the wool herself. Since her sheep are of the domesticated variety (like Shrek here), they need shearing. Most ethical vegans would say that using the sheep's wool is still unethical because I'm ""using the wool for my own gain"" and therefore exploiting the sheep...but the sheep need to be sheared. So should they be sheared and the wool be wasted? I just think it's a weak argument to make in terms of domesticated sheep.

Edit: I just want to add that I DO knit with other fibers and blends. However, wool has very good heat retention, even when wet. If I knit hats, scarves, socks, mittens, etc that I know will be used in the snow, I want them to have wool in them. Acrylic certainly does not provide this kind of warmth, and cotton and hemp are ""warm weather"" fibers with different properties."

For example, in one of the sections, you and your opponent have all your pokemon set up on this spin-the-wheel, and your team is chosen by throwing the darts at the wheel.

bagehis,Eve,1390936895.0,"I tried to break things down in a way that non-gamers would understand:

1) This war is not any more significant than any other wars in the game.  The battle was significant.  It was significant because of several reasons.  Primarily, CCP has improved the servers so they stay up during a fight like this so the battle actually played out to the end.  Neither side was able to build up their entire force before the battle kicked off, so ships were trickling in during this fight in smaller numbers, allowing the fight to proceed (unlike a fight that failed to escalate to this level earlier this month).  Both Laz (CFC commander for this fight) and Manny (PL commander for this fight) were willing to go all in and called for ships to keep entering the fight all day, neither disengaging and cutting losses.

2) 75 titans were confirmed to be killed, around 200 dreadnoughts, 100 carriers, and another 700 smaller ships.  Smaller ships are of negligible value, between 1 million and 1 billion isk, in this fight most were under about 200 million isk.  Carriers cost between 1-2 billion.  Dreadnoughts cost between 3-5 billion isk.  Titans cost about 100 billion isk (in game currency) for the ship and up to another 100 billion isk in things put on them to allow them to function (fittings).  Most titans that died were in the 130-150 billion isk total range.  Isk is primarily obtained through an economic input called bounties, where a player kills a non-player character.  This money flows through a fairly complex, commodity market managed by a economist (Dr. Eyjolfur Gudmundsson) and his team in a similar way to the US Fed.  The in-game currency can be used to purchase game time from other people who have paid for the game time with real world currency.  The conversion is roughly $14-$20 for 550 million isk (depending on how much you purchase).  In this fight, the total destruction was 12.5 trillion isk.  Purchasing that much isk with real world currency would cost around $350,000 (but as has been pointed out, the majority was gained by in-game means).

3) Key people to interview are Bryan ([Lazarus Telraven](http://www.reddit.com/user/Laztel), the CFC commander in this fight), [Manfred Sideous](http://www.reddit.com/user/ManuelNoryigga) (the PL commander in this fight), Alex ([The Mittani](http://www.reddit.com/user/Numismancer/), the CFC Leader), and CCP's PR guy, Ned Coker - nedcoker@ccpgames.com .

If you don't already have their information, let me know and I'll see if I can point them in your direction.

Try not to store the bow resting on the tip, it won't cause any serious material damage by itself but makes it easier to accidentally kick it or lean on it and snap the knock-- and it will also dry out the top limb over long periods of time, but it takes a while for that to happen and is especially hard to inflict upon hickory.

It's a good idea to have a coat of sealant, and hickory stains pretty well. I personally prefer not to stain my wood because I like the natural appearance of the species I use, but it certainly isn't harmful. for sealants I prefer tru-oil, but really any kind of wood sealant will work."

 The cause and effect relation is only visible in hindsight and because of that repetition we project that concept on a future observer or even a extra temporal one, and assume that since our actions are confined to this temporal paradigm, they will seem predictable form an outside point of view.

But put it this way, multiples causes can lead to the same effect so from that external point of view, seeing the future, you can not deduce what past cause or combination of causes led to it. And within your definition of a mathematical function, this should be easy, as simple mathematics have algorithms than can be reversed.

Also you assume everything fits together because you are not capable of knowing the alternatives, our present moment isn't the result of the universe getting snake eyes x times in a row, our universe is the result of it getting under 3's for at least x times out of y tries.

In the OP's example, and for cases in which the mods have been banned in the past, the money given to the mods has been given on the basis of services rendered on reddit specifically - payment for modding the sub, running advertising services, et cetera.

In the case of /r/Minecraft, the donation is for an exterior, *non-profit* service that is a collective of the community. The mods didn't throw up a server and say ""Come here and donate,"" the community created a server which was then ceded to the mods' control and the donation bar is a public access point for community support. 

It's very much in a gray area, but I'm fairly sure that if it *does* violate Reddit rules it only breaks the letter of the law."

Rodalli,politics,1390937091.0,"You're missing the point, I think. The people that were working those unskilled jobs 30 years ago didn't just vanish. The US population didn't decrease - but the pool of jobs shrank because of a) automation/technology and b) overseas competition. Although a large portion of our population has made the transition into skilled labor or some type of profession, it hasn't been enough to keep up with the rate of jobs lost for unskilled labor. Other factors are affecting this too - access to education, poverty rates, etc.

So now the supply of unskilled labor is far, far greater than the demand. When supply outstrips demand, it causes a price drop in labor because that commodity is now perceived as being worth less.. If you're willing to do a job for $10/hr, there are probably 50 people waiting around who would do it for $7/hr, and so forth, because those 50 people aren't employed, or are underemployed (part-time).

So even if some jobs can't be offshored - security, retail, burger-flipping, etc. - the wages for those jobs are still affected because the market is flooded with cheap labor."

Banri has so far been two characters. He is Ghost and Body Snatcher. Each girl only loves one Banri. Each Banri only loves one girl. There has been some bleeding of emotion recently, but they are still separate identities. So a triangle is too small but a quadraladeral could be argued is too large since there are only 3 bodies. Triangle seems to over simplify things.

Neither Banri is trying to make everyone happy. Both are actively pursuing their love interests the other girl be damned romantically. They don't want to hurt the other girl, but they don't care if they are hurt in their pursuit of their love."

ctesibius,britishproblems,1390937234.0,"Personally I think (professional opinion, not just a hand-wave) that Android is too much of a risk for banking applications even in non-rooted form due to the third party keyboards you mention, and screen scraping on later versions of the OS. However a rooted version introduces new hazards. If you want to break an HTTPS connection and insert your own transactions, you need to do two things. Firstly you have to break the DNS (the system that translates from a domain name like ""www.barclays.co.uk"" to an IP address like 195.69.153.161). You do that to route the bank's traffic through your own server for interception. Ok, but that will raise a security error on HTTPS - so you need to insert the certificate for your site as a trusted one as well.

Rooting an OS potentially allows both of these things to be done. *Potentially*: I'm not saying that your 3rd party image of choice has actually been nobbled. But Barclays can't tell, whereas with the standard image they can do some testing and have someone that they can hold responsible to some extent.

I should say that I'm a bit of an absolutist in security terms, and banks are moving more to using multiple factors to assess risk - for instance geographically where does your transaction seem to be coming from? Whether the phone has been rooted could become  just one more risk factor to be weighed, and it could be that if everything else is ok, they would accept a transaction from a rooted phone. However at the moment they are not rejecting rooted phones just to be awkward."

A shoe with a slight heel that exposes the top of your foot gives a longer line and is what I tend to do when wearing skirts. I found a chunky heel made by a company called Dansko. It's my best shoe. Not too high but it somehow gives the illusion of height because of it's chunkiness.

tangerinelion,cpp,1390937255.0,"    cout &lt;&lt; year""\t"" &lt;&lt; Forested""\n"";

is invalid syntax.

You can't have a variable and a string literal next to each other like that; there's no operator implied in that statement.

Note that with string literals you can have
  
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Hello "" ""World"" &lt;&lt; endl;

What you want is
 
    cout &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; ""\t"" &lt;&lt; Forested &lt;&lt; ""\n"";  // Prefer std::endl to ""\n""

Also your code has *huge* problems.  The least of which is that it will not at all do what you want, but will print out a ton of repetitive garbage.  And that's only on the condition it prints *anything* at all due to buffer flushing.

Also, it's standard practice in C++ to initialize variables with a value if they have one.  Prefer, for example, 

    float Forested = 2500.0F;

to
  
    float Forested;
    Forested = 2500; // Technically an int to float conversion here

Lastly, year should be an int not a float and the expression year++ returns a copy of the previous year.  You would prefer ++year to (year++) -- the parenthesis are completely unnecessary here.

Don't mean to be a dick, I know you just started, but getting these things straight help you understand exactly what each line does rather than just saying ""Well, this does work so I can use it."""

On top of that, customers are very price sensitive, even when they are spending big money.

What's he's saying (or at least how I interpret it) is that many sexual beings, men and women, connect their sexual desirability and their ability to please their partner with their self-worth. So, on the one hand I need the physical release of sex. On the other hand, I need to feel desired by my partner. My partner needs to want me. Rejecting sexuality *in general* may make your girlfriend feel that you are rejecting *her sexuality* and therefore *her* in specific. 

Therefore, approach the issue with caution. You should feel free to tell her how you feel about sex, but what you should NOT do is approach sex with her as a duty, as unpleasant, as a chore, or as something you do just to shut her up. You approach sex as a loving service that perhaps isn't your favorite thing, but something that is intimate and brings your partner pleasure, and therefore gives you pleasure (even if yours is non-sexual). Otherwise, she will get the message that *she* is a duty, a chore, and ought to just shut up about her needs. "

So I just decided to put it at +100 just in case and not give a fuck about fiddling with it.

Pet stores also tend to not care about the health of the puppies they sell, I was in a large store that mostly sells outdoors things but also sold some pets and one of the puppies had kennel cough and was still being shown to people, rather than getting the care it needed.

AssaultKommando,TiADiscussion,1390937521.0,"&gt;I mean, isn't this obvious? First, even on a subconscious level, if every powerful business of political figure you'd ever known had a deep voice and broad shoulders and was a man, you're going to subconsciously associate these traits with power. Meanwhile, if you grew up in a society where the women attempting to assert authority over you consisted of maybe your mom, nanny and kindergarten teacher, you're going to subconsciously associate authoritative statements by females with mothering and nannying and the domestic sphere. You don't think ingrained perceptions like this impact society's reception of males/females contending for leadership positions?

Examining the obvious often turns up surprising insight, doesn't it? I was an avowed fat hater (still am by some metrics because I still loathe fatlogic), but reading the literature on the causes of obesity has moderated my views considerably.

I'm not sure those are traits formed by subconscious association as much as they are inborn, but that's a can of worms that we can confine to the other thread.

If you grew up in a society where you were largely bossed about by women in your formative years, you'd also grow to respect female authority and be more pro-female, no? I might be reaching here, but the link you included regarding Rudman's research certainly gives some credence to that view.

I do, but I don't think they're the formidable and formalized obstacles you claim they are. Even if they don't adopt stereotypically alpha male behaviors or lack the physical preference, women seeking these places can easily position themselves as an alternative to traditional male machismo and/or demonstrate their suitability for leadership through a long history of competence. Attaining leadership isn't just about fitting into a particular mold.

&gt;But also, and perhaps more blatantly, women have been literally prohibited from owning property, voting, running for office, etc. until relatively recently in western society. In some societies, they are still prohibited from doing these things. Abrahamic religious institutions, which are some of the most influential power structures in the world, have historically prohibited (any many still prohibit) female leaders (e.g. female imams or priests). 

It's not just women. Suffrage for the common male was a relatively recent development as well; citizen was interchangeable with ""societal elite"" for the vast majority of history.

These nations are where the frontline for the battle for equality should be located, not in the columns of pseudo-blogs pandering for views.

While I agree prima facie that the Abrahamic religious bias against women in the developed world is problematic ([look what you made me do!](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=problematic)), I'm not sure it's a problem that's rooted in religion as much as it is a reactionary denial by entrenched bigots. The religion is a mere platform for their expression of sexism. Most institutions have the problem where the people holding the most outdated beliefs are the ones in the greatest position to attain and exercise authority, and this is really especially prominent in organized religion given the protracted process of advancement.

&gt;Are you sure you're not overestimating the extent to which these are fringe beliefs, though? If you use the phrase ""magic sky fairy,"" I suspect you'll agree that Christianity exerts an astonishing amount of influence over American society and politics. I haven't googled stats so correct me if you know differently, but don't a majority of Americans doubt evolution and don't a substantial plurality believe in the biblical apocalypse? The bible that prescribes those beliefs tells us that a wife should submit to her husband as the church submits to Christ; i.e., a woman should basically regard her husband as a god. Most of them won't come out and say that educating boys should be a higher priority than educating girls, but if you believe that the man should be the head of the household and the main provider for the family (do you doubt that a majority of red-staters believe this?), and if college is expensive, you do the math. 

My exposure to this fringe is limited, which my sanity is quite thankful for. I don't know how much they trickle down and I don't particularly care to check, though I do remember that the figures for belief in intelligent design and the deluge are quite depressing. I concede that while a good number of red-staters might hold these beliefs, college demographics in red strongholds seem to be reasonably even.

&gt;The homophobia hypothesis is one possibility the researchers indicated that they wish they'd tested[1]. You're right that it was an IAT, but I don't think it's unreasonable to imagine that an ingrained ""no homo"" reflex would affect subconscious reactions to images of other men. 

Fair enough. It is text-based though, so I suspect controlling for homophobia wouldn't have produced significantly different results barring some extreme cases.

&gt;Through four experiments, psychologists Laurie A. Rudman, PhD, of Rutgers, and Stephanie A. Goodwin, PhD, of Purdue University, used the Implicit Association Test to discover 204 heterosexual college students' automatic gender preferences and gender identity by asking them to associate positive and negative gender-free words with either ""men"" or ""women."" They also tested participants' self-esteem by asking them to associate those words with ""I"" or ""others.""

&gt;Amanda Marcotte is generally loathed by SJW feminists because of this[2] and a subsequent book cover that depicted a white woman nagivating the ""jungle"" of patriarchy by fleeing from black savages. However, while I grant you that she still writes for some mainstream publications, I don't see any problem with giving more scrutiny to Larry Summers's statements than Marcotte's. Larry Summers is unambiguously a member of society's power elite and, at Harvard, he helmed one of our primary gatekeeper institutions. Amanda Marcotte writes an occasional clickbaity column for Slate.

Beyond the plagiarism, she's made some very troubling comments on a number of issues in media, most notably about the [Duke lacrosse rape accusations](http://reason.com/archives/2007/04/16/last-call-for-rape-crisis-femi). I don't know about you, but when I think of toxic partisans in the mainstream that MRAs love to bash (and usually quite rightly so) Marcotte is at the top of the list. 

She's also a pretty prominent media figure representing mainstream (white) feminism, and you're rather discounting the influence that sites like Slate have. I'd rank them on par with Gawker at the least. Conversely, 
Summers was never really noted as a public intellectual with a strong mainstream presence until his [comments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers#Differences_between_the_sexes) brought a shitstorm down on him.

What is especially infuriating is that [his points](https://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html) can be reasonably supported to a degree by the literature, but in their rush to tar and feather him for his lack of political correctness the mainstream media conveniently ignored the context of his statements in favour of extracting the most offensive soundbites. Placed in context, his statements are a lot more nuanced and come across as personal speculation (congruent with his stated aim to provoke) rather than statements of absolute fact, but that's too much truth for the average bystander.

&gt;You're right that we're starting to see a turnaround in educational attainment and earning power stats among young people, particularly childless urban professionals. I will sincerely tell you that I don't wish to see men marginalized from positions of power any more than I wish to see women marginalized. I just don't think we're there yet. 

We find ourselves largely in agreement here, though I do hold the view that the influx of young female professionals should start showing its effects on the top echelons of the professions within a few decades and that further adjustment in favour of women is largely unnecessary.

What does worry me is that the way this turnaround at the expense of men and boys is *celebrated*. Boys are increasingly disillusioned and dropping out of the educational system at much higher rates, but nobody really seems to give a damn because men still dominate at the pointy end of the pyramid. That's necessarily going to reflect the education and professional trends prevalent decades ago and is in no way an accurate reflection of what's going on in universities and the school system now.

This is just a general impression on my part so you're free to take it with a pinch of salt, but if you pay careful attention to the the language used when mainstream publications speak of adjusting proportions of either sex in (higher) education, you might come away with a distinct sense of uneasiness. When organizations like the BBC imply that a further increase in female participation and scoring are great while giving throwaway mentions to decreased male scoring and retention in their milestone exams, you can't help but think there's quite a bit of unaddressed bias at work.

First of all, both LA and SF are good and worthy places, and they're better off without you. Second of all, it's hilarious when people from little states like Washington think that they know what's wrong with California and how to fix it. If your state were a country, would it be in the top 10 biggest economies in the world? No? Then maybe you're out of your league a little. Third of all, when you generalize about SF and LA, you are literally generalizing about a group of people more than twice as populous as this entire state. Just from those two areas! Hell, just from LA! If you've met 100 Californians in your life, you don't know jack about Californians. You're ignorant, and it's showing. Fuck your prejudiced bullshit.

As for the game play its a platformer that reminds me a bit of Rayman Legends. You have 3 characters with different abilities you can swap out instantly. Each area has several environmental puzzles you will need to swap between characters to complete. The combat is pretty generic, but each character levels up and learns new abilities, so that makes up for early hack and slash. 

The boss fights are impressive and memorable. Just figuring out how to defeat a boss is fun by itself. It also seems like its a large game with a ton of area to cover. At 20.00 its worth owning. Its a game I don't mind firing up when I'm looking for something to scratch that platformer itch.

As any scientist or science educator will agree, science is not the result. Science is the process. Science *is* critical thinking and the scientific method. This means that if we started over with no knowledge of the universe whatever, we would eventually rediscover all of science - as long as we discovered the method.

A show that displayed stars and black holes would be interesting, but that's it. A show that explains how on Earth people realized that stars are very distant suns and how there's an unbroken dialog from before Aristotle to Copernicus to Galileo to Kepler to Newton to Mitchell to Einstein to Schwarzschild to Lorentz to Chandrasekhar to Hawking, is a better and more important show.

You are right God gave us the tools. But your analogy fails because God did not give us a gun, which we can agree is a tool predisposed to doing something harmful. God gave us a hammer. A hammer can be used to build a house. A hammer can be used as a weapon. A hammer is neutral."

The CX500 was the one with the most uplift, but suffered from turbo lag which apparently made it a bit of a handful in bends.

I didn't cut my hair to make a political statement, but it's perceived as such by a lot of people. Then again, I have very little use for gender norms, and I kind of like to poke people who are easily perturbed about this sort of thing. So maybe it was a subliminal political statement."

You can tell the consulting firm that you'd like to get your year-end bonus - if you do get one this summer - and that it's important for you to honor one year of your employment contract (in banking you actually do sign a minimum one-year employment clause for the two year analyst program)



I was in your position once - I jumped from investment banking to private equity after exactly one year of banking. My boss at the time wasn't thrilled but he understood that it was a great offer in a field I ultimately wanted to work in, and for that he was supportive. Also, if you want to end up in consulting no one will fault you for going into the field after one year of accounting vs. two. If anything, it speaks volumes to your commitment to breaking into the consulting world."

Spikemaw,AskMen,1390938135.0,"""Pansexual is a more exclusive term."" I feel like someone that identified as pansexual would say the same thing about the term ""bisexual."" They would say that bisexual implies two genders not two sexualities (I feel like if you asked most people on the street what bisexual meant, they would answer ""someone that is attracted to both genders, though that obviously is a statement about an old school perception of solid gender dichotomy). I mean, why would pansexuals use the term if they weren't think bisexual was not inclusive enough? I'm not saying bisexuals aren't welcome to have a more inclusive definition, or that they are wrong in that definition.

I also feel like your explanation of pansexual is strange in that you are trying to exclude pansexuals from bisexuality by somehow saying ""they don't even care about gender, I do"" while earlier saying you're attracted to all gender identities. I think that it's impossible for a person to not perceive and process overt physical gender identity/pronoun choices or lack thereof, and that whether someone cares about gender wouldn't change their basic identity (again as an outsider with no horse in this ""race"") as pan or bi, as long as they are interested in all genders, what is the tangible difference? I feel like the two terms are at best synonymous.

The cooked grains (I assume stuff like quinoa, millet, bulger wheat, other stuff I've heard vegans talk about) is alright, but should be used sparingly. The bulk of his diet should be vegetables and fruits, with some beans or other protein sources (I looooove tofu). Vegetables and fruits by themselves are so low in calories that you will pretty much never gain weight off of them no matter how much you eat; it's the sugars and refined carbs that will get you.

An average meal for me is just a veggie sandwich, with cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, peppers, jalapenos, olives, spinach, and some low-calorie condiment like mustard, on whole-wheat bread. It's about 300 calories for one sandwich, depending on the bread. I also have burritos a lot, with a bunch of veggies and beans and stuff all cooked together and rolled up in tortillas.

andjok,DebateAnarchism,1390938224.0,"&gt; so the fact that not everyone has the initial startup capital to invest and start a business (that money came from somewhere) doesn't factor into the equation at all?

Sure, it sucks that under our current system it can be difficult for the average person to acquire start up capital, and I don't claim to defend the system.  However, with any sort of system of enterprise, whether free or heavily state controlled, startup capital is necessary.  In order to incentivise people to put their capital to use, whether it be the workers themselves or capitalists, there typically needs to be a potential reward for those who risk using capital for a venture.

&gt;and that initial startup capital goes literally nowhere if there aren't people willing to do the work.

It goes both ways.  Capital allows labor to be much more productive, but capital cannot be productive by itself.  Until the day that we have robots capable of maintaining themselves without any human effort.

&gt;ok, but that's not the scenario that was laid out for us to discuss.

Not the original scenario of this post, but I was clarifying a comment made by /u/egbhw up higher.

&gt;and either way, that just demonstrates to me how in a capitalist system, everyone is put at risk and everyone is living precariously, which just reinforces my reasons for opposing it.

I'm not sure why completely getting rid of the capitalist mode of production necessarily fixes this.  People generally have to be productive in order to survive, and in order to improve their productivity, they can use capital.  If they consume more capital than what they are able to produce with it, they have operated at a loss.  That seems to be a potential risk whether the firm is run by capitalists or the workers.  In a world with only worker owned organizations, I don't see how the workers wouldn't have to worry about having enough resources and capital to keep their organization running.

Now, you could argue that free of statist corporate style capitalism, it would be easier for the average person to start and run an organization with their fellow workers, and I would probably agree with you.  You might also also argue that people would be more likely to give freely to each other and help each other out through mutual aid, and that's great.  But I think it's a bit utopian to say that in your system people could start whatever operation they want without risk.

&gt;if the business fails, it is not guaranteed that the workers will get paid

Again, I'm not sure how you could have a society where it is guaranteed that anyone will get paid or get the resources they need.  Also, in a capitalist business model, the workers in a new business typically get paid before the investors make their money back.  That's my point.

&gt;and even if they do, the fact that they no longer have a job means that that last paycheck has to last them until they find a new one.

That's true.  But if they came out of a failing business, they still came out ahead of the business owner, who actually lost money trying to start the business.  Now, of course under the current order many entrepreneurs and investors are fabulously wealthy and could afford to take the hit (most reasonable people wouldn't start a business if they couldn't afford the potential loss anyways), but there are many small business owners who barely make ends meet as well."

Ampharos has astoundingly good coverage, because it hits almost everything for neutral damage and can clock whatever it doesn't with SE HP Fire. Fairy types are immune to dragon and resist dark, so even if you face off against the only pokemon that resists both of your STABS and isn't weak to fire, aka Dedenne, it still won't be useful. Dragon pulse BP 85x1.5 (STAB) = 122.5, so dragon pulse and thunderbolt both do more than a supereffective HP Dark. If something does resist your STABs and is neutral to HP dark, your STABS still hit it harder with a resisted hit (122.5x.5=66.25 vs 60 BP for HP.)

Protect seems like a strange choice, Ampharos doesn't need protect to mega-evolve, in fact that would be a bad plan because it becomes slower and gains weaknesses when it megavolves--it's not like you have leftovers. Volt switch can net you a free switch in, since Ampharos is slow, Thunder Wave is always useful, and Cotton Guard is gonna keep your Ampharos alive longer despite its lack of speed, though you can breed for Agility instead if you plan to make your Ampharos more useful by getting it HP fire anyway."

ha_ya,OCD,1390938340.0,"You're not putting anything on hold. Delaying is dealing with the real problem: the OCD.

Delaying does help me, at least when it comes to irrational fear-type obsessions. It's a type of ERP, in a way, because you're basically deciding to expose yourself for a period of time before deciding that something is risky or harmful. And by exposing yourself and finding that nothing bad happens, you're reinforcing your confidence in your rational mind.

The obsession or compulsion won't go away after __ days, but it will get exponentially weaker.

Kesshisan,Buddhism,1390938546.0,"Before your son learned to run he had to walk.  Before he learned to walk he had to crawl.  He took things in baby steps (excuse the pun, I couldn't resist.)  Why not you, too?

Start small.  I suggest practicing like this:  The next time you are driving, and you see a stoplight ahead, don't accelerate to beat the red light.  If it turns yellow and you can safely stop, don't speed through the intersection, stop.  If you see the stop light and desire to get through it before it turns red, you will be disappointed when it turns red and forces you to stop.  However, if you let go of desire, whether or not it turns red and whether or not you stop at it will have no real affect on you.

I did a speech on Buddhism for a college level public speaking class recently.  In it I discussed desire and while talking about desire, I pulled out a Snickers and started eating it.  I [rhetorically] asked the audience if they wanted some (of course they did!)  But the point I was driving home was that they didn't know about the Snickers bar 30 seconds prior, and thus did not desire it 30 seconds ago.  There was almost zero difference between their lives before and after they saw the Snickers, yet they wanted something started suffering due to desire.^*  This is very simplified, but it's a starting point.  The fewer expectations, the better you will feel about any situation.

^* I had a bag of candy that I handed out to the class afterwards.  :)

And while we're on the subject of expectations, impermanence can be applied here.  One day your son will pass on.  This day may not be today, may not be tomorrow, and may very well be after you pass on first.  But it remains that your son existence, like everything else, is not permanent.  I have a girlfriend, and despite being together for over a year and making plans for the future together, each and every day I wake up and consider ""What would happened if we broke up?""  I also consider ""What would happen if she died?"" and a myriad of things as well.  When I consider the fact that there is no great cosmic obligation for my relationship with my girlfriend to continue, and that means it could end at any moment for a myriad of reasons, it reduces my expectations.  Fewer/Less expectations reduces my desires, and also lets me contemplate life without.  Even when things get rough in our relationship, knowledge that we're not required to be together helps me to appreciate being in the relationship to begin with.  Perhaps you should try applying this to your son.  To put it bluntly:  Your son could die at any moment.  Appreciate the fact that you have a son.  Appreciate the fact that he's able to spend any time with you at all.  There may be a time when you can't...there will be a time when you can't.  Appreciate that which is here, now.

Good luck, friend.  :)"

CaspianX2,politicalfactchecking,1390938548.0,"Your fact is more deceptive, because it fails to take into account property value. If you take out a loan for a car, you may owe more money than you have in your bank account, but the car you took out the loan for has value too. Same goes for a house. And as for the other big thing people commonly get loans for, college, it is often (though not always) an investment in a future career.

This paternalistic nonsense failed to consider that the problem was that poor people in my city lived in food deserts -- they had no reliable transportation and grocery stores were three blocks away. And they usually worked two jobs and didn't have time to cook. Or lived in an apartment without a functioning kitchen, or didn't have reliable appliances. Or appliances at all. And forget cookware. Hell, and my city is hot as fuck. It gets over 100 degrees for months at a time. You try living in a house without A/C, and then some paternalistic fuck tells you that you need to *cook* your food with an *oven* in a hot house after getting off your 12-hour shift on your feet at a hotel across town.

This attitude -- that poor people are stupid, is judgmental as shit. I grew up around poor people. I am a poor person. No matter how much I make, that mentality will never go away. I know my roots. Poor people aren't stupid. They're out of time, out of money, and at their wit's end putting up with bullshit barriers paternalistic rich assholes and policy makers put in their way to ""teach"" them how to be less of a failure.

While that is true, I think the new 52's Action Comics said it best.  ""Clark"" is who he is.  As a super powered being, he doesn't really have any physical limits. He can hold his breath for hours, dive to crushing depths, take a dip in the sun to recharge, and much more.  He is Clark because he has to be.  Writing never comes easy, and so by being Clark Kent: Reporter, he is challanging himself mentally in a way that can never truly be mastered with even more difficulty because he has to do it in a way that awakens the public to important issues.

""Superman""  Is all of this rolled up into package.  It's the sum of the parts fighting for those who are faced with something they most likely wouldn't survive much less beat.

Read a comic, and wherever you start, in the next 2-3 issues when Superman faces something that is insanely strong, or non living, he always says something like ""good, now I don't have to hold back.""  Think of that.  He's so powerful, he has to judge how much strength to use in everything he does, and only enough to incapacitate who he's fighting. It's not about not killing.  It's about helping those who need it.  From being hurt, hurting themselves, and others.

Batman said it best in one of the New 52 Batman/Superman issues.  He likes Clark, and is afraid of him because he chooses to be Clark.  It's the thing that fuels everything he does in any way he does it."

One thing I did when I flew international was take multiple flights, using a discount airline for part of the journey. For example, I wanted to get to Paris in July, ~$1100 roundtrip. I flew to Dublin ~$600 (on United or somethign) and used Ryanair (~$120-150) to fly to a satellite airport for a cheap train ride into the city. Saved close to $300 on that. Careful to pack light and not check bags if you go this route.

oneeyedgoat41,AdviceAnimals,1390938816.0,"Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to find these but only one was actually relevant:

I was unfortunately only able to access the abstract for the Kenrick, Groth, Trost, and Sadalla article, so I do not know what the “24 traits” the study surveyed people on are. If chastity and selectiveness are among them then that is definitely something to think about, although self-reported requirements for different types of relationships, while helpful, are not enough to distinguish between what is biologically programmed and what is learned through one’s environment, so that is also something to bear in mind.

Here are why the others were not relevant:

The Stone and Shackelford article doesn’t support what you said. It supports what you said in low socioeconomic environments but finds it isn’t as strong in other environments.

The Schmitt and Shackelford article addresses only what men and women are more likely to prefer or go after in terms of short-term and long-term mating. It says nothing about what mating strategies men prefer the women they mate with to have.

The Li, Valentine, and Patel article discusses mate preference for men and women relating to a bunch of factors (Physical attractiveness, social status, kindness, creativity, liveliness.) Chastity and pickiness were not among them.

The Shackelford, Schmitt, and Buss article was multicultural, which was a good start, except that it surveyed people on four “Universal dimensions” of mate preference for mena nd women, none of which included selectiveness or chastity.

Again, I am not saying you are wrong (I do not know enough to say either way,) and I actually think your idea makes a fair bit of sense, but spouting things as if they were fact when you have nothing more than “well this kinda sounds right” can be a dangerous exercise.

Machines are usually not accurate in the calories they say so don't believe them. Something I read in a reddit comment was that you burn 1 cal per kg per km. So if you weigh 60 kg and your run 1km you burned 60 calories. If you ran 500m you burn 30 cals. There was no source in the comment, so it's not necessarily true, but it might be a good starting point if you want to estimate how many calories you do burn, so you can be as exact as possible."

Worrying about how it might fail, is energy spent on your relationship that is weakening instead of strengthening it.  If you want it to last, take that energy and put it into strengthening the relationship and self-improvement.

tangerinelion,buildapc,1390938917.0,"A linux live disc is going to give him access to both drives in their current state.

Which means a new 1TB HDD will be unformatted.  Most of the time writing to an NTFS partition works just fine in linux, but it's not guaranteed to work.  In the case of a new drive you have to take the additional step of partitioning and formatting the 1TB disk before you mount it and copy over the data from the SSD.

If the SSD worked in booting up on the new equipment then I would use the easy transfer wizard that Windows has to create a backup of my settings and whatnot and store that on the 1TB disk.  Since I'd be in Windows anyway, I know I can format the 1TB disk as NTFS correctly.  From there all that would need to be done is to reinstall Windows on the SSD, formatting the partition so it's a fresh install, and then do a restore from the wizard.  Programs would not magically come back, but a fresh install of Windows will always be better than one that was originally on different hardware.  You remove tons of references to hardware that doesn't exist (in principle it shouldn't be trying to use them anyway, but Microsoft relies on 3rd party vendors to write drivers so you can't guarantee anything in practice).

Of course if the SSD won't boot on new hardware, then your idea is probably the simplest once you have the 1TB disk partitioned and formatted.  Using a G4L (Ghost 4 Linux) live disc may even be better as it does a complete copy of the partition rather than whatever files you choose/remember.  After using G4L you would start from doing a fresh install on the SSD, installing your programs, and putting back whatever files you wanted.  G4L may end up creating a partition on the 1TB disk that's only as big as the SSD so after that you would want to delete the partition on the 1TB disk and repartition it however you like (probably one 1TB partition)."
thatskyegirl,LongDistance,1390938924.0,"Maybe just a little bit? From the sound of it, the whole spend the whole night thing seemed more like an offhand joke.

&gt;he'd planned a few days back 

Then I don't think he intended for you to take the playful comment seriously.

I understand how even the simplest things can be a total bummer, and sometimes fights ensue. But maybe in this case it's best to just go to him and say, ""I'm sorry Sweetie. I know you had plans to go out, and I guess I wanted you to stay so badly that I took your comment seriously. It's not because I don't want you going out; it's because I miss you so darn much. Forgive me?"" That way he can comfort you and try to plan things a little more accordingly next time.

Don't worry. Little arguments like this are nothing compared to all the good times on Skype/calls/texts and what have you. Just look forward to making happy memories together. Wishing you luck!

The first time? Vulnerable. Gut wrenchingly vulnerable. You're about to start the sex show, your enjoyment isn't a priority, and if you fuck it up or dare to come first you get to go back to the single bench. Possibly forever.

&gt;But women are expected to have small tight perfect neat pink little pussies that don't smell or taste like much

I gotta say, I've only ever heard that from women. In fact there was a thread on here not long ago where someone asked what kind of vaginas guys like, and the overwhelming response was that we generally don't care, unless it's *really* bad.

&gt;researching cause and treatment is a more pro-active responsible route, in addition to being a compassionate partner.

That's along the right route, but I'd say the key is edumacation. If we teach teenagers that men are in fact not walking dildoes then maybe some women would have less unrealistic expectations and men would feel less pressure.


Never underestimate the ease with which you could crush a man's self esteem once you've seen him naked or slept with him.

SoyBeanExplosion,Christianity,1390939065.0,"&gt;God commands us to not do things because they are wrong.

Are you familiar with the Euthyphro Dilemma?

&gt; Socrates asks whether the gods love the pious because it is the pious, or whether the pious is pious only because it is loved by the gods (10a). Socrates and Euthyphro both accept the first option: surely the gods love the pious because it is the pious. But this means, Socrates argues, that we are forced to reject the second option: the fact that the gods love something cannot explain why the pious is the pious (10d). Socrates points out that if both options were true, they together would yield a vicious circle, with the gods loving the pious because it is the pious, and the pious being the pious because the gods love it. And this in turn means, Socrates argues, that the pious is not the same as the god-beloved, for what makes the pious the pious is not what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved. After all, what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved is the fact that the gods love it, whereas what makes the pious the pious is something else (9d-11a). Thus Euthyphro's theory does not give us the very nature of the pious, but at most a quality of the pious (11ab).

Essentially the problem is that you are saying that God says that to kill is wrong because some outside force has made it wrong and he is merely explaining this to us. That's not a maximally powerful God. And yet if it is the other way around, that it is evil to kill *because* God has decreed it so, is he not making totally arbitrary ethical decisions?

&gt;Unless he directly steps in and stops someone from doing it, there’s no way to simultaneously let people choose their actions and not let them choose their actions.

I was questioning the fundamental justice behind granting us the ability to choose between A and B with the knowledge that the consequence of choosing B is punishment. Surely that's not really free will at all, if the only way to act without being punished is to act in the way that God decrees.

&gt;The view the Bible expresses is more that humans are corrupted by evil than that they were created bad. Like look at what Paul says in Romans 7:20 – “ And if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it, but the sin that is dwelling in me.”

The Catholic church believes in original sin though. We are all born sinful and corrupt according to them. I know you may not be Catholic but it's one interpretation.

&gt;He did! He made a world where there was only good, and had made it so there was only the potential for evil at all.

Kind of brings me back to my original set of problems though. I need to have another think about this and I'll get back to you later!"

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390939158.0,"I am interested to see what others have to say as well. 

And I couldn't agree more about not taking life lightly, and appreciating my body and not taking it for granted. I can't believe, sometimes, the things I see people willingly do to their healthy bodies.

I agree with you that having children and thinking about what you are passing on is something to think about, and **not** to be taken lightly.

This is a view I have actually changed my mind on.

My mother has a dominant genetic mutation. The condition's heritability is 50%. It doesn't present the same in everyone, though everyone has the same mutation. Some people are mildly hindered, but it can also be fatal on it own, and it increases risk for cancer.

I used to think my parents were at best thoughtless, and at worst selfish to have children. Even though I am one of those children. None of us have it, luckily. *(My autoimmune comes from Dad's side, but things were so poorly diagnosed that it is only now, looking back on my deceased Grandmother's -born 1913- life we realized what her issues were.)*

I got up the balls to ask Mom about it when I was a teenager and a geneticist was checking us out to be certain we didn't just have extremely mild prestations.

She told me basically what I said above. The only other thing she said was, ""I knew you and your siblings were supposed to exist.""
 
At the time, I really couldn't understand what she meant and I wrote it off as ""one of mom's rationalizations because she won't admit she's wrong.""

It hit home though, years later.

I was working for this very, very rich family. Good looking people, very healthy. Not particularly nice though. Horribly selfish, and cruel when they could get away with it. And they had kids, because they could support them. And their kids were raised to be, pretty objectively horrible people. They paid me well though, and I couldn't have gotten through school without their employment.

At that point I was pretty sure I was a better parent than they were. But there is still adoption, of course.

Then I met this really, really, stupid family. Also good health, very active, and not at all mean. But definitely not clever people. Life was difficult for them in many ways. And they also had kids,  good kids, but not bright. And they struggled for it.

And in that moment, it clicked for me.

I am a bright person. I am an empathetic person. I am logical and quick witted and enjoy a very wide range of academic pursuits. I am physically much stronger (as in can lift heavy things) than anyone else my size I know. I work hard, my endurance is incredible. I am patient. Those are good qualities that I can pass on and teach.

Other people will keep passing on their good traits, as well as their bad.

But no one else can pass on my good traits. 

edit typos and such

EDIT 2:

On the genetic note: Many heritable conditions caused by genetic mutations would still occur in the population, even if no one with them ever reproduced. For example, my mother's condition, even though it has 50% heritability, inherited cases are still only roughly 50% of all cases. *(Both stats are actually about 50, I can pull them up if people think I'm full of it.)* This is because this mutation is something that happens randomly as well.

Such is, in my understanding from undergrad level genetics, *again, can pull up more info if relevant)* the case with many mutations. 

They are randomly occurring as well as passed down."

Went two or three months tobacco free and then I lighted a couple of fags whilst drinking. Since then I occasionally light a cigarette, but only one or two every couple of weeks or so.

That way I don't have the feeling I have an unhealthy habit I can't get rid of and at the same time I don't feel the pressure of being bound to a strict rule.

Not smoking at all is the healthiest decision of all, of course, but this way I don't think I'm harming my body very much and also not harming my mind with fear of weakness.

kiwirish,Rowing,1390939241.0,"As both a miler and a rower, I can sympathise with both parties.

Running the distance of 1 mile to me is the hardest distance to run, if you're doing it properly. It is too short to pace yourself to a victory, but too long to just sprint the whole thing, so the race becomes a big mind game. You have to plan whether to run ahead and assert a mental dominance, or stick with pack and pounce on everyone else's fatigue. Keeping in mind that it is a constant battle between aerobic and anaerobic efforts. The last 400m of that mile absolutely suck, you're running out of oxygen, your legs are absolutely burning, and yet this is the time when you're supposed to go faster. By the time you cross the finish-line you don't even care that you PBed at 4.07, you just want to collapse and fall asleep.

This is similar to rowing, though a 2k still allows you to stay aerobic until the very end. The first mile of the 2k can be done at a decent stroke rate but high pressure. The agony of the last 400m is the same, but overall I'll choose a 6.35 2k over a 4.07 mile any day.

Amonette2012,aion,1390939257.0,"Battleping, WTFast and similar software

Greetings Daeva,

Due to continuous improvements in our systems and procedures, we’ve made some changes to our rules on Battleping and other such software. In sort, we will no longer be allowing people to use these tools to connect to our servers. While we understand this will be upsetting and frustrating to some players, we have several reasons for this change.

Security Reasons


We’ve noticed an increase in account theft from people using such software. While using this software, this also increases problems while dealing with these cases as this tool will adjust your IP and change your location. Meaning we’ll be unable to assist you properly in such situations if this software is used as this security risk has been created by yourself. Remember, this software will force your internet traffic through a third party and while this may be fine for some players, you’re also giving this third party a chance to look at all the information you provide.

Interference with anti-bot technology

We’ve received a lot of feedback on the bot situation in game that is helping us analysing the current situation. Due to this, we're able to continuously develop and adjust anti-bot systems.
However, one of the side effects of this is programs that are hiding your true identity; we were able to track several professional bots that are using such software. By adjusting our systems you may be caught in this list and considered as such. For your own protection, these programs should not be used.

Generally not supported with the T&amp;C

While this has always been the situation, we have tolerated such software to date, however with the recent changes and increases we’ve seen, we have been forced to follow this with a lot more strictness than before.

We understand a lot of people use these tools to lower the ping they’re having in game and this being taken away will upset people. However, we’re also constantly improving our servers to increase performance for this matter and we would like to get to a stage where such programs are not needed anyway.
While we understand this is a large change for some players, we hope you’ll understand the reasoning for this and support us with this update. There are always downsides to any change, however the upside is the introduction of our new anti-bot technology and we feel that having bots removed from the servers will make this worth it."

I suppose that would depend on the individual haha. But on a hypothetical 'blank slate' person one must be aware that all humans are *capable* of murder given the opportunity. The typical Christian view is that we tend towards sin without the guidance of God to help us, so I suppose from that perspective it's *more* likely he would sin and kill the man than not. It's difficult talking in such hypotheticals though, because it bears little semblance to reality."

trackdecthlete,loseit,1390939425.0,"Personal trainer here. I have clients ranging from wanting to lose +250 lbs to toning up. 

Number one thing you can do and be physically active whether it's at a gym or in daily life. Try doing things you enjoy. 

Another thing to do is learn how to lift weights properly. Doing 3 sets of 15-20 repetitions will not make you bulky, and will in turn increase your lean muscle mass, which in effect helps you burn more calories by just being alive. (Muscles use energy in the form of calories to function, hence the more you have the higher your metabolism).

Lastly, and I'm hesitant to suggest this to some one who may be impressionable or take this in the complete wrong direction, is you have to be strict about your diet. You have to be honest about what you are eating. When you don't have much to lose, it's those last few pounds where nutrition is so key. Focus on lean proteins (chicken, fish), greens, veggies, fruits, etc.  Small changes make a big difference. Cut out sweets and be sure to eat at least 1500-1700 calories of quality food.

Compatibility, chemistry, a desire to please, communication - all of those things are more important in sex than size, taste, smell, shape, etc.

I totally agree that edumacation is key, and right off the bat at a young age.  Teenagers also need to be taught the variety in how their privates can look, and how important again, things like communication are.  It's still very much a give and take interaction in sex between men and women, and that's unrealistic and hurtful to both.

I broke probation and went to jail for 3 months, so I had to drop out of college. I was allowed to move a county over upon release, but had to continue commuting to probation meetings. I then became addicted to other things that wouldn't turn up on bi monthly drug tests. I overdosed the day I got off probation. refused rehab. Then I decided to leave everything and everyone I knew, and just left my apartment one day. I was gone for a year and a half traveling the U.S. and South America and fell in love with life, and finally found my own purpose. I moved back Austin in 2011 and applied to college. Got in.

bertrussell,AskScienceDiscussion,1390939542.0,"I am not entirely clear what you define as ""soft psychology"", and whether or not you're friend is just defining a distinction?

Many people I have argued with (on a variety of subjects) simply use a form of the ""no true scotsman"" argument to define the problem they are rallying against. For example, if you were to define a set of ""soft psychology"" practices and prove that at least one aspect of that is properly scientific, would that disprove the whole theory or would it simply be stated as ""not soft psychology""?

There are a lot of problems with the scientific community coming to light lately, from ghost authorship, sponsored authorship, fraudulent methods, non-scientific experimental design, etc. People outside the scientific community are starting to take notice.

Talk to your friend. Come up with a commonly understood definition o science. Test the subject matter against that definition. If at least part of it meets the criteria, then all that can be said is that at least part of soft psychology is scientific.

Painting things with such broad strokes isn't helpful, nor is it very much in the ""spirit"" of science (which looks to define things more precisely, not more broadly)."

Sure, they get great holidays, but a lot of that is still spent in the classroom, amd outside of term time every day taken off is unpaid. The pay where I live isn't bad, but it's not really enough either, because it's a tough life. Both my mum and sister love teaching, but they both say it's a very demanding job.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1390939667.0,"I'm in that thread, just FYI.

I've talked about it before, but I grew up on the dole. The barriers people put up to get on the dole are *unreal*. You have to stand in line, you can't do it online or over the phone to ""prevent fraud."" Of course, the offices are nowhere near a bus line and never open when you have time off from work. So it's not exactly uncommon to lose your job to get to the food stamp office. Oh, and you have to tote your kids along with you. And stand in the hot sun, because the office isn't big enough.

And once you're on the dole, there's so many goddamn *rules*. You can't use it in drive thrus or restaurants. This is because policy makers and rich people decided poor people are fucking stupid, and they want to ""teach"" us to cook our own food. They won't pay for reliable appliances, cookware, housing with appliances, or A/C (it regularly gets over 100 for months at a time in my town, *you* try baking in a house without A/C because you got the electricity shut off -- or you have a swamp cooler). And if you spent 12 hours on your feet cleaning a hotel, then taking the bus home, you're supposed to cook. Did I mention that none of the poorest neighborhoods have grocery stores anywhere close? Try three blocks away. Yeah, grocery shopping is really fun on the bus.

Once you get to the store, you can't chose low fat or low calorie foods. Don't ask me why. If it's not food, you can only have certain brands. Probably because Pfizer or someone paid the state for the privilege of forcing poor slobs to buy their overpriced shit. Want the generic pack of 5 toothbrushes for $6? Too fucking bad. You can only get the individual Crest $5 toothbrushes. Deal with it.

And if you want your kids to get free lunches and breakfasts they *have to* there on time. Bus was late? Junior's going to starve. Boss switched your shift at the last minute? Junior's going to starve. Stuck in traffic? Junior's going to starve. Not that junior wants to eat the free food. Hamburgers, mystery meat, french fries, apples that were picked sometime when Reagan was president. Want a salad? What the fuck do you think this is? A Hilton?

*Every. Single. Person.* on the dole bitches about the dole. Because it sucks. The last thing you want do to is get yourself in a situation to have to apply for more. Hell, there were plenty of people eligible for assistance in my neighborhood that didn't get it, because the process of getting it was fucking insane. Nobody had time for that shit. Oh, and you can't forget all the judgment. People not on the dole judge you for being on the dole. People on the dole judge you for being on the dole. There's always a way to be poor wrong.

I wanted to crawl into a hole and die everytime mom wiped out the stamps at the grocery store, because I could *feel* the waves of hatred come from every person behind us. It's why we shopped in the ghetto, even though the food was more expensive and shittier -- because less people judged us there, they were all on the dole too (and they had signs on the aisles about which foods you could use your stamps on, and which you couldn't).

So tired of reddit's bullshit about poor people. Yeah, they're all retards. Being poor is your just desserts for being stupid. Especially your kids, those little fuckers were just stupid infants, so punish them. Put up all sorts of barriers to aid, shame the shit out of all of them.

Secondly, calories and vitamins aren't all that are required for good health.  A twinkie diet would lack sufficient protein, fiber, phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals _not_ in multivitamins, and would be high on the glycemic index.

TMA-3,socialanxiety,1390939797.0,"Freshman here at a university with ~60,000 students--last semester my SA ruined every aspect of my life and made doing the smallest things incredibly difficult to the point that it was exhausting and I couldn't channel any mental energy into academics. Ended up becoming depressed and stuff, grades were terrible, failed 2 classes.

This semester I started taking a medication to help with my anxiety, but all it's done is make me tired and apathetic toward life all the time. I went to all my classes the first week back but skipped literally every class for the past two weeks. I just slept and acted lazy all day and I just stopped caring about everything. I didn't feel like going to class, partly because my SA has actually gotten worse and partly because I just lost all interest in class overall."

Or if you wanted something longer and less downbeat, you could have a longer series covering the time period from [The Battle of Sudden Flame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagor_Bragollach) up until the final overthrow of Morgoth.

There's a lot of great, climactic moments to be had, most notably the fall of Gondolin and the sacking of Menegroth . But aside from those, the stories set during this period are mostly smaller, more human ones. Running and hiding in the depths of the forest, trying desperately to fight back as Morgoth slowly engulfs the land.

So aside from a few epic climaxes that could serve as season finales, the show is economically feasible to film. No more expensive than Game of Thrones, at any rate, though that show hardly counts as cheap."

Ask engaging questions about why you are doing particular things, then go home and research it.  If there is any inconsistency, they are making things up and are potentially putting your body in harms way.

Learn about their background while working out. Personal training is as much about working out as it is meeting some one new. You're going to spend time with them, so get to know them!

Be vocal about your wants and needs. We're not mind readers. We understand that the vast majority of people want to lose weight, but why? If you're not enjoying something, tell them. You're paying for a service and you should enjoy it. (Obviously some things are hard and won't be enjoyable, but as long as you see rationale behind it to reach a particular goal it's ok!)

Don't move on to the next progression of a move if you do not feel comfortable with the basics. Working out is like learning a language. You cannot form sentences if you do not know words. Likewise, you cannot do box jumps/cleans/[insert olympic lift here] without knowing how to do a bodyweight squat properly.

Lastly, make sure they are accountable. Write down the metrics you want to keep track of: weight, BF%, hip/waist/arm/thigh measurements or anything else. Every few weeks they should be going back to those tests to see how you are progressing and reaffirming that what you are doing in the gym is working.

""Neckbeard"" today means what ""nerd"" typically used to mean. The obsessive, detail-oriented qualities that once were defining aspects of being a nerd have shifted to the ""neckbeard"" stereotype. Personally I find it pretty fucking offensive as those are the qualities that define truly being a nerd - deep-diving into games systems, filling pages upon pages with well-researched and cross-referenced campaign notes, and getting into heated debates over topics that are seemingly inconsequential to the outside observer. 

Contrast that with kids used to League of Legends coming to FNM complaining that any creature bigger than a 4/4 is broken, playing one game and one game only yet still somehow having the expertise to trash other games (Pathfinder sucks/4E sucks, it's always one or the other), and talking about how much of a gamer they are because they waste 6 hours a day playing Battlefield, one of three games they own for their decal-laden console.

I don't want to go into details because it is their story not mine, but i will say it was of the getting drunk and peeing in public variety and the getting busted by angry parents the day of the 18th birthday with a 17 year old girlfriend variety. 

The catch-22 is i knew these guys as friends and so i was close enough to the situation to have my own independent opinion, but i have no real reason to believe a new guy i just met, so i probably would not date a stranger on the registry. These two friends would be the only exception if we liked each other that way, which we don't.

I travel a lot and live in Europe, so i would not date a guy with a felony because you can't get a long term visa for where i live with one or even a tourist visa for some countries with one.  So even if i found his version of events plausible, if he lived in a state where statutory or peeing in public was a felony and not a misdemeanor, then it just logistically would not work, either."

Lunch - get food to go and eat in my room or just skip it

Dinner - get food to go and eat in my room or just go late at night when it's mostly empty so I'm not surrounded by huge groups of people eating together and I don't feel self-conscious sitting at a table by myself.

I try to keep a supply of nutritious snacks and stuff in my dorm so I can eat in the event that my anxiety imprisons me inside and makes me miss a meal, but when I run out...then the shit gets real.

10thMuse,SkincareAddiction,1390940343.0,"I have horrible, thick, dark hair and have had awful trouble with bikini waxes in the past.  It doesn't need to be that way, you just need to find the right combination of the best esthetician/salon and the best after care routine.  

I tend to get more ingrowns if my hair isn't grown out enough when I go in (must be minimum of 1/4"") or if the esthetician isn't doing it properly.  If the person isn't taking their time and doing a good job, or if the wax isn't good, hairs will break off instead of being pulled out... this leads to MAJOR bumps &amp; ingrowns. I find that the healing/ingrown issue is depends about 80% on who does it/how it's done and 20% on how I take care of it after.


I've never been to a European Wax Center, and I don't know if they are all the same, but the lady that does my waxing said that she specifically doesn't recommend them due to how fast they try to get people in and out (she said it's usually 15-20 minutes for a Brazilian).  For me, a Brazilian takes an hour and is a bit more expensive than EWC, but each strip is done carefully.  She uses two types of wax (mostly soft wax with strips, around the more ""delicate"" areas she uses a hard pull-off wax). At the end the last 15 or so minutes are her going back over with tweezer and a little lancet thing and *gently* getting rid of any ingrowns she can see that have already developed and getting rid of any hairs that broke off close to the surface.  If your esthetician is just doing a quick job and then your out the door, find someone new!


Post-waxing, starting 24 hours later, I use a little exfoliater mit each time I shower.  The first couple days I'm a bit gentle, after than I exfoliate the hell out of the whole area.  I find the mit is easier than a sugar scrub to make sure I'm thorough.  After the shower I use [THIS EARTHLY BODY MIRACLE OIL](http://www.earthlybody.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=12) which seems to really cut down on overall redness, inflamation, and ingrowns.

ialsohaveadobro,NetflixBestOf,1390940345.0,"There are hundreds of movies out there that I have at least some interest in seeing.  I can't watch them all anytime soon, so I have to narrow that list down toa manageable number. In order to narrow down which ones I should watch, I have little to go on unless I want to spend hours and hours researching each one when I'd rather just pick the one that looks good to me at the moment. 
  
If I'm on Netflix,  what I have to go on is the poster and the blurb. If the poster--the most ubiquitous marketing image the distributors saw fit to attach to the film in order to convey eBay it was like to the audience they expected to like it--makes it look annoying to me, then I'm probably going to just move on to the next option. Because,  like I said,  there are hundreds of viable options.  
  
I'm very sorry if that for some reason personally annoys you, but that really seems like your problem, not mine.  If your goal was to persuade me to give the film a chance,  you were succeeding until the very end, and then you fucked it up.  Because part of why the poster annoys me, knowing that the film has passionate fans, is that to me it seems like it is advertising to an audience of people who are rather proud of themselves for enjoying this movie. (Look at her smug little grin.)  I know people like that and they tend to be insufferable. Congratulations,  because your last paragraph conformed quite well to that mental image. (Really, why do you care why I haven't watched this film?)  
  
I never claimed my thought process was rational. I doubt many people are especially rational when choosing a film to watch, or food to eat, or music to listen to. I was just describing the fact of why I hadn't watched it because it accorded with the parent commenter's experience of it.  That's all.  
  
The fact is,  I probably will watch this film fairly soon now,  simply because all this discussion has acted as an extended advertisement for it and now I know a bit more about it, which usually stimulates my interest.  So why don't you go be happy now?"

We all want one too. How can we make that happen?"" So Jesus (a son of God) laid out a plan, which God endorsed, that would have us all come to Earth, and using our own agency (free will), could choose how to live our lives, and if we lived righteously, we could eventually become as God is. This meant not everyone would, but that would be their choice. Lucifer then got up and was all ""Hey, I have a plan that would get *everyone* a body just like God's, but the catch is that you won't have any agency (free will) when you're down on Earth. Everyone will be forced to live righteously. Also, y'all will have to worship me."" So then all of us decided which plan we would want. A third sided with Lucifer (aka Satan) and were cast out along with Lucifer, never to get a body. The rest of us were sent down to Earth to get these awesome bodies and to basically try to be good people. But Satan and his followers are haters to the max and do whatever is in their power to tempt us to do bad things.

RichardBehiel,spacex,1390940399.0,"Let me take a wild guess until someone more qualified comes along.

Galvanic corrosion can be a problem when you have aluminum parts mated to carbon fiber parts, since it could cause the bond to weaken and break over time.  However, the corrosion isn't *extremely* noticeable, as in it wouldn't cause the aluminum to disintegrate like pouring mercury on it would.  Moisture affects the rate of corrosion, but since the aluminum contacts the carbon fiber on the inside of the leg, it seems like it would stay relatively dry.  

Also, I doubt the aluminum actually makes contact with the carbon fiber.  There's probably a layer of some sort of insulating fiberglass resin between them in order to prevent galvanization.

wayfaring_stranger_,HaircareScience,1390940413.0,"Thanks for the info! Sodium citrate (or more specifically in this case, trisodium citrate) **is** a metallic salt, since sodium is an alkali metal. I know metallic salts tend to be synonymous with *bad*, when it comes to hair care, but *WHY* is sodium citrate actually bad? In this case as the conjugate base of citric acid, it performs as a buffering agent to regulate pH. A way to minimize hair damage that may result from shampooing or treatments is to prevent the hair shaft from alkalinization. Most detergents have an alkaline pH, which causes hair shaft swelling. This swelling loosens the protective cuticle predisposing the hair shaft to damage ([Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)). Hair shaft swelling can be prevented by ‘pH balancing’ the shampoo by the addition of a buffering agent.  
I'm comfortable with consuming citric acid and [sodium citrate](https://ehs.cranesville.com/msds.pdfs/MSDS\(P027\).pdf) (present in ice cream, coffee creamer, mac n cheese, etc.); so my gut instinct is to also be okay with putting it in my hair. Am I missing something? "

Where things fall apart a bit is in the analysis of how to respond to that. Feel guilty all the time? Use the privilege for good? Become totally demobilized and step aside to make space for others? Some of the above, at the appropriate moments? My sense is there’s no widespread, common, easily-understood version of what to do with privilege, other than to continually fess up that one has it.

If you really aren't willing to not sleep with them, are you really friends?  Are you really all that nice?

Who the fuck cares.  That's not the point.

The problem with friend-zoning is it ALWAYS happens, not that it happens once in a while.  If it wasn't so frequent, it wouldn't be a big deal.

The other issue is 90% of the time the girl doesn't treat you like a friend.  She turns you into her Fluffer, an orbiter, a workhorse with false hopes of booty, a friend-ATM, any number of things that all have a common theme, she's not friends with you she's just using you.

I have in my time had friends that were chicks who didn't use me.  We were just friends.  And that was awesome.  They'd let me know what parties had the hot girls.  I'd bring my crew of good-looking guys.  And occasionally we'd talk about things that we both found interesting.  This was all social proof that benefited us both.

The days are getting shorter, and daylight savings is over. Consumerism rears its ugly head in the form of ""Black Friday"", a term coined because of its bleakness, the meaning lost on the masses huddled outside the Wal-Mart, waiting to get their filthy mitts on a cheap HDTV instead of buying new clothes for their brood of misfit children.

Oh, just what we need in America. I won't berate you too much for this because, much like Thanksgiving, the Super Bowl affords us the opportunity to gorge ourselves on junk food, enough to feed a dozen African villages for months. The difference being that the Super Bowl is an event, something tangible. Thanksgiving is a notion, a concept, a fucking misnomer perpetuated by schools who want to make children think that we peacefully acquired this chunk of dirt from the native inhabitants instead of systematically killing or enslaving them to the point that they're called ""American Indians"" by a third of the barely-literate.

I notice that more effort is being made now by parents and schools to change this, but in the past a woman had self worth through her husband, her beauty, her home, her status, and it never meant that you were to share that with your girlfriends but rather show it off.

use_more_lube,changemyview,1390940827.0,"&gt; I personally believe that because everyone and everything dies at some point, it is more humane to let your pet die when it's their time rather than when you think it is.


Sounds like you think there's a preconceived time for each creature to die. Is that so?


How has that death date been altered already? By vaccines, neutering, quality food, limited predators, and breeding for superior animals?


At what point in the continuum in an animals life do we step back and say ""nope, that'll change when they're going to die... and I sure don't want to extend their life unnaturally"" ?


Letting a pet die ""when it's time"" is shirking our responsibilities as pet owners. We are responsible for their comfort and care because we've removed their ability to care for themselves in the wild.
If they could communicate their wishes to us, that would be one thing - mercifully, they don't know they're mortal.


Also, humane - that word does not mean what you think it means and there's a little bit of Irony happening.

If a car drives straight through a red light they can hit another and kill an entire family in an instant. If a cyclist goes through a red light they might get hit themselves, but they're not really putting other people in danger. There can of course be substantial psychological damage done to the driver if they hit and kill a cyclist, even if it wasn't at all their fault, but you're very unlikely to cause the sort of damage that a car accident does.

beanfiddler,AdviceAnimals,1390940895.0,"&gt;I guess I don't understand how an apartment won't have basic functionality (fridge, stove, etc.) so mark me as ignorant as to how terrible being poor in the US is.

You're renting just a room or you're homeless. You're renting a hotel room in Motel 6 on a monthly basis. You got the power shut off again. You're renting an apartment with appliances, but they're shitty and the landlord won't fix them because you're behind on the rent. These circumstances aren't uncommon.

&gt;Excuses about not being able to cook - I don't understand this.

Pretend you work 80 hours a week. Or hell, pretend you work 40 hours a week, have to take the bus everywhere, and pick your kids up from daycare on another bus line.

&gt;You can get a hotplate for very cheap 

You have literally no money. As in your paycheck doesn't even cover your rent and essentials, you've charged up credit cards every time you have an emergency, and you're using food stamps.

&gt;I was a dumb college student until I did some basic math

This is the problem with this discussion: you're assuming that we're talking about college students. I'm talking about people who work full-time jobs or many part-time jobs who have kids, no car, and live in a shitty dangerous part of town. Poor people. Not college students.

&gt;Of course you are going to make it extremely challenging to escape the poor if you waste that much money on unhealthy food.

$5 of spinach is probably 100 calories. $5 of McDonalds is nearly 1800, and I don't have to cook it. Guess which one my mom got us when she was in a hurry, we were hungry, there was no guarantee when we could have the next meal? Mc-fucking-Donalds.

&gt;There is just no excuse not to learn how to budget, and eat healthy and cheaply - there is no end to the resources and help out there if you are just willing to ask.

Your budget is $23000 a year. You have two children. Rent is $900 a month. You work 50 hours a week. Credit card interest payments are $200 a month. Daycare for two kids $600. Your car payment and insurance is $200 (you have a shitty car). Whoops, there goes all your money... and you haven't even bought food.

&gt;It's just tough to watch people continue to make poor and selfish decisions and expect others to take care of them when they are more than capable of learning how to do it themselves.

TIL being poor is your reward for being stupid and selfish. Man, all my friends and I were really terrible fetuses. That's why we came out poor, right?

mkvgtired,casualiama,1390940924.0,"Switzerland actually has a very similar set up to the Affordable Care Act. The government spends less, as a percentage of GDP, than the US government on healthcare. Most insurance is provided by private companies. 

So its universal healthcare where private companies provide most of the services. Their companies are limited to 3.5% profits, the ACA limits large insurers to 15% profits and overhead (buildings, employee costs, profits, etc.). So it is a different limit, but a similar outcome. 

The new US system takes a lot away from the Swiss system. The one major difference is Switzerland sets prices for treatments and medications. So they're no set by insurance companies negotiating on their own but rather at a national level (or canton level, I cant remember, maybe a Swiss person can clear this up). 

Long story short there are a lot of ways to provide universal healthcare. The Swiss system provides excellent treatment, but it is the second most expensive in the world (sometimes being replaced by Norway for second place). 

I think the US is definitely on the right track, but hopefully it follows Switzerland's lead (and other countries using private insurers) and at least sets prices at the state level (because of differing legal climates in different states, I think national prices would be a bit unworkable). Maryland is poised to set prices and Vermont is in process of implementing a single payer alternative. So hopefully in the next few years these out of control costs will begin to be reigned in. Even if states say to hell with DC and do it on their own."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390940946.0,"Exactly. I think the author's point is the fact that you will be treated as if you're making a political statement, when in fact you may just be making an aesthetic choice. It is a decision that exposes you to people's prejudices and critiques. You may not to care about what other people think, but the choice to expose yourself to regular criticism and praise by people interpreting what you are trying to ""say"" with your hairstyle is a somewhat political choice. 

It's a bit like if you dye your hair bright pink and expose yourself to the prejudices that people have toward people with ""rebellious"" hair. Men who grow their hair out experience the prejudices that they are rebels, unkempt, hippies, etc. We all engage in these kinds of choices about how to dress or groom ourselves to be perceived a certain way, and that is just part of human nature.

The thing that makes cutting a woman's hair short especially stigmatized--and therefore more politicized--is the way people can interpret it as an attack or rejection. If I get pink hair, there will be certain spheres of society I'm ""rejecting"". It could be interpreted as a statement against establishment society, but most people don't feel like they are personally offended by my choice; they just shake their heads and look down on me.

On the other hand, if I cut my hair off, suddenly it becomes that I am rejecting one of society's basic assumptions about women--that they should want to be feminine and considered beautiful. This is received as if I'm rejecting society/patriarchy, and the way people take offense to that shows how deep the assumptions go. Suddenly people don't see me as an individual; I get lumped in with their stereotypes about this or that kind of feminist. The author points out that in her case, she doesn't want to ward off men with her hair, as some people assume; **she simply places her personal preference above the preferences of men (or, for that matter, most women). The concept of that seems pretty uncontroversial, yet her decision is interpreted by many as a rejection of, or even an attack on, men.** 

So it's not so much that women cut their hair off *in order* to cause tides. It's that they do it knowing that they will cause tides as a side effect. Everyone will assume you they trying to make some sort of statement. Not caring what people think as much as what you think is considered a bold statement on its own. Personally, I don't really have the guts to cut off my hair precisely because of this reaction. I really respect people who do, because they are able to stand out whereas I prefer to conform.

Serae,raisedbynarcissists,1390940964.0,"Ok here we go.

I have an Nmon.  

1.) She wanted to wear a white gown to my wedding.  She never got married and said it was the least I could do to help her feel important.  I took her shopping for an outfit and convinced her to get something else.  It was an uphill battle.

2.) Left the ceremony and missed the pictures.  She gave a half dozen different reasons that made no sense (she said her car was out of gas and she had to fill it NOW or she couldn't make it to the reception; she had to change her clothes/shoes but had to go home to it; was offended no one congratulated her about me getting married...)

3.) At the reception we had a buffet.  She HAD to be waited on...by me.  She refused food that I did not bring her myself.  She cornered me and demanded I make her coffee right NOW.  There was a Keurig available.  It wasn't hard.  I pointed her in the direction but she threatened me with dumping wine on my white gown if I didn't make it NOW.  I made her damn coffee.  She then wanted four more cups.  I sighed, made four more.  She then delivered it to my elderly family member saying in a sugar sweet voice, ""Look what I made for you all!  You all looked a little chilly so I thought it would be nice to treat you to some coffee!""  I wanted to strangle her.

4.) Same thing as above happened with our wedding cake/cupcakes.  We got a small cake for the cutting but had cupcakes made exactly the same as the cake to cut costs and make it easier to serve.  Plus people then had a choice of cake flavor.  My mother demanded a piece from the cake.  She didn't want a cupcake.  It had to be the cake and I had to drop everything I was doing to get her a slice.  Fuck that.  I brought her a cupcake.  She reacted to the cupcake with a sneer.  She threw the cupcake at the ground and kicked it at me.  My maid of honor noticed it, rush over and whisked me away (while removing her hidden flask from beneath her dress and handing it to me).

5.) Started badmouthing my in-laws for not approaching her.  They knew about her.  They knew she was crazy.  They avoided her.  I don't blame them.  She badmouthed them loudly.

6.) Was offended and blamed me that she missed the pictures.  She cornered me for pictures with the photographer.  Every picture with her I look unhappy and uncomfortable.  She kept pressing herself against me in the photos and in the process stained my dress with her make-up and pulling my hair down.

7.)  This was two hours into the reception.  She eventually walked off with a bottle of wine gifted to us by friends and left hours early.  She did not speak to me for three week.  When she did she demanded an apology for ruining ""her"" wedding.  She demanded this for many months and hung up on me when I refused.

tetromino_,washingtondc,1390940994.0,"IMHO a dickish maneuver is one that causes an unsafe situation, forces other vehicles or pedestrians to perform evasive action, or causes preventable delays.

Let's consider the alternative to the standard left turn maneuver: not entering the intersection and waiting 2-3 stoplight cycles for a long gap in oncoming traffic. Does it create an unsafe situation? Yes: you are forced to accelerate quickly to make the gap, and if anything goes wrong (e.g. a pedestrian comes out of nowhere) and you brake, you are forcing oncoming cars to slam on their brakes. Does it cause unnecessary delays? Absolutely. You are blocking the left lane for 3 cycles! And the cars behind you are now forced to move into the middle lane, causing all sorts of potential for fender benders.

The way I see it, the standard left turn maneuver is not dickish; but the new DC legal left turn is all about being a 100% dick to obey the letter of the law."

bobbyg27,politics,1390941025.0,"I think unions, like those they have in Japan, are good; representative negotiation, tapping into union resources like legal representation or training or mentorship.

It is the government-approved right to strike that I have a problem with.  In other words, if a union decides to ""strike"", they can not only stop going to work (admittedly, without pay), they can act as bad employees, protesting outside their employer's establishment, yelling at customers, actively impeding business.  The employer, however, cannot sever employment ties with these employees BY LAW.  Those employees can then, at any time they choose, stop the strike and resume employment. Any reprimanding action taken upon these employees by the employer that even has a HINT of relating to activity or actions from during the ""strike"" period can be met with harsh anti-labor lawsuits by union representation along with the NLRB or other government agencies.

Ok I forgot, I also have problems with ""closed shop"" union rights in certain states, where unions in an industry are somehow able to mandate that all employees in that state, and in that industry, are REQUIRED without possibility of opting-out to be members of that union. New employees, existing employees, there is no choice.  This hurts many companies trying to field young talent, as (for example) kids home on break looking for part time work to get a little money during the summer are extremely turned off by the mandated union dues taken out of their paychecks and the initiation fees that they go elsewhere.

I think the example you gave, /u/DashingLeech, in your post is a good reason why ""unions"" in general are not bad. However in the US, the legal rights that were given to the unions in the 1920s and 1930s to counter-act monopsonies that no longer exist in this country are what are creating issues today.  Unions have too much legal power, and it is damaging the US economy, in terms of transfer payments, inefficient compensation, and rational outsourcing.  I say remove their legal right to strike (they can still strike, they just won't have laws dictating what happens when the strike is over) and make union membership a CHOICE for all potential members, and I'm fine with unions."

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1390941074.0,"1) Yes, points are the same as standard mortgage points.  If you borrow $70k, you'd pay $2.8k if the fee was 4 points (I've seen rates from 1.5-5 points on hard money, mostly 3-4).  There is no downpayment requirement, but they will only lend you up to e.g. 70% of ARV, so you need to be able to buy the place for enough that purchase+repairs aren't much beyond 70%.  Each lender varies a lot in terms of what kind of loans they'll take, but you pay for risk.  E.g. the lender I generally use charges 2.5 point, and does a 5 year balloon instead of 6 months, but only works with folks with a stable 6-figure income, 740+ credit score, and won't loan on anything above 70% LTV (e.g. even if you want to come up with the cash out of pocket to cover the additional cost, he won't lend because it indicates that you don't know what you're doing as an investor, i.e. are willing to pay too much).  The purpose of the down-payment on a conventional loan is to ensure that the lender can be made whole in the event of foreclosure.  If you buy a place with 30% equity, it has the same effect as putting 30% down from a risk perspective (more or less, the rehab adds some additional risk, for which a hard money lender is well-compensated).

2) Hard money lenders make a lot of their money up front (the points you pay), so it is better for them financially to turn over loans as quickly as possible (hence the near-ubiquitous 6 month balloon loans).  Banks won't generally lend on a place that doesn't meet FNMA standards for habitability, but as soon as you have it fixed up and have an executed lease, they treat is the same as any other rental property (why wouldn't they? the risk profile is exactly the same).  Your hard money lender will not do a conventional loan.  Here's how it works in a nutshell:

a) Buy uninhabitable property with hard money.  You owe hard money lender $70k.

b) fix property

c) lease property

d) arrange financing with conventional or portfolio lender (they will have an appraisal done, at which point you find out how accurate your ARV estimate was and either rejoice or cry, depending... I have done both, lol)

e) close on refi.  Hard money lender gets paid their $70k, hard money loan is replaced with conventional loan.  You now have a (hopefully) cash-flowing rental property, and saved yourself a 20-30% down-payment.  

---

Honestly, buying a property for full-price with a 20-30% downpayment (35% for &gt;4 properties) is generally just awful from a financial perspective.  There are very few markets where you wouldn't be better off just putting your money into the stock market, especially given the additional risk and illiquidity you take on by doing that.  At that point you are just buying cashflow, and taking on additional risk (if you pay $100k for a $100k place and it drops $10k in value, you just lost $10k... if you pay $75k for the same place and it drops $10k, you still made $15k).  If your goal is just to buy cashflow, multi-family is almost certainly a better way to go, but even then you are unlikely to beat stock-market returns without being able to increase NOI.

SenseiCAY,AskMen,1390941297.0,"Yeah.

I play Ultimate Frisbee competitively. I've played since I was a senior in high school. I'm not the most athletic or the best thrower on the field, or anything like that, but I've been fortunate to have played for a collegiate national championship, and to have played with some of the best players in the game at some point or another. I have a [disc collection](http://i.imgur.com/A0CD7Qf.png) and a [jersey collection](http://imgur.com/a/pfCuF) hanging on my office walls. At this point, of that stuff dates back almost 10 years. You could say that I'm passionate about the game.

I've been out of college for a few years and I've moved onto playing for club teams around where I live (still having a day job). I think that as a result of some coaching and self-training, I was a better player two years removed from college than I was when I was in college. I was playing for a pretty good team, and in some of the best shape of my life. 

I started to burn out at the end of that season. Our team won the section (basically, a state championship) and fizzled out at the regional tournament. I had some injuries the next season, and didn't make it back onto the team, and instead played for a newly-formed team, captained by my best friend. I guess a combination of fighting injuries, going from being a role player on a good team to one of the go-to players on a mid-level team, and eight years and change of playing and never taking a break finally hit me one day. I had a shitty practice. It shouldn't have been a big deal; it happens to everyone at some point. Maybe I was tired from a long week or something, but that Saturday, I had no desire to play good defense and none of the fiery competitiveness that had gotten me to where I was without having ridiculous athleticism or talent. I knew that I didn't have it that day, but since our team was formed as a fairly low-pressure, low-commitment team (a group of friends decided to form a club team and see where we could go), we were always a bit short on bodies, so I had to keep playing. Just because I'm slow at these things, I'm usually the last one to leave practice because it takes me the longest to muster up the strength to take off my cleats and socks and change my shirt. That day was no different, and everyone else said their goodbyes and left. I stayed at the field and just sat there in deep thought for a long time, seriously wondering if I should just stop playing and hang up the cleats. I had been telling myself (and others) for a few seasons that I would finish out whatever season I was in at the time and then take a year off of competitive playing so that I could let my body recharge. Every season, it was the same result. I couldn't bring myself to not play, and so my body never got that recharge. 

I was seriously heartbroken at the thought of quitting altogether, and what got me up and motivated to play again was the fact that in my years of playing, I had met so many wonderful friends, teammates, and even adversaries that were like brothers and sisters to me. I had been places (and have since been to more places) that I wouldn't have missed for the world, and I wasn't ready to stop with that yet.

That was two years ago. I finished out that season, and started my next one early by trying out for a semi-pro team and making it, perhaps my biggest accomplishment to date. I'll probably take a season off eventually :)"

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1390941429.0,"Re #2, if you even have a broken window on a house it doesn't meet FNMA habitability standards and most lenders won't touch it, as it's seen as high risk.  It doesn't matter that you can just replace the window after you buy the place.  On the other hand, if you walk in and buy the place for cash, and replace the window, now it meets FNMA standards and every bank in the world will lend you money on it.  Hard money is a type of loan that bridges that gap for folks who don't want to tie up that much capital.

Obviously the window example is very contrived, but as scary as foundation/plumbing/etc. sounds to a novice investor, it's really all pretty straightforward, much like replacing a window.  The real risk is in estimating rehab costs and the unexpected things that always come up during rehab, and that's a big part of why banks won't lend.  E.g. you go to replace the window, and find the frame is rotten.  You replace the frame and find there is extensive termite damage.  While remediating the termites, you find the structural integrity of the house is compromised.  That is how banks see it.  If it's already ""habitable"" then they can lend on it, you get insurance, and the termite damage etc. is covered by the insurance policy, and the bank takes on less risk.  To get an idea of how significant this risk is valued, compare prices on a normal landlord/liability insurance policy, and a vacancy policy.  You're talking an order of magnitude cost difference.

Hope that's helpful."

Most general practitioners would offer just a low dose of an antidepressant, but I would suggest against that. A short, focused bout of Cognitive-Behavioral therapy may help mild depression (if that's even what is going on with you) while staying focused much more on exterminating the negative thoughts/behaviors rather than digging up the past or anything. Someone in your situation, if you have depression or anxiety, would probably do well in a CBT setting (plus its generally fewer than 15 visits for simple issues). "

It might benefit you to look at your class and find the people who are more mellow, quieter, and have similar social tendencies to yourself and make an effort to get to know them.

i'm not saying you can't carry as leblanc in low elo games you very much can but you really need to take everything into your own hands and you need to be able to pick off anyone including tanks.  typically in the lower elo games i'll farm as fast as i can until i get dfg and then i try to become a terror to the enemy team.  you blow up 3 people within just a few seconds and soon they'll be afraid to go anywhere they can't see you.  after that just keep pushing lanes out to apply pressure and farm up as much as you can.  i typically find myself not going back to base until i have around 2k to spend.  the biggest problem i see from people in lower elo games is backing too often.  if you kill someone and don't apply pressure somewhere or take an obj it's kind of a waste.  as leblanc you have crazy high mobility so don't be afraid to over extend a bit while pushing because odds are no one can catch you if you have W up.  do that every game and eventually you'll outfarm and outlevel your enemies making bursting them even easier and you'll get so fed that no one can stop you and even MR is a waste.

ps always rush dfg first and if you see the enemy is buying MR get ready to go into void staff as your next item in your build.  once you get dfg and blow people up they'll start buying MR so you counter that by already building towards void.  this makes it so you don't fall off late game."

Really though, that macro is just a way to generalize all people who are on welfare. That mentality is what people use to shame the poor, whether they ""deserve"" it or not. Say a single mom is working a full-time job but still needs food stamps to make sure her two children don't go to bed hungry.

The children grow up in piss poor neighborhoods, destined to continue the desperate cycle of poverty their parents are already caught up in.

First, a lot of people voluntarily cancel or delay - maybe they wanted to change anyway, maybe the delay simply fucked up their trip and they're not going to reschedule, or maybe they're enticed with cash or credit etc. Other people arrange substitute transport: maybe they drive, bus, or train, or maybe they switch airports.

Second, there's always some slack. There's lots of different route permutations that aren't *all* full. Maybe all the LA-&gt; NY flights are sold out, but there might room on LA-&gt;BOS-&gt; NY, or LA-&gt;CHI-&gt;NY, or LA-&gt; TO -&gt; NY. Furthermore, even ""sold-out"" flights are rarely at 100% capacity- there are last-minute no-shows.

EDIT: I'd like to point out that very often this is the case for a lot of the minute details - most people don't know that the presence of kobolds indicate that there might be a dragon in the area because they studied the Monster Manual, but rather because the player participated in an early adventure that had that factoid as a plot point. You might not understand state-based actions in MTG because you read the rules, but because your judge buddy explained an interesting interaction you saw in a draft. A good newbie absorbs this shit like a sponge even if he doesn't possess the resources (time or otherwise) to do so of his own initiative. A bad newbie gets confronted with this stuff and loudly declares that it's bullshit, broken, etc and proceeds to misrepresent the respective hobbies despite not really being a member of them, but feels entitled to because he self-identifies as a ""nerd"" by the new definition.

I'm talking specifically about people who like to bandy about the label itself with no respect for what it stands for. Most of these hobbies are inherently cooperative, so what my fellow gamer does concerns me greatly if he's poorly representing the hobby outside of my group or ruining the game inside of my group."

Anything you do, no matter how hard you work, you will never be viewed as anything but riding on your family's coattails.

Lets say her dad gave her $10 million.  She turned that into $1.5 billion.  That's 1500/10 = 150x wealth generation.  If I wrote you a $10000 check, could you come back in ten years and hand me $1.5 million? Most people couldn't."

Is that Capucine in the back? Maybe this will be crossing with Swamp Thing as well as the FE Blight books. Not sure if that'd be a good thing or not. Charles Soule's influence on the event? Good. Swamp Thing being forced into a crossover? Not so good. 

With the Dark being focused on more with FE Blight and now this, I wonder if we'll see some new Dark books launch soon? The Dark line has been really thinning of late (we're down to JLD, ToS: PS, ToS: Pan, Constantine, and Swamp Thing) and there are so many open spots left to fill before we're back up to 52. I'm enjoying DeMatteis' Dark books, but I'm not the biggest fan of Fawkes work so hopefully they'll find a new writer to leave their mark on the Dark (heh).

cmagnificent,PoliticalDiscussion,1390942294.0,"Problem - Seasonal and migrant workers.

Problem - How are we going to pay for these bounties? Where's that money going to come from? Furthermore who's going to pay for all these newly issued IDs, background checks and finger printings?

Problem - Assuming you somehow magically solve the first two problems will these new legal-illegals (as I'm going to describe) be subject to US labor laws? If so then many people probably won't want to keep using them and they would then be reduced back to being regular illegal-illegals and we'd have to deport them.

Problem - You say it costs $113,000,000 a year to accommodate these illegals. Under *ideal* conditions in your proposal you claim we would move 12,500,000 per year. At $100 a head on the bounty, that puts the money we're spending to move them at $1,250,000,000 which is *significantly more* than it costs to accommodate them.

Problem - What happens with these illegals as they're being bounty hunted? What happens if they resist being taken in? What happens if they put up a fight? Is the 'hunter' allowed to use whatever means necessary? Do you see how a lot of people might have some massive ethical concerns with essentially green-lighting vigilantism?

Problem - What do you think we're going to find if we run a criminal background check? If they were an illegal alien and ever got arrested, they would've been found out and deported, that's a waste of money.

Problem - These illegals are *already* not supposed to be in US, how is banning them from reentry going to stop them from coming back?

Problem - 

&gt;The cost of having them here far outweighs any contribution they are making to our economy and culture.

That is entirely your personal value judgment and without backing it up with hard numbers and facts from unbiased sources, it doesn't actually hold any water (and good luck on finding hard numbers on something as soft as 'cultural damage').

Problem - This is plan is half appeasement (which no conservative group is going to support) and half wildly draconian (which no liberal group is going to support). How would this ever *actually pass* through a legislature (state or federal)?

I know that everyone on the internet likes to think they've found the silver bullet in a 'simple common sense solution', but the problem is, immigration policy in the US *is not a simple problem and there is no simple solution for it*. Your plan here has more holes in it than a block of Swiss cheese and is completely unfeasible for multiple reasons.

The problem you're looking to solve, compared with other things is not that big of a problem (more American jobs have been lost to corporate outsourcing than illegal immigrants and those are high skill high paying jobs) and your 'solution' would cost more than just ignoring the problem in the first place while raising a lot of ethical/human rights concerns."

DieMensch-Maschine,AskHistorians,1390942427.0,"Regarding dead languages - I can read Latin and Old Church Slavonic.  I originally studied classical Latin, but then was informed that I should become familiarized with its Early Modern, particularly religious variant.  I first studied Latin on my own, so it's difficult to place a time frame on how long it took me to become proficient in it.  I also studied Old Church Slavonic as a grad student, first in the Slavic languages department and then at a summer institute at another institution.  I already possessed a couple of Slavic languages, so learning OCS wasn't a complete nightmare (reading knowledge of Russian was a pre-requisite to take the course).  As to fluency - I'm not sure I could read Cicero with superb fluency these days, but I am certainly functional enough to read Latin documents pertinent to my research,  making out most of the unusual usages and abbreviations that were common in my period of study.  As for OCS, I haven't looked at the classical Old Bulgarian variant in years.  That said, I read the Ukrainian/Ruthenian variant relatively frequently.  As with any language, the less frequently you use it, the more rusty you tend to get.  Likewise, you might come into an archive with excellent classroom-based knowledge of a language, only to realize that those skills now have to be adapted/refined to make sense of the manuscripts in front of you."

I never really went for it, and only practiced like once every two weeks, so it was very half-assed, but I wanted to really start bodyweight this month, so I did it almost daily. The pain in the wrists was always there, but I just ignored it and didn't think much of it.

It's come to a point where I had to stop doing anything where I put weight on my wrists, because my right wrist can't stand it anymore. No more handstands. Pushups and the likes, I all do on my fists now, because I don't hurt my wrist if I do it that way.

Will_Im_Not,SubredditDrama,1390942600.0,"&gt;[Friendzone is not gender specific but it does affect males more than females **due to the breeding strategies of males and females**. Since males are less discerning when it comes to breeding a female is less likely to be ""friendzoned"" by the guy. What's interesting to me is that the friend zone is most often a subconscious desire to create a harem. Women like to feel wanted. Male human/ape reproductive strategy is to sire many children. Female human/ape reproductive strategy is to select the best mate for her childbearing investment. **When one reveals to a woman that they are interested romantically then the power dynamic has shifted. She may have been considering them a potential mate, but once she knows she can have them as a mate at any time, it's in the interest of finding a better mate to string them along.** A better mate may come along, so she leads on the one who is romantically interested in her, typically for as long as they can stand it before frustration or sexual urges lead to sex or termination of investment.

tetromino_,washingtondc,1390942628.0,"No. I am talking about turning left at an intersection controlled by a stoplight that does not have a left turn arrow. Let's say you are going north, you want to turn west. The light north and south is green. You need to yield to traffic going south, and to pedestrians using the crosswalk at the west edge of the intersection box. So you pull into the middle of the intersection, wait for the traffic south and for the pedestrians to stop, and only then complete your turn west. At a busy intersection, that will typically happen only when the north/south signal becomes red (so the southbound cars stop) and the east/west signal is about to turn green (so the pedestrians crossing north/south will have had a flashing ""do not walk"" count down to 0).

The new DC legal alternative is to not pull into the middle of the intersection, and wait for a lucky moment in the middle of the north/south green signal when there is a gap in southbound traffic. Based on personal experience, people who use this style of left turn in DC can easily end up waiting for 2-3 full cycles of the stoplight, during which time they are blocking the left northbound lane (if there is a signal without a left turn arrow, there is almost certainly no dedicated left turn lane)."

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1390942656.0,"I'm agreeing with you but that doesn't change the fact that theosis has always been seen as repentance, and all writings on it are elaborations on that fact. When you deny that, you add a false 'woo-woo' veneer on the teaching that just leads to lazy navel-gazing and the practice never gets beyond the inside of your head.

This is the issue with the laity reading monastic writings in the first place. Without a teacher, they lack context to see these writings in, typical of today converts. It's so common that I could be writing this about Buddhist converts too.

I very much rather consider the perspective of monastics authoritative on this subject.

And your comparison between Buddhist and EO laity is not accurate for the reasons I have already said. In the EO context, the laity aren't seen on two different paths fundamentally. Monks, nuns, and laity, are all ideally on the road to salvation. In Buddhism there is a precedent of enlightenment being for monks and a favorable rebirths being for laity. This would be the equivalent of saying that EO teaches that heaven is for monks and the laity just exist to feed them. This isn't the case.

And Protestants do believe in more than just intellectual dissent alone. ""Faith Alone"" is meant to oppose salvation through sacraments, not that they don't believe that no inner transformation must take place. They just believe they don't need sacraments to do this. Again, caricatures invented by reactionaries and people suffering from ""convertitis"" are just strawmen and inhibit real discussion, as any exasperated Protestant debating a new EO convert can attest to."

3) using a curling iron or wand, curl entire front sections using 1"" partings 

4) begin wrapping ponytail into a messy bun 

5) once you have gotten your messy bun how you want it, secure it with large bobby pins 

6) begin picking up curls from the front sections and place them up and around the messy bun 

7) secure curls in place with bobby pins and continue until most or all the curls are pinned back on both sides

morelle,PCOS,1390942829.0,"When I got diagnosed, I was told the same as you and came home crying that I would never be able to have kids.  I was also worried that maybe there was some sliver of opportunity that I would miss because I wasn't interested in having them immediately.  

I talked with my husband and we decided to relax the birth control a bit so that it might happen naturally -- not that we were trying to have a kid, just that we'd accept it if I got pregnant and blame biology rather than ourselves if it never happened.  After three years of that, I was pretty convinced it wouldn't happen on its own, and I started to wonder how long I could afford to wait to try to have a baby before I was further compromising my chances.  In the meantime, I was even more concerned about my weight which was slowly creeping up even though I was starving myself and exercising constantly.  I felt like I was running on a treadmill and it was only a matter of time before I collapsed from exhaustion and gained 500lbs and watched my husband leave me alone in a house full of cats (who would magically appear, sensing my desperation) where I would spend the last days of my short life bitterly contemplating what might have been.

My doctors and I did not exactly see eye to eye on the gravity of the situation (as you might imagine, lol), so I turned to books and eventually found this sub and /r/keto.

As soon as I started keto, I started feeling more like my old self and moving toward my regular weight.  And then, just as quickly, I stopped feeling like my old self.  I realized that I was pregnant.  Correlation does not equal causation, but after 3 years of no pregnancy and then getting pregnant within a month of changing my diet, in conjunction with other compelling factors I'd prefer not to discuss here, I'm convinced that keto is what did it for me.

My pregnancy was healthy with no complications or scares, and she wasn't in a hurry to come out either (I had to be induced two weeks late). It wasn't the timing we were hoping for, but I'm glad I got pregnant when I did, because it was getting to the point where I wasn't enjoying my young/childless life as much as I should because I was concerned about the future.  

Not to say that keto is some magic bullet that will work for everyone (just my experience, nothing more).  I think it's really smart to be considering other peoples' experiences so that you can consider the best- and worst-case scenarios and adjust your plans/timeline accordingly."
lordfuzzywig,dayz,1390942832.0,"Even further than that, they're circumventing the ""no passwords"" rule by kicking.

""The bending of the shaft loads potential energy into the stick, similar to the way one would load a spring. The loading stage is extremely important to the shot because without the loading of the stick, the shot would be significantly slower, making it much easier to get stopped. Once the stick has been loaded, it continues along the ice until it touches the puck. The next stage is the release of the puck. This is the stage where the stick is in contact with the puck, in physics, this is known as an impulse. The impulse (I) is equal to the force (F) applied to the object multiplied by the total time (∆t) the force is applied to the object:""

Unfortunately halfway through the vacation she got really sick and needed to go to the ICU.  She got transported via ambulance to the hospital one night, and I slept in the hotel that night.  I went to visit her the next day.  From one of the hotels near the strip I hailed a cab, and told him where I wanted to go.  The cabbie said he didn't know where it was.  I had directions and was explaining this to him, and he kept shrugging saying ""I don't know, I don't know.""  I gave up, waved the people behind us to take this cab, and got in the next one.

The next cabby in line knew where it was, and was more than happy to take us there.  When we told him about the previous cabby he said that the other guy probably knew where it was, but couldn't get a return trip so didn't want to do it.  The hospital where she was staying at was nowhere near the strip.  It's about 25 minutes away.

I thought the first cabby was just greedy.  But the experience makes a whole bunch more sense now that I've read /u/QuarkGluon's post.  The guy [probably] wasn't an asshole, he was [probably] trying not to piss off his superiors.

Sornos,DaystromInstitute,1390943075.0,"I don't the Mirror Universe is a true alternate universe. The Mirror Universe seems to be, like the name suggests, a reflection of our familiar prime one. This means that whatever crazy shenanigans happens in the Mirror Universe, the course of events are still tethered to reflect the Prime Universe. For example, the main characters of the various shows are all still born despite history being completely different. James T. Kirk's parents and still conceive little baby Jim despite the incredible amount of deviations in Earth's history. Not only is Kirk born, but he happens to become Captain of a starship named Enterprise and has a Vulcan XO named Spock. 

Even after Spock dissolves the Terran Empire and throws the Quadrant into chaos, so many of DS9's characters are still born. Further still, they have much of the relationships with each other, just like Mirror-Kirk and Mirror-Spock. Mirror-Ben Sisko marries Mirror-Jennifer even though they likely did not meet on a beach on Earth.

All this to say is that the Prime Universe is what really guides the Mirror Universe. There is some correcting factor to make sure that nothing really gets too dissimilar between the mirror and its reflection. Perhaps the Mirror Universe is created from the thoughts of the inhabitants of the Prime Universe. All the negative emotions repressed and controlled are expressed somehow into a whole new reality (which coincidentally explains why Quark is such an altruist on the other side).

Or maybe the Mirror Universe is some omnipotent being's playground. The Mirror Universe is more funhouse mirror than deep reflection. 

Regardless of the origin, it's clear that the Mirror Universe is very tightly related to the Prime Universe. This makes it different from all the other alternate realities we've seen. "

I used hostelworld and loved it. A lot of people I've met use hostelbookers  and loved that. The main arguments I've heard for hostelworld is the site is cleaner and it's easier to check reviews. Hostelbookers on the other hand doesn't charge a booking fee (hostelworld is $2 I think). You can buy a goldcard for $10 and not be charged any fees on hostelworld which is what I did or what I've seen people do is look up the hostels on hostelworld then book the hostel on hostelbookers.


**Being an introvert in a hostel**

I have a lot of experience here. A little background first. Before my trip (US road trip followed by Europe backpack trip) I was shy. Really shy. I couldn't go up to a stranger for anything, if I met someone new, I'd freeze up and not have anything to say, and I was petrified to plan something for fear of rejection. We won't even get into talking to girls. Now, I'm still an introvert in that I like time alone with my thoughts but the shyness is completely gone.

From the very first hostel I stayed in I started to change (Washington DC). If you're nice and open to meeting new people you will have no problems meeting new people. There will usually be at least one person that will go out of their way to get you involved I found. In fact, even as an introvert I never felt smothered by being around so many people for so long because it was simply so much fun.

The best advice to ensure you meet people is to hang out in the common area in the morning and at night and try to stay off the electronics. If you must use an ipad/phone/laptop for something (or you're the first one there) don't use headphones. If the hostel serves breakfast try to be up in time for it.

If you have specific questions about being shy in a hostel or hostels in general let me know and I'd be happy to help!


**Seattle**

I can't speak for the Green Tortoise hostel as I didn't stay there but I did stay in [City Hostel Seattle](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/City-Hostel-Seattle/Seattle/24089?sc_sau=sfab&amp;sc_pos=1) and would highly recommend it.

Nowadays, there are so many games played primarily online, regardless of genre, that it is harder to get people to play an MMORPG who aren't in love with the RPG part of the genre. There are several very successful FPS, there is league and DOTA, TF2, what have you that all have very strong online communities.

Drop_,DotA2,1390943228.0,"The raging doesn't calm down as you get levels, but as you get better (improve your mmr). 

I would say I have about 10% of my games with someone raging, and probably another 10% with someone who (IMO) gives up prematurely and just fountain sits.   At least for solo queue anyway. 

You never get away from it completely, but if you are prone to raging yourself or arguing, you are more likely to be in more games where people rage, in my experience anyway, because it often provokes other people. 

The best way to avoid it is to keep a positive attitude, and know how to play, and admit when you've played poorly.

Trigger23,penguins,1390943253.0,"&gt;You're so clearly trying to push you're *opinion* against facts its irritating

Where specifically am I doing this? Give me an example of where I've replaced a fact with an opinion. 

I say Letang isn't a top-pairing guy because he has never been consistently deployed against other teams' top lines. Your mention of special teams is actually exactly how he plays a ton of minutes while rarely being pitted against the strongest players from opposing teams. 

&gt;You mention Suter and Keith, they are both in their age 29-30 season, Letang is still just 26.

And both were significantly better on the defensive side of the puck when they were 26, and both were consistently being used to shut down other teams' top lines. Something Letang has yet to do. 

&gt;Why would you ever change positions of someone already proven to be an outstanding player/even elite who is just now entering his prime. 

Because he doesn't play particularly well without the puck. He frequently turns the puck over in the neutral and defensive zones, blows assignments against 2nd and 3rd line forwards, and gets caught pinching multiple times each game. Why not relieve the burden of defense and let him play to his strength? Why is it such a negative concept to let him off the leash and do what he does best: create offense?

&gt;Name one defensemen in the same age bracket who is better than him. Subban? Karlsson? Doughty? Krug

Defensively, Subban and Doughty. Offensively? Subban and Karlsson. I'd also put Oliver Ekman Larsson into the conversation. 

&gt;You don't think other fan bases tear apart one aspect of their game, yet they know they have one the best and brightest players in the entire league. Are they whining they need to change positions? No. 

First off: who's whining? I'm saying I think it would be an interesting experiment and I'd like to see it attempted; an opinion that you seem fanatically devoted to deride and disprove (as though an opinion can be disproven). 

Second: these are areas where he has struggled for several seasons now. He hasn't made the kind of improvements on those aspects of his game that you'd expect from a defenseman coming into their prime. 

Lastly: again, I ask - *why do you see this as being a negative/damaging/insulting scenario for Letang?*"

DERangEdKiller,AskWomen,1390943397.0,"I love this comment, and the others you follow up with.  


Though Anecdotal, I want to share how I see this situation.

For the record, ""you"" is a generalized stand in for how I'd feel in this situation with any woman.  It just sounded better in my head commenting in this way.

As a man, personally I can see where a lot of guys fall into this, but I think a huge part of that is the gender divide, and the fact that we only really cross it later in life.

Men do share their thoughts, secrets, etc with each other.  My closest friendships are incredibly intimate, and a huge part of why I love those guys is because you can spend hours avoiding an issue, and just being there is usually therapy enough.  We only ever open up to our most trusted friends, only when we need to, but then there are no limits.

Sharing this part of yourself to a fellow man isn't avoided because it's shameful and not manly (at least not always any more), but because so much of what we say and do, and how we think is so personal I only want/can open up to my trusted advisers, and I'm curious to know what they'd do in my situation while I'm receiving empathy.

Do you see how that might be confusing?  If I'm friends with you, there's at least some level of attraction, and I might not even know it at first (that applies in different ways to both gender, it's just with women, there can be some level of physical attraction there too).  Couple that with the idea that the people I decide to share my life, and thoughts with are people I would fight, and die for, for the rest of my life, and you can see how the signals can get mixed. We can be friends, but if I can open up to you, you already have the inside track, and if I find you attractive, and can share with you so openly, why wouldn't I want there to be the opportunity to see where that could go.

It's the fact that sharing has such different values within the genders that we come to friend zone frustration, and  even then I'm usually more mad/frustrated at myself for being giant chicken, or that I misread what was going on than I am at you for not reciprocating my feelings.  How could I really be mad at you.  I love you.

That must suck for women in that situation, especially since I'd probably withdrawal some trust until I fully worked out how I felt about you

It's tough because of how we value communication differently."

Our attempt to bring ""justice"" to the victim simply conflicts with our legal system's quantification and classification of the accused sometimes.  It's imperfect, but unless humanity's perception of right and wrong congeals into some hive-minded system of perfectly ethical, all knowing collaborative sentience, it's all we got.  

EDIT:  I forgot, this is ELI5...  We want people to behave.  We want people to act about the same, and think that the same kinds of actions are bad.  In order to do this, and try to be as fair as we can to people who were wronged or hurt, we have to sometimes be unfair to the people who we think did something wrong, in the hopes that others who might try the same thing do not do it because of the consequences.

md619,AskMen,1390943596.0,"&gt;Age makes us more sure of what we want, or at least more comfortable in our own skin.

I think that's a naive interpretation. You can talk about ""maturity"" all you want but truth is people respond to incentives. That's the way the world has always worked.

Imagine you're a famous rockstar. After every show and on the street you have girls throwing themselves at you. BUT, there's a catch. In about 15 years, your reign will be over. Your bands popularity will continually decline in till people don't even remember who you were. You'll lose all the money you had. Your chances of having a kid are also going to dramatically decrease, which sucks, because you've always pictured being a dad. Assuming there was no way to reverse this, what would you do?

Well for the moment you're still a rockstar. So you fuck around for awhile, enjoying the casual sex that's being thrown at you and maybe some short term relationships. But as your 15 years come close, you're starting to notice the drop in attention from women. You know it would be wise to land a wife BEFORE it's all gone and you have to settle for whoever sticks around till the bitter end. Sure they might be loyal but no one wants the bottom of the barrel. 

In order to do this, you'd probably start shifting your dating preferences. No more wasting your time with hot groupies who will never be ""mother"" material. You end up marrying a quality girl before your 15 years is well up. You eventually lose it all anyway but because you have a life together, love each other and honestly neither can do better, you stay together. 

But let's say maybe you waited too late. The drop off in attention is now major. Girls are no longer throwing themselves at you, in fact for the first time in your life, you have to chase them. If a date comes along, you take it because it's been a long time. The girl is hardly high quality but you're desperate at this point.

That's what it's like to be an attractive women. Her youth and beauty are what makes quality men move mountains to lock her down and be with her. That's her fame. But it's burning fast, and once it's gone, it's gone. So she has to cash in while she can.

She might have other nice qualities, sure, but they're almost worthless without young and beauty first. It's like how women want a nice guy, but they don't *just* want a nice guy. They want a nice guy they're attracted to. And in fact sometimes they'll be willing to sacrifice on the ""nice"" part in order to get the ""attractive"" part. Guys think the same way, except I would say even more so.

So think about all that. And now you want to say ""oh, it's just because they're more comfortable""? 

Come on man. Sure there's some of that but it isn't enough on it's own."
deadcow5,AdviceAnimals,1390943597.0,"&gt; You have gripes, not arguments.

So my argument (that paying welfare to the poor so they can have kids that they can't afford, thus continuing the cycle of poverty is irresponsible) becomes invalid, simply because you re-label it as a *gripe*? That's a fantastic argument, good sir. [Hats off.](http://media2.giphy.com/media/b9aScKLxdv0Y0/giphy.gif)

Your *solution* appears to be simply to ignore that the problem is even there, and keep treating it the same way we are already treating it. I still fail to see how this is solving anything. In all likelihood, all that's doing is perpetuating the cycle of poverty (just like you are causing me to keep repeating this argument ad nauseam, because you fail to even see it as a problem). 

Yeah, some kids may get out of the cycle here and there, some are able to beat all the odds and make it. But they're few and far in between. Do you really believe that somehow, if we just pump enough money into inner city schools, we'll somehow, at some point, produce a generation in which the *majority* makes it out of poverty? "
Blacksheep01,cordcutters,1390943601.0,"I'm not saying this to be snide, I am a lifelong MLB and NFL fan, but they are racking up those costs running thousands of hours of useless sports analysis, highlight clips and talking head shows, and frankly, all of them are worthless.

I used to watch ESPN religiously from the ages of 12-17 or so, and then I finally realized, ""why the fuck do I need to watch people make bad predictions, cause drama where there is none or tell me what happened in a game I just watched 100 different ways?"" The answer was I didn't, I just wanted to watch the damn game and be done with it. Haven't watched an ESPN show that wasn't an NFL game in 15 years now.

ESPN won't change to just cover games and do a short little nightly news highlight reel of the day now though, they need to pay legions of people to talk about a bunch of crap that makes no difference and has no influence on anything. And in all of that garbage are their huge costs. What do they have, 4-5 channels now? Besides college sports games now and then, I'm sure it's 90% ""analysis.""

I love MLB.tv (blackouts are an issue, but not for me) and just wish all leagues would just broadcast their games like that. ESPN can go out of business for all I care, listening to other people talk about sports all day has got to be the zenith of useless, futile activities in life. I can get my MLB trade rumors from well, MLB trade rumors, and if the mood strikes me to talk about sports, the Patriots blog at SB Nation is nearby just like my Blue Jays message board is always there. ESPN can go die in a fire, nobody needs them, they are responsible for outrageous cable costs and likely holding up certain sports from being all streaming, all so they can talk crap day and night about nothing."

The best thing you can do to get away from it is to simply get better.  Not only will you be less likely to induce rage in others because you are better, but you'll be playing with higher level people who are generally less rage prone. 

Another tip is to try and calm people down when others are raging at another person on your team.  It doesn't always work, but it often calms people down a bit, rather than letting the game get out of control.  "

I agree, there is absolutely no obligation for any *person* to have to date someone. That said, the guy has been told since birth that being nice, being non-judgmental, taking interest in a woman's personal life and even putting someone else's interest in front of their own is what they **MUST** do to be an attractive mate to women.

I believe what I've learned and what TRP tries to get men to understand is that those are **not** the qualities that attract women. Those are good qualities to have in humans in general ... but they are not what makes a woman interested in a man. Men get hurt and angry for being put in the ""friend zone"" because in their minds they are following the ""rules"" they've been told too, and it just doesn't seem to work for them.

I was a virgin until I was 24. Why? Because I was (and am) a nice guy who thought all it took to attract women was to be a nice guy. Once I started thinking less about others and more about improving myself, I became a much more attractive mate to women. Not to toot my own horn, but I have no problem attracting women at all now.

Logically, women should love betas, because betas are selfless. However, women love alphas because alphas have something to offer."

Shinji at United has come across way more of a false 9 than a playmaker, he trys to drift in the box and score, but he's got no confidence so won't shoot or his finishing is awful. That's why he scored so much at Dortmund. Mata comes across way more like David Silva to me, great passing, great mobility, great crossing. Shinji is more reliant on runs and flicks, which are harder to judge, his passing has never really impressed me. I say that as someone who has been a huge fan of Shinji, my patience is just running thin. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't sell him though.

PotRoastPotato,CFB,1390943859.0,"No college is worth $55k/year. You can go to a good school in your home state for much less than $55k. If you spent that much on a college not called Harvard or Yale you probably made a poor choice. 

My point: I'd rather be paid 55k/year and pay for the college of my choice than get *any* college scholarship.

With 55k you could be a full time student paying tuition out of pocket to a good state school and still live comfortably with a mortgage, car payment, full benefits while putting away money in a 401(k) for retirement. 
These kids, even UVA kids, live in a horrible dorm with a crappy meal plan and don't have spending  money unless their parents give it to them (or, unless they take student loans and go into debt!). Don't fool yourself. 

One more point about the Harvard/Yale thing... It really is true. Other than the ""Super-Elite"" schools, it really matters not where you get your degree, only what you do if with it. I'm living proof, I went to a crappy little liberal arts college and FSU, which has as bad an academic reputation as a school can have. 

And yet, If I'm applying for a job even against someone who went to a semi-elite school like UVA or Michigan (or even UNC or Duke), will they really give the other guy the job because he went to a ""better"" school than I did 15 years ago? Or will they look at our experience and fit for the job? My experience from being on both sides of the interview table is unequivocally the latter. 

So no, even though the accountants might say they are getting $60k/year, I'll take cash over an ""equivalent"" 100% tuition discount any day. "

* I transferred the American funds from the Edward Jones brokerage to the Vanguard brokerage.
* I still owned American Funds, now in my Vanguard account, and paid the normal American Funds expense ratios.  But this was convenient to tax purposes.
* I sold the American Funds and bought similar Vanguard-branded offerings that have a lower expense ratio.  This is a taxable event though, but I preferred to do this in my Vanguard account for convenience reasons; less forms and all that.

Her family, my mom and I all met at a theme park.  It was a little awkward and I really wasn't thrilled to meet her in person (I liked our online friendship)  We lost touch over the years, however.  We recently found one another on Facebook and she has bloomed into a BEAUTIFUL girl, holy moly!

* A guy who was in my WoW guild happened to live in a town about 30 minutes from mine, and was coincidentally attending my college and enrolled in my math class.  We were good friends for a while.  We eventually dated, ""fell in love"" and things got ugly after 6 months together.  He opened me up to a whole new friend group, however, that intertwined very nicely with my own and we're all pals!  A few seperate romance stories between our friends came out of that over the past 5 years :)

* A friend of mine I played EverQuest and League of Legends with came to check out med school in my city a few years ago and we met up throughout the weekend.  He is my very best E-friend I have ever had and we still keep in touch occasionally when he isn't swamped with homework (unfortunately he didn't end up moving here for school).

I don't think that's the case.  Let's say you've got a group of guys, all of whom act in accordance with male gender roles except for one who doesn't.  An effeminate male provides no value to the rest of the group- he's weak and creates issues that energy has to be spent resolving, without being able to offer them sex.  To convince the group not to isolate the effeminate guy, you'd have to convince them to put up with him when the benefits don't outweigh the costs.  That's much more an active process than letting ""policing"" take it's course."

Read some of the responses. Overall, I got 100% of the responses on-topic and not a single person got on a soapbox about his own world. It was very helpful.

I disagree for another reason too. When I started browsing /r/worldbuilding, I was not an aspiring worldbuilder. I just enjoyed reading about other people's worlds and looking at cool maps and designs. Later, I was inspired to pursue my own work, but initially my interest was in the work of others. I suspect that we have quite a few such readers who are genuinely interested in enjoying the work of others. And even though I've built (but not shared) my own worlds, I ask clarifying questions on every post I comment on, only rarely providing examples when I genuinely think it will help the creator.

1. You try to completely get her out of your life, which means removing everything that could remind you of her from your life (pictures, facebook, gifts, etc).
2. Try dating another girl, which basically means replacing her.
There might be other methods but these helped me in the past, yet both methods take some time."

Drakkanrider,sex,1390944143.0,"I was in a very similar situation to your gf not so long ago.  I'm going to start by saying you are absolutely doing the right thing by not pressuring her to give you a blow job.  She isn't ready for it and it would be horrible for both of you.  I can't speak to what's happening in her head, so I'm just going to tell you what it was like for me.

To sexually inexperienced me, penises were terrifying.  They were scary, gross, weird, and, above all, unfamiliar.  As far as I knew they stuck out when you wanted to have sex and spewed disgusting fluids when you were done.  You've had one of these things your entire life, she hasn't and she doesn't know what to do with it.  She probably hasn't watched much porn if any, and attractive pictures of naked men aren't as ubiquitous and easy to acquire as attractive pictures of naked women.

So that's where I was.  Dicks were weird and I didn't really want much to do with one.  When my first sexual relationship started, it started with PIV because that's all i was comfortable with.  I just wanted it to do its thing down there where I didn't have to see it.  There was some cunnilingus if I didn't finish from PIV, but no blowjobs.  I didn't really want to touch it, let alone put it in my mouth!

I'm not like that any more thought.  So how did I change?  It took a bit of patience on my partners end, but it didn't actually take a lot of time.  What I needed was to be able to get comfortable with a penis in a nonsexual context.  My bf would walk around naked after sex.  He just didn't feel the need to put clothing on right away, so he'd go about his business pantsless.  And, well, a flaccid penis isn't nearly as intimidating as an erect one.  They just kind of flop about in a not terribly threatening manner.  Its actually kind of cute, thought slightly younger me.  This instigated a desire to explore this whole penis thing.  My bf was a good sport about it, he let me play with it, poke it, flop it around, he even showed me a few funny things he could do with it.  It transformed from a mysterious, scary beast into a body part like any other (although, a good deal more amusing than most).  Now, playing with it is such a habit I with even notice I'm doing it sometimes.  I like touching it, playing with it, kissing and licking it.  Now it's sexy and fun.

So there you go, a journey of sexual discovery from a girl who was terrified of penises less than two years ago.  My advice from all this, my tl;dr: let her get comfortable with you and your naked body.  Cuddle naked without sex being even a possibility.  Masturbate beforehand so you can stay flaccid for a while and so sex isn't on your brain at the time.  Walk around naked and unashamed, let her see you being comfortable with it and it will be easier for her.  Don't just pull out your dick when you want sex and hide it away at all other times.  Show her it's something to enjoy, not something to be afraid of."

I was put in Taekwondo for eleven years against my will. I experienced a lot of violence as a child. Most of it from Taekwondo, but the most damaging of it from my father.

I'd like to describe what happens when I get into a situation where there's a potential for a fight, where that fight or flight response kicks in. Well mine says fight. And it says it real loud.

I remember one time, male housemate of mine was mistreating his girlfriend (who was also our housemate). He was drunk and wouldn't leave her alone. I tried telling him to just let her sleep, *alone*, like she wanted, but he wouldn't have it, and it seriously took a lot of mental strength to not kick his ass right there. I mean it seriously felt like I was pushing against the weight of a small car holding back from this guy. Later in the night though he kicked a door down and that was too far. I grabbed him, his girl ran out of the house with another girl housemate of ours (college house btw). I didn't seriously injure him, I didn't kill him, just used violence to control a situation that needed to be controlled.

In any case, a lot of these comments seem to make me out to be a monster for what I did, since I didn't *have* to do shit."

The safest option would just be to not register, and spread via word of mouth that you're hoping to put a down payment down on a home.  Most guests will give cash anyways if you don't have a registry, and the ones who ask your mom or your gossipy aunt sally will just be told that you're trying to save for a house and will probably get the picture.

Should people with premature balding issues not have kids? People who are short enough that they got picked on at school, should they refuse to have kids in case they're short too? Or people tall enough that they hit their heads on low ceilings?

If we say that people who might pass on bad things to their kids shouldn't reproduce, our species will end. (A few would argue that's a good thing, but that is a topic for another CMV.) So it's not a matter of ""might I give my kid some negative trait"", because the answer is yes, it's a question of whether a genetic problem or unusual characteristic is so terrible that it would be cruel to bring the kid into the world. Honestly, I don't know where to draw that line. Maybe cancer is on the wrong side of the line and you shouldn't have kids after all. I guess that's up to you to decide."

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1390944641.0,"No problem! Glad I can help.

It generally does not make sense to pay off a mortgage, as unleveraged RE returns are lackluster at best.  Average non-inflation-adjusted returns for stocks in the last 50 years are 11.3% annually.  Given the additional work, risks, extremely high transaction costs, and liquidity issues associated with RE, I would want a significantly better return than that to make an investment.  I generally look for at least 25% cash on cash returns, and a bare minimum of 12% return on equity. In addition to that, I typically see at least 25% return up front in terms of equity capture after accounting for a 9% cost of sale (ideally if I do dispose of a property, it is directly to a tenant and my cost of sale is closer to 3-5% due to not having to pay realtor commissions).  I don't factor appreciation into my models (it is the 'icing on the cake' if it happens).

Buying a multifamily at 10% cap rate means you will underperform the stock market unless you can increase NOI and thus value of the property.  

The really attractive qualities of RE, to me, are:

1) cheap leverage, without the risks associated with leverage in the equities space (your leverage is backed by a physical asset, and is significantly less than the value of that asset)

2) ability to easily buy for less than market value.  A friend of mine was just talking to me about a deal he found a few minutes ago.  $33k  purchase, $15k repair, $80k ARV.  Spending $50k for $80k of assets is pretty awesome.  Even if there are $12k in cost of sale, acquisition/holding costs, etc, that's $20k in profit.  You can do deals like that on a regular basis, as there is always someone who needs to unload their house quickly.  No other asset class offers that type of reliable discount.

The amount of risk you take on buying a property with $20k of profit built in is very low.  The amount of risk you take on buying for full price is very high, due to the high transactional cost.  If something happens and you need to unload property A, you are $20k richer.  If something happens and you need to unload property B, you are ~9% of purchase price poorer.  

Rule #1 of investing is ""Never lose money.""  This means that every investment needs to have a margin of safety (one of the reasons I don't like the standard dollar cost average into an index fund approach, although I do with my 401k).  Paying full price means not only do you have no margin of safety, but with the high transaction costs in RE, you have effectively already lost money.

That's how I think about it, at least."

katharinekay,xxfitness,1390944658.0,"Unlike the smarter people in this thread, I started wearing VFFs 4 years ago and jumped straight into running 3 miles. Literally bought em, went home and then ran 3 miles at 8,000 feet in elevation (vacationing in CO). Worst idea ever. I could hardly walk the next day, but I kept up with my usual level of fitness (college track and field) and eventually the soreness went away, and now they're the only athletic shoes I wear. To be fair, I guess I had started running on the track completely unshod that spring, but only once per week and very slowly and short distances (800m-1600m).

They're definitely not for everyone, but not everyone likes to wear heels either. They helped me run faster, better, and relived me of back pain and the pain of having my arches cramp up in regular shoes. I've never had shin splints (and I was a triple jumper! The top of the shin-splint scale from all of the pounding). I got my boyfriend started in them too, and made a believer out of him (even after we went on a 2 mile hike his first day).

I do more body building now, but they're still my shoe. Even if you don't use them for all of your fitness, they're a great thing to try and see if they're for you -- and they never fail to start a conversation.

EDIT: just saw your concern about calf cramps. Definitely go with what /u/aubbey said and start SLOWLY or else your calves will be burning with the fire of 1,000 suns for months on end. The upside of that for me was it made me go out and run again because that was the only way to get them to stop hurting for a bit."

I think you are better off staying with whatever program you will do best in and learn the most from.  Unless you know for a fact that you want to be an orthopedist or accountant or something, don't try to pick your career now.

Listen to the previous poster.  If you want to be an entrepreneur, start now.  Everyone in college says they want to be an entrepreneur but they have no idea what that entails.  Do you want a job with benefits like health insurance or retirement?  If so, you probably don't want to be an entrepreneur.  Do you want paid vacation time?  Regular hours? Time with family? Steady, reliable income?  People like the idea of being their own boss but they rarely appreciate what entrepreneurship actually means.

rinse your dishes off before you throw them in the sink, or that crust is going to be impossible to get off.. better yet just wash the dishes as you use them and you wont have a pile of nasty dishes in your sink.

naot,travel,1390944824.0,"I did a similar trip to this not too long ago but I went the opposite direction since I'm from Orange County. I flew into San Francisco and took the Amtrak to Seattle then drove from Seattle to Vancouver then back to Seattle and flew back home to Orange County. I only did a week but for everything I spent around 1.5k, that's for food, car rental, flight, and spending money.

The only issue you might have is trying to rent a car in Vancouver and leaving it in the States, you will prob have to take a bus or amtrak from Vancouver down to Seattle then you can rent a car there and drive down to Southern California. To be honest the only really nice drive is from San Francisco to Santa Barbara I've done that drive at least 3-4 times and would definitely do it again. There's not much to see between Portland and San Francisco, I would suggest taking an amtrak if possible just to avoid the boring drive. It will prob cost the same in terms of gas and car rental and drop off fees.

I did the trip during the fall but I don't think it would've been much of a cost difference if I did it any other time of the year."

progbuck,PoliticalDiscussion,1390944825.0,"This isn't accurate, and that's not what balanced budget means. Specific contracts are earmarked funds, and they need permission to exceed their budget. Congress has to vote to appropriate funding, and any change or increase must be voted on. Generally, they stipulate a certain amount in a general fund that the Executive has a, limited, discretionary authority to distribute. 

What a balanced budget means is that any and all spending is paid for via normal sources of income, rather than via financing. 

An increase in labor costs for government contracts would, indeed, increase the operating costs of the government, but not by very much. The vast majority of Federal spending is tied up in either entitlements or the military. Increasing the pay for minimum wage employees on contract would be an increase of less than 1% of the budget."

But google is going to push for a world where they, not Apple, control the way HTML is read.

This economy will always need burger flippers and maids and janitors. It's not sustainable to make it impossible for them to get by, then blame them for not getting by. For the record, my mother was an elementary school teacher, not some uneducated slob. This was the early-'90s, but it's worse now. My city is clogged with call center jobs that require college degrees, and pay near minimum wage. What ""life skills"" can overcome rising costs of living, massive unemployment, stagnant wages, and the burden of paying to educate yourself for entry-level jobs?

If poor people were victims, they wouldn't apply for food stamps. It takes monstrous effort to swallow your pride, accept judgement of strangers, and jump through all the hoops to get them. They wouldn't have jobs. They wouldn't have college educations for entry-level positions.

I'm sure it's plenty annoying hearing other people bitch about unlit burners, but imagine how annoying it would be to get PLOWED INTO by somebody cruising home on their bike. Spoiler: this happened to a campmate last year and the other guy made off with a scrape and some bruises but my buddy got all cut up on his face from being thrown over his handlebars. Sure, you think you can see (and more importantly, avoid) everything and everybody as you're walking/biking along, unlit, but it's *only because of everyone else's lights.* Nobody can see you, a well-mannered and intelligent individual hiking to the portos at 3am.

ebonlance,PlayStationPlus,1390945267.0,"9 is my absolute favorite, but there's a lot of nostalgia there. Not just with he game itself, but the way FF9 paid subtle reference to its predecessors. 

I wouldn't classify any of them as strictly hard. It might be a little difficult as a newbie but you'll get into it. I'd recommend playing with a guide for your first one to get a feel for the amount of depth you need to put into things.

Here's my tier list of FF games

Masterpieces: FF9, FF6, FF5, FF Tactics
Wonderful: FF4, FF7, FF8, FF10
Good: FF 1
Acceptable but you won't miss them: FF2, FF3, FF10-2

I would play them in the following order:

FF4, FF6, FF7, FF8, FF Tactics, FF5, FF9, FF10

The reason I suggest this is because FF4 (especially the PSP remake) is really accessible. The difficulty is toned down from the original version and there isn't much customization on the party or abilities for you to mess up and get frustrated - just level up and enjoy the story.

FF6 has an even better story but adds a lot of customization too, which eases you into it. FF7 is the first ""modern"" final fantasy which has a lot of customization and a more cinematic feel to it. FF8 is similar to FF7 but has a completely different sort of leveling system, to get you used to the idea that things can drastically change in the series. FFT and FF5 introduce you to the concept of jobs and are among my favorites. FF9 plays off of parts of the entire franchise and has the perfect balance of story, gameplay, and customization. FF10 pulls an FF8 on you by changing everything but is still very enjoyable.

If you're only going to play one, I'd say FF9 though."

Take Bill Gates, now his family weren't super-rich I believe but they were rich enough to send him to a school that had a computer. Hundreds of other equally talented and intelligent kids didn't have the same opportunity and didn't end up being one of the worlds richest men.

The same can be said of all the kids who's parents couldn't afford to buy them computers, video cameras, musical instruments and so on. It's not that successful people aren't hard working or talented, it's that they've often been given a chance to make use of those talents."

tamasuperstar,reddevils,1390945621.0,"Very much impressed.

He got back to receive the ball a la Rooney a lot, and his superiority when it comes to distribution over Kagawa is just plain to see. His passing from deep within midfield was great and really helped to open up their defence. Hence where our first goal came from. God help other teams when we sign a proper CM.

I've realised him and Kagawa are incredibly different players. Mata is far more of a David Silva esque true playmaker, who happens to have goals under his belt too. 

Kagawa's passing for us has never really impressed me, and he seems to rely on others to feed him so he can either score, or do a nice flick to someone else to score. We don't currently have a system that lets him do that so he's not working. Which means his confidence is low and he never ever fucking shoots and isn't scoring at all. Which is the huge problem.

He was confident on the ball, but still obviously a bit shaky about running too much on it, which is understandable. The guy's **trained with us one day** and **not played since New Years** considering how rusty he should be he was brilliant.

So fucking excited by him."

mrcleanup,offmychest,1390945656.0,"I know how it feels when a relationship ends. I am sure this isn't your first. Try to remember the good times you had and let that give you hope for the future. Yeah, it sucks if you are looking for a permanent relationship and not finding it, and yeah it sucks to be alone now, but you had joy, and you have good memories. Use those memories to give you strength, like logs on the fire to get you through the winter, a warm reminder of better days that will come again.

It's hard to appreciate those memories now, with the pain of loss being so fresh. It's ok to have happy memories and pain at the same time. It will get easier to deal with as time goes on.

Going forward, the main thing to remember is that you don't *make* a great relationship, you have to *find* it. Someone who wants to date you is a possibility, not your future. Your job is to look for possibilities, sort through them, and discard the ones that aren't going to work out. I am sure that looking back now you see signs of what was to come. Your job is to watch for those signs and when they happen, address them directly, if they can't be fixed, move on then, not later. The longer you are with the wrong one, the longer it will be until you meet the right one. 

It is worse to work too hard to try and make it work than it is to let go. Learning to let go of the wrong relationships is the real challenge, and the better skill. Learning to see the end of the wrong relationships as a success and not as a failure is your goal.

Always be true to yourself, always be honest about who you are and what you want, and always demand the same of your partner, and when you find the right person, you will find that you don't have to work hard to make it work.

You are a good person and you are going to be ok. You are going to hurt for a little while, that's normal, let it happen. And then when you have had a chance to mourn, look forward again, and see that you avoided a future of unhappiness, and a happy future is still possible."

Ha ha! It's amazing how things change, don't they? I always liked Tolkien's elves and I still do, even if they have their faults. That's *good.*

I had an interesting discussion with a friend lately about dwarves vs elves, as we're both active in fantasy fandom and larp and stuff, and there is a clear preference for elves among women vs dwarves among men. We've both independently come up with the idea that elves make men uneasy, what with liking art and songs and starlight and being delicate and pretty and poetic and yet still dangerous and badass. Dwarves, on the other hand, *used to be* exactly what guys would like masculinity to be: unkempt, ugly, aggressive, arrogant, no finer feelings and no ""trouble"" with women, while still awesome and dangerous and all that. Now suddenly guys are all up in arms because their bastion of fantasy bro-dom has been compromised. To quote a friend, ""He's prettier than Aragorn! Why is he prettier than Aragorn?"" (He was just born that way, dude. :D )

warriorscall,USMCboot,1390945912.0,"Depends on the NJP.  The concept of an NJP is just that - ""Non Judicial Punishment"". It's essentially official punishment handed out by the commander.  This may sound unfair, but it is permissible to take it to a court martial if the Marine wishes - however, this is normally only a good idea if the Marine being NJP'd is actually innocent.

The punishment is decided by the commander, and the higher a commander's rank, the more punishment they can mete out.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment

You can find out the various allowable punishments here.

I could definitely see a punishment like being kicked out of intel school since it's an MOS with a clearance.

As far as a reenlistment, I would theorize that whether or not he will be able to will vary based on if he state of the Marine Corps when the time comes - if we get into another war and need more manpower, then maybe he'll be able to (if he is shit hot these next few years).  But if not, then probably no. The Marine Corps is downsizing and they have no reason to keep a Marine with an NJP over a similar Marine with a clean record, assuming they both want to stay in."

... And sought to invalidate mine as well. 

&gt;You make it seem as if moving Letang to wing will suddenly make him an elite forward as if he will be an immediately better option than Bennett, Neal, Kunitz or Jokinen

He is more offensively gifted than three of those players. 

Letang: 0.54 P/G 
Jokinen: 0.62 P/G
Kunitz: 0.69 P/G
Bennett: 0.54 P/G

The biggest gap there is less than a quarter of a point per game, do you really think his production wouldn't increase by at least 17 one-hundredths of a point per game playing on Sid's wing?

EDIT: Kunitz's production went from .64 P/G in the three seasons preceding his move to Pittsburgh to .79 P/G in his time with the Pens. So it's not outlandish to suggest a younger player with more skill and a similar playing style to Kunitz could easily see an increase of a quarter-point per game. 

Are you under the impression that playing forward is so highly specialized and drastically different that an elite player couldn't make the transition? Especially one who played that position not long before his NHL career started?

&gt;you would have to make the case he isn't better than 120 other defensemen (top **4** defensemen per team X **30** franchises) to even make the argument he isn't good enough for that role. 

Ah, I see where the rub is now. This doesn't have anything to do with me saying that he isn't ""good enough"" to be a top-four defenseman. I'd have to smoke more crack than Rob Ford on payday to suggest that. But I also don't have to make that case in order to justify experimenting with his position. At all. All I really have to do is prove that we could plug a defenseman into a top-four role that provides a similar level of defensive capability.  With our depth and the fact that we went without Letang and did just fine defensively when he was injured, the Pens have made that point for me already. 

It's not about Letang ""flunking"" out of being a defenseman or whether he's ""good enough"". It's about seeing his skill set and wondering if he might have a higher net contribution to the team if he were placed in a role that tool full advantage of that skill set, combined with the insane organizational depth with defensemen who all project to be at least as good as he is on the defensive side of the puck and many of whom also have offensive upside to boot.

Aikidi,todayilearned,1390945973.0,"Yeah, but even still questions of masculinity are a central theme in just about all of his books (a few exceptions, but at the very least it features in *The Sun Also Rises, The Old Man and the Sea, A Farewell To Arms, The Green Hills of Africa, Across the River and Into the Trees*) and a lot of his famous short stories like ""The Short Happy Life of Francis Maccomber"", ""The Undefeated"", all of the Nick Adams stories etc.



Not that there's anything wrong with writing about/challenging concepts of masculinity, I can just see where women might get bored of reading it and might enjoy reading someone writing from a more feminine perspective. I'm not sure why women are mocked for liking Austen when men liking Hemingway is basically the same thing. Both are revered authors who have stood the test of time, and for good reason.

I now run 30 miles a week when a year ago I could hardly run around the block.

I also cared a whole lot more about what I was putting into my body all day when I needed to fuel it to push me forward. 

A lot of people here have the right idea in saying this isn't a diet, it's a lifestyle change. Don't start giving up foods you know you can never live without. I easily gave up fast food, soda, and processed foods. Pizza? I'll never give up pizza, I just can't have it all the time."

I had become the very best, like no-one ever was, I had traveled all across the globe, carefully choosing my allies, until I had distilled the very best of the best into the six members of my hand-picked, and intensely trained team, and it had all been worth it. 

The road had been long and treacherous, and my opponents, five masters of unparalleled skill, each with their own elite disciples, had neither asked nor given quarter.

I still remember, as I stood upon the plateau reveling in my victory, I had noticed that the sun, threatening to rise, had bathed the entire landscape in an otherworldly indigo light, and to my eyes, no color had ever been quite so beautiful. 

The next part is all a blur now, but I remember the victory ceremony, and my mentor the venerable old professor who had first sent me on this impossible quest, shaking my hand, even as he collected the names and pictures of my broken, bleeding, triumphant team, ending with mine, and I said a small prayer for the ones who were no longer with us.


But then, everything changed in an instant, as I realized, horrified, the lives I'd destroyed, and the damage my little war had inflicted, not just on the battlefield, but upon the very souls of those closest to me. 

In that instant, I recall vividly the look of shame and humiliation on the face of my rival, as the officers led him away, to sink into disgrace for all time. 

It was all my fault, I had taken everything from him, every shred of dignity, and I had done it for all the world to see. Now he could never do enough to repair his tarnished family name, and he would never bridge the rift I had cut between him and his grandfather.

The old man had actually lectured him, as if his defeat at my hands, with the whole world watching, wasn't enough. And I felt, in that moment, the deepest, most soul-wrenching pity imaginable. It hit me like a wrecking ball, and all I could say was;

""I am so sorry Gary Oak."""

MikeyDeez,relationships,1390946328.0,"There's a part of me that feels like its not so much the lack of activities (any adult in a town/city could find them) that's the problem, as much as the lack of her doing this on her own that is.

For whatever reason (**I don't know the relationship; I won't speculate on how/why it got to this point**), OP's wife would rather be miserable for years than to take the initiative to find something to do. Codependency, dysfunction, *maybe* OP is a jerk; whatever.

If she wants to complain about money when she has a new jeep and ipod, I doubt that she'll get much out of volunteer service before she ""get bored"" or thinks its stupid...**then makes it OP's job to entertain her again**.

I think that some people are getting hung up on symptoms (nothing to do) and missing the problem (functional and perfectly capable adult wallows in boredom and makes everyone else miserable like her for years).  If OP continues to allow his wife to make him responsible for her enjoyment, I doubt she's *really* going to appreciate and take advantage of activities he plans.

The caveat to this is that she might not have time to do personal activities while taking care of the kids. However, I don't think you or I are getting the vibe that free time is the biggest issue or that OP is unwilling to watch the kids for a few extra hours.  

I really feel like the responsibility for OP's wife's enjoyment should come from OP's wife...including the initiative to find something to do.  I went through a phase when I acted like OP's wife...briefly when I was 21, a new college grad, and too lazy to look for work but too entitled to remain content being poor. "

Amonette2012,aion,1390946374.0,"Well it's more weeklies now. Each garrison on the map can give you 20 BM a week for PvE quests (plus 5 one-off single BM quests). In addition to that, different zones around the garrisons have a war quest that you receive automatically, which gives you 3 per day for killing one Asmodian in that area.

So there are I think 17 regular garrisons, plus two with only the ely/asmo PvE quest. That means for PvE you can get 584 BM if you do all the garrisons.

You can get a further 95 BM for doing the one-off garrison quests (good for levelling). 

If you do, say, 5 PvP quests a day you would get a weekly total of 105 extra BM.

So it is possible to get the complete set including one weapon in a week, you could do it in less time if you did all the PvP quests, or you can get it in two weeks at a more relaxed pace.

What advice would you give someone who wanted to work out and get in shape but couldn't find the time? Let's say they have a great social life but it consumes all of their time. They go out drinking after work, watch football on Sundays, are in a bunch of social groups, etc... 

It sounds to me like you have a lot going for you and a lot of things you want to do/learn but your current interests and activities are filling your days so much that you simply don't have the time for them. I don't know what the rest of your schedule is like but maybe try moving your workouts to the morning or shortening them a little. It also sounds like you prioritize spending time with your girlfriend (this is good!). Does she have much of a social life? Is it possible to find social things to do together?

Some other suggestions. If you see a post on facebook from an event or activity that sounds fun send them a message asking if you can go next time (obviously use your discretion on what/who to do this with). Something I learned after college is that drinking does not always have to end with you being drunk. You can go out to a bar, have a couple drinks, pace yourself, get a little bit of a buzz and go to bed (and more importantly wake up) feeling good. If you go to a bar with someone who criticizes you for not getting trashed then you can decide if you even want to go out with them again.

This was mainly just a stream of thought so if I think of anything else to add I'll add an edit."

Not a lot to surprise me there. The first two are obvious even if it's a little sad to see MJF crash. The Secret of My Success was on TV last week and catching it at the start just as he took his first plane ticket.. man I had to watch that movie. ""Oh Yeah"", incest by marriage, MJF doing awkward positions to kiss girls taller than him, the montage, bedroom musical chairs, I mean there's so much to love about that movie.

I'm one of those who bailed after one season of Revolution. It was really bad. Almost as bad as Falling Skies. But I watched it.. I even planned on watching Season 2... it just hasn't happened yet.. 

The Neighbors as a huge 3rd Rock fan I was into The Neighbors. Truthfully it was Parks and Rec'd. The first season was weak but the second season cemented a lot of characters and it's been much better. I mean the talent isn't quite at that Third Rock level but it's got a lot of heart and it comes across well. This is the only show on the list I want to save.

BatB... yeah.. didn't start it. Not gonna. Not unless someone tells me Ron Pearlman plays the Beast and all the ads are lying to me.

The Carrie Diaries... this just seemed indulgant even for 'chick' TV. I mean I have no idea what this is but did it really need to be made?

Intelligence.. .ahh who doesn't love vague single word show titles. It makes it awesome to google information about right? that problem (which I also have with Revenge, Betrayal, Scandal and plenty more) is the reason I never bothered to google this show."

No, GOG argues that a lack of scientific understanding (not a hole) is evidence for a creator. Of course as we progress, these gaps are filled and new ones are found. There will *always* be gaps in our knowledge; however, they are not necessarily arguments against a scientific theory.

&gt;Darwinian evolution is basically arguing that there's no scientific evidence for a god

Again, no. Darwinian evolution states nothing about God. It states that all life evolved from a common ancestor through minute changes in, among other things, genetics.

&gt;I make a distinction between micro-evolution and Darwinian evolution, because one is a very relevant survival mechanism

I think you use the terms because you think it shows you have an understanding of evolution and thus can disprove it, when you don't :/

Add an Episode to the tbl_episodes table.
Then add the lines you wish in the database to tbl_lines with each Character that stated them etc.

Create a query on the table tbl_lines that only returns the new lines you added.

    SELECT tbl_Lines.LineID, tbl_Lines.Line, tbl_Lines.CharacterID, tbl_Lines.EpisodeID
FROM tbl_Lines
WHERE (((tbl_Lines.LineID)&gt;9501));


Save this as ""qry_NewLines""

Then run the VBA Function fnc_WriteWords()
Before you run this though, (So it doesn't duplicate the words that are already in the database) change the line
    
    Set rs = db.OpenRecordset(""tbl_lines"")

to 

   Set rs = db.OpenRecordset(""qry_NewLines"")


and it should loop through an only add the new lines."

A dude saw me smoking and we started talking, turns out he does hypnotherapy and asked if I wanted to try it.  I'm like ""why not"", so we go into his car, and he starts talking to me(hypnotizing me).  I'm a skeptical person but I go along with it.  After what was anywhere between 10-30 minutes(i totally lost track of time), I came out feeling completely relaxed, refreshed, and, satisfied the way you feel after a cigarette. 

If I had stuck with it I honestly think it would have helped me quit.  But I never contacted him again out of laziness, ended up quitting later on my own after I developed asthma.

I say go for it, if the hypnotist is any good and you stick with it, I bet it will help.  And even if it doesn't, its can be very relaxing and meditative in a way.  And please post updates!"

So to be more efficient you set them to be lower than body temp and put them outside.  The body can send more blood or bring them closer to the body.  
Putting them outside the body give it more control over more precise temperatures, both warmer or colder.

We need at least platonic interaction, and the older one gets the harder it is to have consistent intimacy (even just emotional intimacy) with people who are not romantically involved with us. An investment in another person for the sake of a long term relationship, is an investment in yourself. Otherwise you will be lacking a major social component in your life, which very often causes a roadblock down the line for career and other personal advancement. 

There are plenty of successful single people out there, it's true, but you have to then really cultivate your other non-romantic relationships to give you lush and full human interaction. Otherwise your social skills may very well deteriorate. You can be an amazingly skilled and intelligent person, but if your social skills are lacking, it will prevent you from sharing those skills and ideas with the rest of the world, and thus attaining success.

An earlier game oriented PA, something like Phase -&gt; Drums -&gt; Helm of Iron Will (HotD later) -&gt; BKB is going to both come online sooner (which is important in the current meta) and is going to make you more durable than Phase -&gt; Bfury -&gt; BKB.  

In fact, Phase + HotD + Drums + BKB is still less expensive than Phase + Bfury + BKB, while giving you an easier buildup, and much more durability.

The extensions from the core should either be Deso for raw power, Basher for control and damage, Satanic for durability, or possibly AC for a mix of offensive and defensive stats.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1390946888.0,"Unfortunately for me, SRS may be one of the very few internet forums that has ever banned me. This was relatively early on in my redditing before my comment history was stained by TRP posts. I made one comment, *""You're right &lt;user/&gt;. He does sound like a shitlord.""* I think one of them thought I was being sarcastic and had me banned for that one comment. I looked through my comment history at the time, didn't know what I did wrong. I said ""fuck it"". And so ended my attempt at understanding one of reddit's most infamous communities. I don't even think it's that bad. They are just very trigger happy with censorship/banning or no strict rules. I guess. When I look at the sidebar, and network of subs all fitting under the ""SRS fempire"", it's hard to take it seriously or come to any fair conclusions.

However, I think I *can* somewhat elaborate pillburt's assessment of the situation.

In my mud-diving, I've gone to some of the most infamous forums I could think of online, as a matter of curiousity. Keep in mind that many of these groups definitely hate me for who I am (and I can't change that), so it made it all the harder for me to admit that I would have initially been stomped if I tried to debate them. I just kept shut, and tried to read and understand people.

These people spend a lot of their time and hate-fueled energy thinking and studying things that the average person just never considers, because it's simply ""not PC"" to talk about. 

For example, most people, including myself, wouldn't talk or even think too much about cross-cultural/cross-race standards of beauty/fitness and the impact miscegenation could have on that as well as genetic fitness. They actually put a lot of time and energy into researching those things and understand terms and concepts I never thought about.

Sure, a lot of their information scrambled between truths, half-truths, and outright lies, but I wouldn't have been able to distinguish because I was out of my depth. I had to do my own research, before coming up with have nuanced arguments. The well-spoken of the bunch could wipe the floor in a debate with the average Joe pulled off the street if the subject was about race relations, race history, etc... you know, the stuff racial nationalists talk and obsess about all the time. 

Liberals who spend their time in PC/self-censored communities often get comfort from the fact that mainstream opinion already supports their views, and they rarely have to validate them. They are comfortable sitting back, pointing and laughing at the lowest common denominator of their rivals (and to be fair, their rivals can go pretty low). Comfortable that at least *someone* intelligent on their side, like some scholarly liberal champion in academia, has already proven them right. Comfortable that if these ""fringe"" groups came public, they'd lose their jobs or be publicly shamed to oblivion. They are rarely forced into honest discussions.

This is a dangerous way of dealing with political/ideological rivals, because it's essentially a race to the bottom, with both sides cherry-picking the worst the opponents have to offer. It also makes everyone weak to manipulation by trolls and psyops. I've actually found radical groups to be a bit more aware and open to these possibilities. They are often conspiracy theorists so they are [rightfully] wary of the FBI. Some people talked about their personal histories being betrayed by Hal Turner (an informant), for example.

The only times I've tried talking to liberal friends about uncomfortable subjects, I've always felt the pressure to mitigate my tone, thesaurus my choices of words, obscure my meaning, etc. And I would still fear judgment on my character just for even bringing up the subject. Always this fear of a response, *""How dare you even bring this subject up? What is your agenda?""*

People who self-censor themselves and refuse to talk about controversial/awkward topics, even amongst trusted friends, do themselves this long-term disservice for short term comfort. "

Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.

&gt;**Gilbert**: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.

&gt;**Göring**: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, **the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.**"

CrayonOfDoom,gaming,1390946955.0,"I don't even mind including the gimmick in the system.

I knew that having the main controller be something I wouldn't enjoy would seriously hamper how I wanted to play games.

Also, I mostly agree with the technology part.  Watching my dad learn how to use a smartphone was one of the funniest things ever.  ""I wish they just sold regular phones!

There's cases where technology simply evolved naturally, without really having gimmicks, though.  Like personal computers were for... well, personal computing.  Maybe they were a gimmick to people who bought them and didn't need automated spreadsheets or word processing, but they were basically invented to vastly simplify what many people needed to do.  They evolved because it just happens that people wanted to make games on them, or wanted them to do things faster, or... and the technology naturally evolved."

dublos,OkCupid,1390947235.0,"**photos**

top 3 photos awesome.. though I'm not a fan of cutting off the top of your head.   Bottom 3 photos, not so much.. number 4 is too dark, and number 5 and 6 look very old in comparison to the others.

If you could find a picture similar to your current main photo where you're not cutting off the top of your head and you're looking at the camera and not your food.. that would be ideal.

**Self Summary**

Brief..  there's not a lot here that's going to pull a person's interest in, and there aren't really any hooks for them to ask about and start a conversation.     Who are you, what formed you into the person you are?  Are you a NY Native, where did you grow up?   Was your family huge or small?   What drives you to volunteer, why do you like the clubs you're in and what are they?   Give people something that's *you* to hang their hat on and start to get to know you.

**doing with your life**

Good start, whatever pieces of the questions above are more ""what you are doing with your life"" put here, the pieces that are more ""this is who I am"" but in self summary.

**really good at**

good humor, but can you think of something you are good at that makes you a good choice of someone to date?   Not required, but an opportunity missed if you can't think of something.

**first thing people notice**

Not bad.  Not visual, but if you're in a club or coffee shop and the first thing they hear is your laugh I suppose that works.

**Favorites**

So.. What's the first sentence of  100 Years of Solitude? ""Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.""?  If it's the best in your view, quote it.. don't make them go look for it.  That's the hook to ask you why you think it's the best and launch a conversation.     American book review puts it 4th.  First is still Melville ""Call me Ishmael""

You're missing food.   Food is important, not just because it's a listed category that's requested, but because it is a opportunity for your prospective date to picture themselves on a date with you.. so cuisines, favorite dishes and even a favorite restaurant would be good.

**six**

Good.. could be better, but this is always a tough section to generate conversation from.

**thinking about**

Good... but also pretty generic.. Add something that's more specific to you and how your mind works.   This is another missed opportunity to give someone a hook to launch a conversation from.

**Friday**

There need to be youtube videos of these lip sync contests.  They should not be linked but they should be referred to and offered as bribes if their messages are eye catching enough.

**private**

Is it private because 94 is so low for such an awesome running/dancing tune or because Taylor Swift is a guilty pleasure?

**message me**

Again.. there needs to be a youtube video of you performing this.. up the bribe to they have to make it to the third date before you give them that link.

Excellent though because it makes me look at your profile picture and say that'd be hilarious, I want to see that.. hopefully same mental process happens for a lady you want to meet."

Fahris,Games,1390947248.0,"Absolutely. The worst raid nights in WoW were always the we've-been-stuck-on-this-boss-for-weeks-and-we'll-obviously-never-kill-him-but-we-might-as-well-wipe-again nights. To make that worse, some people just bring that attitude no matter what. 

Recently in Guild Wars 2, the developers introduced a temporary boss that takes about 150 people, ~25 people per lane, which alternate going into a portal to cut chains on a giant marionette that is trying to kill you. Those 25 people get split up into groups of 5 (randomly assigned to a platform when you enter a portal), and all 5 groups must succeed in order to cut a chain. Fail to cut a chain a couple times, and you all die.

This means that in a fight of 150 people, if a group of 5 people fails to succeed at their objective, you're that much closer to a wipe. If that happens 5 times, you fail and don't kill the boss - which means that if you get 5 inexperienced players together on a platform a few times, or a group portals in on top of a mine that one of the bosses puts down (for example) and wipes, you're all screwed.

So, some people start saying that everyone is going to fail in local chat before and during the fight, and getting everyone down. Anecdotally, the only times I've seen the boss killed, everyone has been very positive in map chat, and cheering on each lane as they get to take their turn cutting chains. "

beefcakez,naturalbodybuilding,1390947310.0,"Not completely, but I wish I did :(

I've been pretty lackluster in terms of progress in the gym since last fall, due to well. . . . life, but that's okay for me.
Darn, I was hoping for more discussion here too. 

I'm not using any certain periodization so to speak right now. Just trying to regain lost strength after being super lazy in the gym late last year and early this year. 

However, I'm currently trying to write myself out a routine for the future. Looking heavily into doing an [Undulating Periodization](http://www.myosynthesis.com/workouts/undulating-periodization-bodybuilding) style to test it out on myself for an 8-10 week period, possibly longer. Will update and post routine in the future. 

Historically, I've simply made progress with the HIT style thinking in regards to accumulation (must add weight or reps each workout) as well as a mixture of different routines. 

Truthfully, it's been a hodge-podge concoction of so many training styles and routines that I can't even recall them. I have a training log, but it's at home (at work now), and I really have only used it for my accumulation-style workouts. 

I.e. I did 6 reps at xxx lbs last week, so I need to either do 7-8 reps at xxx lbs, or do 6 reps at xxy lbs, etc. 

Whatever I chose, the 'intensity' always increased in one form or another. 

So, regarding the periodization, I haven't done a long-term cyclical program in a long time. Maybe because I've competed about mid-year  since 2011 and most of the time it's been spent either in contest prep (mine are usually 20 weeks long) or in a 'get back to your pre-contest prep level' training after I turned into a weakling. During those times of strength regain, I did my accumulation style workouts. 

Hope this contributes to the discussion. I've made progress, but it's more than often 'in spite of' the training I've been doing.

I don't think that's the way woman .. or anyone should be looking for relationships. If you want to lower your bar for interest sure.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1390947484.0,"Ok, a couple things though.

1) I don't see how this negates my point about an unrealistic utopia....marxists have tried in several countries to overthrow capitalism, and aside from cuba which is questionable at the very least (I've heard it claimed it has better living standards than much of the surrounding region, minus the US of course), each attempt has been an abject failure. Russia collapsed, North Korea is hell on earth, and China has largely moved away from communism (economically speaking, they still maintain the oppressive government) and appears to be hypercapitalist to me. Each country also has not gotten rid of inequality, they just worsened it. The elites who run the government are well off, everyone else is in poverty. Above all, those countries generally are dictatorships. I'm sorry, but the utopian dream marxists create just doesnt seem to work in reality very well. It's been a nightmare quite frankly.

2) I'm actually familiar with the thesis/antithesis stuff, learned about that in high school. I think it's valid to a degree. I'd say the libertarian paradigm is meant to be the antithesis of marxism, to the point you actually have some people literally calling it the total polar opposite of communism, but quite frankly, I'm a bit of a fan of the horseshoe theory. While libertarianism, as far as ideals goes, IS polar opposite to marxism, it begins to resemble it in many ways. Extremes do that. They're so near, yet so far away. And that was the point I was making. They also promote their own little idealistic picture of people practicing capitalism without the state (while marxists promote a society without capitalism and a transitory dictatorship). The problem is, both, to me, are unrealistic. The failure of communism is it failed to take into consideration human greed and how the leaders of the transitory regime would become oppressive themselves and make it permanent. On the other hand, ancaps seem completely oblivious to the idea that without the state, corporations and elites in society would just establish a ""psuedogovernment"" (an entity that acts like a government, but it's technically a government because they legalistically define their way around calling it a government) that also becomes oppressive and looks out for its own interests. So that's kind of what I'm getting at with my whole ""the two are the same"" thing. I recognize in terms of values, they're about as opposite as you can get. But at the same time, I also recognize that in practice, the two will end up bearing a resemblance to one another in the sense that both will attempt to eliminate power structures they see as oppressive, but that they will ultimately fail, as new ones worse than before will just take their place. 

To me, if you want to eliminate oppressive power structures, you need to take the American approach. You can't try to flat out eliminate them, because something will ALWAYS take their place. The idea is to limit factions and pit them against one another in the form of a government just competent enough to do its job, but dysfunctional enough where a single party can't just take over the whole thing and become oppressive. The problem, as I see it, is that while the government isn't perfect, it's done a fairly decent job at limiting factions, just watch Boehner and Obama go at it. The weakness of our current system is inadequate protections to limit the power of money and big business, which allows them to use their freedom of speech to drown out all other voices and buy out the politicians to basically force them to promote their corporate agendas. This, to me, is what needs to be worked on. 

3) To point out the difference between the idealist approach of libertarians and the materialist approach of marxists, why not use both? Both attitudes and materialism make a difference. If you don't have the materials to make a social change work, then it's not going to work. Marxism and basic income won't make sense among subsistence level farmers, for instance. However, it's also possible for attitudes to trail behind our material abilities. This is what I think will be a growing problem in the 21st century, as the US keeps trying to preserve its obsession with job creation in the face of outsourcing and automation, when in reality we should be doing stuff like establishing more social programs like the basic income, and trying to shorten our work week to create more employment. As you can tell, I dislike extremes. I don't think the answer is A or B. I think it's C: all of the above. I think we should look at all systems and take the good parts while ignoring the bad. I think capitalism is a necessity at this point of time, and an adequate means of distributing goods and growing the economy to a degree. I also think marxism is correct in its critiques of capitalism, and how left to its own devices its exploitative. However, I dislike the hypercapitalism and the worship of the free market libertarians like to push, while also disliking the idea of revolution that marxists promote, because let's face it, as much as I complain about things capitalism does wrong, I would NOT want to live in a communist country. 

I'm a pragmatist, and a utilitarian more than anything. I don't like to subscribe to a particular philosophy and try to take it to its logical extremes, because in my experience and study, all of these extremes ultimately end in some form of dystopia. Rather, I like to take the good ideas from all philosophies and create a mishmash. I guess it's the equivalent of your ""synthesis"". And like you said, sometimes it isn't necessarily logically consistent, but as far as ethics go, I think trying to create a unified logically consistent moral system is highly overrated.

DrStephenFalken,AskReddit,1390947500.0,"&gt; member of a normal restaurant is drastically underpaid for the hours and energy they put into a shift.

That's very true. People don't realize how poor cooks are. Most cooks live 3 cooks to an apartment as where most servers have their own apartment or live with one other roommate. 

With that said, I read an article in GQ a year or so back and it was about a James Beard winning chef, and how the restaurant had won Three Michelin stars but the cooks (including head Chef) were making $4 an hour. They cooks worked long hours and the place in Chicago only had twenty tables and was only opened for 5 hours a night but had reservations backed up for months on end. The cooks put so much time in that their annual salary equated to $4 an hour. Now I bet you anything all of the servers in that place made 5x what the BOH did. It's so jacked up IMO. The cooks are putting in 16 hour days and living way below the poverty line. As where the servers work 5-7 hours a night and make a giant amount of money for little of nothing. "

It was a long time coming. My father had stopped coming home before the split. I hardly ever saw him. He would be at work from 7 am to 11 pm just so he could avoid coming home to his angry wife. 

When my father visited me when I was older, I asked him why he ever married my mom--he said that he couldn't explain why he loved her, he just did. I was also able to confront him about how he just let us go with her even knowing that she was as unstable as she is. I told him it hurt that I had to deal with her and protect my brother without him around. Essentially the whole, ""I was just a kid, you were the adult, you should have protected us."" 

My dad basically said he was a weak person and he couldn't do any of that. He said it was his failing and he was sorry for it. To this day he doesn't stand up to my mother if they are ever together. 

There was one incident 3 years ago when we were all at my mom's house (my now boyfriend in tow) and they were arguing about money. My mom was confronting him about him not giving her enough money for his son (my brother). My mom was advancing towards my dad with scissors in her hand and gesturing at him with it. My brother took my boyfriend out to the balcony while I stood between my mom and my dad and I just kept repeating to her to put the scissors away. 

I don't think she meant to use them for anything (she's already had counseling and had been getting better) but I didn't want to take any chances. I think back on that now and it really spoke volumes about my dad's character--that I had to step between him and my mom to keep *him* safe. 

My mom is under the impression that she will live out the rest of her days being supported by my dad. My dad's told us that he's going to stop sending money as soon as my little brother is out of her house. My mom doesn't work... I have no idea how she's going to support herself after the money stops going to her. 

My dad asked me for advice on whether to really divorce her or continue this cross Atlantic (he's in China, she's in Canada) separation. I have no idea what to tell him. Divorcing her could prove problematic and he could end up paying a lot of alimony (Taiwanese divorce laws).

MarvinTheAndroid42,nonononoyes,1390947723.0,"I'm not so naive as to give something my support without facts to back it up. My car has extremely crisp, neutral steering, I've taken it on fast twisty roads and through tight dirt roads without a so much as sound from the tires. The boxer engine is an amazing piece of machinery, it's low center of gravity and symmetrical design destroy any signs of body roll or torque steer(see the Focus ST) and because of the close relationship with Porsche(yes, they get along quite well) the suspension systems on various models perform exceptionally well. On models like the B4 you can find suspension actually tuned by Porsche. 

All cars, regardless of their origin, are limited by their drivetrain. Without a good drivetrain a car is useless. In snow, for example, my car actually annoys me because I am not able to slide. It's just too well attached to the road for that sort of thing. 
Even a type R is limited by that factor and suffers for it.

As well, this isn't *just* all wheel drive. It's an almost undefeated symmetrical full time all wheel drive system touched only by Audi, who actually invented the first AWD system for their Quattro rally car. It's the kind of AWD system that allows a Forester XT to put a 350z to shame. 

You're lying to yourself if you think FWD has grip(heh) in this debate. A type R is good, but it's not that good.

wolfkin,AskMen,1390947749.0,I think the collective beef with redpill is that their wisdom is limited but they present it as unlimited. It's not that the techniques don't work or even that most of them are rapey. I assume they aren't. It's that they present this worldview as absolute when it's not. It's a worldview when you have a very specific redpill goal. When you're looking for grown up relationships and stuff  that redpill stuff won't work.

Uncomfortable being the only gender on set? Maybe not, because the first thought that comes to mind is how improbable it would be to work on a set entirely crewed by women. The industry isn't going to change its bullshit before I graduate and get out there working, but I'll be damned if any of my crew openly has an issue with my gender. I'll be damned if my justified anger at being discriminated against is brushed off as being ""overly PC"" or being a ""pissy feminist"". I'm a filmmaker for fuck's sake.

1. Make a scene at our rehearsal dinner about not having wine.  We were paying for the event and had decided to go with a casual beer/bbq theme for the rehearsal so we could afford to invite everyone.  She does drink beer, but on this occasion she ""needed"" wine and sent someone to go out and buy it for her (and only her).  Of course, she couldn't be convinced to eat until her wine arrived.

2. Not showing up to the bridal suite where I (her only daughter) was getting ready for my wedding day.  I had a surprise for her and waited and waited for her to come until the ceremony was about to start and I had to get moving.  On my way out, I found her downstairs in the dining room of the hotel telling a very animated story to a captive audience of people, many of whom later asked me if everything was okay because my mom was ""not acting like a mother of the bride"", haha.

3. We used something cultural/sentimental in our ceremony and after showing it to my mom, she went out and bought a different version of the item that she liked better.  Relatives caught wind of her campaign to switch the items and convinced me not to be bullied on the point, so we stuck with our original item, which my mom volunteered to hold for us and present at the appropriate moment during the ceremony.  Unsurprisingly, she ""accidentally"" shattered it into a million pieces after the ceremony was underway and spent the rest of the day publicly thanking God and the stars (but mostly herself) for having the foresight to purchase a backup and bring it ""just in case"". Nmom saves the day!

I'm not even mad -- at this point in my life I just think it's funny."

I'm sure we could also require full access to the bank accounts of every student on scholarship or Pell Grant, too. Except we don't do that, because we literally -- as a society -- think that 18-year-old students are more fiscally responsible than fully grown adults with jobs (you have to have a job to qualify for a lot of government aid).

Face it: the rules put in place on government handouts are pretty unique to poor people, and they're not very effective. They amount to purely punishment and a circus act to satisfy ""Good Upstanding Americans"" that those damn minorities (let's not pretend welfare reform arguments don't have a strong racial undercurrent) aren't stealing their hard-earned money.

After a few months of working jobs I wasn't trained for; I asked them to promote me to cook, they wouldn't. I kept showing them for a couple of more months that I could do everything in the restaurant while doing my job. 

I eventually got demoted to cashier because they hired in one of the cooks family to do my job. After, that about two weeks later I walked across the street to a competing restaurant that was higher end and applied for a cooks position. They hired me on as a cook and I got promoted and kept moving up the chain there. So every time I got promoted I would walk back across the street in my chef coat to the restaurant that wouldn't promote when I worked there. I would have lunch and talk to my old coworkers who were in the same spot two years later. I would flaunt my job around and show them how far I came and what I was capable of doing and what they passed up on. It always felt good to do that. "

Thinness being attractive isn't fucking arbitrary. It's science. Evolution tells my caveman brain what is attractive and what is not. Hip:waist ratio is critical, as is thinness. If you're fat, not only will I think you're gross, but my caveman brain will tell me to stay away from you as you're probably not healthy enough to bear or raise my children. 

[From Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness)

""Men, on average, tend to be attracted to women who are shorter than they are, have a youthful appearance, and exhibit features such as a symmetrical face, full breasts, full lips, and a low waist-hip ratio.""

Many people don't like a request for an explanation because it's probably something intangible like ""no chemistry"", of if there is a specific reason the person being rejected will try and change your mind.  Also, another request in a couple days is frustrating because it might come off as not taking the no seriously.  It's unlikely that her feelings are going to change in a couple days.  
  
&gt; But when the guy gets rejected with no explanation, the assumption is that he's been rejected solely on superficial reasons - such as appearance.

I notice through interactions with her that she really cannot empathize with another person, even her children. She doesn't feel pain automatically upon seeing a loved one suffer like most of us do. It's not that she doesn't WANT to feel empathy, it's that her mental/biological make up doesn't provide her with that basic human tool. 

So I think her finally going to counseling helped her identify that, and it helped her understand FINALLY the effect her actions have had. I don't think she understands how it *feels*, but I think she understands enough to know that it's *terrible*.

Try turning the fan speed up to about 75% and see how large the drop is from 72 towards the ambient temperature of the room.

I run most of my cards at about 85-95% max fan speed with aftermarket coolers, knowing that this is nowhere the rated max of the motor, but rather the designed maximum for that particular implementation. With the reference coolers on the 290 it does get a little bit more complicated, but you should be fine running them at something like 80%+, unless noise is a concern. Generally the cooler they are the longer they will last, and fan over usage is never going to be a practical concern within the time-frames we're talking about *for most fan designs*.

Support down here isn't massive given that LA is 100 miles north and were conditioned from the time were born to not like Los Angeles, in addition to the fact that San Diego fans suck, but Galaxy has almost all of the support from the MLS crowd down here. 

What lead to San Diego supporting Galaxy? The lack of another MLS team to support, mostly due to the general disorder of Chivas, Beckham/Donovan and non-Mexican soccer fans not really fitting in with Xolos. 

What's holding suport here back? Apathy toward MLS, and the distance between here and Carson, commuting up there is a bitch and half, and the distance largely removes the ""local"" attraction of Galaxy down here."

When I got into a car accident (not my fault) my mom used the insurance money to buy my sister a much nicer car and bought me a POS that didn't even last 6 months.

She went off to college first, so there was no money for me, so I went into the military. 

Fast forward to current times and I'm happily married with kids, I own my own house and have a well paid position working for the govt (thanks to my military service).

She just recently graduated from community college, is an ""artist"" with a crippling ammount of student loans. Lives part time with mom and is driving a car I gave her when I upgraded (I also pay her insurance because it's my car and I'm nice like that)

The best revenge is the joy of having a better life. I used to be so envious of how things were seemingly handed to her on a silver platter and how I had to work so much harder to obtain the same results.

Diet has only marginal effect on those metrics.  Your high T-levels will have more of an deleterious effect than anything you eat.  There's nothing wrong with high cholesterol as long as your ratios are healthy.  Cholesterol levels are a function primarily of body composition, then genetics.  I wouldn't stress over it, unless your doctor advises you otherwise."
neverdeadned,AdviceAnimals,1390948531.0,"tell that to my roommate. he thinks the sell-by date means it's inedible after that.  just last week he tried to throw away a bunch of cookies because they were ""a couple of days old""."

PantheraLupus,AskReddit,1390948543.0,"I made a big ""house"" out of boxes when I was little, with a few big boxes that i broke down and taped together. I pretended it was a bedroom, a cottage, an office and a castle interchangeably. I even made a door and windows that opened and closed and slept in it for a fair few nights. My little sister was also not allowed inside eheheh. Ah, I haven't remembered that in a long time. One of my few good childhood memories. I think they may have been moving boxes."

bamgrinus,malefashionadvice,1390948552.0,"I've been looking for a decent-looking cardigan that's a reasonable bargain for, like, awhile now, and for some reason I'm just having no luck.  It's not like they're a rare item or anything.  I probably should've just gotten one from uniqlo awhile ago, but I'm always a little wary of going too cheap on knits."
