I traveled through Central America and cursed the fact that I couldn't speak Spanish and I know I missed out on so much because of it.

Gertiel,Foodforthought,1388838615.0,"The thing about this is brain death is declared to the best of the knowledge of the doctors. Consider the case of Rom Houben. His mother insisted he understood what she said to him. Doctors vehemently insisted he did not. After 23 years, he came out of his ""coma"". He'd actually been awake and fully cognizant, but unable to talk or move to reply in really any way doctors recognized. 

Then there are numerous cases of patients declared dead who later revived. Colleen Burns (cardiac arrest as the result of a drug overdose), Vanessa Tanasio (declared dead of a heart attack, revived 42 minutes later), Jamie Ogg (premature baby spontaneously revived 5 minutes after declared dead), Tony Yahle (revived 45 minutes after declared), unnamed premature baby girl (declared dead, spent hours in a box in the morgue, father saw movement when visiting there and effected baby being rushed to Bogata for treatment for undeveloped lungs), Evangelina Garza (pronounced dead, spontaneously revived) - these are but a few examples. 

Now I will grant you, these cases are RARE, but they do happen. I don't know that we should indefinitely wait to see if this happens, or that we shouldn't. Rom Houben seems to be in a lot of difficulties in the available videos, and I would think he'd be incredibly lucky to eventually be able to care for himself in any significant way. Even so, look at Stephen Hawkings. He's pretty helpless, yet still manages pretty significant contributions to the world of science.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388838992.0,"&gt;It's funny (to me at least, I don't get out a lot) that the two examples you mention as 'proof' gender roles are hardwired into us and therefore will never go away entirely are very, very unnatural.

That's not at all what the OP said.  Opening doors and paying for meals are examples of dominance display, and what OP is suggesting is that dominance display is an integral part of mating.  he says as much right here:

&gt;However, I don't believe that the traditional dating practices, such as men **being dominant, leading interactions, and being ""masculine""** will ever go away. I believe that these actions create attraction in the opposite gender roles because it is ""hardwired"" into our brains.

The dominance display is hardwired; the ways dominance is displayed are culturally constructed.

&gt;We actually excel in ignoring things that are hard wired into us (getting scared for fun, having sex without intending to be a parent, eating cooked foods, wearing clothes, smoking, surgery...).

I can pick all of these apart, but I'm just going to focus on one:

&gt;getting scared for fun

The fun part about getting scared is that your brain quickly adjusts and realizes the danger is not real, which floods your brain with neurochemicals that make you feel calm and relaxed.  We are hardwired to feel fear as a reaction to certain stimuli -- seeing others in pain, displays of aggression and violence, screaming, loud sounds, surprises -- and we have discovered that we can manipulate this fear response to stimulate the release of these neurochemicals (I think its dopamine, but don't quote me on that).

Horror films make uses of our vulnerability to these stimuli, and the inherent safety of the theater, to provide a safe, controlled environment in which to ""shoot up"" and enjoy the high that comes from fear.

This doesn't demonstrate your argument nearly as well as you think it does, because curiosity and experimentation are also hardwired human drives.  We have a hardwired tendency to play with our own instincts.

We are hardwired to desire sex, and we are hardwired to respond to children and protect them, and in pre-technological society, this would be sufficient to produce and raise young.  People would be driven to have sex, babies would result, and then people would feel compelled to protect and rear them.

But there's no actual connection between the desire for sex and the desire for children.  They are two completely independent drives, which is why the discovery of birth control was so awesome for humans.

Again, it comes back to experimentation with our drives, and manipulating them for fun and profit.  We are hardwired to eat food, and perfectly capable of eating raw foods and thriving.  But we're smart and experimental, and we discovered that fire pre-digests food and makes it easier to eat.  That's not a contradiction of our hardwired drives.  The drive is to eat, not to eat only raw foods.  That's why when we discovered food tastes better when you cook it, we started cooking the shit out of everything.

We are hardwired to play with things, and find novel solutions, and because of these hardwired tendencies we make and horde technology.  That's why we wear clothes, smoke, perform surgery, etc.  Because those things are not contradictory to our drives.

Okay, well, surgery is contradictory to the hardwired drives of the *patient*, but this is why we use general anesthesia.  Because we have found that its very hard for people to sit still be operated on if they are conscious.  Sitting still while someone cuts you open is contrary to the hardwired pain response (fight or flight)."

In the end, she did change, and she admitted to me that it took so long because she thought she couldn't do it, but the only thing holding her back was herself.

I don't think you realize how he feels. It made me feel as if she wasn't attracted to me, and I would keep blaming it on myself, no matter how well I knew the problem lied with her and how much she tried to reassure me. It really made me feel like shit.

Perhaps ask him to talk about how the entire situation makes him feel, and try to resolve it.

I would turn down sex every time I got the impression that my SO did it just to please me. You have no idea how worthless it made me feel, like some pitiful loser who had to have his primal needs satisfied. She kept insisting that she never did it just for me, or out of pity, but that doesn't change the fact that it made me feel like it did, and that felt absolutely horrible. Stop giving him pity sex, and try to work on your libido. A man wants to feel wanted, he doesn't want to feel like he's just getting his way out of pity."

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1388839093.0,"&gt; It's my understanding that such cloaks would have been reserved for officers (Caesar for example being noted always wearing a bright red paludamentum)

Great catch! And it's unlikely that any besides the officers would have worn those distinguishing red cloaks - we aren't even sure if they wore red tunics. There's an argument to be made that the legions wore white (undyed), or even yellow tunics - Vitruvius noted that red and yellow were the cheapest dyes to use. We know that the *cavalry* wore red or orange-brown tunics - we're just not 100% about the infantry :) Regarding their cloaks, it was the higher ranking officers who wore the rich red cloaks - standard legionaries would have worn cheaper, woolen cloaks, *probably* undyed. 

&gt; Was this something the producers simply made up? I understand that our conception of the actual mechanics of Roman battle are incomplete, but is there any source evidence at all that speaks to them rotating ranks, rather than rotating centuries or whole cohorts?


They made it up. We've got no evidence for that kind of rotation actually happening - though, of course, it's a matter of debate on how line rotation worked, especially regarding the manipular legions. Some believe that, after the *hastati* had worn down the enemy, the *principes* were fed into the line. Others believe that the *hastati* were pulled back, the *principes* advancing to the front line in their place. But I digress - it's absolutely possible that the rotation that they showed in *Rome* could have been used - I've just never seen any evidence that makes that claim.

junlinu,FinancialCareers,1388839474.0,"Note: I'm a 3rd year junior at a regional target school in America going into banking so that's the experience I will be imparting to you.

If you want to go into banking I highly recommend tapping into your networks. You said you've worked with NGOs and a start-up. I'm sure there's plenty of resources in your past experiences. In America, many of the board members of NGOs are C-level executives (CEO, COO, CFO) of businesses. Do well for the NGOs and hopefully get in contact with them because they can help you substantially. Go from there and contact individuals in fields you may be interested and NETWORK. I cannot stress this enough, particularly if you're going into Investment Banking where who you know is more important than what you know. Talk to them, get to know them and what they do, and have them forward you to other finance people. It will be a good start towards getting a feel for what you want to do and getting your name out there. Particularly if you're from a non-target.

As for internships, I can only speak from my past experience. My summer after my sophomore year I worked at a financial advising firm and now I'm working at a large European Wealth Management bank hoping to get an internship in Investment Banking this summer. Looking back, I wish I had started earlier so it's good you're thinking about this now. I recommend finding an internship at a financial advisory firm, one that does lots of investments and life insurance. They usually take many interns and it's not as competitive but you still can network with many people and learn a lot. Then from there hopefully begin working towards finding a position during school. Either intern or study abroad every summer. Try to get boutique investment banking internships during the school year and land internships with big name banks during the summer because these larger banks have an actual 10-week program. And remember: always be networking.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388839922.0,"&gt; We have examples of masculine cultures moving towards feminine traits with no change in genetic information, which I honestly think damns you theory all by itself. Think of Feudal and Imperial Japan vs otaku and sexless Japan. Surrendering to gaijin sure did a number on Japans sense of manliness.

Actually, I think you may have just inadvertently demonstrated the correctness of the OP's position.

As you note, surrendering to gaijin sure did a number on Japans sense of manliness.  It lead to a widespread sense of cultural emasculation, and a generation of Japanese men were brought up with extreme doubts about their masculinity and virility.  Feminism had a similiar effect in the West, though not so pronounced (but modern Western men definitely perceive themselves as less masculine that their fathers generation, and especially their [grandfather's generation](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/overly-manly-man)).

And what do we see in Japan? ""otaku and sexless Japan.""  And what do we see in the West?  More people staying single longer, less people getting married, lower birth rates, etc.

I'm not saying this is a fully-formed argument, but if a strong correlation could be found between a strong cultural sense of masculinity and higher birth rates, that would seem to at least hint at a fundamental connection between male dominance display and female sexual response.

It's also noteworthy that both dating experts and pick-up artists are in total agreement that confidence is the key component to male sexual success.  And examples of confident men are always also examples of men unabashedly embracing their masculinity."

PatHeist,pcmasterrace,1388839942.0,"Depending on where you live, it is entirely reasonable for the ISP to handle distribution to individual apartments from a shared fiber end point in the basement to a single ethernet jack in the wall. This has actually become the standard in most places with fiber connections reaching the user rather than a street hub. Welcome to the 21st century. Beyond that it is your landlord's responsibility to ensure you have reliable access to that. And, as I've said a dozen fucking times by now, it is entirely possible that your local laws mean you are allowed to run Cat5 throughout the walls of where you live.

Are you incapable of reading? Are you mentally retarded? I honestly don't know what's going on here. The points that are applicable in rarer situations I made very, extremely, redundantly fucking clear to be dependent on your local laws. Like they are. And for the other points I also made clear that it depends on your local laws, but that most places will favor you, as a tenant. 

Whenever someone decides to make money off housing you or providing you with residence, they decide to pick up an awful lot of legal responsibility in doing so. In many places (including parts of the US) you don't even have to be paying them money - these are legal obligations on their part if they let you stay more than a certain number of days. And part of those obligations tend to include acknowledging that you living there means they provide you with a home, not a box that you magically hover around in. Holes for paintings and hanging shelves are generally considered normal wear. The door on your refrigerator could fall off and it would be your landlord's responsibility to fix it if the fridge was there when you moved in, and as long as you weren't grossly negligent with it. The same goes for just about every aspect of your living there. So, depending on what your local laws are concerning pulling non-high voltage cables, it would be entirely reasonable for that to fall under acceptable wear in terms of holes. Especially if you patched the holes up before leaving. And at the very worst, they can deduct a reasonable amount of money from your security deposit in order to patch up the holes. Something that they'd have to take you to court over if they wanted to do. Not to mention that your security deposit should be kept in a separate account in accordance with laws nearly everywhere, and that you are entitled to the interest it gains. So, in all likelihood, they would end up having to give you more money back for your security deposit than you initially gave them regardless of your local laws or your contract allowing you to pull ethernet cables through the walls for your LAN.

But no, I'm a moron and totally ridiculous because I fucking read up on laws and know that statistics is a fucking science? It's a wonderment that some people manage to survive into adulthood without offing themselves. "

TheJumboShrimp,infj,1388840137.0,"These are just my opinions, but I think that ""matching"" based on Myers-Briggs profile isn't very useful in our individual lives. Sure, there might be statistical ""best"" and ""worst"" matches, but even within the same profile, each of our needs in a relationship are different. INTJs work well for me because I like listening and discussing new interesting topics in a passive way, but lots of INFJs find the sort of things INTJs find interesting to be boring and dry. Also, not all INTJs are calm conversationalists like the kind I want to be with. There are tons of argumentative INTJs, and that's just fine, but I wouldn't want to be with them at all. And I'm sure that my preference is largely from familiarity. I know that I enjoy this kind of dynamic in my life, but if I had different experiences and more exposure to other types of people, maybe I would have different preferences. My point is that matching types is silly to me because there are more than 16 personalities in the world. Myers-Briggs is more about general, vague emotional needs and things to generally avoid. If you and someone else meet each others emotional needs and avoid the things that get on yalls nerves, that sounds like a good foundation for a relationship.

About emotional development in INTJs, I think the two most important things are learning to listen and take light criticism well. INTJs have a habit of arguing against any criticism, which seems like they're arrogant stubborn jerks, but then when they're alone they really think about what you say and amend their views if you made a good point. I can understand why they do this. If they press back against you, you can go more into detail and they can think about things more deeply. Unfortunately, they tend to do this even with those that don't want to argue, which can stress their relationships. I think that all parts of their lives can be improved if they learn to look for cues whether it's appropriate to ask for more detail, to argue back if they're both enjoying it, or to let it go if the other is bored or frustrated. In the end, their emotional need is to flesh out their own views, not convince others, and if they can learn to recognize that, it can really improve their social lives.

As always, the most important developments are unique to the individual, but learning to express their Te with those around them in mind is something that all INTJs seem to struggle through in their early 20s."

DayMan-FTW,nintendo,1388840709.0,"&gt;If Nintendo overcharged, they would have no sales.

Not entirely true. Many consumers will pony up obtuse amounts for something regardless of how expensive it is. ([Monster HDMI cables](http://www.monsterproducts.com/HDMI/linelist/hdmilist.asp?CAT=1)  would like to have a word with you.)

I'll bet Nintendo sold a shit tonne more copies of the 30c promo games over normal priced games because they were just too good to pass up. Even the ones I didn't want, and still haven't played I bought because hell, they were 30c!

They just aren't interested in finding that equilibrium. It seems they're more interested in a higher price per unit and less sales. Which to me, seems counter-intuitive when the WiiU is going through a tough patch. Why not give people a silver lining of heaps of amazing, cheap retro games while they wait for the big hitters to come out?

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1388840728.0,"Sure thing! The incident was in 9 BCE, concerning the death of Drusus Caesar - here's the quote from [Cassius Dio!](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html)

&gt; Drusus undertook to cross this river, but failing in the attempt, set up trophies and withdrew. For a woman of superhuman size met him and said: ""Whither, pray, art thou hastening, insatiable Drusus? It is not fated that thou shalt look upon all these lands. But depart; for the end alike of thy labours and of thy life is already at hand."" It is indeed marvellous that such a voice should have come to any man from the Deity, yet I cannot discredit the tale; for Drusus immediately departed, and as he was returning in haste, died on the way of some disease before reaching the Rhine. And I find confirmation of the story in these incidents: wolves were prowling about the camp and howling just before his death; **two youths were seen riding through the midst of the camp;** a sound as of women lamenting was heard; and there were shooting stars in the sky. So much for these events. 

Sorry, I mixed up the loss in battle with a different bad omen &lt;.&lt; These kinds of things were taken rather seriously by the Romans (especially in hindsight), and riding your horse through a camp was a seriously big deal if it was ranked with howling wolves, shooting stars, and random giant women ;) But ignoring the omens before a battle was a HUGE deal - they would signal impiety to the Roman people. Publius Claudius Pulcher, for example, lost [the Battle of Drepana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Drepana) to Carthage in 249 BCE. This was attributed, afterwards, to a horrific omen which he received before the battle - his sacred chickens wouldn't eat. So, thinking on the spot, he had all the chickens thrown overboard, saying ""If they refuse to eat, then let them drink!"" That battle was one of the worst naval losses to Carthage that Rome suffered, and Pulcher, upon returning to Rome, was charged with high treason and sacrilege, culminating in exile and the utter termination of his political career. All because his chickens wouldn't eat breakfast. 

Sorry about the slight confusion there :) "

This also (obviously) means the frame of the gun must be wide enough to accommodate the magazine. 

In a single stack configuration the rounds are stacked perfectly vertically in the magazine (think 1911 mags) allowing for a narrower magazine, and therefore a narrower frame, at the expense of ammunition capacity.

constituent,AskReddit,1388840845.0,"Sexuality has little to play here but, rather, roommate dynamics and basic etiquette.  Is your girlfriend and the couple just *roommates* or are they also friends?  If they're merely roommates with very little interaction or involvement, then the situation is just a contractual living arrangement where people abide by the unwritten rules of the land (e.g. no sex in the common area, don't eat my food, wash your own dishes, shut the door when using the bathroom, etc.).

If they're friends living together, those 'rules' are much more flexible but still fall within reason of respect and good manners.  The simple question people may ask themselves in what may be perceived as awkward:  ""Would I do this in front of my mother/grandmother?""  If there is any hesitation, then it wouldn't be construed as 'publicly acceptable'.  
Also, does the couple even interact with or know you?  Do you folks hang out with one another?  If there's hardly any interaction there, you're more liable to be seen as a guest and your actions are a reflection upon your girlfriend.  Tolerance levels of roommates will differ based on personalities, hence the popularity of passive-aggressive behavior and housemates.  Some people won't care, others would demand that people are covered from head to toe.  And, just to throw this out here, physical appearance isn't even a guarantee.  Fit or fat, some folks may be completely repulsed by a stranger walking around in boxers.  It's just a matter of decency.  [I personally wouldn't care, but please put some clothes on if you're going to be joining at the breakfast table.]

When someone drops a well-timed, dark little gem of a joke like that right in the middle of relating a story about how completely traumatized they are, it's time to put on your skepticism cap and start asking if you believe in /r/KarmaConspiracy 

But no, really, the real proof that we're being trolled is this bit:

I found out his name yesterday (1-2-14) and looked him up on Facebook. This was the worst decision I could have made. **He is the most disgusting human I've ever laid eyes on and I've never felt so violated in my life.**

She just said that the fact that she found her rapist unattractive made the rape worse.  She feels more violated because he was ugly.  She almost says she didn't feel violated *until* she discovered he was ugly.

This is a troll.  This is someone who wanted to see reddit fall over itself to pour sympathy and karma on a girl who went out and made herself as vulnerable as possible, and decided it was rape in the morning after she realized the dude she slept with was ugly.

What helps a bit with me is to realise that while what you feeling is real, a lot of what you see and feel is exaggerated by your fear. Your mind is a powerful tool. ""Normal"" people also have little things they feel or see but they don't give attention to it, because they know it is probably not a big deal and that it will pass. You are having a hyperfocus now on your problem that makes it look even worse than it is (literally, you see something worse than other people). Try to think: ""Listen, I can see something is going on, but this is not a life threatening thing, if it stays the same for a few days, I should have it checked out. Until then, I can think of something else, I'm on it and it will be taken care off.""

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388842086.0,"&gt;That's sort of proving my point - we can - and do - adapt very well to changes in our environment and social structure. 

Not really.  Consider the fear example.  We can't make ourselves not react negatively to loud, discordant sounds.  It takes tremendous discipline, and can bring on PTSD, to become the kind of person who has no fear response.  It's *extremely* injurious to the psyche.

See instincts do not determine behavior.  They inform and shape behavior, but we are rational creatures and we can overcome our instincts (well, *most* of us can, there are exceptions).  But when we fight them, and try to repress or deny them, problems arise.  We tend to go a little crazy.  We tend to be less healthy.  We're less successful at mating.

Like we are wired for brief flashes of violence in self-defense, but not wired for sustain campaigns of violence.  We force ourselves to fight anyways, but then soldiers develop PTSD and a host of other mental issues after spending time at war.

We force ourselves to go to work at jobs we hate, and experience massive amounts of stress which shortens our lives as a result.  

More to the OP's point, we say that we want equality, but then women -- even feminists -- fight against the idea of women initiating sexual encounters, and we see feminists hold up the same ideals of masculinity -- the feminist definition of a male loser and the patriarchs definition of a male loser apply to the *same guy*.  We see that men who are confident and embrace masculinity are more successful with women than men who embrace a more feminine approach and are sexually passive.

We demonize and criminalize rape and sexual assault, and women consume massive quanties of eortica that glorifies rape.  *50 Shades Of Gray* becomes the fast-selling book of all time, and is a shoddily written extended rape fantasy that glorifies male domination.

We pretend that we are above our instincts, but we're really like [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/BJqGMy9.jpg), pretending that the door will hold and that everything is fine."

For an example off the top of my head, the current Coventry cathedral is the fourth religious building on the site. There was originally a convent on the site, which I am told was sacked by the Vikings (but I have no source for this). 

Then they built the first cathedral on the site, which fell into disrepair during the dissolution of the monasteries. 

After a while, they rebuilt a church there, which later got made into a proper cathedral. 

In the Second World War, the existing cathedral got bombed beyond repair. They've built a new one next to it, leaving the ruins of the previous one as a spooky reminder of what happened to Coventry in the war.

The uncivil war was the most horrendous, atrocious, wholesale waste of human life ever in this country. If calmer heads would've been at the helm, America could've avoided this travesty of human carnage, instead America was plunged into a totally unnecessary, useless, and stupid war that cost almost a million lives. I can't even begin to think about how much further we'd be in medicine, research, and other good things that a society requires if we did not undertake this conflict. It was such a burden on America!

The funny thing is, I agree with a lot of those sentences,^(1) but I get the feeling that I disagree with him entirely.

^(1)Aside from the Chartist idea of linear progression of society, and war as an inevitable detriment to that progression.

Edit: On further thought, I actually probably disagree with all of those sentences. I mean, many died, but many more were freed from slavery by the end, and we kept the country together. Hard to call that a ""waste."""

What depresses me is that I feel so alone in this view. I feel like it is a fucking burden. At the same time I admire this from myself, because somehow I believe that this is the view that will take us further as a species. So how I try to see it now is, ""suffering"" for science, lol. 

You said you have read about Buddhism. This is exactly the kind of thing what Buddha was talking about when he was talking about ""suffering"". Buddha probably knew this feeling and made a whole philosophy and guide to be able to deal with this. I believe, he doesn't say: ""You can never use/do x!"", but means: ""I abstained from all this and it is what helped me the most, maybe you should try it aswell"". Look at the [Four Noble Truths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths) and apply it to this situation, then you'll see what I mean. He basically gives us a guide to try to accept this feeling and let it go. "

Gertiel,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1388843930.0,"This definitely comes under ymmv, as this is just my personal experience. 

I went through a rather stressful time when I was 30. Up to that date, it was the most stressful thing I had experienced by far. I don't think it matters what the cause was. For a while I didn't eat, and then I did eat. It did seem like the weight loss didn't really start until I did start eating again. I'm fairly certain I was still eating less than prior to the stress, and I was also likely getting more exercise. The exercise was not particularly strenuous, just for longer periods than previous. 

I lost between 20-25 pounds and went from a full size 7 to a size 3 reliably fitting quite nicely. Luckily, although it wasn't entirely clear until pretty well into the situation how long things were going to be stressful, I was only fully stressed out for just under 6 months. I did know the stressful period would eventually end from about a month into the situation, and I think that realization is what allowed me to start eating again.

In a later period, I actually used a certain diet which was designed for a loss of not more than 1 pound per week, and I think from that I learned why it did not seem like I had lost weight until I was eating again. When you just drop a pound or two, for most people that's not visually very apparent. Especially going to be so if you're already looking pretty drawn just from stressing. A general rule of thumb the dietitian told me was people are not going to notice / your weight loss isn't going to be apparent unless you are really looking for it until you have lost at least 8 pounds. If you are pretty overweight, it will probably take more like 20-25 pounds before folks notice, though you probably will feel it in the fit of your clothing. I'm guessing I hadn't lost enough to really notice prior to beginning to be able to eat again is all that really happened.

Eight years later, I went through a much more stressful period. At the start, it was possible the stress might last as much as 8-9 years. It took about 3 months to really start to see a potential end. Though I still didn't have a date, it began to look like no more than a year on the outside counting from the original start. This stress felt like 10x the stress I had suffered at 30, plus this stress was of a sort that loomed more directly over me at all hours of the day verses the stress at 30 being something I generally could count on escaping for a good part of each day. Around the third month I did start to be able to escape the severest stress about one weekend a month.

As with the first stress, I didn't really eat at first. I really didn't start to eat much at all until three months in. The situation ended up taking right at 7 months to get to a point where I got significant relief, and a total of a year from beginning to end before I was able to get fully away from it. 

This second period of stress had some pretty extreme effects on my overall health. The first thing was my hair turned white. Certainly at 38 I did have some white hair by the time this started, but my beautician has said the white hair multiplied x10 in the first three months. In the ten years since that time, she says she doesn't think my hair has whitened significantly further. Despite certainly eating much less, I began to gain weight slowly. When I got fully away, this weight gain began to get faster. My skin got really dry, I experienced a problem with my gums bleeding more when my teeth were cleaned despite maintaining the same care I have always maintained, and I began to have trouble gripping small things like caps to open bottles. 

Eventually I was diagnosed with hypothyroid and began to take medication to replace that. My dry skin, gum issues, and grip problems melted away pretty much immediately. The weight is taking much longer. Part of the problem is fully me. By the time I got my diagnoses and medication, I had got to the point I ate too much. I gained weight even when I cut my calories to a level I knew for all of my previous adult life had resulted in reliably loosing weight. I just developed bad habits because if you're gonna get fat either way, might as well enjoy it. So far, I am very lucky in that I don't suffer from high blood pressure, diabetes, or cholesterol issues. I'm trying to loose the weight in hopes of keeping things that way as long as possible."

Gromann,pcmasterrace,1388844133.0,"Because there's protecting IPs, then there's crushing every single thing relating to them with a vengeance not seen outside of the RIAAs offices.  That's Nintendo.  I get that they've cultivated brands, but at the same time when they go after the fans for fan-work, that's just asinine. 

Not to mention, since the gamecube, they've done nothing but gimmick after gimmick and haven't put out a piece of just solid hardware with a decent ecosystem. 

They censor IPs on their system (remember how it was news when Wii got its first M-rated game?) though I can't get too much on that, because we had ""Genesis does what Nintendon't"" and with wordplay like that, how can you not laugh at Nintendo's almost religious like fervor over content?

But finally, and most gravely of all... They're a console maker and guilty of something even worse than Sony, Microsoft, or even Sega; they're happy with mediocre hardware.  Imagine what games would be like if they were all ports of something from the Wii instead of the PS3/360.  At least we get pseudo HD textures in last gen because of that wheras nintendo was content with delivering technology that was years behind its competitors and even further behind the PCs.  

Like it or not, Consoles have a history of spurring tech development and if we had a world with PC and Nintendo, developers would get lax as we saw happening in the PS3/360 gen.  Nobody was interested in taxing the PC except for a few notable exceptions, for 8 years we had to deal with the same level of bullshit, with nintendo that bar would have been even lower.

IMO, Nintendo needs to drop out of hardware entirely and go the route Sega did.  Cultivate their brands and release them for other platforms; PC, Mobile, hell even the PS4/XBoner.  I would much rather see Metroid Prime in a fully fleshed out version than be relegated to the same device for years on end.  "

This subreddit was a breath of fresh air for me as the attitudes of reddit were getting obnoxious and I could see my own sentiments reflected in others here. /r/circlejerk, which is what this subreddit has basically devolved to, is one of those reddit things I find extremely obnoxious, which is why I'd rather unsubscribe than stick around.

http://www.sunherald.com/2014/01/03/5231588/police-saying-man-found-at-biloxi.html

&gt; BILOXI -- Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove has identified the man who was found dead at the Maison D'Orleans apartments as 63-year-old Carmen Edwards.
&gt; 
&gt; Hargrove said Edwards died from blunt-force trauma.
&gt; 
&gt; Detective Steve Schlicht said police received a report of a medical emergency at the apartment complex about 2:15 p.m. Thursday. Upon arrival, authorities discovered a man dead inside his apartment.
&gt; 
&gt; Schlicht said investigators are trying to find 43-year-old Michael Floyd Wilson, also known as ""Pretty Boy Floyd,"" for questioning as a person of interest.
&gt; 
&gt; By Friday afternoon, crime-scene tape had been removed from in front of the apartment complex, which is just west of the Coast Coliseum on Beach Boulevard.
&gt; 
&gt; On New Year's Day, Wilson had been booked at 5:24 a.m. on a felony charge of eluding law enforcement and misdemeanor charges of reckless driving, possession of paraphernalia and suspended driver's license, but bonded out hours later.
&gt; 
&gt; Biloxi Police Chief John Miller and Hargrove said police are not releasing details of the man's death at this time as the investigation is ongoing.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone with information regarding the investigation is asked to contact the police at 392-0641, Criminal Investigations Division at 435-6112 or Crime Stoppers at 1-877-787-5898."

tsukino_aiko,BabyBumps,1388844928.0,"Im so sorry, but really glad that you are getting help! It can be really hard to realize when your own emotions aren't ""real"" (for lack of a better word) because they *feel* real. I have struggled with various depression and anxiety issues since puberty because I have messed up hormones, so I have gotten better at saying to myself ""is this real, do I have any reason to feel like this?"" and working at analysing the answers. 

Example: The other day I was sad, I didn't acknowlegde that I was sad becuase there was no reason to be sad (seriously, like none) and so I found myself picking fights instead. It was easier for me to be mad then sad, even though neither emotion had any real backing. I had to embrace that I *was* sad, even though there wasn't a reason other then hormones and let the rest go. Talking to my DH helped, though by that point he was a little wary of doing so as I had yelled at him many times that way. Crying also helped, as did some food and a nap. Sometimes ya just gotta plow through. 

Good luck and I promise talking to someone is the right thing to do!"

Lollerstakes,Warframe,1388845387.0,"I'm gonna be honest with you - your builds are bad.

First off, the Soma. It's the best weapon in the game, next to the Synapse which is situational. You need 3 things to make it work: Pure damage, multishot, and crit. Elements optional. [This is how it's supposed to look.](http://i.imgur.com/UxmnfAV.png) (That's my Snipetron Vandal because my Soma was just polarized, but they share most of the mods - replace sniper ammo mutation with whatever you'd like, maybe heavy caliber.)

Next off, your Nekros. Your build isn't that bad, but you need to drop Steel Fiber - it's not worth it, not even on a Rhino, much less a Nekros. Max out your Streamline, max out your Desecrate ability, maybe add Continuity. Oh and add an Aura mod for extra points! [\(Here's my Nekros, for comparison.\)](http://i.imgur.com/G4UWGcv.png)

The Despair. A crit build isn't worth the points due to the low innate crit chance, damage, multishot and elements take the cake again. [Here's mine.](http://i.imgur.com/0lmcn5a.png)

I'm not gonna comment on the Ether Reaper as I'm no expert for melee weapons, I just use Dual Zoren with max attack speed so I can move around quickly.

Your sentinel - max out those precept mods!

&gt; This is a false equivalency. Terminating a cluster of cells is different from refusing to support a born child.

The man would be refusing to support a cluster of cells. If the mother thinks she can't support a child on her own, she still has the abortion option.

constituent,AskReddit,1388845586.0,"About the wingmen thing, I can identify with that.  As a generalization (not law of the land), good conversation can be excellent foreplay for women.  Gay men are more inclined to exchange dialogue in social settings because it becomes intuitive during situations where one is seeking out another gay man (needles in haystacks, etc.).  Therefore, it eventually becomes second-nature behavior.  Know the saying, ""*a good speaker is a good listener*""?  This is highly applicable, even when not on the prowl.  A good conversationalist can eliminate most of those awkward barriers and allow defenses to be lowered.  It's all about trust and charisma.

Without being overtly sexual, the art of conversation is a necessary skill for any person so you're not perceived as a creeper.  Nobody enjoys being punched in the face for saying the wrong thing.

So, in the eye, you have receptors to see yellow-blue, which means when one is seeing yellow, it can't see blue. It's busy with yellow. That's why we can't see a yellow-blue color. It has to switch off seeing yellow to see blue, if that makes any sense. Now pain is also part of the opponent-process theory. Pain is also on a switch system, where your nerves feel pain and then relief of pain.

So let's take for instance a dog. You shock the dog, and it is scared and feels pain. When you stop, the dog feels relief of pain. After awhile, if you do this enough, the dog will become happy after the shock from the relief of pain. You have conditioned the dog to feel happy after being tortured.

This is what you have done to yourself. You have conditioned yourself to feel happy after cutting yourself. You have taught yourself to feel happy after you feel pain. You can change this. You can recondition yourself. But it isn't easy and takes time. But now you know."

&gt;Let the centre of a circumscribed circle be 0. ΔACD's area is largest
when **AC's height (height opposite AC, maybe?)** is greatest, so it becomes AC:OD.
Now, with angleAOD = angleCOD = 60deg, ΔAOD and ΔCOD forms a
**(missing character) triangle.** Therefore, the area of ΔDAC, like that of ΔOCA, becomes:

&gt;&lt;formula&gt;.

&gt;ΔABC's area is &lt;formula&gt;, and therefore the area of the quadrangle ABCD's
maximum value is &lt;formula&gt;.

&gt;Note: an approximate like 11.69 is sufficient.

Here's the original since it's probably super simple, I just never progressed that far in Japanese-language math. Or normal math, for that matter.

高さが最大となるときであるから、AC:ODとなる場合である。このと

And finally, I was a Muslim for most of my life.  I still have access to Arabsat and the dozens of Arabic religious channels and programs that come with it and I can tell you from first hand experience there is no argument about the age of Aisha nor excuses except with clerics trying to sell a more favorable image of Islam to liberals like you who will swallow any bullshit they're fed by those exotic different people that you think are so awesome and misunderstood."

Of course my assumption is that you'll want to get into making your own coils, and a dual coil build is probably not the best place to start.  It's also important to have a backup just in case.

If you do not want to rebuild your own attys then ignore me and move on to the next post.

My personal experience is that new builds can be frustrating.  I'm still pretty new to building my own coils and wicks, I've only been doing it for about a month and a half...  And the last thing I want to do is run into difficulties working on little fiddley things like coils and wicks when I can get some nicotine.  If I had only 1 device and could vape while building I probably would smashed my gear with a hammer and gone back to smoking.

Side note, and still presuming you want to try building your own coils...  Get an ohm meter.  Bad things can happen if you don't test your coils before unleashing your battery on them.  And it'll save time and money, you won't waste your effort wicking a coil that just isn't what you wanted to build. "

Really? You think Catalonia respects the Eurozone requirements in this current form? Are you fucking out of your mind? If Spain were to try to join the Eurozone in their current shape they couldn't because they don't meet the fucking requirements.

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1388846705.0,"&gt;The problem; however, occurs in the choice that they are making. Women face consequences no matter which choice they make. If they have the baby, the consequences are obvious. If they abort, there are more subtle consequences (most stemming from social stigma). Men wouldn't face the same consequences.

And so you arrive at the typical feminist solution: not trying to solve that problem, or minimize its impact, but instead giving other people problems too.

&gt;Additionally, if the state does not replace child support payments for the father who had chosen to forgo parenting, many women will feel forced by economic circumstances to chose to abort.

That's a good thing. We need to breed for quality, not for quantity. 
If they were to get child support from those men, that would hamper the ability for those men to support the children they *do* want, anyway, so that doesn't really solve anything.

&gt;Essentially because women bear more responsibility when it comes to having a child (not to say men don't face any consequences or have any responsibility, just that it is far less), they should be the ones to make the choice.

They still get to decide about the life or death of the fetus. The man only could opt out, not opt in: there's still no way for him to keep the child if the woman doesn't want to carry it.

I'm still waiting on ANA results to rule out autoimmune diseases, its very likely as I have a piss-poor immune system and I was quickly diagnosed with fibromyalgia, which is often misdiagniosed. For a long time I thought endo could explain everything, I only ever got the pain, fatigue, malaise, migraines rectal bleeding, bruising, seizures etc on my period, every other day of the month I was fine. the rectal bleeding wasn't really blood either, it was that sort of deep red wine chunky tissue you get on heavy period days, only coming out the wrong hole, and each time I got a chest infection it was immediately following a period and I would throw up and cough up aerated blood for a few days. My cousin had endo in her brain causing epilepsy, so when I started having seizures on my period as a response to the migraine pain, Endo became a real concern.

But that was 11 years ago, the more and more GYNs I see the less even I think its endo causing the pelvic pain, (who knows, it might be IBS) I was on the pill for years and it was amazing, but legally I had to come off due to the migraine disorder and I can't go back on, that's when things started happening every day of the month rather than just on my period.

 Progesterone methods just haven't been the same. I still have a few more diet changes to try, Sugar is the big one, I have cut down but I need to try and cut out.

She actually went through a period of telling other people she was NC with me by her choice because I was so crazy, all the while trying to contact me on the sly. I think she thought certain family members were passing on to me that I wasn't welcome, but no one said anything. Not until I was sitting with some relatives she'd played that pity the martyr who has to refuse contact with the crazy daughter game to and got a bunch of texts from her. It actually took me a bit to figure out why they seemed so shocked when I mentioned how annoying it was she was still trying to contact me when I had tried for years to get rid of her.

I hope your nMomster keeps her word and lets you just get on with enjoying the rest of your life without her manipulative bullshit mucking up your life.

I was really struck all the same with how very similar the things your nMomster said to you were to the phrases my nMomster used to pull on me.

&gt;I will not be ignored in my own home.

&gt;I have to walk on eggshells around you!! I can't even be honest with you because you're so fragile. 

&gt;I know you tell people I'm CRAZY. I know you talk about me.

&gt;You're throwing your life away for a man! You're man-crazy!!!

&gt;I don't even care about him. He's nothing to me. 

&gt;I feel nothing.

&gt;I loved you since the day were born.

&gt;I only want the best for you. 

&gt;Everything I ever did was what I thought was best for you 

&gt;I'm the only person in this world who will be honest with you.

Every single one of these phrases was trotted out by my nMomster on a regular basis. I can recall her saying these things so often it took every iota of control in my body not to mouth the words as she said them for probably the third time that week and get the crap kicked out of me for it by the time I finally escaped to college. 

The one I really, really loath is ""I loved you since the day you were born"" because it came out of the same mouth that told 11-year-old-me she believed wholeheartedly in abortions easily available even to teens because having a baby before you were out of college with a career would be the ruin of any woman's life. She got pregnant with me, had to quit school because of the rules of the school not allowing unwed mothers, and never managed to get back on track. She did everything but outright say she'd have aborted me had it been legal at the time for her to do so."

I'm going to be honest with myself--I'm in good physical shape, but I'm nowhere near acrobatic/flexible enough to make good use of the 3DMG. Don't think I'd last too long in the Legion."
thingsliveundermybed,todayilearned,1388847083.0,"I don't think that. At all. Anyone who falsely accuses someone of a crime is guilty of wasting police time and, if *proven* to have lied in court, perjury and perverting the course of justice as well. However, the feeling on reddit and in many other areas seems to be that rape accusations need a special extra charge. This falls down for a few reasons.

1) It's a crime already, so it is already subject to the same rules stated above (perjury etc).

2) Whether the above charges are brought is up to the authorities and decided on an individual basis. So if the police deem the waste of *their* time unworthy of more time, it's their call. That one isn't up to the person who was accused.

3) No one is stopping the falsely accused suing for slander or libel. People ask why ""real"" rape victims don't go to the police more, why aren't they also asking why the falsely accused don't make more of a fuss? Both things are life-ruining.

4) People actually getting found guilty of rape is rare. Serving prison time for it is rarer still. Sorry for the crap link, on my phone. This is actually a US one, could only find a UK one earlier but that's there in response to another comment if you're interested. I hope this comment makes my feelings on the matter more clear.

unicornbomb,Aquariums,1388847093.0,"This looks quite a bit like a photo I've seen before of [Costia](http://www.simplydiscus.com/library/disease_medications/images/costia.jpg). 

This is what I found on it: 

Symptoms: 8-15micrometer long flagellates may be visible. Affected fish may do swinging movements, scratch against decor, stop eating, have labored breathing, have bluish-grayish slime coating, clamped fins, red tints on body, may have fin disintegration, gills may be covered in mucous and anemic.

Treatment: Remove all fish from tank. Treat fish with Aquarium Salt baths: Use 2.5 tablespoon/gal for 10-15 minutes then place fish in clean water for 10 minutes then move it into the hospital tank. If fish becomes obviously stressed then remove it from the salt bath quickly. Do this daily for 3 days. Use 2tsp/gal in the hospital tank to prevent secondary infection and perform daily 100% water changes. Sterilizing the tank: Costia cannot survive at temps above 86*F so increase the temp of the main tank to 88*-90*F for 48 hours. The parasites will die due to both the temperature and lack of host and it will be safe to reintroduce your fish as long as they have finished treatment."

0x_,Fitness,1388847597.0,"&gt; 100 push ups a day

Work your way up to 200-300 a day, ~~if you can~~ find the time. You want forearms? This will give you them. Do a variety of pushups, some with your hands closer together,and further apart.

&gt; 50 crunches (since I have a little tummy fat)

Spot reduction (thinking a specific exercise will target an area for fat removal) *does not exist*. Lose overall weight with exercise and diet. However, you cant neglect eating enough food to put on muscle, so you have to pick one goal, and eat right for that goal. You can diet to lose weight after you put on the muscle.

&gt; I feel really tired everyday and have a slight body ache.

Good isn't it? This is the feeling of your body stimulated into a need for growth. Feed the machine. You need more calories than your daily requirements in order to feed muscle growth.

Daily requirements include your BMR, your normal caloric output (are you sedentary, active, what?), plus your calories spent exercising, then you need to eat an excess on top of those calories, say 500 calories extra a day, in pure protein would be ideal. If you find it hard to eat that much, supplement the protein with a shake.

Yes. Nutrition is key. But at its most basic, eat lots, but of course, eat real food, if you eat lots of high calorie food you'll become an actual fatass.

Read the FAQs, get some online nutrition and exercise calaculators to help you measure your nutrition balance and calories input/output.

~~Good luck.~~ Luck dont enter into it. Start and dont stop and in six months you will have come a long way. Keep increasing the load, find new ways to increase your output.

Edit: Everyone will say you need big weights, they help, they get things growing faster, they are not the only way, especially for your noob gains. If you cant face the gym (dont be a pussy, if you can, go) this will get you started."

Geohump,Christianity,1388847701.0,"Sorry, No. There is great risk in ""trying magic"" because far too many people are willing to believe without real evidence.  Humans have a tendency to attribute causes to things with no real connection.  example:  humans long believed Thunder and lightning was the direct action of angry Gods, not understanding what weather is and what really causes these phenomena. 

So people will believe that the magic did something even when it didn't.  And then other people will exploit them, or they will harm themselves, (emotionally or physically) by relying on magic that does not exist (like the people who rely on the ""wheat grass cure  for cancer"")

I am a Christian and I have a background in Biology, Chemistry and Computer Science.  You know who I rely on for objective evaluation of magic etc.. ? James Randi, who is a magician and an atheist, Also Penn and Teller, also magicians.

Why ? because these people whose business it is to perform ""magic"" under the direct observation of a large audience, understand how we fool ourselves into seeing magic happen when it never did. 

God did not allow any room for magic in this universe.  Every supposed ""miracle"" that has happened, had no magic involved. Every one of them was simply a collection of unlikely events that happened in just the right order to make something highly improbable happen. 

An omnipotent, omniscient being (God) would find it to be child's play to create a Universe whose initial conditions made these highly improbable events certain to happen. No magic at all is needed.

It was kinda weird, but one of my aunts, one of my cousins, and my grandmother had hysterectomies the same year I had mine. All for very similar reasons, too, though the doctors say genetics likely weren't involved. Given the over 40 year age spread between us, probably right genes weren't involved, I guess. Who really knows? Anyways, I was the only one to have that type of surgery.

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1388848441.0,"&gt; Well it's not a comparable thing, because an abortion aborts for both parents, and a spouse opting out leaves 2 people, the mother and child, in a seriously bad situation.

No, it warns the future mother beforehand that she's going to have to do it on her own. She can still abort. If she chooses not to, it's her choice to enter that situation.

&gt;The only way to do so would be to allow the wife the opt-out option as well, in which the child is born but she chooses no financial responsibility. 

That option already exists, it's called adoption (and in some places the old-fashioned way, dropping it off at a charity organisation anonymously, also happens). The mother can decide that on her own without problems if the father has already relinquished his parenthood at that point.

&gt;Then the husband would be left in the same position.

Well, if the father wants the child and the mother doesn't, but is still willing to give birth, that would be solution that gives everyone what they want. But that's a voluntary agreement between the two of them. Bodily self-determination applies at any time for the woman.

&gt; But that of course completely ignores the child, who is the one the parents are obligated to (they are not obligated financially to each other- just to the child). The result would be the same- a lot more struggling single parents and more kids in orphanages. Not really a fair trade-off.

But the current system generates a lot of single mothers, by giving them a false impression that their decision to care for a child on their own is a good idea - they can force someone else to support it anyway. I'd rather have people know what they're going to face beforehand. IMO giving both parents an emergency exit would reduce single parenthood."

Say there are 10 militant atheists who just REALLY feel it's their duty to get rid of religion, specifically the Spinnaker religion. There are normal Spinnakers who go about their day and pray every night, then there are Spinnaker Extremists who try to kill everyone that isn't a Spinnaker, they also only eat skittles, that's it.

Now wouldn't it make sense for them to start talking to the Spinnaker Extremists first? That way they can save people's lives. They know they wouldn't have to worry something bad will happen to the normal Spinnakers while they're talking to them, cause those guys aren't the ones with guns trying to kill people, besides their religions, the normal Spinnakers are just like the atheists, they both even like to wear fedoras. Besides the killing and skittles, the extremists are just like them too.

All three groups are depressed even, but only the extremists get the point of contemplation of suicide, so 7 of the 10 atheists (commenters) try to convert (help) them first so people stop dying (this one is literal), they let the other 3 try to convert(help) the non-extremist because they know it's not as urgent. But every atheist cares for the eradication of the entire spinnaker religion.

pakap,AskHistorians,1388848788.0,"The world-wide ban was the result of a series of UN-negotiated treaties: the [Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs_1961) (1961), the [Convention on Psychotropic Substances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Psychotropic_Substances_1971) (1971) and the [United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_Against_Illicit_Traffic_in_Narcotic_Drugs_and_Psychotropic_Substances_1988)
(1988). Local laws such as the US Controlled Substances Act of 1970 were then adopted in response to countries ratifying the treaties.

Prior to that, the Society of Nations had adopted several treaties on the subject. Main focus at the time was on opium.

The main rationale behind the ban was that drugs, particularly addictive drugs, could be a cause of social breakdown and were morally wrong. The driving forces were mostly countries who did not have a tradition of consuming drugs such as opium and did not have an economic stake in the production and sales of these drugs.

Quoting from a [2002 Canadian Senate committee report](http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/371/ille/rep/repfinalvol3-e.htm) on drug policy : 

&gt;William B. McAllister has divided the participating states [in the 1961 conference] into five distinct categories based on their drug control stance and objectives.

 

&gt;- Organic states group: As producers of the organic raw materials for most of the global drug supply, these countries had been the traditional focus of international drug control efforts. They were open to socio-cultural drug use, having lived with it for centuries. While India, Turkey, Pakistan and Burma took the lead, the group also included the coca-producing states of Indonesia and the Andean region of South America, the opium- and cannabis-producing countries of South and Southeast Asia, and the cannabis-producing states in the Horn of Africa. They favoured weak controls because existing restrictions on production and export had directly affected large segments of their domestic population and industry. They supported national control efforts based on local conditions and were wary of strong international control bodies under the UN. Although essentially powerless to fight the prohibition philosophy directly, they effectively forced a compromise by working together to dilute the treaty language with exceptions, loopholes and deferrals. They also sought development aid to compensate for losses caused by strict controls.

 

&gt; - Manufacturing states group: This group included primarily Western industrialized nations, the key players being the U.S., Britain, Canada, Switzerland, the Netherlands, West Germany and Japan. Having no cultural affinity for organic drug use and being faced with the effects that drug abuse was having on their citizens, they advocated very stringent controls on the production of organic raw materials and on illicit trafficking. As the principal manufacturers of synthetic psychotropics, and backed by a determined industry lobby, they forcefully opposed undue restrictions on medical research or the production and distribution of manufactured drugs. They favoured strong supranational control bodies as long as they continued to exercise de facto control over such bodies. Their strategy was essentially to “shift as much of the regulatory burden as possible to the raw-material-producing states while retaining as much of their own freedom as possible.”

 

&gt; - Strict control group: These were essentially non-producing and non-manufacturing states with no direct economic stake in the drug trade. The key members were France, Sweden, Brazil and Nationalist China. Most of the states in this group were culturally opposed to drug use and suffered from abuse problems. They favoured restricting drug use to medical and scientific purposes and were willing to sacrifice a degree of national sovereignty to ensure the effectiveness of supranational control bodies. They were forced to moderate their demands in order to secure the widest possible agreement.

 

&gt; - Weak control group: This group was led by the Soviet Union and often included its allies in Europe, Asia and Africa. They considered drug control a purely internal issue and adamantly opposed any intrusion on national sovereignty, such as independent inspections. With little interest in the drug trade and minimal domestic abuse problems, they refused to give any supranational body excessive power, especially over internal decision-making.

 

&gt; - Neutral group: This was a diverse group including most of the African countries, Central America, sub-Andean South America, Luxembourg and the Vatican. They had no strong interest in the issue apart from ensuring their own access to sufficient drug supplies. Some voted with political blocs, others were willing to trade votes, and others were truly neutral and could go either way on the control issue depending on the persuasive power of the arguments presented. In general, they supported compromise with a view to obtaining the broadest possible agreement. "

etruscan,boardgames,1388849177.0,"I'm in Canada, so take this with a grain of salt... though I suspect a lot of this will translate. 

Most of the successful board game retailers I deal with are online. As a gamer, I *want* to purchase from a website, regardless of whether I'm picking up or having it shipped... so that I know I've got a copy. Most of these shops are run out of peoples homes, which is cheaper and more efficient for them. A couple have storefronts.

The **first** of those is a warehouse type storefront that's tough to find and has terrible parking. It's not a ""walk-by"" location, but it's bigger than most home basements, so he's able to keep a much bigger selection of stock. There's also an area with big game tables, so gamers can come play tabletop wargames. These folks do very good business from a retail perspective because they have some of the best selection and lowest prices, but they pay for it with almost no staff... meaning the owner is very overworked.

The **other** brick and mortar is a gaming cafe (I actually understand there's a second one in my city now but I haven't seen it yet). It's located in a heavy foot trafficked area. They have a HUGE selection of games available for customers to play for a $5 cover charge (slipped into the final bill). The cafe is nice (sandwiches, pastries, beer, lattes) but the big draw is the game selection (2500 games), and the fact that there are ""gurus"" walking around during prime time hours to help people learn rules. Tables are beaten up and smallish (it's tough to fit all the pieces on a table, you often need to keep some pieces in the box at your feet, but patrons make it work). They also have a retail section and sell online, but the retail is quite small - in fact, a lot of stock is kept in their basement, away from the floor. They do *incredible* business.

So, I don't think Walmart is a big competitor, because they will never specialize like a small shop can... the question is whether or not your small city has enough of a fan base to support a specialized shop. If not, running a *brick and mortar retail shop* might not be the best idea. 

Running a *retail website* isn't a terrible idea because it can also compete outside your city... but then you're up against Amazon and CSI and MiniatureMarket and some of those other big shops. Luckily in Canada, we don't have those places (Amazon.ca is a joke, and shipping from the USA adds $20-30 to each order, so we stick to locals). 

The best bet would be *the cafe* idea... which can attract hard core gamers, but if it's done right - it can also attract regular folks off the street. Moms or Dads who want to spend an afternoon out with their kids, hipsters who want to avoid the bar scene, party kids who want to play party games, or business professionals who have lost their social life but want to play games (hi there!). 

I think that no matter what route you take, you want to either specialize in video games, or specialize in board games, but don't take both on at the same time - at least not at first. That's my two point five cents."

She will be creating life, growing your child, inside her, and remind her how amazing and strong she is. This is new for both of you guys. Enjoy the ride!

Make sure you do everything she is in preparing as well. **Read everything she reads**. Learn what she is learning.

Make sure she still feels **sexy**. It's hard for women as their bodies change so dramatically, and it's easy to not feel sexy anymore. Don't worry, you are *not* going to hurt or ""poke"" the baby, which many men feel like.

Early on, prepare for for ""morning sickness"" which actually happens at any time during the day. Carry ginger candies, make sure there's small snacks on hand, put some barf bags in the car now, and encourage a lot of water drinking. Being prepared can mean the world for her. Also, it's really hard to do almost anything the first trimester, so helping out with cleaning house can be amazing.

Also, don't be afraid of speaking up about how you're feeling, either. After he started moving, my husband discovered that he was feeling jealous of all the ""time"" and bonding I got to spend with our son now, and he felt detached from the whole experience. He felt like he was missing out on that physical experience of growing a child. And that's ok to feel like that. Just make sure you communicate these fears or emotions that you have. I've tried very hard to make sure he has his own experiences with our son. Before bed, hubby cuddles up to my bump and reads him books, tells him stories, feels him move as I read a book and ""check out"" to give him his own time with the baby. I think that made him feel better.

I suspect that the key is finding a passion you can talk about with almost anyone, dance and theatre do it for a lot of people because it's great fun and easily accessible to almost everyone.

I recall a lot of situations in my childhood where I would be innocently minding my own business probably studying or reading where I would get jumped for things that were not really my fault. I was often ordered to babysit my siblings or even care for them while my parents performed chores they deemed to dangerous for me to handle. There were also many times I was randomly cornered and attacked because I had failed to watch over a sibling because I hadn't been made aware I was supposed to be doing so.

She can absolutely get started independently, and that is what most successful cam girls will recommend. I would also advise her to check out several different sites and see which one meshes the best with her personality and comfort level. 

Streamate is good for beginners. It's a private-based site and nudity is not allowed in free chat (technically it isn't allowed on any site, but some are very lax on the rules). This means you don't do a show unless you're getting paid for it. However, some girls really like the tip-based sites like MFC and Chaturbate where you can play games, do prizes, etc.

I've been watching it, Shimizu vs Kang was pretty surprising to me because I was really afraid it'd draw, but that third round was justifiably a 10-8 even before the submission. Holy crap. Still, I've never seen a 2-point deduction like that for vertical elbows. o_O

Also really really sad about Dutra vs Kunimoto, that was disappointing for both sides. 

About to watch Saffiedine vs Lim right now.

EDIT: Really disappointed with Lim right now; not only is he being harangued by ~~Rogan~~  Stann for not using his *9 inch* reach advantage, he's eating a ton of lead leg kicks and letting Saffiedine dictate pace and range, and trying to retaliate with really wide-swinging hooks and haymakers. Really sloppy. This is also Lim's first 5-rounder and it's really showing in his lack of strategy.

EDIT 2: This is a wrap-up for Saffiedine now. Lim's left leg is GONERS.

EDIT 3: WOW, Lim actually came back in Round 5 despite fighting one-legged for almost that entire fight. I hope he learns not to rely on his size and power so much in future fights, he's got a really good chin and heart. But really impressed with Saffiedine's strategy and changeups."

It really has nothing to do with me not wanting to spend time with her and you really have to try not to take it personally. I'm the type of guy who gets easily worn out of too much interaction. So whenever my ex would spend, say an entire week together I would start to get cranky and unpleasant from the constant interaction (There is a difference between having a visitor for a week which you need to entertain and spend time with at all times compared to just having a roommate).

Everyone has their ways of releasing stress and recharging themselves, some like to go to parties, some like to go running, some like to ride horses, and some like to play video games. I don't know your boyfriend, but if he's anything like me, I think he just wants the time he spends with you to be as fun as possible, and he knows that if he wants to achieve that, he needs to be able to have his alone time so he can get that release.

V171,AskReddit,1388849997.0,"There's a lot of differing opinions that are on this topic. Personally, I am absolutely okay with it, but I can understand all arguments. 

Firstly, a gay bar is a gay space. It was tailored for us. Straight people literally have the entire world tailored to them. Sometimes we just want an atmosphere that is for us and there's nothing more frustrating than a straight guy getting super offended because a guy hit on him in a gay bar that he's only in because his girlfriend dragged him to it. 

Which brings be to another point. Women love gay bars. Like you said, there's usually better dancing music and they like the fact that they can dance and have a good time with men that aren't trying to drug them. That's okay. 

Unfortunately, that usually brings stroight men to the gay bars to try and pick up the straight women. It's a vicious cycle. 

Then there's the people who like to go to gay bars the same way that people like to go see the circus freaks. It's weird and different and they want to exploit that. That's not okay. 

Basically, if you want to come to a gay bar to have a good time, that's awesome. But don't get pissy when you get hit on. Just be polite. "

The need to fix someone is rooted in low self esteem; that if the person cannot do something to drastically improve their partners life then they don't deserve the relationship in the first place. They don't judge their qualities, such as being kind or funny, strong enough to keep someones attention long enough to form a loving relationship(*). 

'Why would anyone want me if I can't do something so earthshatteringly amazing for them that they can never envision a life without me?'

They need the guy who lost a leg in Middle Easternstan and suffers from PTSD, the girl who was abused by her father, or the kid who grew up without parents. 

The problem is trying to figure out how to 'fix' the fixer.

From the [Reuters article](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-machinists-approve-contract-tied-061302966.html): 

&gt;Younger machinists had voiced strong concern that failing to vote for the contract would cost them their jobs as Boeing moves the work elsewhere. The 777X is the last major development on Boeing's books for the next 15 years. If the plane was built elsewhere, it would have slowly eroded aerospace jobs in Washington.

kicker7955,europe,1388850264.0,"Ok, so let's take the example of UK press and disregard tabloids.

Among mainstream UK press, Romanian Gypsies are either victimised  in relation to the Romanian government or portrayed  as a failed social issue that Romania passed on to the EU. Both arguments can be made but they completely overshoot what can be classified as a reasonable discourse in the press. 

Sensationalism is infectious and addictive, and on minor(from the point of view of a British reader) topics , they tend to be viewed subjectively from the filter of local politics. 

Among this ""blind"" debate the issue becomes generalised and after months the common ground is the only thing enforced  in everybody's conscience regardless of how much it is oversimplified (....in my example, the Romanian government is responsible for the Rromani tragedy.)

I don't think every idiot needs corrected, I welcome idiotic opinions because they give diversity of opinions, and they exhibit a more primal, less complicated view on certain issues. If you want to fight racism you listen to racist not liberals IMHO.

I think some publication need to be held at a much higher standard, because, they set the tone and context for issues, that will become the framework for other less scrupulous publications.

Of course such a double standard can't be imposed in practice, but I just wanted to raise awareness that even high brow press can be unintentionally bigoted, and this has consequences more far reaching than a racial slur."

Lyte_theelf,lifeinapost,1388850329.0,"What kind of foods do you regularly eat?

This seems random but I ask because I realized that at least some of my depression growing up was due to my diet. Grains, sugar, carbs, dairy... all the time. I even thought I had a healthy diet because I was totally organic and a vegetarian. I started having health problems (couldn't digest food well, tired all the time, severely depressed and moody, etc etc) and after doing a lot of research, I found out I had Candida Overgrowth and Leaky Gut Syndrome. Instead of going to a doctor (seriously, eff most conventional doctors) I changed my diet to the Paleo diet (no carbs or sugar, just healthy fats like coconut oil and olive oil, lots of protein and lots of veggies) and for the first time ever I naturally felt the depression lift. 

I have a lot to be depressed about. I live on my own with my boyfriend and we are extremely poor. I can barely afford anything and have to carefully juggle to pay the bills on time, or at all. I'm being crushed by debt to a shitty school and medical debt. 
My father died when I was 18; his last words to me were ""you need to grow up"" when I was 14, after we'd had a falling out (because he had *molested me* when I was a child, giving me PTSD). I never spoke to him again and only found out at the last minute that he was dying of cancer, and when I called him I was just a few hours too late.  
Recently I've lost one person to liver disease and another, only 20 years old, to a car accident. People I loved and cared about.
I live far away from my family now because right after losing those two people, I was essentially kicked out of my house and it was the only place I could afford at that moment. I never see my friends and I feel isolated out here, surrounded by people who look at me like I'm an alien.

I have plenty of real world reasons to be depressed. But these things are *so much easier to deal with* now that my mind is clear, my body feels good and my diet isn't holding me under that sea of depression.

Seriously, I was off dairy and grains for just two weeks and I didn't notice much of a difference, so I tried eating dairy again. The next day, that very familiar depression was on me like white on rice. It was intense, overwhelming, and on top of it every joint I had was on fire. I haven't touched it since and my ability to handle my emotions is only growing and growing and I never feel randomly depressed for no reason.

You spend a lot of time on the computer (just like I used to). Spend some of it looking up diet in relation to immunity and depression. Research the importance of gut health and how the intestines and the probiotics in there strongly affect brain health. Nutrition is a truly fascinating subject, and I think you'll find you like it, especially since you were in to studying drugs. Food is chemicals, drugs are chemicals, the body is a sea of chemicals-- and you get different effects depending on what your intake is.

I'll give you a couple places to start:

Duffadash,Games,1388850440.0,"Many modern (point-and-click) adventure games seem to fall into this category.

Gone are most of the [horrible mistakes](http://grumpygamer.com/2152210) that the early games of the genre made. If a modern adventure game fails, it's most likely because of a weak narrative (although inserting action elements is also a good way to make the game bad. I'm looking at you Dreamfall: The Longest Journey).

My own examples would be many of the Daedelic adventures, such as the Deponia trilogy (which are not bad, but they're definitely not as good as the games that came out during Golden Age of LucasArts).

Similarly the Book of Unwritten Tales was somewhat of a letdown, mostly because of subpar writing in a comedic game.

Telltale seems to be of generally high quality, but I still cannot help thinking Tales of Monkey Island and Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive people could have been better written.

Besides comedy games which ALWAYS fails if the writing isn't good enough, another affected subgenre is the adventure game 'conspiracy'-themed games. There is no gameplay differences between Broken Sword 1 and 2, but there's a world of difference in the writing.


Please bear in mind that as an adventure gamer, I have played though, and enjoyed all the games I have mentioned, and I would recommend all of them to seasoned players. That being said, they are not the strongest games of the genre, and if you're looking to get into it, there's better ways than the games mentioned above."

BACsop,tampa,1388850502.0,"Hi!

I live in Tampa and just got back from a trip to Austin. IMO Tampa is not very walkable/bikeable unless you live downtown or very close to it (Hyde Park/Davis Island/Harbour Island). However, these neighborhoods while very nice to live in tend to be extremely expensive. If you like running, Bayshore Blvd is perfect for that and there are some other nice trails in the city.

Tampa is definitely moving in the right direction with regards to urban planning - it has a nice riverwalk (like Austin) that is being expanded, more residential buildings are going up in the core urban area of downtown, new restaurants and bars are sprouting up as well - but it still has a long way to go. That being said, though Tampa's downtown kinda has a 9-5 vibe, it is quite beautiful and has some really nice attractions, like Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park, the Straz Center for the Performing Arts, the Art Museum, and the Tampa Theatre. Adjacent to downtown is the Channelside District, which has the Florida Aquarium and some other attractions.

Austin just implemented a bikeshare program and has a car2go program as well as a good bus system and a light rail line which is due to be expanded I believe. Tampa has none of this (except for a bus system) - public transportation options are very slim and a car is a must if you want to go most places. I hear they are going to implement a bikeshare program in the next year or so though. Apparently there are talks underway for some sort of rail system from the airport, but Tampa is way behind other mid-size cities in this respect. (It's worth mentioning that Tampa has an absolutely fantastic airport - it's really one of the best I've been to.)

You've lived in Florida before so you know what the weather is like. Some love it, some hate it (like me) but make sure your wife is aware of how damn humid and unpleasant Florida is for much of the year.

Austin definitely has a better food/bar scene than Tampa, though Tampa is getting better. There are some really good restaurants here; unfortunately they are not as concentrated like 6th Street or SoCo in Austin. South Howard (SoHo) has a bunch of good bars, but it's a bit of a hike from downtown, so again unless you live in that neighborhood a car is necessary. Ybor City also has some good nightlife as well (and some really cool history with the Cuban cigar factories and all) but it isn't the safest of neighborhoods.

If you and your wife want to live in the suburbs there are some really good options. New Tampa, Wesley Chapel, and Brandon are all relatively nice and not too expensive. However, traffic in and out of the city can be really bad so keep that in mind if you don't like long commutes.

Finally, you mentioned that both you and your wife are very liberal. While Tampa is represented by a Democratic Congresswoman and has a Democratic mayor most of the nicer areas of the city are wealthy and pretty conservative. Austin definitely gives off a very liberal vibe (like Portland, OR or Asheville, NC); you won't find anything like that in Tampa. It's a relatively young city but a lot of the established neighborhoods give off a very traditional feel. That's just my take on it.

I hope this was helpful! I like Tampa. It's not perfect but it is headed in the right direction. I can say one thing for certain though - it's a hell of a lot better than either Naples or Orlando!

**TL;DR: You can't go wrong with either Tampa or Austin; it all comes down to personal preferences.**

thebonnar,AcademicPsychology,1388850632.0,"It depends on what exactly you mean by ""behavior identification."" Anything and everything you can do is a behavior so knowing the reason you're looking to ID a behavior would help with suggestions. Within the area there is Verbal Behavior, principles such as reinforcement, challenging or dangerous behavior, personal behavior change plus others. It's a broad field so more specific details will help. I'm guessing you're interested in challenging behavior because you mention modification (but that's only a guess!). 

Cooper is mentioned here, it's a great book to use as part of a course but I doubt if it would be a good book to use without other course materials. As well as that it might be too detailed if you're looking for materials for a general psych course (source: I read it for two years, it's painful :). If you can throw in any more details about the specific area of behavioural psych I might be able to throw out a suggestion or two. 

Also maybe cross post to r/BehaviorAnalysis. The people there are very helpful and if you look at old posts you'll spot some really important papers that people have linked to. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals/309/ 

this links to the journal of Applied Behaviour Analysis archive where you'll find a ton of free papers. Also a lot of people in the field have dropped ""modification"" for ""analysis"" in the title because of new ways of analysing behaviour that weren't around in the early days of the field. Some people can be sticky about that one so it's good to be aware of. Have a look at JABA anyway for the free articles and see what you find. Hope you get what you're looking for!

He presented the only reasonable arguments against the existence of God.

&gt;Because while I, an atheist, will be the first to admit that arguments specifically against any God possibly existing tend to be weak, arguments for God are all just as weak, if not weaker, when observed under any glass of logic or modern physics- thus introducing the possibility at least of a godless existence.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""logic"" and physics does not refute anything.

&gt;There are tons of perfectly logical reasons that have been presented for the historical existence of spirituality and belief in gods- including an evolutionary one (first link I found, though I've seen the theory provided elsewhere, including in philosophy classes)- which makes the mere near-universal belief in gods across the world (universal when not accounting for individuals) easily explained and thus, not necessarily indicative of anything.

You mean evolutionary science can show that there is a natural desire for God? Excellent, a classic argument for the existence of God is scientifically proven.

I don't get how people think that a natural desire for God is somehow evidence against it, as if evolving a desire for food and water is evidence against the existence of food and water.

&gt;Can I get something to back up that claim, that most atheistic arguments are long since straight-up REFUTED? 

Read the other side thoroughly, and I just woke up so I don't feel like digging up sources.

&gt;I mean, the majority of philosophers (about 70%, by most sources that I've ever seen) are atheists- and these are the guys that spend their entire lifetimes logically analyzing every aspect of life and, obviously, philosophy, including philosophy of religion.

In modern philosophy, the non-existence of God is taken for granted as a question answered long ago. If you haven't noticed, they aren't exactly pumping out new arguments.

&gt;The mere existence of awesome people doesn't mean that they're saints blessed by God. Soldiers jump on grenades to save lives. People die trying to save family members in natural disasters. People suffer tremendously to help people. Without the context of religion, would you think that the historical saints were somehow divine beyond normal people who make great sacrifices? Would you still call their ""virtues"" supernatural?

Do you know the lives of the saints? It was hardly individual incidences that displayed their virtue, it was their entire lives, or, at least, their entire lives post-conversion. As for the other questions, they'd still be heroic people, and it's certainly very possible.

People in that sub are open to these kinds of questions. They just don't want ""How do I remove this virus from my computer?"" or ""How do I protect myself against Cryptolocker?"" type of stuff. I subscribe to, and frequent, that sub. One of the top posts of all time is someone asking about how to get into malware analysis, including methodologies/tools used in the business...so very similar to the question you are asking.

A very high overview of malware analysis methods is possible to give to you, but a detailed step by step method (as you requested) is impractical and useless because all malware is different, and thus requires a different approach to analyzing. What makes a good malware analyst is the ability to recognize what a piece of malware is trying to do, and that requires piecing together a lot of seemingly random or insignificant data. Once they realize what is being attempted, they can continue conducting their investigation. However, if they were merely trying to follow a step by step procedure, they would undoubtedly hit a snag and find themselves at a dead end because they don't actually know any of the concepts behind what they are trying to do."

Gertiel,raisedbynarcissists,1388851183.0,"You don't mention a lot of detail - perfectly fine, btw, you really don't have to! But they do sometimes help in giving advice. I am just presuming you're looking for ideas and information with this posting, though.

The very first and foremost thing is you have to choose this for yourself because if that isn't the case, it is absolutely going to fail. If you are resolute, then it is time to begin. 

In my case, my nParent at least ought to be 100% aware why we are NC, but the actual moment of it ending came about due to a specific event which happened to go through a little earlier than she'd expected. I pretty much ran while the getting was good, and didn't look back. There's always some axe she has to grind and she hopes I will help forward her cause. 

Unfortunately for me, being 100% NC isn't entirely possible since she has power-of-attorney over my grandmother who is in her 90s and in a care home. I do speak with grandma regularly via phone and visit her as much as is possible. If she were to fall into dire straights, my nMomster is the only one the care home would call. 

Once grandma is gone, I will absolutely be 100% NC. I love my grandmother, though, so I hope she lives a lot of years yet. I have spoken with a bunch of family members who've promised to let me know as soon as they hear of grandma being in dire straights. Unfortunately, my grandma has had a couple of scares and my mom didn't let any of the people who'd contact me know until those situations were pretty much resolved. The overall result is while I never, ever contact my nMomster first, I do make an effort to be civil when she calls or I run into her at an extended family event. Thankfully the contact is very rare, especially at family gatherings, since she's often on the outs with the better part of the extended family.

I would say if you're looking for practical advice, the best way to do this is to start by situating yourself somewhere you have a few friends to help keep you balanced while you are going through this. I don't know where I would be without my chosen family of friends. They've been my rock and support though many years now. The best part about punting my nMomster and enabling step-dad from my life is I now get to spend a lot more time with my chosen family.

temmith,boardgames,1388851385.0,"There are 3 types of products a store usually carries: Consumables (items that are usually consumed quickly - such as food products and paints for minis), semi-permanent (items that customers tend to buy a lot of, but are not consumed - such as the actual minis, MTG singles/boosters, and dice), and permanents (items that customers will only buy one of - such as board games, tabletop rpgs, video games). 

FLGS also have a unique secondary ""product"" in the form of events or workshops. 

One of the best ways to figure out if your store will be successful is to determine what you can sell. If what you would mainly be making money off of (ie. the big ticket items) fall in the second or third category, then you need to have the customer base to support that. Are you near a college where you have a high turn-over rate of customers you can sell permanent items continuously to? Do you have a huge fan base of big items like Warmachine/Hordes or Warhammer (keeping in mind that Warhammer representatives are dicks and have strict regulations about how you sell their items)? Can your town/surrounding towns or cities support a business - ie. are FLGS fans from your area currently flocking elsewhere to get their fix?

If you are truly interested in setting up part of the store as a LAN cafe, do you research there too. It's a completely separate area of the gaming world from an FLGS - complete with its own set of problems. They aren't the great money-maker some people think they must be. At least, not after you calculate the cost of maintaining high speed internet, nice computer systems, and the security to take care of them. 

Also, as much as people are pleading for you not to focus solely on MtG, you SHOULD have a large selection of singles if you want to make a tidy profit. I think people underestimate the importance of this product to maintaining an FLGS. Think of it this way: a customer buys a booster for $3.95 from you (you are already making a profit of about $1-$2. They find a card inside with an arbitrary value on it  set by the customer base (popularity/newness). They sell you that card for 1/3 to 1/2 of that amount. So you buy essentially a $.14 card for $18-$20, but then sell it back for a $20 profit. 

And as people have pointed out here, many board game/RPG fans tend to frequent Amazon for product sold at a steep discount. MTG fans don't. Unless they are looking for a very specific card, they go to their local store, where they may make spontaneous buys depending on what your stock of singles are. 

Also, Friday Night Magic (FNM) is not just something a lot of FLGS do, it is actually a WoTC sponsored event. The stores who participate are added to a searchable database on their website. Think of it as free advertising. They also are given prizes to hand out to the winners, instead of having to pull from their own stock. 

Now, this is not saying to ignore your other customers. Please don't. This is a folly many stores run into. They focus TOO exclusively on a single area (near me, one store focuses very heavily on MtG and another seems more focused on Heroclix) and forget that other customers would like to spend money in their establishment as well. 

Having each night be themed helps negate that. Maybe you participate in FNM, but you also have Board Game Sundays, Heroclix Wednesdays, PFS (Pathfinder Society) Thursdays...You will really have to do research to figure out what is viable in your community. Find what groups exist already and go from there...

If you don't have ANY groups near you, then this is probably another sign that this may not work for you in your area. If you really want your life's work to be within the FLGS realm, you should also consider moving to a larger city if you have to. Know what your specific market will support. 

For the questionnaire you gave, I think you are asking all the wrong questions, to be honest. You are asking the internet (a ridiculously large collection of people that literally span the globe) for research information that should be specific for your area. To make it worse, you are asking r/boardgames where people generally spend vast amounts of money on bulking up their collection and post [COMC] tags. This will not help you in the slightest. If no one in your Small Town, USA has even seen Tabletop, then I would say you are SOL and should be grateful you didn't buy-in to this venture already. 

You also need to consider your timeline and how suitable YOU are for this job. Most FLGS fail in part because of the market, but people tend to forget the owner. If you are a shitty business owner, then no amount of research you do on the market will help you. Have you had any schooling in business? You don't NEED to, but at least taking a few classes on start up for new ventures would benefit you. Do you have access to a business consultant to help determine your best business plan? Where do you plan to get the money from? How much capital would you plan to begin with? 

[This is my favourite column on FLGS](http://www.rpg.net/columns/list-column.phtml?colname=businessofgamingretail)

I also want to one day open a gaming store in my city, so I can't tell you not to do this. However, I have been in the process of doing research and bettering myself for it these last 2-3 years. I have taken classes, bought lots of games to learn game mechanics and styles, read up on market trends, get every months copy of GTM. I'm also hyper aware of the issues stemming from internet websites being your biggest competitors....Don't make the mistake of rushing into this IF you really want to do it and it's not just a whim.

GetOffMyLawn_,Hypothyroidism,1388851563.0,"I think you mean hypothyroidism, which is not enough thyroid hormone. They wouldn't give you hormone if you were hyper since hyper means too much thyroid in your system.

You need to see a doctor and at the very least get your TSH and FT4 tested. If you are taking hormone pills you would be getting these tested regularly, at least once a year. You should also get your vitamin D levels checked. I think you can order your own blood tests but then you still need to have them evaluated by a doctor to get something prescribed. One of the sites on the sidebar tells you how to do this.

I have found that large doses of vitamin D helps my depression and it's cheap enough and safe enough that it does no harm to try taking a supplement. I would start at 1000 IU a day. (I take 5000 IU but I also get my vitamin D levels measured yearly. However 10,000 IU is considered the safe upper limit for daily use so quite a lot of leeway here.) Here are some various dosing recommendations. http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/vitamin-d/dosing/HRB-20060400"

Amadameus,answers,1388851648.0,"/u/SirUtnut gave a good summary, but here's a few extra details:

America is currently in a pretty cold snowstorm. Some people's car batteries will actually be too cold to start their cars.

That said, lithium-ion batteries actually perform pretty well in the cold. I've taken Android phones and tested them all the way down to -10 Celsius before they stopped working completely.

Another reason why the battery may have seemed die suddenly while it reported charge remaining is that lithium-ion batteries don't report their state of charge directly. For example, a lead-acid battery like in a car can be measured by its standing voltage (if the voltage is 10, it's dead. If the voltage is 14, it's charged.) but a lithium-ion battery can be at the same voltage for 50% and 100% charged.

Instead, a tiny microcontroller counts how much charge has entered or left the battery and tallies up how much of the battery is left. This is a process similar to calculating the gasoline left in your tank by using your odometer and dividing by your MPG.

Problem with this is, lithium-ion batteries degrade over their lifespan. What happens when the microcontroller is expecting the battery to output 1000mAh and the battery can only hold 750mAh these days?

On older or cheaper battery management systems, this is reflected by a steep dropoff at the tail end of the charge bar. The microcontroller notices the battery's voltage dropping too quickly, so it compensates by lowering the capacity displayed. Suddenly you go from 1 bar left to critically low in seconds!

Then when you charge it again, the microcontroller resumes counting from its earlier total (the one before the voltage crashed) and it seems like it's charging up from 25% even though it was just reporting a critically low 5% state."

And you don't tell him that his cannabis use is ""affecting"" your sex life even though you believe that it is. You don't like (not ""particularly,"" you just don't like it. Own your feelings) his cannabis use, and you think he'd be more frisky without it. Is it about more than just friskiness, do you dislike weed? Do you smoke at all?

Of course, you're attempting to control his sexuality by trying to forbid his masturbating. If a man tried to forbid a women masturbation, she'd dump his ass.

I think that you need to examine the wider relationship, rather than focussing on your boyfriend as having ""a problem."" You've said you both spend almost all your time together, have few friends, rarely go out. He works a lot and is tired afterwards (do you work?). That sounds like a lot of pressure.It sounds like you might be having high expectations of a tired man that just wants to smoke up and relax after work. Maybe you're having fights and he's feeling pressured/not appreciated/emasculated/hurt and is subsequently not often in the mood for lovemaking?

silverionmox,TrueAskReddit,1388851943.0,"&gt; It's unfortunate in that there are places like Japan, which is not suited for nuclear power due to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters, and there are places with very little seismic activity where a nuclear power plant would bear a very very small risk.

The point is not that there exist places that are unsuitable for nuclear power. The point is that we, humans, aren't capable of avoiding them. Increasing the use of nuclear power will increase the prevalence of such accidents.

&gt;Generation IV nuclear reactors 

... are science fiction for now. Sorry. From the wiki: 
""Generation IV reactors (Gen IV) are a set of theoretical nuclear reactor designs currently being researched. Most of these designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030.""

&gt;I'm not saying that nuclear is a permanent solution, but it presents a long-term solution to global energy needs that is much cleaner than coal and in time will be economically competitive as well. By the time we are ""done"" with nuclear power, renewable energy will be far, far cheaper than coal.

Wind energy is already outcompeting coal and nuclear in some places. If we're going to have to make massive investments in research and infrastructure anyway, let's do it for renewables."

We had a small set of condoms that were regular size (just the standard Durex condoms), however they would be really uncomfortable for me, and also make the head look like the pathetic triangle you described. Having sex with those condoms also made me feel almost nothing.

It came to the point that whenever we had to have sex with a condom I would simply turn her down or suggest oral only. At that point she gave away the remaining condoms and bought bigger ones. The difference is pretty big. They're a lot more comfortable, and give a lot better sensation. The triangle thing still happens, although a lot less prominent.

Friend, you need to watch some Bruce Lee movies. What I am reading is a lot of limiting belielfs, you can't do this, you can't change that, it's part of your nature etc. I'm going to pull your post apart and give you some pointers, suicide is bad mmkaay?

&gt;So I found this subreddit and read alot of posts here and well, now I'm posting too.

Good place to start. This is my first post and I only glossed over the sidebar but I think I got this, I am seeing a lot of myself in you.

&gt;I think I need help, because I'm suicidal and in real danger to kill myself.
I dont know, if someone can say that, without confirmation from others, but I think I have a real issue.

There are no physical tests for mental illness, you can self-diagnose, I can't tell you were the line is between suicidal and depression is. I have had depression and the thought of suicide did occur to me in that phase of my life.
 
&gt;So whats my problem? Did I lose anything? Anyone? Do I have no money? No house to live?
If you look on me and my life atm. you would not find any real issue in it or think ""well this guy really needs help"".
But still...I'm on the way to kill myself.
I finished my abitur last year in May and after school was done, I was happy: no school, free time and awhh yiss I had the thing I learned 12 years for.
After that I just did nothing, I never wanted to do something like school again, I hated it, it was pain for me (even if I was not bad in school) and after finishing it,

I feel you bro. I was bullied relentlessly, If someone tries to touch me, be it a pat or a hug I flinch away like I'm expecting to be punched. School sucked, but you are free of that never have to go back.


&gt;I instantly deleted 80% of my ""friendslist"", because the people annoyed me and I never really liked them. 

I kept most people from school, deleted to assholes and bitches, kept the dumb ones around to laugh at.

&gt;And thats how the real issue started, **since June 2013 I never really left my room or had fun outside.**

This concerns me I'll get back to it.


&gt;Well yes, I was shopping and met my best friend a few (short) times, but nothing really big.
I began to stop being social. I just write a few sms a month, to hold onto 2-3 people, but thats it, the only contact I have daily are my friends, I play games with (I know them in real life too, but since school is done, we rarely meet.)

Can I recommend, inviting them to do pub trivia one night? This is a big step as it takes confidence to organise something like this, but worth keeping in mind. Even if only 1 or 2 show up the first time, if you talk of how much fun you guys had, talking over beers, you might encourage more people to come next time.

&gt;I'm a **annoying personality**, that makes it hard for others to really like me, because **I'm stressed out all the time and I get easily get angry.**
I have a lot of fucked up character traits, so it isnt easy to get a friendship going with me. (For example: **I dislike people who are ""dumber"" than me**, but **I'm also jealous and pissed around smarter people.** I dont hate them or something like that, but I cant stand it) **I'm a dick.** I know about that, **but I cant change it, its my nature,** thats me.

Everyone is there own worst critic. I have worked night and day for the last two years to make myself a better man. I used to get angry really quickly, I used to be jealous, I used to be spiteful and hurtful, for no reason, I used to wish horrible things on people. I haven't cured myself yet but I am working on it. For instance, jealousy is an emotion for weak people, who are in a bad position (normally their own fault), once you realise this, you can stop being jealous and be envious. eg. ""Fuck that asshole that invented XYZ, i bet he's snorting blow off the backs of $1000 a night hookers"" that's jealousy, it's really just finely veiled hate. Instead these days I am Envious. eg 'Wow, that guy that invented XYZ was pretty damn smart, I wish I had thought of that.'

&gt;To add to my difficult character traits, I'm also in really niche things: I like anime and manga. I read alot of books and hear niche music.

Anime and manga, are just a form of media. Like books, movies, video games, photography. I can't say drop it, but I would recommend cutting down your exposure and taking that time up with another medium, like tv. I hate to say it but I have actively avoided anime in my life because it makes me look like a nerd, there is so much to enjoy in this world, I can afford to miss out on one form of art.


&gt;I dislike sport (well I try to jog every day, but well...).

I hate sport, my friends can sit down to watch cricket for 5 days. I'd be bored before that game starts. Depression which is what I think you may have (I'm not a doctor) is very beatable. Jog everyday. Phyical activity is easily the biggest change i have made in my life in the last two years. Two years ago, I could run 2km without severe pain, due to sitting in a computer chair my whole life. Now girls like seeing my arms. It breeds such confidence within you. If you take nothing else away from this keep running.

&gt;I'm a nerd, and I like it, I'm good with computerthings, the internet etc.
Thats how it is.

I don't know about in Germany but in Australia the girl on facebook use so many memes, I cringe every time I open the thing up. As long as you don't count in hexadecimal instead of decimal, don't worry about it. Girl's like guys with a passion, a drive. My brother is into lockpicking, and flying his quadcopter. He also watches anime and is studying programming at uni which do you reckon he tells the ladies about?

&gt;I started studying in August and I hate it.
I dislike it, I hate the place I study, I hate the crowded university and I cant connect with any people there.

Quit, join the workforce. I did that, guess where I'm going this year? Back to uni. Working in the 'real world' helped give perceptive to my life. People are happy working boring shit jobs, for worse pay. It's bloody scarely. Join the workforce, save some money go backpacking across Europe. See the Aurora Borealis from Norway. 

&gt;My parents pressure me and my stepdad is a fucking cunt, that says, I wont make it anyways and I cost him money and all that shit.
Since my mother married this idiot, I hate him, hes a typical snob, that pressures his view of the world in others. Everybody that does not think like him is an idiot and is useless in this world.
Goddamn I hate this guy, I even tought about killing him, but I have a little brother and I'm to weak and cant really harm people, I hate violence.
I'm under such heavy pressure, I pressure myself and everything my parents say pressures it harder.
Yesterday my stepdad said ""Well thats what I foresee: A useless guy with a mediocre graduation, that costed me alot of money.""
After that I said to him, that would not happen, I take care of that, because, when it happens I'm away anyways.
Well he did not understand it, but I tried to show him, that I would kill myself, when I fail.
But no, noone understands my hints or my behaviour.
My mother doens't look at me anymore, never asks if anything is okay or something like that.
My stepdad is a cunt and other family members or my friends (the 3 I have) only see my ""always smile"" face and know my behavior and character (or think they know me)and discount it as ""yeah thats him, he is like that"". I'm burned out, I sit in a corner of my room and just want a new reality. I hate the society, its rules and all that shit.
All the requierements you need to fullfill, all the things everybody wants you to do and what you need to do. All that, I'm SICK of it.

I have a lot of issues myself with my family. I can't really give much advice, I haven't found anything that works. If you do quit Uni you may be able to afford to move out.

&gt;I wanted to write so much more, I had so much more in my head, but now I'm sitting here and cant write it properly.
The conclusion of that is...I plan to jump in front of a train next week. Maybe friday, because I need to get up later and take a train with no schoolkids.

I have close friends that are train drivers please, please don't do this.

It's not a safe way to die, you could end up as a vegetable in hospital, unable to move your body in anyway, but with no brain damage, set to live the rest of your life, hated by those who have to care for you, it's possibly the worst injury that you can sustain. You will fuck up that train drivers life forever, s/he doesn't need that."

They also never read the original manuscripts of Aristotle or Plato and those manuscripts are a hell of a later than any scripture manuscript. And yet, you wouldn't reject their writings and contributions to Aristotelian or Platonic thought.

melmano,Vivillon,1388852660.0,"Hi ! First of all, welcome to the Vivillon collecting scene :) I'll do my best to answer your questions :)

So first : Yes, there's only one pattern per cartridge. All Scatterbugs (who evolve into Vivillons) generated or caught in your game will be your own pattern. This means, as my pattern is Polar, that every Scatterbug/Vivillon I catch in the wild, even the safari ones, and every Scatterbug I breed will be Polar.

The way the game determines your pattern depends on your country and region (which is set in your 3DS settings) *at the time you created your savefile*. What this means is you keep your pattern no matter what 3DS you use. This, however, also means you can *cheat* the system, by changing your location in your 3DS and create a new savefile to get the pattern you like best or something.

You can check [this website](http://www.pokebeach.com/forums/thread-vivillon-secret-of-the-wings-colours-locations-possible-new-wings) for a list of where the different patterns can be found in the world. There was a better website, but Chrome says it turned malicious or something...

If you have other questions I'll be glad to answer these as well :)"

I have told him I don't like it, but i don't let it become a sore point in our relationship because, as I stated, I know he does it to relax. Where I live, 90% of the population here smokes, so it's something I'm used to being around all the time. 

I've only brought up the fact that maybe it's his marijuana use that lowers his drive because there have been instances where he would get home and raring to go, but after he smokes a few bowls all he wants to do is sleep, which is extremely frustrating.

mhblm,changemyview,1388852689.0,"Hopefully these studies will allay some of your concerns with the cohort study. If you don't believe me, go to google scholar, type in the keywords ""cannabis"" and ""schizophrenia."" There is a consensus among researchers that cannabis causes schizophrenia in a small minority of people.

&gt;Cannabis use is associated with poor outcome in existing schizophrenia and may precipitate psychosis in individuals with preexisting liability. To investigate the overall effect size and consistency of the association between cannabis and psychosis, a meta-analysis from prospective studies was carried out. The pooled odds ratio was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7–2.5) and **could not be explained by confounding or reverse causality**.

http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/3/608.short

&gt;**Patients with previous cannabis abuse had significantly more rehospitalizations**, tended to worse psychosocial functioning, and scored significantly higher on the psychopathological syndromes “thought disturbance” (BPRS) and “hostility” (AMDP). These results confirm the major impact of cannabis abuse on the long-term outcome of schizophrenic patients.

http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004060050064#page-1

&gt;In summary, while it remains possible that associations between cannabis and psychotic symptoms are non-causal and can be explained away as a result of inadequate measurement, residual confounding and reverse causation, the weight of the evidence, including observational research, animal studies, laboratory research and behavioural genetic research **all points to a causal process in which increasing use of cannabis is associated with small but detectable increases in the risks of psychosis and psychotic symptoms.** 

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.02959.x/full

And, for good measure:

&gt;There is some evidence that cannabis use can contribute to schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that cannabis is neither a sufficient nor necessary factor in developing schizophrenia, but that cannabis may significantly increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and may be, among other things, a significant causal factor. Nevertheless, some previous research in this area has been criticised as it has often not been clear whether cannabis use is a cause or effect of schizophrenia. To address this issue, a recent review of prospective cohort studies has suggested that cannabis statistically doubles the risk of developing schizophrenia on the individual level, and may, if a causal relationship is assumed, be responsible for up to 8% of cases in the population.

See the ad at the top there? It doesn't even have a redirect through a clickmeasurer that i can tell (maybe you can verify that if you know how). Its a direct sale of adspace, not serving up a conveyor belt of ads, just one, with a plain old link. Which means its not tracking, not exposing your users to possible bait and switch malware attacks some adservers fall victim to, and is providing some ad sponsorship.

4chan had j-list for years, although that one did pass through some clickthrough measuring service, it was probably less awful than the typical ad-server system where it can be anything, not even targeted.

If you have lost money until now, but absorbed a lot of the damage and thats in the past, and your outstanding bill itself isn't that huge, you should consider new revenue now, if you are a webmail service, adding something like the above from some mlp fandom related and relevant service marketed to bronies.

Look at ponycountdown.com for another example, they have less overheads than you i'd expect. They do it. I admit i dont know how they do it, because i use adblock (which means they probably use something they didnt make themself, even though they say it is specifically products aimed at bronies).

Its not that evil, if you do it right. And could make the thing break even rather than bankrupt you. It might never look amazing, but you will progress to a point where it will have to close, unless you fund it sustainably.

I mean, another method, if you refuse to advertise, is the Jimmy Wales pitch, for which you could use a combination of a paypal donate button, a bitcoin/bitpay(bitpay might be a % cut i dunno, bitcoin itself is free) address, and something else, i dunno much about what there is available...kickstarter/indiegogo? The methods of payment/donation could be mixed/multiple, but the pitch would be the same, send out a mass email to your users, to ask your them how to deal with a situation thats been creeping up on you for a while. Ask them what their level of interest is in the future of the service, and if they would be prepared to engage with some kind of donation drive to pay off the bill, how you could balance this in the future, would they accept a single ad, if not do they have any ideas for an alternative way to make the service sustainable.

If you ask them, you might be surprised by a supportive response, its good to ask your users for advice, rather than simply pitch a Jimmy Wales out of the blue, as it is a community gesture, not just hanging out your cap. 

You will essentially poll what kind of users you have and whether or not they have the means or the will to help you make the ""rent"". If not you can work out how much further you are prepared to commit your own money your earn to the losses the service is making.

Let me know what you think. I love the little indie guy, alternatives and competition are good for the future, best of luck."

Amadameus,answers,1388853224.0,"&gt; Is it that a battery requires a chemical reaction to occur at a certain rate for it to be able to power a phone? And since the reaction occurs less quickly as it discharges, and even more slowly at lower temperatures, in the cold a battery has more stored charge when the rate of the reaction is no longer able to power a device?

This is it exactly. Good assessment!

A battery is a chemical reaction that pushes two things - electrons and ions. While electrons are pushed out the battery and through the circuit, ions dissociate through the battery and onto other parts within it.

Colder liquid means it takes longer for ions to move from one side to the other.

Have you ever used a cordless drill while the battery pack was dying? It would die in your hands, but then if you stopped for a moment and started up again, it had a few seconds of life. (This is less true of the new Li-ion ones than it is of the older NiMH and NiCd packs)

Why does a battery seem to come back a little when it's given a chance to rest?

Every battery has what's called *internal resistance.* That's the battery's ability to change state. For example, a battery with 0 internal resistance can discharge from 100% down to 0% in no time at all. It's basically a capacitor.

A battery with a small internal resistance like a NiCd battery can discharge quickly without problems. But what about a high internal resistance, say a 9V battery?

A 9V battery isn't really designed to discharge quickly, it's designed to power low-draw devices like a fire alarm for a long, long time. If you connect it to a circuit that pulls more amperage, the chemical reaction inside can't keep pace with the speed the electrons 'want' to move at.

Trying to discharge a battery faster than it can handle causes voltage drop. The battery is still trying to discharge as fast as it can, but it just doesn't have the force of high voltage behind its current any more.

This is why you feel your cordless drill die in your hands.

But when you turn the drill off, now all of a sudden the reaction in the batteries can catch back up - they were only 25% dead after all, not 0%. The voltage returns to its normal state.

Then you pull the trigger on the drill and ask for a bunch of current - the normal state of the batteries can keep up, but only for a second before they fail to keep up and die again.

Whenever I describe this phenomenon to people, I usually compare it to conveyor belts. There are two - one on the outside moving electrons, and one on the inside moving ions. The inside one slows down as the battery dies, while the outside one continues at a speed dictated by the electronic circuit. When the outside one turns off, the inside one can catch back up."

1) Marry your son to a foreign count/duke/king/emperor's (depending on your goals and size) daughter. Kill her siblings. The grandchild, who you will eventually be, will be heir to both titles.

Once you have enough counties (or claims for them), claim independence, and form the duchy/usurp your liege's depending on where you fabricated claims. 

3) It's a delegation system. You need to keep your demense size under your limit for optimal taxes, and also it's easier to keep one king happy rather than 15 dukes.

duckface08,AskWomen,1388853367.0,"Seconding this so much.

Everybody has different face shapes, eye shapes, lip shapes, ""best features"", etc., so why should one technique that works for one person work well for another? Make-up techniques that work for me won't necessarily work for a friend who has different eyes or face shape than me.

For example, for the longest time, I hardly ever used eyeshadow because I couldn't seem to apply it correctly. I followed the diagrams and looked up video tutorials on YouTube and just could not get it when I tried it for myself. I then stumbled upon a blog of an Asian make-up artist that basically explained in great detail that Asian eyes are shaped differently and therefore require different shadowing techniques. My mind was blown.

Therefore, your best bet is to go to someone who knows how to highlight the best parts of your face and downplay aspects of it that you might not want obvious. They can also help you match colours and shades and such. After that, you can start experimenting a little more on your own to find your own personal style."

2. I don't like the work of having to sleeve cards.
3. I don't feel it's in the spirit of the game to protect the cards.

...that last item is weird, I know... but I feel like a game is supposed to be played as-is. It's going to wear, I know that - but games are still playable after they've been worn. I've played games at Snakes &amp; Lattes that have been absolutely beaten, battered, and bruised by hundreds of non-gamer hands, had rulesbooks torn up, and pieces replaced with pieces from other games... and they're still fun to play. If it's REALLY bad, I'll buy another copy in ten years (assuming I'm still playing that game).

Having said that - there are exceptions. Love Letter is a game that can't withstand any markup, because there are so few cards involved in the game and any markings would quite easily break the game. Games like Coup or Mascarade would also fall into that category.

Otherwise, I avoid sleeving at all costs."

kratistos,AskHistorians,1388853531.0,"&gt; Berg is just a traditional German surname suffix.

It's very, very rare. I'm German and if I meet a Gold/Silber/Rosen -berg I'm going to assume he's Jewish. As anybody will here. 

And by the way, Alfred Rosenberg is **still** rumored to have Jewish ancestors and has been so since at least 1937 when L'Osservatore Romano, the daily Vatican newspaper, had an article claiming exactly this on him.

Even Ernst Piper, who wrote ""Alfred Rosenberg. Hitlers Chefideologe"" (a very decent biography) strongly suggests that there were documents that would have proven Rosenberg's Jewish ancestry but were destroyed in the last weeks of the war.

Piper also talks about the fact that the rumors in the 30's were that Rosenberg ""had not a drop of German blood"" and only ""Jews, French, Mongols and Latvians"" in family tree.

-berg is more of a suffix for locations. Most of the German surnames with -berg that come to mind are names of nobles, like Von Rechenberg or Battenberg."

Vocaloid works by drawing from a bank of hundreds of short voice samples (for every combination of sounds the human mouth can make) to construct sentences and song lyrics. In that sense it's just like any other sample based text to speech program. There are also duplicates of all the samples for different pitch ranges, since the voice is required to sing. To produce an exact note, the program might pick a ""close enough"" sample and change the pitch as required by playing it faster or slower.

As for how they produce each unique voice that Vocaloid can sing with, the samples are all recorded from human voice actors. That's the whole point of sample based speech synthesis. It sounds much more natural than a voice generated from scratch by a computer algorithm. Hatsune Miku for example, one of the most popular Vocaloid voices, is based on recordings of Japanese voice actress Saki Fujita."

To clarify - it's never a big deal with family or friends, but I can't help but be aware of it. I'm 20 years old, for reference, and 5'5"" and I weigh 105 pounds. I'm really small. Most guys weigh maybe twice what I do, at least.  Regardless of whether I exercise, or whether a guy exercises, I would lose to a guy, every time. I'm lucky that I don't face many dangerous situations, but the awareness is still there. Physically speaking, most guys out there (excepting maybe the skinniest of them) are twice as wide as me in the waist and torso, or bigger. Many guys are a foot taller than me. Someone could get their hands most of the way around my waist if they grabbed me, or close their hand (at least most of the way) around my upper arm. 

I would *not* be able to get away if a guy had bad intentions. He might not even have to get me alone, because, as the OP in the original thread shows, a guy can put a girl in a situation (even in a crowd) where her best option may be to do nothing in hopes of not escalating the situation or facing social repercussions. This physical power dynamic is something I'm pretty sure most guys aren't aware of at all. Even if a woman works out and is stronger than most other women, she still could be overpowered easily by many guys.

We also have laws that if any major infrastructural project is planned and your house just happens to be in the way of that, you're SOL. 

What happened in the Netherlands is that after WWII when suburbanization started. In the 60's, when though advances in technology it became feasible to commute longer distances to work, people started to move out of the old 19th century neighbourhoods, which were all but falling apart and very small, into the surrounding towns in the countryside to have a safe and quiet place for their kids to grow up. In order to prevent the so called ""Green Heart"", the rural area in between the 4 biggest cities in the Netherlands and the complete breakdown of all infrastructure around the cities and he government pretty much immediately took a tight grip on this and only allowed for the construction of new houses in several so called growth-cores. 

This process ultimately failed, because the new commuters were still too much for the infrastructure. Local government saw fully well that these problems existed, but more people = more money from taxes, so the building continued in those growth cores. Another big problem was that with people moving out of the cities, there wasn't enough money coming into the local government to be able to keep the services a city is supposed to provide running. This led to people fleeing the cities at an even greater pace, and the cities themselves got a lot of issues with crime and drugs.

In the 80s, the government saw what was happening and realized that people needed to move back to the cities. They managed to do this by expanding next to the cities and by knocking down and rebuilding everything in the old 19th century neighbourhoods. The government also provided a lot of incentives to move back to cities. Through major upgrades to trains and highways the problem was somewhat solved.

Since then there has been a wave of re-suburbanization and re-deurbanization, and there are still a lot of problems. For example, if the weather is bad it is not uncommon for there to be a traffic jam on more than 1000km of the total 2300km of highways in the country."

That's what you need to prove. That this action is hardwired in, because it seems a bit silly to me. In the past and present, the whole village collaborates to feed and protect the children, completely outside of gender roles. The elderly grandmother protects the child as much as the male warriors.

Normally I'd agree with you. Yes it takes a woman (or a scientist who can put together a nutrient drink) to feed an *infant*. So for nine months after conception and a month after birth, a woman is necessary ish. After that, no, not really.

At this point, all you can say that, ""The system of a human body is branched into two types, or genders, to facilitate childbirth."" It says nothing about our roles, how we behave or what we're attracted to. Which is what OP's point is in the first place."

2. Some gay people have an accent, but neither my husband nor I do, nor do most other gay people I know (not a huge sample). To the extent I've seen this discussed, it's predominantly perceived as a sociolinguistic marker. But another way to think about it is ""Why do all you straight guys have such an accent?"" Say you're a healthy young hetero male with an effeminate voice. You're going through adolescence. Do you, perhaps, learn to pitch your voice lower and speak with less affect? A gay guy, particularly, a more effeminate one, is already majorly violating social norms in their preference for partners.

Sadly, DC is bad at getting the classic Secret Origins series on the digital market. [Only three issues are currently available through the Comixology platform.](http://www.readdcentertainment.com/Secret-Origins-1986-1990/comics-series/8681) I'm not going to make any assumptions about your life, so if you say you don't have room for a single comics magazine, I believe you. Comics are kind of a bitch to keep sorted once you start collecting more than a few, even with boxes, not mention wanting bags and boards for protection and all that nonsense. As somebody who does not have a lot of storage space, I really only have room for the one shortbox I keep. And I'm certainly not going to tell you to go out and spend your money on these single issues with added shipping.  
  
But we have rules here, against posting full comics, or half comics, or full stories within comics. It doesn't matter if it's 25 years old. It doesn't matter if it's an actual post or a comment. [We have rules.](http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/strrp/changes_to_image_policyetiquette_in_rcomicbooks/) I love comics. I wish every great classic comic were easily accessible for people to read. I wish DC would quit sitting on all these great classics and just put them on the marketplace, because people would buy them, and they sure as hell aren't making money on, say, the Starman Omnibus tales, by having Volume 3 be 100 dollars on the secondhand market.

Lyte_theelf,casualiama,1388854623.0,"Short answer: Candida Overgrowth and Leaky Gut Syndrome; the diet fuels my body appropriately and keeps candida in check (by supporting the healthy probiotics candida competes with) while healing my gut (by easing the digestive process, giving my body the perfect building blocks to rebuild intestinal walls and by not doing further damage).

Longer Answer: I have been chronically tired and depressed for most of my life, without realizing how bad it was because I never knew anything different. I've also gotten sick pretty easily with stuff like strep, yeast infections, uti's, stomach bugs, etc etc, and have been put on antibiotics frequently, especially as a very young child. More recently I started getting food intolerances; suddenly I couldn't digest cow's milk, and then shortly (a couple months) after that started, it seemed like I couldn't digest anything. Every time I ate, I bloated up and looked pregnant. My stomach would make crazy noises, I'd feel ultra tired and sluggish, have brain fog and be super moody.

Keep in mind, this was while I was eating exclusively organic food and a vegetarian. I frequently ate brown rice and beans, quinoa, farro, tofu, nutritional yeast, oats and oatmeal, fruits and nuts. All food that conventional wisdom would tell you is ULTRA HEALTHY and SUPER GOOD FOR YOU. I really had no idea why I was having these digestive problems.

I started taking an enzyme with every meal and that helped a ton, and I researched endlessly. I started reading up on Candida Overgrowth and realized I was the perfect candidate... Antibiotic overuse, yeast infections, poor digestion, brain fog, constant random itchiness and rashes. I started a Candida cleanse and had classic die-off reactions, confirming my self-diagnosis. Kept researching, found Leaky Gut Syndrome and that rounded it off, explaining the onset of food intolerances and my inability to digest anything properly (as well as some TMI-type things you don't want to hear about, lol).

Unfortunately if you search ""Candida Diet"" on the internet, you'll read ten dozen different articles that all say different things. It's honestly ridiculous, but I tried and failed because I was still eating a dairy-heavy (sheep and goat dairy, that is) diet (according to many of these sites, yogurt and keffir are fine because they have probiotics. So stupid). 

Eventually I found Paleo and took to it really easily, and I finally started feeling better. I realized that all dairy really messes with my health, whether cow, goat or sheep, and that I was really missing out on my greens and my protein. 

This is the first time I've been able to handle my depression and anxiety on my own. My digestion is awesome and my energy levels are getting better all the time. :)

Paleo heals because it supports your body's natural ability to take care of itself. Every food I eat is medicinal in a sense. It's pretty awesome."
funkymunniez,boston,1388854623.0,"This has zero to do with free market capitalism and everything to do with 1) the amount of complaints filed vs those unreported, 2) the manpower of the inspection office that covers these incidents, and 3) the penalties for violation of he regulations hes ignoring.  Im sure you could also include a 4) donations to politicians in there too.If youd notice, hes lost a ton of the cases filed against him but when you have a transient student population that is inexperienced or just wont complain, a lot of it goes under the radar.  Also,  the inspection dept that reals with this stuff probably has 20 people in it (and thats a really, *really,* ***really***, generous guess). It would take 5 years just to cover half of the apartment units in boston.  Never mind all 140,000.  Also, you can make the penalites higher and still have free market capitalism.

At any rate, free market capitalism, communist,  socialism, taoism, whatever wouldnt prevent this.  Thats a terrible boogey man people keep throwing out like its the source of all our problems when in reality, the issues lie elsewhere."

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1388854635.0,"Land tax - eh, I have problems with it. First of all, owning land, unless you own a massive crapton of it, doesn't mean you have an income, many landowners are your simple home owners, and I don't believe property tax is an equitable way to tax people. Second, I think the idea of tying value in society to land is kinda outmoded. In today's capitalist society, I think that the big problem isn't land use or whatever (besides the pollution issue), it's growing income/wealth inequality, and I'd rather address that in a more direct way than land.

As far as VAT, that has issues insofar as it's regressive. Poor and middle class people spend their money, while the rich invest large sums of it instead. So the people who look to benefit from UBI will hit with taxes while the rich don't.

If we want to go off of the citizens' dividend idea, I think it needs to be updated from the 18th century concept Thomas Paine had tying it to land ownership, and have it be a dividend based on the wealth or income of the entire country. After all, major factors that I think will fuel the necessity of a basic income are growing wealth inequality, and a disappearance of jobs. That being said, UBI should ultimately look like a transfer of wealth from the rich and successful to those who are not as well off. I think typing it to an income or payroll tax is the best bet. If we were to have a VAT at all, I'd only recommend a small one, as this in itself devalues the UBI. I think one member of this subreddit did the calculations and we'd need like a 127% sales tax or something that ridiculous to pay for UBI. I'd rather tie it to income, corporate, and capital gains taxes. "

alienkcc451,AskReddit,1388854778.0,"As a nice guy myself I can tell you the answer to this question.  I am sorry if this is harsh - They don't find you attractive.  Its nothing personal.  In high school and college I grew close to 2 incredibly beautiful women - 9s both of them.  Whereas at the time, I was maybe a 6, ok a 5 on a good day. I always was the great friend, available to hang out and talk, be supportive, listen… and I hemmed and hawed and complained why me, why was I stuck in the friend zone.  The friend zone exists because she says she wants a nice guy and one who will listen to her and love her, and you do… but she doesn't find you attractive.  She wants her nice guy to look like Liam Hemsworth or Ryan Gosling.   You don't.  So you stay a friend, clearly more involved in the relationship than she is.  (I can say this because I have been there.)  There's two solutions to our problem- 1) get better looking.  Get in shape (this was my problem.  I was pretty fat back then), dress better, care about your appearance and she *might* begin to notice you.  2) lower your standards.  A 9 or 10 might be gorgeous, but if she's not into you, start looking at the people that are closer to your level  and I promise the friend zone won't be an issue.

ssnider23,hockey,1388854956.0,"The whole chemistry question has been really intriguing to me to as of recent.  One of my biggest thoughts has been regarding this chemistry, I could not picture Duncan Keith on the ice without Brent Seabrook to his left.  Seabs is a good player (probably not Olympic worthy without Keith) but he is an astounding player with Keith by his side.  I'm sure the same can be said for the less of the many duos.  

In my opinion, I believe they will leave Stamkos off the roster for injury to clear up a spot for someone else.  I know Canada really wants Stamkos on this Olympic team, but they also want to see him play in the NHL for the rest of the season.  If they do decide to take Stamkos, he will probably be on the ice very minimally, and it will result in St. Louis not making the cut.  

I think in the end, the lock combos for the team are Crosby-Kunitz, Toews-Sharp (Sharp is on fire, see other threads), and Perry-Getzlaf. 
The locks without combos will be Bergeron, Tavares, Subban, Staal, and Nash (maube not Nash, but I loved watching his skill when he was on Columbus. Kicked the Hawks butts a lot.)"

~~for the ""catch"" points do you just need to get the ball over the truss and hit a teammate before the carpet?~~

edit: so catching you have to possess a ball, here are the rules pertaining to possession:

G12 An ALLIANCE may not POSSESS their opponent’s BALLS. The following criteria define POSSESSION : 


A) “carrying” (moving while supporting BALLS in or on the ROBOT), 
B) “herding” (repeated pushing or bumping), 
C) “launching” (impelling BALLS to a desired location or direction), and 
D) “trapping” (overt isolation or holding one or more BALLS against a FIELD element or ROBOT in an 
attempt to shield them). 


Violation: TECHNICAL FOUL per instance. 
Examples of BALL interaction that are not POSSESSION are 
A. “bulldozing” (inadvertently coming in contact with BALLS that happen to be in the path of 
the ROBOT as it moves about the FIELD) and 
B. “deflecting” (being hit by a propelled BALL that bounces or rolls off the ROBOT). 


A BALL that becomes unintentionally lodged on a ROBOT will be considered POSSESSED by the 
ROBOT. It is important to design your ROBOT so that it is impossible to inadvertently or 
intentionally POSSESS an opponent’s BALL.

Next, get some with a two inch heel and repeat the process.

Also you might just want to improve your balance generally, in which case I suggest getting yourself a basketball or similar, stand on one leg about two feet from a wall. Now bounce the ball off the wall, alternating legs when you get tired, and try and build up the number of bounces you can do before you wobble. If you start to wobble, see if you can re-centre yourself without touching the ground. Repeat daily and your balance will improve. You could also take a tai chi class - it's amazing for improving your balance.

Heels are a LOT easier to wear once you have a good idea of your own centre of gravity. Then it's a case of wearing them until the shoes become an extention of your body. You also need to use your core muscles for this, so if you're feeling wobbly on heels try tightening your stomach muscles and pulling yourself back into correct posture. Shoulders should be above hips, and move your hips when you walk to get that nice high heeled walk.

Can't speak for everyone here, but if I want a AWD Crossover, it's because I plan on using it in a way/location that lets me take advantage of the AWD, additional cargo room (supposedly) and ground clearance.  To the mountains maybe?  Oh wait.  They go for fuel efficiency (which has its place in this world) and the only engine I can get in this piece is a shitty four-banger.

&gt;The discussion is regarding if a man can father a child and then relinquish all responsibility. My response is no he cant.

That's inconsistent, since you allow a woman to do the same.

&gt;they are, but that's not what was being discussed.

The whole point was that men should be granted that right, *because* women can do it as well. You don't get to exclude inconvenient arguments because they prove you wrong.

&gt;The reason why i don't consider the argument that women also get the chance to abort the pregnancy is because its her body.

That's the reason why she gets the right to abortion. Unfortunately, that means that she can opt out of parenthood as well. So we should give the man the same right, even if the woman only acquired it as a side effect of another right.

&gt;her choice, one that the man has nothing but a potential advisory role in.

Yes, I'm not arguing otherwise. Likewise, she should have nothing but a potential advisory role in whether the man wants to become a parent or not.

The whole question of the thread is whether men should be allowed to opt out before that in certain circumstances.

It's very, very rare. I'm German and if I meet a Gold/Silber/Rosen -berg I'm going to assume he's Jewish. As anybody will here.

And by the way, Alfred Rosenberg is still rumored to have Jewish ancestors and has been so since at least 1937 when L'Osservatore Romano, the daily Vatican newspaper, had an article claiming exactly this on him.
Even Ernst Piper, who wrote ""Alfred Rosenberg. Hitlers Chefideologe"" (a very decent biography) strongly suggests that there were documents that would have proven Rosenberg's Jewish ancestry but were destroyed in the last weeks of the war.

Piper also talks about the fact that the rumors in the 30's were that Rosenberg ""had not a drop of German blood"" and only ""Jews, French, Mongols and Latvians"" in family tree."

If you take those patterns across a wide number of individuals and create an ""average"", so to speak, you can then ""teach"" software to recognize this pattern and move accordingly. 

Mind you, you're not saying ""if you see this pattern, execute this set of movements"" but rather ""because pattern A corresponds to movement A and pattern B corresponds to movement B, the observed pattern likely corresponds to this movement.""

Intigo,Guildwars2,1388855855.0,"The gates and walls look different when upgraded. They get significantly stronger looking. If you cannot tell by the look yet then you can target a Wall or a Gate and the target will show up as ""Door"" / ""Reinforced Door"" or ""Wall"" / ""Reinforced Wall"" / ""Fortified Wall"" depending on where the Keep is at in terms of upgrades. It's also worth noting whether Cannons are up or not.

A scout needs to be very good at reporting info and staying in touch with your Commander(s). In particular: 

* Enemy movement - try to avoid terms like ""zerg"" or ""blob"" and get very good at telling numbers from a quick glance. People use ""zerg"" so loosely that it can be hard to know how many people are talking about when they do. Additionally, it's important to be able to distinguish an enemy Commander group of 30 unorganized people and a guild group of 25 very organized people. Know the enemy, know what you are reporting - if it's a guild group, report that! There's a large difference between ""~30 PS group leaving N Hills towards NE supply camp"" and ""~25 Red Guard leaving N hills towards NE supply camp"" in regards to whether it can be engaged by your friendly Commander.

As from the above example, good intel is usually reported like this (the last 2 being in case they are already attacking something):

&gt; ""&lt;numbers&gt; &lt;server&gt;/&lt;possible guild&gt; &lt;location&gt; &lt;direction&gt; &lt;siege up&gt; &lt;gate/wall %&gt;""

* Upgrade status of objectives - it's worth telling the Commander if an objective can be easily capped or if a Wall/Gate is damaged from an earlier assault

Besides scouting, Thief is well-suited for ensuring very few Dolyaks reach an enemy Keep which they may be trying to upgrade. Stay on top of that and it may be a lot easier to cap later on."

am5437435,electronic_cigarette,1388855879.0,"Right, but are you suggesting that everything he says on stage is insincere or ironic or meaningless?  Because it isn't.

In the show, there's a scene where the guys are playing cards and they talk about using ""faggot"" in their acts.  The gay friend at the table explains where the word comes from (ie. gays were burned like bundles or ""faggots"" of wood and thus ""faggot"" was applied to gays as well).  It was a heavy moment in the show.  Reminded me of the exact same conversation I had with my gay friend when I called someone a ""fag"" in his presence.  I was advocating for the same position as Louis on stage and he was taking the position of Louis in the show.

*Edit* I'm also reminded of that scene with Willem Defoe in Boondock Saints where he's in bed with his male lover and the lover ""just wants to cuddle"" and Defoe calls him a fag.  Was Defoe's character exhibiting self-loathing or the internalization of cultural bigotry?  No, he wasn't.  His lover was just acting all faggy - which was a separate issue from the homosexual sex they had just had.

I fully agree with the bit he does about the word.  In the past, when I called people a fag, it had nothing to do with sexual orientation - they were just acting like a fag.  Now that I've grown up a bit and understood just how hurtful it can be to people, I don't use it unless I am *really* trying to be offensive and hurtful.

So, actually, by learning about how hurtful the word can be, it has become more hurtful in my usage.  I save it for when I want to invoke its hurtfulness rather than its benign usage for someone acting all faggy."

For what it's worth, I agree with you, everyone I knew was shitting bricks over him, particularly *The Fault in Our Stars* (which is bar none my least favorite of his. I read it at the time where a young relative of mine was battling with leukemia and I honestly found it to be emotionally exploitative, like he was intentionally writing about a super sensitive subject just to get knee-jerk reactions. The fact that it was a lot of my extended family *who were going through the same thing* that thought the book was so good infuriated me to no end) and I'm thinking ""yeah, he's... alright? He's not a bad writer by any stretch of the imagination, but he's not like God's gift to the literary world"". I even have some issues with his other works like *Looking for Alaska* because it was pretty obvious to me that the character of Alaska Young was just some dude remembering the kind of girl he would've liked to have dated in high school. In other words it was pretty obvious it was some middle aged dude trying to write a cool and edgy female character and it didn't quite work, though I did enjoy the book on the whole. The same applies to Margo in *Paper Towns* but to a lesser extent.

Honestly my favorite was *An Abundance of Katherines* which, combined with my hatred of *The Fault in Our Stars* makes me a pariah in the John Green community. I thought AAoK had the most realistic and most well rounded side characters and none of the events of the story seemed particularly forced of hammed in (like Margo's exodus in *Paper Towns* or Alaska's breakdown and the last like, 30 pages of in *Looking for Alaska* or the entirety of *The Fault in Our Stars*.

On the other hand, John Green is still a hell of a lot better than the super vast majority of what falls under the 'young adult fiction' category, so I'm happy about that.

BanditMcDougal,funny,1388856129.0,"Best I can find is a [writing by Bob Jones](http://www.biblefood.com/7wrdsin.html) on the different Greek words we translate to ""sin"":

&gt;Contrary to many modern teachings, all sin is not the same in the New Testament. There are at least 7 different Greek words for sin, each one having a different shade of meaning. This subject is so large that we only have space, in one devotion, to introduce the Greek words for sin:

&gt;1. ""Hamartia"" = ""To miss the mark"", as in archery competition, and therefore fail to receive the prize, or blessing. This is the general Greek word for sin, and is used 221 times. ""Hamartia"" encompasses the other 6 words for specific sins, in the sense that in all types of sin, we are ""missing the mark"". Example: Heb. 12:1, KJV = ""the sin (hamartia) which doeth so easily beset us"". We are aiming at God's best, but miss it.

&gt;2. ""Hettema"" = ""Diminishing what should have been given full measure"". Example: 1 Cor. 6:7, KJV = ""there is a fault (hettema) among you"". We all need God's constant help on this one! Placing emphasis on the things that please God will bring God's wonderful blessings into our life.

&gt;3. ""Paraptoma"" = ""Falling when one should have stood"". This one is actually an unintentional slip. I guess you've experienced this, as I have, and we are surprised when we realize we've sinned. Example: Eph. 1:7, KJV = We have ""the forgiveness of sins (paraptoma), according to the riches of His grace"". Even our ""slip-ups"" are forgiven.

&gt;4. ""Agnoeema"" = ""Ignorance when one should have known"". Example: Heb. 9:7, KJV = ""the errors (agnoeema) of the people"". This passage speaks of how the Old Testament was a shadow of the New Testament. Ignorance is no excuse, that's why we stay in the Word!

&gt;5. ""Parakoe"" = ""To refuse to hear and heed God's word"". Example: 2 Cor. 10:6, KJV = ""disobedience"". In this passage, Paul urges us to hear God's Word and to bring every thought into captivity for Christ.

&gt;6. ""Parabasis"" = ""To intentionally cross a line"". Example: Heb. 2:2, KJV = ""every transgression (parabasis) &amp; disobedience (parakoe) received a just recompense of reward"". When God ""draws a line in the sand"", we can suffer great loss of rewards and blessings by intentionally ""stepping over"".

&gt;7. ""Anomia"" and ""Paranomia"" = ""Lawlessness, or willfully breaking God's written rules"". Example: Titus 2:14 KJV = Jesus gave himself for us in order to ""redeem us from all iniquity (anomia)"". God has ""rules"" to bless us, not to curse us. Someone said ""the Bible is the owner's manual for human beings"". Can you imagine trying to operate something as complicated as a human life without referring to the owner's manual? That would be just asking for frustration and failure!

&gt;The GOOD NEWS is that Jesus paid the price in full for ALL our sins! Isn't our Heavenly Father wonderful! He has given us an owner's manual; permanently forgiven us all 7 types of sins; He disciplines us to correct us when we commit the sins Jesus paid for on the Cross; He restores us to fellowship when we honestly confess our sins to Him; and, as we maintain fellowship with Him, He empowers us to live a life pleasing to Him!

&gt;God has provided everything we need to live a successful Christian life, and in Phil. 3:15 , He even promises to reveal to us the areas where we are falling short.

Maker her soup if she's sick or cook her a nice dinner or breakfast. Make love (of you've gotten to that stage) in intimate positions where you're face to face, that also conveys a strong emotional connection.

That is absolutely, positively not what they were arguing. The point is not that ""if a woman implies she doesn't want to be touched, that always means she doesn't want to be touched"" (even though that's pretty reasonable imo). The point is that you need to be *aware of context* and it's more respectful of other people to assume they don't want to be touched *until they indicate that they do*.

Also:

&gt; If a woman does have an incredibly easy way out of a situation, but does not use that incredibly easy way out of that situation, do you really believe that it's so unlikely that maybe, just maybe, she genuinely doesn't want to get out of that situation?

Yes, I and many others believe it's unlikely, because it is not ""incredibly easy"" to *come up with a lie* when you're already put on the spot. You are literally suggesting that women should be prepared to lie in order to navigate basic social situations.

arichi,investing,1388856419.0,"When you have multiple retirement accounts - as you do - I think it's a mistake to treat them as different investments.

You say your Roth is maxed at Vanguard.  Maxed for 2013?  2014?  Prior?  How much is in there?  

How much is in your 401(k), and how much do you anticipate adding in 2014 (guessing about $8400 from your description).

What is your desired asset allocation?

What fund choices are in your 401(k), what is their ticker symbols, and what is the expense ratio for each?  It probably _isn't_ just the full menu from American Funds that you listed."

Hajimotto,gaybros,1388856482.0,"Science cannot answer certain questions. Ask anyone that has actually studied science and they will say the same thing. Science is not the omnipotent answer to all questions. Some questions such as, what happened before the big bang or what happens to our conscious mind after we die, cannot be answered by science. This is not a bad thing, it just means that we cannot gather enough evidence to formulate scientific hypothesizes or theories. Even daily questions such as, what is the best possible existence or what is the point of life, cannot be answered by science because they are completely subjective. Science has always existed and for most, if not all, of homo sapiens existence some form of religion has two. They are not competing factors but rather methods of attempting to answer two different types of questions.  
  
The thing about morality is that it does not shape the big ideas like murder, we see those across most cultures. It shapes the titty-griddy ideas like respect for your elders and treating all with kindness. It is a method of learning the best possible way to live ones life that allows the most peaceful coexistence between people in a group. Very rarely do people of the same faith fundamentally disagree on a moral based issue. This is because religion has shaped their morality to be a common and shared one.  
  
Would it be fair for me to point to Hitler and Stalin and say because they existed every atheist is a genocidal maniac? Terrible things have happened during humanities existence and it is unfair to claim any single factor is what allowed these events to occur.  
  
Comfort is never false, especially when it is created via religious ideas. There are two types of pain, that which makes you stronger and that which cripples you. Truly soul crushing lose, such as of a lifetime spouse or child, is not the type pf pain that makes you stronger. Lessening that pain with religion is an appropriate way to live your life. It allows you to both accept that they are gone to this world and that it is okay to feel the pain that you do. "

thebumm,TrueFilm,1388856501.0,"It was uneven and heavy-handed in its approach, for certain. It made it hard to relate to for me as well. I've been poor all my life and have never done the stuff he has. I'm not saying I'm better than him by any stretch, far from it, but the attempts to make him look like a great guy were made obvious, rather than worked in. To me, some were over he top and unnecessary for this film because you don't really need him to be a great guy.

Whether he was in real life or not is not the issue, because ultimately this is a movie. I'm sure in real life he was great to some and awful to others, that's the nature of humans. But in the movie you don't need him to be portrayed as great but flawed, only good but flawed. Look at any movie and you'll see every protagonist has flaws, and I think in Fruitvale they were trying too hard to make up for any flaws shown, which came across heavy handed.


I enjoyed the film, I thought it was good+, but because of that I wouldn't say it was great. To me, just show that he was an average dude with good intentions, had a poor past he was trying to keep in the past, hung with a rough crowd. He made mistakes, sure, who doesn't though? The cop obviously made a huge one. In my mind the worst part was that they victimized OG so heavily it didn't show that the cop was a victim too. Just because OG died doesn't mean he's the only victim.

Also, the ""11 months served"" by the cop, was not including time served through the trial, which the judgement included (iirc). Which may still be too low, but that just shows the facts were shown in a biased manner. That whole situation was a clusterfuck, not going to weigh in on that. The movie could have done a better job at making the characters more real and less like the martyr it became. It was done for the audience it was catering to, so I can't fault it on that value, but for me it's too bad it didn't go for a more realistic/less contrived approach rather than a more propaganda (justified or not) vehicle."

wipeoutpop,toronto,1388856759.0,"As a few others have said, the key to increasing the number of people using active transportation (walking and cycling) in Toronto is to improve the experience of using these modes in the inner suburbs through changes to the infrastructure and zoning/planning/design requirements in these areas.

This is a tall order, but it can be done -- and a big part of the reason for this is that Toronto's suburbs have pockets of high population density (see Jamestown in North York and Dorset Park in Scarborough). These areas would benefit tremendously from walkability and active transportation initiatives, since many of their residents do not drive. One initiative that would make an immediate impact is the animation of green spaces that surround our suburban high-rises -- known in architectural circles as ""Towers in the Park"" -- through markets and other community gatherings (this is part of the Tower Renewal program that has taken a back burner since Miller left office). Another beneficial project, which has been recommended in walkability studies, would be to ""legitimize"" (in other words, pave, light, and maintain) the many [desire paths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) that already exist in these areas; these routes often connect towers to relatively nearby shops and services.

Small, simple initiatives like these can lay the groundwork for larger projects and zoning changes that will make active transportation a more attractive option on major arterials and smaller streets alike. But one thing's for sure: we can't force it like New York did; instead, our city needs to be gradually rebuilt, from the outside in, to address the fundamental reality that a car-centric city cannot be sustained.

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1388856794.0,"&gt; That is a horrible, kafka-esque proposition. 

No, trapping someone in supporting a child he never wanted because there's no administrative option to decline, *that* is kafkaesque.

&gt;You can't force someone to weigh their potential love for an unborn child against the financial burden of raising them alone.

Of course you can. People can and do take their financial means into account when deciding whether they want (more) children or not. Not doing so would be irresponsible.

&gt;They can face that decision themselves, but nobody has any right to make it so much worse for them.

But they do have the right to make it worse for the man involved, even if he has no say in the matter and wants out of it?

&gt;Effectively, this would give men the right to say, ""You have to deal with the consequences of having had sex 

They both consented.

&gt;and bear the difficulties of birth vs. abortion

How would forcing him into fatherhood make that any different?

&gt;, but I don't have to deal with any consequences"".

Neither does the woman have to deal with the consequences of parenthood: she can choose to opt out by means of abortion, a decision the male has no right to weigh in on.

The woman is put in a ""abortion or pregnancy"" situation that has no easy option, but that is adequately balanced with the fact that she can decide unilaterally in the matter.

&gt;If it's voluntary, it's voluntary and then yeah, it's a solution. But in the case when it's not voluntary for one party, neither the father nor mother should have the right to up and walk off on the other two.

So are you saying that abortion should not be possible if the man wants to raise the child? I don't think that's acceptable.

&gt;If it could be proven that the current system generates more problems

As usual in social sciences, hard proof is practically impossible because it's not permissible to experiment with humans in a laboratory..

&gt;I don't see how there is anything like a dominant false impression out there that single motherhood is all well and good because someone else will pay for it.

If the payment wasn't so important, why would people argue so hard to retain it? If it isn't important, why not let people opt out of it and see what happens?

&gt;I don't see how giving parents an emergency exit from the responsibilities of parenthood would reduce single parenthood- quite the opposite.

Naturally, it would have to happen within the time frame where an abortion is possible, since it's intended to mirror the woman's right. I'd say minus one week (with a minimum decision period of three days), since it's the woman who has to perform the abortion. We can't let the term in which abortion is possible expire because someone was late with their decision.

&gt;If you knew you didn't have to deal with the consequences, then you would take less responsibility.

You're assuming that most men will voluntarily destroy their relationships for such reasons. Even if that's true, wouldn't the world be better off if those that do didn't have offspring?"

Rolten,truegaming,1388856856.0,"&gt; But, if you want the latest games, or you want high settings, or you need to get a PC to game on then it is way more expensive.

This is simply not true. Subreddits like /r/buildapc have more than enough examples of $500 PC's that produce graphics that are amazing compared to the newest console gen. If I'm not mistaken, that's the same price you will pay for a Xbox one. 

Take into account the fact that the PC has:

* No yearly costs for online use (like Xbox live. Which amounts to a whopping 200 dollars after 4 years)

* Much cheaper games. New games cost 10 dollars less (normally 60 for consoles, 50 for PC). Steam sales make games practically free.

* Free games. Some of the most popular games at the moment are Dota and LoL, both free. 

* Pirating. Although I myself don't like to do it, I use it to test games. Crusader Kings 2 was a type of game I never played. Pirated it, spent a few hours on it, then bought it. Not possible on consoles (unless you want to risk getting banned).

* Mods. Can make a game much more fun and much more interesting. Greatly increased the time I spent on games like Medieval II Total War and Mount and Blade: Warband. More bang for your buck per game since you play them more.

* Exclusives. Consoles have some great exclusives (The Last of Us (PS3) for example, or Red Dead Redemption). This does not even compare to PC exclusives though. DayZ, Crusader Kings II, Chivalry, Red Orchestra, League of Legends, Guild Wars 2, etc, etc. 

* Other functions. Taxes, music library, school work, etc. You might already have a laptop or PC for this, though. 

* Emulators. Play all kinds of old games from the comfort of your current system!

* Completely supports Xbox 360 controllers! Profit from the best of both worlds: controllers for fighters, racers, and sports games, and mouse and keyboard for everything else. 


I'm pretty sure that a PC has more bang for your buck. "

He didn't get injured, but noone in that line was able to shoot accurate for that round or the next because of concentration loss.

kratistos,AskHistorians,1388856902.0,"When the Jews were forced to take German surnames, many chose to carry their Jewish history with them in the form of cryptic alludes to the Jewish culture/religion. There are many examples with many names. Some took names that sounded similar to Jewish names and tribes.

* Meier/Meyer (""dairy farmer""): One of the most common German names also became a common Jewish name because of it's closeness to *Meir*. An illustration is Golda Meir who was Golda Meyerson before she ""re-hebrewed"" her name.

* Rubin (""ruby""): Similar to Ruben.
* Selig/Seligmann (""blessed"") for *baruch*
* Zucker (""sugar"") for Zacharias

Others alluded to fruits of the holy land or biblical figures

* Baum (""tree"") for Abraham, the founder of the Jewish family tree.

* Teitelmann (""Figman"")

* Stammler (""stutterer"") for Moses 

Colors and animals were used in names according to their symbolization of Jewish tribes

* Roth (""red"") for Ruben
* Löwe/Löw/Loeb (""lion"") for Juda
* Grün (""green"") for Simeon

And some were downright obscure, like

* Maus (""Mouse"") for Moses
* Apfel/Epi (""Apple"") for Ephraim
* Oppermann/Opfermann (""Sacrifice man"") for Cohen
* -burg or -berg for *baruch*
 
The tl;dr is really: The distinct sound of German-Jewish surnames exists because many Jews tried to bring a little piece of their own culture and religion into those new, forced names.

As for your question, it's a quirk of multi-body orbital dynamics. In systems where there are multiple masses orbiting a single point, one must not only account for the effect of gravity between the central mass and the satellites but between the satellites themselves. With sufficient mass or proximity, the satellites can accelerate towards one another and the change in velocity will affect the overall orbit.

You can even see, by the time of the second orbit, that S-IVB's orbit is being radically changed by the influence of the moon. The second orbit is much less eccentric, since S-IVB was decelerated by the moon's gravity during periapsis, but then later orbits had the opposite effect occur.

After the sixth orbit, the timing of S-IVB's orbit was such that it intersected with the moon at a time when the moon's acceleration was parallel to S-IVB's velocity, which essentially gave S-IVB a massive gravity slingshot that accelerated it out of lunar orbit and onto a terrestrial escape vector."

Meanwhile, at my company's cafeteria (I currently live in France, which is one of the most god-awful places ever to be a vegetarian in), I once ordered a veggie noodle stirfry, only to find out the cook had spontaneously decided to add some ham to it. When I was like, *sigh*, he said, but it's got soy sauce in it, which also contains fish!

And yeah, there was a significant Jewish minority in the school I went to from Kindergarten to second grade so there was Hanukkah, and some people celebrated that instead of Christmas, and as I got older and exposed to other cultures/religions I learned there was a greater variety of holidays than I had known about as a child and some people didn't celebrate any, but there was still New Year's for us all (in this country - I realize there are other calendars that don't correspond with January 1).

The only real exceptions are: 1)sniping to defend your teammates right before they get killed, 2) sniping people who are capturing your taken objectives, or 3) counter-sniping those that are doing 1 or 2 effectively. 

Compare that to the value you can bring to your team by playing the objectives aggressively and it's easy to see why snipers are not appreciated as teammates.

I like Pizza Express for that - their menu specifically points out that grana padano is not vegetarian, so the ""Aubergine parmigiana"" is vegetarian only if specifically ordered that way so they can omit the grana padano. At Carluccio's, I asked if a risotto was vegetarian specifically for this reason (it had no meat ingredients listed but I wanted to make sure because of the chicken stock issue), and was told yes, and that their grated parmesan (which I normally just turn down without bothering to ask) was actually vegetarian hard cheese, too.

Can you talk to all her doctors and let her know what is going on? They might start actually talking to each other if they know she is killing herself with their prescriptions.

If she isn't taking care of the dog, then reporting it to a service animal authority or ASPCA might at least take the dog out of that horrible situation. 

You can also look into the requirements (and consequences of) declaring someone a danger to themselves where she lives, and think about that. It could actually put her in a worse situation, though. State-funded facilities aren't always the best.

The common wisdom is that an alcoholic/addict isn't going to change until they want to. However, I do think that calling someone on their addictions is helpful. The person sure as fuck won't like it, not one bit. But a functioning addict often maintains the idea that they are pulling it off, that no one knows, that they can handle it. Being told ""please don't call me when you're drunk/high"" collapses that bubble really quickly. 

Lastly, your wife should be aware that a tendency towards alcoholism and addiction runs in families. She should be very careful with alcohol and other drugs.

suriname0,socialjustice101,1388857659.0,"So, I'm a computer science student, and I could talk about the sexism I've seen at play within an academic CS environment and how I've seen women be pushed away from this major, but I'm more interested in your last paragraph.

&gt;It's probably just a cultural thing. Women aren't inherently less capable of being developers, they just generally aren't interested in such programs. I can see how maybe they'd be turned off by the lack of other women in those programs (not saying that's a valid excuse; the lack of black people in the tech industry doesn't turn me off from it) but that ideology just creates a cycle which results in a gap that'll never be filled.

I think there are a few major assumptions at play here, and the biggest in my mind is that it doesn't matter why me make the choices we make.  You posit that women ""just generally aren't interested"", and argue one possible reason (""the lack of other women in these programs"") that women may not be interested.  On the one hand, you're right to call this ""just a cultural thing""; an individual woman might not be interested in a CS program, and one reason (of many) may be the lack of other women in the program.  But with ""cultural thing""s, a feminist curiosity asks us to think about trends and results.  Is it *actually* the case that women (insofar as they can be broadly grouped together) are less interested in CS programs than men?  If so, what are some of the biggest reasons women appear to be uninterested?   Feminists know that individual preferences don't occur in a cultural vacuum, they occur in a system that confers 'benefits' to some groups at the expense of others.  In that context, it's relevant to investigate the reasons women are disinterested in the context of CS being a high-paying field.  If I'm not being clear here, feminists think that wage inequality is not accidental; it is the result of a series of controls to keep women out of high-paying jobs.  And a part of those controls is simply ""interest"".  If women are kept out of CS by the fostering of women's cultural disinterest in CS, then that is *systemic* discrimination in play.

Also, this

&gt;but that ideology just creates a cycle which results in a gap that'll never be filled.

seems to miss the point pretty hard.  The 'ideology' is just a theory about what might be a reason a group of people seem to be making or not making a particular choice.  If it *is* the case that many women are uninterested in CS programs because of the lack of women in CS, then that does create a vicious cycle!  But as you observe with internships and scholarships and the like, people are working to break that cycle of disinterest and lack of representation.  Even on an individual level, women that are going into CS are breaking this cycle (if it exists).

PS. Quick final comment, this:

&gt;every time a girl has a problem during our lab every guy around her jumps to her rescue.

In order of importance:

Two things I think are super important, pacing and aerobic threshold monitoring, both are covered in the FAQ. These are the foundation of coping.

Getting adequate sleep is very important. If you're not sleeping get that fixed. Sleep hygiene, drugs, supplements, whatever. You need to sleep to recharge your energy.

After that is eating properly. I don't think there is any magic diet, just get enough protein, carbs and fat. Look for simple to prepare food. Eat smaller meals since eating and digesting are so energy consuming. Eating needs to be part of your pacing plan. If you are concerned about nutrition MyFitnessPal can help you track your macros and common nutrients.

I would also suggest cognitive behavior therapy to deal with the stress of it all. Plenty of self help books on this topic out there, they may not necessarily deal with CFS but you can learn the basic skills.

Exercise can help, but you must get pacing and aerobic threshold skills in place before you do that. Graded exercise does not work for some people, in my case it actually made things worse. Aerobic exercise is not good. Slow walking good, fast walking and getting your heart rate and breathing rate up, bad. Find something easy to do. 

Meditation and guided relaxation can help you get the rest you need in addition to sleep.

Supplements and drugs are a mixed bag. They can help a tiny bit, but that's about it, except in cases of frank deficiencies (example: vitamin D). Your biggest gains are going to be in lifestyle changes."

arichi,Patriots,1388857829.0,"Start small.  You're in the D.C. area?  Maybe follow the Redskins also.  They used to be a Boston team (played in Fenway for a bit, even), are local to you, hate the Giants, and only play the Patriots once every four years (unless we both make it to the Super Bowl in the same year, which has yet to happen).  They might even become your NFC team due to minimal conflicts of interest.  
(my favorite NFC team, rather than being where I live currently, is based in the city I intend to move to at some point in the future.)

And they've got some cool players, too.  Look up Alfred Morris.  When was he drafted?  What kind of car does he drive (in his particular case, this is a cool factoid;  don't bother memorizing the cars for every player in the league).

It's also natural to start to know your division rivals:  start with the QBs, star receivers/backs, and a star defense player or two.  For example, it'd be nice to know who Stevie Johnson, Robert Woods, Ryan Tannehill, and Mark Sanchez are.  You probably recognize some of those names already.

Did you go to university?  If so, does your school have a football team?  Do they have alumni in the NFL?  If so, who?  Those might be a good starting point, too, for other players to care about.  Alternately, if you don't like your alma mater, consider rooting for alumni from the rival school (that's what I do for CFB things).


Next season, in FFB, don't let your boyfriend (or anyone else) manage your team.  Auto-draft if you have to, but make your focus of the season on trying to follow the guys you end up with on your fantasy team;  if they get injured, check out waiver wire, look at, say, the top 3-5 suggested players to fill the spot, and read up on them - even if it's just their team website bio or something.  Maybe you do well in fantasy, maybe you don't, but you'll learn more of the league this way.

Lastly, try to set a watching goal for next season.  In 2011, for the first time, I watched at least one game for every team in the league, and have done that in 2012 and 2013, too.   Watching all the Patriots regular season games covers 14 (13 opponents + Patriots).  Alternately, if you don't want to bother with all 32, maybe set a goal of watching at least 16 distinct teams.  Patriots games will cover most of these, and there are enough good *NF matchups that can pick up the rest.

Heck, if you want to get obsessive over it, keep a small notebook with thoughts after each game - just a jot of a player or two who stood out in some way (whether performance, a particular play, neat thing on the sideline, etc).

I hope this helps!"

BroseidonSirF,highseddit,1388857977.0,"&gt; I don't want to leave them because I really do enjoy there time and everything, but do you guys have any tips for branching out to other social circles??

Try joining a new sports teams. Have any kids that you've talked to, are friendly with, but aren't exactly friends? Ask them to hang out, invite them to see a sports game or something. INvite them over. Slowly you'll meet their friends and their friends friends, etc.

Invite more people to sit by you at lunch. 


&gt;My second question is this. One of my friends in this social circle has been the alpha for a few years. He's gotten the girls, respected, could push us around a little. In the past year or so I've become more ""alpha"" (I'm not a fan of the term) and it's started to build some tension. I feel like we always go for the same girls (because they're high value) and can get irritated with each other, but I feel as though I am at a disadvantage because he is already the established ""leader"" so to speak. I don't want to surpass him and make him be really beta but I want to find a way to coexist with him in the social group, get the same level of respect and control and not step on each other's toes. Any tips for how to accomplish this???


Stop taking any shit he throws at you, and start going after other girls he doesn't want in the meanwhile. Go out and cold approach because he can't meet the girls only YOU cold approach. 

There was a kid when we were in middle school who was a coexisting alpha with me, but I surpassed him upon discovering highseddit mid 2012. 

It's alright if you surpass him. You might even have to play a little dirty if you're really wanting to do so. 



Now if you wanna coexist, you gotta talk to him and make a systme so you don't go after the same girls. Make a deal with him that the guy who the girl likes gets the girl, no dibs rules or anything like that. "

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1388858001.0,"Well, my own plans involve taxing corporations, income, and capital gains at around 32-40%, depending how much basic income we're gonna give (32% for $10k, 40% for 15k). So it works into the income tax structure. People at the bottom actually pay in effect negative taxes, since the taxes they would give on their meager salaries would be more than offset by UBI. For middle class folks, I'd expect their effective taxes to go down slightly or stay the same. The rich would see a much higher burden though (although not above the nominal rate).

Think of it this way. SOmeone makes $30k a year. If they're taxed at 40%, that means $12k. But then they recieve a UBI of $15k, making their effective income $33k. Someone making $15k a year would only pay $6k, but would get $15k, so they would end up with $24k a year. Someone making $50k would pay in $20k, get $15k back, so would only end up paying 10%, and going home with $45k. Someone making $100,000 would pay $40,000, and would ultimately pay 25%.

So it definitely scales up as you make more money, but unlike our current system where people on welfare lose their benefits when they find a job, what you ultimately get is:

Basic income + wages - taxes. The flat tax of 40% is high, but it's main goal is to claw back the benefits a bit as you work and earn more, but in a fair way that doesn't punish people for working. 

We could try 32% for $10k (this is total federal taxation btw, total reform of tax system and social safety net). Someone making $15k would lose $4800 due to taxation, but would earn $10k, so they would ultimately make a little over $20k. The $30k guy loses $9600, but gets $10k, so he just about evens out. The $50k guy would lose $16k, but would ultimately only lose $6k with UBI (12% tax). The $100k guy would end up paying 22% in practice.

Basically, a higher amount + a higher tax is more progressive than a lower amount + lower tax. The higher tax + higher benefit actually means most low and middle income people pay less, but the rich pay more. Lower amount and lower tax makes it less progressive, but makes the top tax rate lower. This is because non UBI expenses are included. Either or, what you get is generally a system where the rich pay more and the middle and lower incomes pay less though. 

Keep in mind thats how it affects single incomes as well. Household incomes, ie, married couples and stuff, will get twice the UBI money because they're two people. In my plan, kids don't get it, but this is because I think giving UBI to kids can create problems with exploiting the system and would either drive up costs or lower benefits for others overall. But as far as couples go, imagine you're making $50k as a couple. With the $15k plan, they'd pay in $20k, but get $30k back between the two of them, giving them a total of $60k. With the $10k plan, they'd pay $16,000, but get $20,000 back, so they'd get a total of $54k.

And obviously if no one works, you just get the UBI money and nothing else."

You'd then have to decide whether or not they were lying, so as not to hurt your feelings. This is the only way you can know.

Secondly and more importantly, understand **your feelings are not you.** Have you ever woken up feeling like the biggest piece of shit on earth, then maybe gone out, passed a few hours, and not felt so bad? Maybe not brilliant, but certainly not the worst person since Jeffrey Dahmer. Does this mean you've fundamentally changed as a person in the short space of an afternoon without really trying? Or are there other factors affecting [those random thoughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusive_thoughts) constantly revolving around our ape brains all the time? 

The biggest help to me in the last few years has been understanding that just because I feel, for example, tired and bloated from a crappy diet, or lazy and uncreative, that I'm now a useless and hateful individual as a result. I might *feel* that way, but is that the case?

There are so many factors involved in our feelings: diet, weather, productivity, comments from other people, nothing on TV, all number of things, and there are just as many factors that can change how we feel: Going on a diet, exercising, calling a friend, going for a walk, watching a good movie.

Seen the 'bald badass' trope(eg. Walter White)? People who get into fights regularly would find having grabbable hair to be a disadvantage, which may be a reason behind the association.

A reason that women at high posts have short hair could simply be that hair takes maintenance, and proportionately with length. Women with busy lives would like to optimise by reducing time spent on hair maintenance.

Equally busy housewives may keep their long hair out of conformity with tradition. While more 'progressive'(technically any woman at a high post is breaking traditional gender norms) women may choose to cut hair not out of explicit anticonformity, but just practicality."

seanomenon,alcoholism,1388858142.0,"It is a really good idea to see a doctor and be honest about everything. Alcohol detox is dangerous and can even be deadly without medical supervision. They can help him go through it safely and more comfortably. 

I also highly recommend some support. Getting sober is only a small part of dealing with alcoholism. One needs to learn to live sober. I found the support and resources to do that at AA meetings. [This link lists AA meetings near you.](http://www.aa.org/lang/en/subpage.cfm?page=28) I recommend that he try a few different ones, they can be very different.

There are also other options, there are alcohol/addiction counselors, outpatient rehab programs, and other support groups. AA is what helped me, and they have free meetings almost everywhere, so its what I recommend.

Having the support of a spouse can be invaluable in living sober. He is lucky to have you on board. Anything you can do to make your home sober and comfortable for him will help. Getting rid of alcohol in the home is a great first step. Being understanding if he doesn't enjoy parties or other drinking occasions also helps a lot. Just putting up with him for the first few months will be helpful too. A lot of newly sober folks go through some fairly manic/depressive cycles in the first couple months. It's a huge change.

Good luck to you both."

Thom0,magicTCG,1388858239.0,"Hardly, 40k is a hobby game and the main appeal is painting and collecting. The thing with painting and collecting is you always want to paint more and you always want to collect more. 

Sure you can just play the game but that's hardly the main aspect of 40k/WH/LOTR/any of the other niche tabletop games they run.

I know guys who pretty much pay the bills, set money aside for 2 pints on the weekend and then spend the rest on models and they have been doing this for the past decade. 


The amount of money that goes into GW is insane.

In Magic you can sell of decks or cards once you're done and then pay for the next set with the profits, you also have a collectors element to Magic but since the game is so competitive its mostly a minority. You cant re-sell models, the value is gone once you open the box.


Smart guys charge other guys to paint there armies for them, then those smart guys use that money to fund there own armies. That's what I did, I was good at painting and my nan was handy with a paintbrush as well so I use to get her to do some.



After all is done, after you stop playing you can sell of those old cards. I've got boxes full of models that I cant do anything with other then throw in the bin. Some of the collections I've seen run well into the five figure range.

EDIT: Fuck me, I forgot the fucking paint's and glue prices. Holy shit that stuff will break the bank.

MrDubious,Entrepreneur,1388858278.0,"I don't advertise on Facebook, but I know a ton of folks who do, both in paid ads, and in Facebook pages. Across the board, they've seen a 40-50% drop in organic interaction. I've read through your original posts and the original articles, and I think you are indeed a marketing genius...you've marketed yourself through all of this, and gotten a lot bigger exposure than you normally would have through the combination of some reasonable success combined with astute timing and some aggressive opportunism. 

Good for you! That does indeed prove you're good at marketing. However, you've put out a bunch of different posts now regarding your Facebook marketing, and they've had some mixed information and some contradictions. For instance, in the first BI article, you were quoted as saying you'd never paid to boost a post. Additionally, the 120K valuation noted in your second BI article doesn't seem to align with the revenue you said you were bringing in on the first post. Are you short selling, running a really tight margin, or are these partners bringing more to the table than just money?

(*Edit: I just rechecked your original revenue numbers, and they were lower than I thought I remembered. I'm thinking the first BI article upped my perception of what your revenue numbers were*)

Additionally, some of the successes of your techniques are very specific to the product niche you're in; low to mid priced counterculture retail products are a little easier to sell online than most other niches for several reasons, and there's some potential correlation/causation fallacies occurring here that might have other small business owners going broke attempting to replicate your success. I sincerely doubt it's widely duplicatable across industry verticals, and I've NEVER seen anything from local retail to national industry campaigns that showed the sort of ""Paid Like to Sale"" ratios you're describing. Sorry to live up to my username, but I'm exceedingly dubious that you're the only guy in ten thousand paid marketing professionals who knows how to use Facebook right, know what I mean?

That being said, I don't know if the kinks I'm seeing along the way are just unclear explanations due to your inexperience, misquotes by the BI writers, or intentional misrepresentation, but your aggressive self marketing is what I tip my hat too. You've done an extraordinary job blowing up your personal brand, and there was nothing passive in how you created this media opportunity, and then rode it aggressively. That, more than any of your Facebook marketing techniques, is what really impressed me.

MotivationToControl,changemyview,1388858476.0,"In the fall of 2012, the depression and anxiety I have suffered with on and off all my adult life took a turn for the worse. I felt suicidal. The feelings and thoughts you describe in the OP are pretty much boilerplate. I felt hopelessly abandoned. Nothing in my life was going the way I planned. The news was filled with stories of mass shootings, hurricanes, etc. The world was death and suffering, nothing more.

I felt suicidal, but I didn't want to kill myself. I think that's a normal feeling. I wasn't running towards death as much as I was running away from life. I decided to really think about my choice. So I went to the bookstore.

I ended up with a copy of *The Myth of Sisyphus* by Albert Camus, an essay about philosophy and suicide. Long story short, it saved me by explaining in cold reasoning why suicide is a fool's errand and how you can find a reason to live even in a hopeless existence that's devoid of meaning and bound to end. I suggest you read the book.

It's been over a year since I reached my lowest point, and I can say with certainty that my suicidal thoughts were misplaced. I was focusing so much of my energy on how horrible this and that are, so much energy on how I could have done things differently, that I failed to realize that _I was fucking **alive**_. Sure, being alive sucks a lot of times. It's hard, and it never gets easier. But, it'd just be a shame to waste myself. Good things take effort. It takes a lot of courage to be happy. I have realized that I am a lot stronger than I led myself to believe in the fall of 2012. 

Don't let yourself buy into the garbage you're own mind tries to sell you. You've lost you're high school friends? Look at your parents... chances are they aren't close to their high school friends either. That's what happens when you get older. You'll find other friends. 

You're family isn't so much of a support group? Well find a group of people you can depend upon, and make sure they can depend upon you (it's a two way street). Put in the effort and you'll find your niche. You'll find a home. In the meantime, you have yourself. Use this time to make some improvements. You have the chance to rebuild yourself, start over. You're failing to see it as an opportunity.

Please, for your future-self's sake, don't kill yourself. I know you're in despair and you're afraid, but we all have immense reserves of courage. Tap into them and have the courage to live, instead of taking the easy way out. It'll be worth it."

[This was the best Calvary Chapel](http://www.ccleatherhead.com/teaching.asp) I ever attended, the pastor there is amazing, very knowledgeable and engaging, was the only church where I ever took notes during service because there was so much interesting historical and theological information.

Our mating has increased success - our children live longer, and medical interventions create children out of petri dishes. We repress our instincts all the time for positive benefits with no ill effect - extreme emotions such as anger are normal, but there are healthy and unhealthy ways of dealing with it. We hold our bowels closed until the appropriate place and time. We donate to strangers. We rush into burning buildings to save random animals. We keep pets.

We go insane and shoot up schools.  We have nervous breakdowns and neurosis.  We imprison millions.  We're destroying our environment and slowly reducing the planet's capacity to support us.  We slaughter each other in wars. We enslave each other.

silverionmox,TrueAskReddit,1388859058.0,"&gt; Do you think we're able to avoid accidents related to any type of power plants? Nuclear is a LOT safer than people give it credit for.

But no other energy source has a combination of being able to cause a single disaster *and* lingering waste for such a long time, which will remain even if we switch over to another source in the future. I'd rather preserve our fissiles for use in space for that reason.

&gt;Saying that Gen IV reactors are science fiction is a shitty argument, and you know it. 16 years is not long. It's well within the timeframe where the world will realistically still be relying on fossil fuels.

They also said that fusion reactors would be ready by the year 2000. They're not. Nuclear plants almost always come in over time and over budget. They said Fukushima was entirely safe, it wasn't. I'm tired of half-true promises, and we need to do something now instead of gambling everything on the promise of a new technology that may never materialize. If it's to fantastic, we'll switch over as soon as it's ready. Until then, I'm going to do what I can with what we have.

&gt;Wind power will certainly be able to cover a share of world consumption, but not all of it.

Nor will nuclear.

&gt;First, the power that can be generated varies over time

A sufficiently large number of stochastic sources still provide a baseline production. Most energy use coincides with the production peak of solar panels, anyway. Nuclear needs to rely on gas plants too to fill peak demand.

&gt;and secondly the windmills need to be spread out across a large geographic area, making it unsuitable for densely populated areas

Densely populated areas have opportunities to leverage energy efficiency.

&gt;Until we find a viable method of large-scale power storage, we'll need a method of power generation where the output isn't dependant on environmental factors, and for my money nuclear seems like the best of the available options.

I'm not going to exclude nuclear from being thrown in the mix, but it certainly won't provide the bulk of power in this century.

I don't see an exact equivalent for me, a straight guy, but I know I gotta get hard and in there when I'm getting down with my wife, and more so when we try to get pregnant. I also know it's tough - or can be - to get pregnant and seeing as this dude has like 3 or 4 kids, he'd have to get it on several times with a woman. He loves her dearly, they are in love, but he equates it to bestest friends/soulmates without sexual attraction and I can't think of any dude I'd ever be able to get it up for enough to get him the equivalent of pregnant."

Slukaj,electronics,1388859338.0,"&gt; First off you got the aging wrong last time it's 9 to 16 where I'm from might be different in the US.

No, I got the US aging about right. FLL is elementary through middle school. High school is 100% FTC and FRC. I can't speak for where you're from.

&gt; Secondly I should add that I participate in FLL not through school but through a club for people especially interested and such probably slightly more skilled than the average class, and so my view on it may be biased.

Very much so.

&gt; And yes I am a ""student"" and our leaders are really good, they don't interfere and let's us have our own meetings and ways of doing things. They are pretty much only there for supervision and teaching us some things.

If that's the case then that's excellent, but the experience I've had looking at other teams is that you usually get 10 teams with heavy mentor support for every team with a genuinely talented student body. The best teams in FRC/FTC/FLL tend to be the ones who A) have lots of money and B) have engineering mentors rather than volunteer parents. The usual is that the mentors get a lot of say in how a problem is solved (and if your mentors offer ANY solution, then they're swaying your ability to learn).

&gt; We have small competitions and they push for us to find loopholes, which we've gotten really good at, to the point where they have to use 15 minutes to explain the rules...

Which completely shoots the objective of FIRST programs in the foot. The objective is to apply your critical thinking skills to the design and construction of a robot, not to find loopholes in the rule. FIRST is designed to teach you how to think; how many corporations do you think get second contracts if they solely exploit loopholes.

Teams that stick with the spirit of the program tend to hate teams that look for loopholes. 

&gt; Once we got the task of building a segway, they said the two wheels were the only things that could touch the ground. So we flipped them, and balanced the bot on that, the leaders were not very amused, well some of them was. And it's since been told as legend.

God, as an ex-FRC competitor, this just makes me cringe. Rather than actually solving a problem, you exploit a loophole. Yeah, it's clever, but it 100% shoots the objective of FIRST in the foot by avoiding doing what is *difficult*. 

&gt; The point is that while the nxt software makes do, it's nothing to be proud of 

I'll tell you right now that you will never be proud of software you like if you base it solely on the language.

The rest are just randomly spread everywhere for NO REASON at all. I just don't understand. Also i get that there is lag but when i spray at someone running at me and they don't die.. that annoys me.

The only thing i can think is we're dealing with more lag and more desync than we realise, that the shots miss because they the scope sway isn't where we think it is, and the spray-n-pray doesn't work because PEOPLE aren't were we think they are. But even when i have a dead-steady beed on a zombie, like DEAD between my crosshairs.. I just miss completely, over his shoulder, falling short to the left.. I don't get it.

I would understand if it was a straight drop (or raise) over and still in line with my crosshairs, because the acog lets you zero your rifle up and down (which i'm hoping actually does something) but its not just a consistent drop to shoot or too far, its just all over the shop left and right, which i can't stop with the zeroing and i can't compensate for because my crosshairs are dead-still.

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1388859600.0,"&gt; I was asked about whether I support abortion so I answered.

And you agree that it is permissible for people to get out of parenthood in some circumstances, for example abortion. So why not for men?

&gt;it's not a comparable thing, because an abortion aborts for both parents and a spouse opting out leaves 2 people, the mother and child, in a seriously bad situation.

That makes the *abortion* less fair. The man just decides about his own future, leaving all options open for the woman. If a woman aborts, she also decides that that man is not going to become a father.

&gt;The physical reality of pregnancy and reproduction isn't fair whatsoever, and you can't really create a legal framework that gets around that.

I still allow the woman the complete control over her own destiny and the pregnancy. She still can decide what she wants, and whether the child lives or not. We can't give the man that right to infringe on her right of control of her body, but we can give him the right to get out of parenthood, just like she has.

&gt;The only way to do so would be to allow the wife the opt-out option as well, in which the child is born but she chooses no financial responsibility but still leaves the husband with all the financial burden.

I have no problem with that.

&gt;But that of course completely ignores the child, who is the one the parents are obligated to (they are not obligated financially to each other- just to the child).

It's the choice of the parent who wants to keep the child.

&gt;The result would be the same- a lot more struggling single parents and more kids in orphanages. Not really a fair trade-off.

IMO it would make people more aware of the consequences of their choices, with less ability to make other people pay for those. There would be more abortions, but less single parents. And single parenthood is a subpar situation for the child, with or without child support."

BroseidonSirF,highseddit,1388859854.0,"Ok I went to hardwell last saturday. It was one giant dancefloor with intensity varying from close to the Dj booth outwards. 5 sets resulted in kissing and by far the off the dancefloor approach was the best. 

Mini FR here 

1. She wanted to pass so i said ""WHERE DO YOU THINK YOURE GOING"" we pushed and shoved playfully. 

2. I literally said hi, we chatted and I just took her hand and we danced. 

3. They were taking selfies so I jumped in. Re met up with the girls later and closed. 

4. She was with her friend off to the side so i went up and said ""you guys didn't buy a ticket to sit and text!"" The tall one said ""lets dance then!""

5. Made eye contact and whispered in her ear ""they're pushing more than my rugby matches here. "" (meant to say foootball...) found her on the dancefloor and went for it. 


My dancefloor attempts were not effective. It often ended with awkwardly dancing behind them and getting rejected for the kiss. I found that it's better to approach off to the side and build some attraction because if you go in on the dancefloor you might as well try to kiss strangers without talking to them.

The idea is when productivity increases, since tax rates remain the same, UBI will automatically increase, this is meant to keep UBI up with inflation and the like. If it decreases, that's tougher to figure out. Either it would shrink uBI, or it would freeze it and then we'd have a budget deficit until productivity picks up again. Someone else on this subreddit brought up the idea of locking it in to, say 25% of the 40% tax rate (since the other 15% is to pay for other government expenses). 

Also, keep in mind my numbers are rough. I basically drew them from this calculator: http://jsfiddle.net/3bYTJ/11/ , and kind of assume perfect conditions. A real implemented UBI may need to either be lower or the taxes higher due to inefficiencies and the like."

The switch cover has a strong spring, so when it flips down it ensures the switch is flipped to the down position as well.  (down is on low, center is off, and up is on high).  I ran those wires to a couple relays under the hood, and relays to the fan.  

My relays are 40A and 70A, way overkill for the ~17A and ~33A draw I measured from the fan, but I heard of people popping 50A relays on high from the current spike to get the fan moving, and 40A was the smallest I could find at an auto parts store.

Clear your cache every once and a while. Defragment your disks so that they clear up space and will run well for longer. Keep an eye on your temperatures, make sure your CPU isn't hitting extremely high temperatures so that it sustains over time.

I had the idea that, as soon as I hit level 2, I walked down past the river brush and lined up my Q to perfectly hit the boss wraith and Vi. I let it loose right when it had another hit left and it gave me the 30/50 whatever it was gold, and snared Vi. I walked up a bit more, tossed my E and popped it on her.

She had like 1/4th hp and had to return to base.

Now I know what I'll be doing every single game to fuck up the jungler.

constituent,AskReddit,1388860527.0,"**Please note, this isn't an attack on you, but the dissonance that always arises in my brain when I hear about ""gay bars = gay spaces"".**

I live in Chicago and we have an entire gay neighborhood nicknamed ""Boystown"" in the Lakeview area.  However, not all gay bars are located in the gay neighborhood.  These establishments don't open as ""gay"".  The crowds in some locations end up defining the identity of the venue.  I've seen some bars or clubs that have gone through several transformations, none explicitly by the management/owner.  Some of these changes can transpire rapidly or gradually over a period of years.  

Likewise, not every gay person is into the gay scene.  When I walk into any bar, I'm not going there with my sexuality plastered on my sleeve.  I'm there because I like the venue, like the music, appreciate the staff, am out with friends, or it was close by.  If I happen to be at a gay bar, it's because I wanted to be there and not because I *have* to.

With the logic of gay bars being gay spaces, does that also mean that gay neighborhoods are gay spaces?  No straight people allowed because it's not tailored to straight people?  If that's the case, I don't like where any of this is going.  I choose my neighborhoods based on (a.) personal safety, (b.) appearance, (c.) location, (d.) access to transportation, (e.) green spaces, and other factors.  Since I'm gay, does that mean I shouldn't be in a 'straight' neighborhood, pack my bags, and move into the gay ghetto?

Some of my gay friends subscribe to the '*gay bar = gay spaces*' mentality and it always leaves me shaking my head."

Flightless_Kiwi,AskReddit,1388860537.0,"For me, there are a lot of little things, maybe call them ""triggers"" that make me attracted to a person. Of the ones that have to do with their body, pretty much every one is more prominent in men than women, or only present in men. For example, I like a little bit of visible muscle definition, a moderately to pretty hairy body, I like vascularity in the hands and forearms, I like the slightly musky smell that guys have, etc. And just flat out, boobs are a turn off and a guys chest is a total turn on. So basically everything I'm attracted to has to do with masculinity, and most of it has nothing to do with femininity.

I think that even with a lot of non-bisexual (monosexual?) people it's not as straight-forward as that. For example, there are lots of mostly straight guys who are really, really, into women with penises, much more so than they are into those that don't. So the things they're attracted to are mostly feminine, but one conventionally masculine thing happens to really turn them on. It's probably a little bit different for everyone.

I know everyone there and everyone knows me and we all get on for the most part.  I told people individually and much as a lot of people have said in the past, if you tell a person directly they tend to keep it in confidence rather than immediately going out and splashing it around.

I told the MD and another Director first, then my immediate manager, then people I got on with and then everyone else.  Usually that was one on one and sometimes two at most.  Almost no-one found out that I didn't tell and it took about 2-3 months to tell everyone due to schedules, etc.  Everyone was pretty good about it and the best had questions and the worst was just a bit weirded out.  They've all seen me now and I tend to go to work do's dressed or sometimes get changed after work and go on from there.  I think I am fortunate but having said that I like to think I've been vaguely sensible about it.

I'm going full-time in about 3-6 months time and I started HRT about 7 weeks ago and I am STILL scared.  Mostly its about what customers will think and say, I'm 6'6"" and I don't particularly pass which is why I am waiting for things to have changed a bit before going full-time.  TBH it's more in my head than anything I think, I won't magically lose all of my sales ability overnight or anything and most of the people I deal with are nice people but just got to get past that in my own head first I guess!

I think its pretty similar for most people in that the things that made you fairly liked isn't going to disappear and besides a understandable amount of awkwardness that people will take varying times to get over you should be fine.  Everything you are now you will still be, you just get to be even happier and more yourself!

md619,TheRedPill,1388860718.0,"The problem is guys don't understand that women aren't designed to be happy.

If you are extremely stringent with your time and dedication to her, eventually she will feel she isn't getting enough and WILL push for more. You can delay the inevitable with game but that's all it is. She isn't happy with what she has.

So guys give in, thinking it will make her happy. But it will never be enough. If you move across the country to be with her, take some corporate job and work 50 hours a week to pay for her kids, she'll complain that you don't ever take her to dinner anymore. If you keep giving in, eventually the supplication and emasculation will drive her attraction away from you.

So what's the solution? Don't give her what she wants, she isn't happy. Give her what she wants, she isn't happy.

The solution is to *accept that she won't be happy and do what makes you happy*. Live your life and play by your rules. If she wants to come aboard, fine, if not, adios.

*But what if she leaves me because she isn't happy?* She might. That's why you don't get married. That's why you always have a back up chick. And most importantly, that's why you establish a life and self-esteem independent of her. 

*What if I get lonely?* You think SHE'S going to fill that void? Some of the loneliest times in my life have been in a relationship. Just having someone around != not being lonely. If anything, loneliness is cured by having a someone around who actually cares about you. And who's more likely to care about you, the girl who looks at you like a human wallet or the girl that stuck it out after you told her ""take it or leave it""?"

&gt;It is up to you! Pre-registration will be open to individuals living in finalist cities shortly – only the neighborhoods that reach threshold pre-registration levels will be built. Some or all finalist cities may get service – it depends on local demand.

Some or all. But not necessarily all. If people don't pre-order.

The point seems to be an attempt to push people inland, sooner so they spread out in across the map and don't just clump up around cherno/balota. Spawning all across the eastern coast. It should (hopefully, eventually) push people up into Berezino and Krasnostav and in through Gorka and into the many military bases inland, even the NW airfield.

There are at least 4-5 military bases i can think of inland, along with many small towns and some decent sized cities, which are often better than the coastal spawns anyway.

Having made my way east along the cost a bunch of times now, i constantly run into either people asking to get killed (for a cherno or closer spawn, not knowing you don't spawn in cherno anymore) or big piles of bodies under towers of people, i assume, trying to do the same thing.

If you get killed repeatedly heading down the coast the smart thing is to.. you know.. not head down the coast anymore and head inland to all the good military bases and towns in the middle instead of pushing down the cost only to get killed by assholes over and over again.

TL;DR: Stop going down the coast and getting killed, go inland where there is cool stuff"

This is what the experts who changed the terminology claim, and I'm sure it's somewhat based in truth. But my dissenting opinion is that it was also, for a large part, a necessary PR move. Remember back in 2000, when an environmentalist won the popular vote, and major car and oil companies were taking out magazine adds boasting about how eco friendly they were? To some extent, you see a bit of that, but not like in 2000. In the last decade, special interests killed environmentalism as a major movement. It really used to be a mainstream thing, but it was completely rebranded as some hippie extremist anti-scientific thing. The last decade was awash with people arguing against climate change based on unfounded trivialities, basically saying to environmental activists ""you don't understand the science!"", when they didn't either. So, global warming was ruined as a liberal buzzword, and liberal buzzwords tend to fare much worse when recognized as such than conservative ones do. I think climate scientists at least took this PR problem into consideration when changing the term, because they were putting out a lot of good science under a word that was being immediately swept under the rug as liberal activism."

tauntology,belgium,1388861070.0,"Well, Brussels has the benefit of being the capital of the European Union. That means a ton of companies have an office there, there are various multinational organizations... And they are quite used to expats there. So for employment that might be your best bet. 

As a city, Brussels has its bad areas but is actually safer than, say, Paris. Regular people in Brussels all speak French. Dutch speakers are a small minority there. But the love for Brussels as a city is something that can take a while. The first two years I worked there, I hated it. 

Antwerp is a port. One of the largest in Europe. That offers some employment perspectives as well and it's a rather nice city to live in. (if you avoid the inevitable bad areas) It is a city big on culture. People here speak Dutch. 

Ghent is another large city and my personal favorite. It's very charming and there are tons of small IT companies. Think hipsters :) Employment prospects here will be small companies. If you happen to know a lot about SEO or Adwords or any sort of coding, you'll have plenty of options here. 

Of course, there is Bruges as well. But I don't really see much employment potential there. They subsist mostly on tourism. There are various ports at the North Sea, with Ostend and Zeebrugge being the largest. But Antwerp is bigger as a port and has more to offer as a city. 

To the south of Bruges you have Kortrijk. This area is considered by some to be the ""Texas"" of Belgium. Lots of companies, but they are almost all outside the city centre.

My mother got married and had my brother at 22 and me at 25 but she was never really an independent person before that. She never got to find or define herself. 

After my brother and I left home and her and my father got divorced she then defined herself by her new relationship and chose a partner who was basically a child and needed to be taken care of. 

Now that that relationship has broken down she is kind of giving me the creeps as I see her looking at my belly in a way that makes me feel like she sees it as a new hope.

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1388861614.0,"&gt; I don't see how. It's no more a trap for him than it is for her,

It is, she can opt out by means of abortion.

&gt;who must be pregnant and either raise the child themselves or choose to abort. You know that abortion is not exactly an easy thing for women, or an option for everyone, right?

Neither are fun, but that is balanced by the fact that she has complete control.

&gt;The woman faces the same issues the man does, only moreso. It's not equivalent. It's less bad for the man in that situation, and you really need to ignore reality to think otherwise.

No. She has control over the situation and can decide. The man currently has not decision power at all. The physical burden is worse for the woman (for less than a year), but currently the man has no rights at all, only duties: he's much worse off (and the consequences take 18 years, and are not less deadly).

Giving the man an opt-out would still leave most of the decision power in the hands of the woman, but at least he can get out of it. He still can't opt in.

&gt;Yes, that's what I described as individuals having to make that choice. That does not describe individuals forcing others into a financial corner, on top of their own situation- which is what you are talking about.

They're not forced to do anything. He's declining his rights of fatherhood and walking away. If she chooses to have the child and experiences financial hardship, it's because she chose it.

&gt;See- this is the issue right here. You think that keeping the man entwined in the pregnancy is a ""worse"" outcome than keeping the female entwined 

No, I think it's equally bad.

&gt;(which is physically impossible to avoid). 

It is avoidable: abortion, at her discretion.

&gt;No, obviously it's not worse, it's equivalent at best if the man wants to stay, or just worse for the female if the man doesn't.

And that is why she can decide completely independently how to deal with it, in any case.

&gt;It helps the child, obviously. Did you forget that we're talking about 3 people here, not 2?

There is no child yet, we're still only in the ""cell clump"" phase. Unless you consider that a child, but then abortion is murder and it all becomes a moot point.

&gt;Yes, because THE WOMAN IS THE PREGNANT ONE. PREGNANCY IS NOT EQUAL FOR MEN AND WOMEN and thus trying to create some solution where the consequences of choice can be shared 50-50 is impossible.

Again, that is the reason why she gets to decide independently between abortion or birth. It does not directly impact the man so he has no say in it. Parental obligations, however, do directly impact the man, so he should be able to decide about that.

&gt;No I'm saying the opposite of that. ONCE THE CHILD IS BORN the situation changes, and neither parent has the right to leave if the other one is there. You are trying to mesh the very different realities of pre-birth and post-birth together philosophically, and it doesn't work in reality.

So why do you have a problem then with the man declining parenthood *before* the child is born? After all, you have no problem with a woman doing the very same.

&gt;Who says it's not important? I'm saying it's just not the one overriding decision determining the viability of a pregnancy, which it would have to be if your solution was to be implemented.

Money is always an overriding concern. You need money to take care of children. Without money, becoming a parent is irresponsible and should rightly be avoided if possible.

&gt;But see, here you go again trying to make some false equivelance. Oh, the man only has as long as the woman to make the decision so it's mirrored, right, right. Does it occur to you that it makes essentially zero difference whether he chooses before or after the birth? 

If he does so after the birth he's just a deadbeat parent and liable for child support.

&gt;That is, unless, you think it's ok to place a woman in a situation where they are forced to abort a child 

They are not forced. They can choose to give birth. And face the consequences of their choice. Why is it better to force that burden on a man for the next two decades of his life than to give a woman a choice between two options, one of which allows you to calmly resume your normal activities 24 hours later?

&gt;they may feel a great deal of love for because the man doesn't want to be responsible.

How is that the man's problem?

&gt;The more you think about what these scenarios would look like in reality, the less you should be comfortable with the type of power that gives men to be deadbeat dads.

They aren't deadbeat dads. They clearly state *beforehand* that they won't be a father to the child.

&gt;No, I'm assuming that significantly more will, not most.

In that case: good riddance.

&gt;Tell it to the abandoned child.

There is no abandoned child. There will be the child of a woman who consciously chose to be a single mother. For all intents and purposes, that man has had a car accident. He's *gone*. It's her decision to deal with the situation.

&gt;The fact is that a ""financial abortion"" option justifies the abandonment of a living, born child.

No, it doesn't. I explicity mentioned the condition that the time limit should be similar for the time limit for an abortion.

&gt;it's significantly worse to simply let a child be born that won't have parents obligated to it.

The mother is 100% responsible for that choice. She was able to choose abortion, but she didn't.

&gt;The kid is not some ephemeral part of the equation. The kid is the only real part of it that matters, since he had no choice in the parent's relationship, financial means, or choice to have sex.

Neither had the man a choice in how to deal with the pregnancy. You can't make him responsible for the consequences of a choice he didn't make.

&gt;I believe that once a child is born to a couple

This is not what the thread is about. It explicitly is about what happens *before* that.

&gt;""But women get to choose the abortion and men don't!"" Yeah, I know. It's because women are the pregnant ones. We are organisms that do not have equal burden-sharing in pregnancy. 

I agree that men shouldn't decide about the pregnancy. But there absolutely is no reason to burden men with the consequences of that choice unless otherwise impossible. If an abortion happens, then sadly the man can't opt to become a parent anymore and that's that. If it doesn't happen, we can still give him that choice, and we should. Because there is no technical reason that prevents us from doing so.

I understand you and many others have noticed some things that you seem to think contradict global warming. Sure, it's just as inappropriate for politicians to point to random things and claim global warming. We really only need one fact: the significant majority of experts who study this shit think we're contributing to global warming and that the phenomenon is causing, and will cause increasingly, worldwide mass extinction. What other reason do you need? Does the fate of our natural resources not sound worthy of your tax dollars? This isn't an activist issue, it's an economy issue, with a healthy dose of foresight. The ocean is worth trillions annually, and it's getting so acidic that it's most diverse ecosystems are beginning to dissolve. Fisheries are disappearing. I'm sick of liberals arguing that combating climate change is ""the right thing to do,"" and conservatives getting the option to just say ""I don't care."" It's not some moral or ethical bullshit, or at least it doesn't need to be. Just recognize that natural resources are the ultimate source of entire economies around the world, and fucking them up is going to fuck us over big time.

*One of The Vagina Monologues by Eve Ensler*

.

This is how I came to love my vagina. It's embarrassing because it's not politically correct. I mean I know it should have happened in a bath with salt grains from the Dead Sea, Enya playing, me loving my woman self. I know the story. Vaginas are beautiful. Our self-hatred is only the internalized repression and hatred of the patriarchal culture. It isn't real. Pussies Unite. I know all of it. Like if we'd grown up in a culture where we were taught fat thighs were beautiful, we'd all be pounding down milkshakes and Krispy Kremes, lying on our backs, spending our days thigh-expanding. But, we didn't grow up in that culture. I hated my thighs and I hated my vagina even more. I thought it was incredibly ugly. I was one of those women who had looked at it and from that moment on I wished I hadn't. It made me sick. I pitied anyone who had to go down there. 

In order to survive, I began to pretend there was something else between my legs. I imagined furniture — cozy futons with light cotton comforters, little velvet settees, leopard rugs, or pretty things — silk handkerchiefs, quilted pot holders, or place settings. I got so accustomed to this that I lost all memory of having a vagina. Whenever a man was inside me, I pictured him inside a mink-lined muffler, or a Chinese bowl. 

Then I met Bob. Bob was the most ordinary man I ever met. He was thin and tall and nondescript and wore khaki tan clothes. Bob did not like spicy foods or listen to Prince. He had no interest in sexy lingerie. In the summer he spent time in the shade. He did not share his inner feelings. He did not have any problems or issues and was not even an alcoholic. He wasn't very funny or articulate or mysterious. He wasn't mean or unavailable. He wasn't self-involved or charismatic. He didn't drive fast. I didn't particularly like Bob. I would have missed him altogether if he hadn't picked up my change that I dropped on the deli floor. When he handed me back my quarters and pennies and his hand accidentally touched mine, something happened. I went to bed with him. That's when the miracle occurred. 

Turned out that Bob loved vaginas. He was a connoisseur. He loved the way they felt, the way they tasted, the way they smelled, but most importantly he loved the way they looked. He had to look at them. The first time we had sex, he told me he had to see me. 

""I'm right here,"" I said. 

""No, you,"" he said. ""I have to see you."" 

""Turn on the light,"" I said, thinking he was a weirdo and freaking out in the dark. 

He turned on the light. 

Then he said, ""OK, I'm ready, ready to see you."" 

""Right here,"" I waved, ""I'm right here."" 

Then he began to undress me. 

""What are you doing Bob?"" I said. 

""I need to see you,"" he replied. 

""No need,"" I said. ""Just do it."" 

""I need to see what you look like,"" he said. 

""But you've seen a red leather couch before,"" I said. 

Bob continued. He would not stop. I wanted to throw up and die. 

""This is awfully intimate,"" I said. ""Can't you just do it."" 

""No,"" he said. ""It's who you are. I need to look."" 

I held my breath. He looked and looked. He got breathy and his face changed. He didn't look ordinary anymore. He looked like a hungry beast. 

""You're so beautiful,"" he said. ""You're elegant and deep and innocent and wild."" 

""You saw that there?"" I said.

 It was like he read my palm. 

""I saw that,"" he said, ""and more, much much more."" 

He stayed looking for almost an hour as if he were studying a map, observing the moon, staring into my eyes, but it was my vagina. In the light I watched him looking at me and he was so genuinely excited, so peaceful and euphoric, I began to get wet and turned on. I began to see myself the way he saw me. I began to feel beautiful and delicious — like a great painting, or a waterfall. Bob wasn't afraid. He wasn't grossed out. I began to swell, began to feel proud. Began to love my vagina. And Bob, lost himself there, and I was there with him, in my vagina, and we were gone."

I had insane chills watching it the first time.

And part of what I love about this Avon-String scene is that you get the feeling String never really intended to tell Avon, but let it slip in the moment because he was so heated about being called ""not hard."" String plans things so carefully and is usually so composed, but we get a glimpse of his insecurity here ... which leads to him running his mouth and ultimately, well, you know.

Newsflash: Opening your legs long enough to have sex with a guy in a committed relationship while you're also in a committed relationship is not impossible for her to stop unless she was raped. 

What she is doing is manipulating the situation so that if things don't work out with her new fuckbuddy, she has you to fall back on. She has manipulated the situation to try and quell your suspicions and look like a better person than she really is, and what's worse is that you're making excuses for her.

**She doesn't care about your feelings, she cares about being caught and looking like a bad person.**

Have some self respect and drop this person from your life. You deserve better and you should 10000% tell her that you know she has lied, you're not proud of how you found out, but the fact remains that she is a liar and you deserve better. Cut off communication and try to move on with someone who actually cares.

* Marriage was adopted by religion 

* Marriage is a contract (Formally women were property and it was a way to bring families together).

* Marriage is not a religious institution 

* Marriage comes with some benefits including being able to offer health insurance to your spouse if you have it at a more affordable rate and visitation rights in the event you or your spouse needs medical care. Which are not (at least where I have lived) afforded to couples in civil unions or common law marriages. Benefits that have nothing to do with religion.

We compete with one another in complex social networks for mates. Intelligence does matter to us. So, someone of higher ""intelligence"" (which is such a problematic concept, but whatever), will probably on average out-compete someone of lower intelligence for mates, and therefore, no, stupid people are still fucked.

V171,AskReddit,1388862368.0,"I absolutely understand the point you are making and I agree on a lot of it, but I want to point out why others might not. 

Where I live there are gay bars and there are locations that gay people like to go. I think that's an important distinction to the argument. When I talk about ""gay bars"" I mean the bars that were opened as gay bars. Not just the bars that gay people like to go to. That would not be considered a ""gay space"" because it was not established in the interest of gay people. 

&gt;Likewise, not every gay person is into the gay scene. When I walk into any bar, I'm not going there with my sexuality plastered on my sleeve. I'm there because I like the venue, like the music, appreciate the staff, am out with friends, or it was close by. If I happen to be at a gay bar, it's because I wanted to be there and not because I have to.

In a perfect world, someone's sexuality shouldn't come into play when it comes to picking a bar or venue to go to. Like you said, it should be chosen based off of the music or staff etc. You have that privilege to choose from a great many bars to go to, but gay people don't. I know Chicago is a very progressive place, but even in Chicago there is bigotry. I am in the south and if I were to express myself at any bar on Bourbon St., I would run the risk of being assaulted by a drunk tourist. So the gay bars are a sort of ""safe zone"" where we know we can be open about everything. I'm not saying that straight people can't go to those places too, but rather gay people don't necessarily have the freedom that you have in choosing a place to go. 

&gt;With the logic of gay bars being gay spaces, does that also mean that gay neighborhoods are gay spaces? No straight people allowed because it's not tailored to straight people?

Yes, it does mean that it is a gay space. No it does not mean that straight people can't live there. But I don't know why you would want to. Every other neighborhood on the planet is a ""straight neighborhood."" Even gay neighborhoods contain about 40%-50% straight people. If a gay neighborhood is convenient for you, yeah you should absolutely live there. But keep in mind that you are trying to force equality on an issue that is far from being equal. Gay people have less benefits than straight people. It doesn't seem fair to take the few benefits that we do have and saying ""we want those too because of equality.""

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,Dogtraining,1388862388.0,"If she is in pain/discomfort this could easily be the reason. A personal anecdote: I have a chronic pain condition and when it is flaring up I am overly sensitive to any stimulus, positive or negative. My personal space zone increases dramatically. I remember once my friend leaned over to whisper something to me and I physically recoiled because I couldn't handle someone being that close. They didn't even touch me, but I was already so overstimulated with pain anything else was too much. 

I would follow the advice that everyone has given: go check with the vet just to double check everything is ok. And ultimately take a break and give her some space. I'm sure she can feel the frustration from you and is worried about it. She just needs her space and people to be calm and relaxed and steady. Take your cues from watching her and determine if how you are comforting her actually comforts her or seems to increase stress. We all have our likes and dislikes and what might work for one dog may make it worse for another. I wouldn't take it personally. Pain and discomfort can make the best of us irritable and unsocial. "

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1388862572.0,"&gt; All my posts have been trying to explain this. The answer is because there is no available solution to allow men to do so that does not simultaneously endanger the child and cause a greater deal of difficulty to the woman- through the direct financial neglect a born child would have, and the increased burden a woman would suffer as either a single parent or reluctant participant in an abortion.

The increased burden as a single parent for a woman is similar to the increased burden of child support. However, the woman *chooses* to be a single parent. I see no reason to make one person liable to support the decisions of another person if he didn't choose to do so.

&gt;Abortion is not supposed to be fair.

Of course it's supposed to be fair. It's a tool to preserve the freedom of choice for the woman and her control of her body, both examples of fairness.

&gt;She decides not only for the man, but for the unborn child. This is the least bad option available, if we are going to allow abortion at all.

No, the least bad option available is to allow the man an opt-out too. His freedom of choice is also important - just as important as that of the woman.

&gt;No, not ""just like she has."" Abortion and financially opting out are not the same thing.

It's as close as possible.

&gt;The latter tips the scales in favor of the man mores than the former tips it in favor of the woman

No, because the man still can't opt to keep the child if the woman wants to abort. He still has less options than the woman.

&gt;and also completely ignores the welfare of a potentially born child.

So does the mother's option for abortion. If that's a valid argument, you are against abortion.

&gt;Well I certainly have a problem with it, because it throws the welfare of the child under the bus so that one parent doesn't need to be responsible for their actions.

Then abortion is the preferable option.

&gt;Incredibly immoral and unfair to a child who had no say in being born.

And making decisions about the life of a man who has no say in whether that birth happened, on the other hand, is okay for you? That's not consistent.

&gt;I doubt it.

We'll see. If it gets out of hand we can rescind it.

&gt;ut I think you would have a massively higher amount of single parents, since the ability to decide to not pay for something is far easier than the ability to decide to have an abortion.

It would also make parenthood a positive *choice* for men, instead of something that is forced upon them. That would lead to more engagement.

&gt;Um yeah, but one of those is worse still than the other.

Men who don't want to take care of child, won't. Giving the impression to future mothers that they will be forced anyway to do so (so they don't need to take into account the opinion of the future father in their decision to keep the child or not) gives a false sense of security."

When going to the bathroom try to get into as much as a squat position as you can, with your knees above your hips. Hope this helps. It did for me! I still eat my shitty diet but yogurt has been my best friend; it helps a lot to bring my poops to normal. (which is shitting every day at least; going 2 days to 4 days without taking a shit is not normal...at all) Also, Activia is bullshit, regular yogurt is just the same just they trick you into thinking that if you buy it your better for it. It works for any types of yogurt if you take any kind for the time I said above.


Edit: I too hated yogurt with a passion, but I needed something with probiotics to help with my IBS, and the juice I normally would buy for that was hard to come by and expensive so I thought I would give yogurt another chance. Although I wanted to start out with flavors I thought I would like so I got Apple Turnover and Peach. Suddenly I didn't hate yogurt anymore. And it helps even with lactose intolerant people because it has cultures and good bacteria in it. So even though it is dairy, it DOES help. Also, if you have a poop that is sticky and not coming out, it's not ready to come out. It has to ""solidify"" more. I have had this happen to me and I go later on and it comes out fine."

I agree that a movie can explore the theme of sexism by portraying sexism on screen, and all the examples you gave are good, but the *whole point* of the Bechdel Test is that it's more about the *lack* of any meaningful portrayal of women *at all*, rather than portraying men being sexist towards women and thus exploring the theme of sexism."

This releases the government from any control over who can legally be married, as marriage doesn't exist in the eyes of the law. We're also saying that **any two consenting adults** can form a union. 

This places all partnerships on an even level in terms of taxes, property ownership and custody in the eyes of the law, and allows private organizations the discretion to perform gay marriages if they wish. It also removes any argument that the religious could have against ""gay marriage"", as no longer exists.

frsp,DebateReligion,1388862857.0,"&gt; By my own debate-oriented definition of person (i.e.: I may talk about a ""dead person"", but I don't consider the corpse a person), to me that means months after birth. 

A person is a being with free will and intellect. The physical form may restrict outward expression of personhood but an embryo is no more a non-person because of that than a Joe Bonham.

&gt;That doesn't mean I advocate the killing of babies at the will of their parents, but try to understand my position.

Do you believe that doing so is wrong? If so, why? Just wondering.

&gt;What if I kill one of the cells without even dividing them? Is it immoral to take a sample? Is it immoral to later take a biopsy of the fetus, which may help save his life? Where's the line?

Are you terminating the pregnancy? That is the line.

&gt;Also, murder involves unlawfulness. It's not illegal, so a better term would be homicide 

We're not talking about the law. Persons exist prior to positive law.

&gt;What if the brain has cells from both, equally distributed?

It makes no difference, the brain is not the person, merely a physical means used by the person. If I have a computer made out of salvaged parts pulled out of two different cases, it may be physically a mix of two computers, but I, the user, am not two different users for it.

&gt;Again, I don't consider fetuses persons. But what I'm saying is, why would God bother with imbuing a fetus He knows will die with a soul?

Why not? Everyone dies.

&gt;You can get stem cells from adult cells, and reverting the effects of aging is theoretically possible.

I know, and I'm all for stem cell research, as long as abortions aren't performed to harvest stem cells. And where can I sign up to be forever young?

&gt;The pluripotent stem cell is indistinguishable from the one of an embryo. It's just a few tweaks in the nucleus.

Neat. 

&gt;Also: is there any scenario where a person may be ""soulless"", no matter how unlikely?

If they are dead or a ginger.

&gt;What are the effects of a soul? 

A rational soul endows the individual with free will and intellect.

&gt;How can we tell if a non-human has a soul?

Following Aristotle, animals have sensory souls and plants have vegetative souls.

Other than that, I would suggest looking up the fancier local boutiques of lingerie shops in your area.

You've certainly got a way with words, good sir. I'm sure that reading it will be very painful for your parents-- but this is something that they may need. 

Setting boundaries is painful. 

They've hurt you and you have every right to tell them how and in what way they've hurt you. 

I hope for their sake and the sake of your future children that your parents change, and overcome their inborn bigotries. That they try to make amends and that through the example of you and your husband, they see that you will make amazing dads and that any children who come into your lives will be lucky to have you. 

On that note, however, the use of ""hubris"", while correct in context, seems to me like one of those ""big words"" that my own parents would pick at me for using-- as much as I hate telling someone to ""dumb it down"", simplifying the term would help not only with making the point more succinct, but also with helping to avoid the ""you're just trying to make yourself sound smarter than us"" that many parents (*cough*myown*cough*) would use as a means of striking back at me. 

Unfortunately, COLDS has set up generations of people with poor coping skills and a gross lack of maturity-- which I see come out most frequently in conflict or when someone feels like they've been backed into a corner. Adults in their 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond striking out like catty teenagers when they're offended-- even if they're not sure *why* they're offended. 

As frustrating as it is, it's why I've come to approach conflict within my own family with the ""how can I explain this clearly and accurately without giving any room for interpretation so nobody tries to put words in my mouth later?"" mindset. Which is stupid, but them's the breaks."

To be fair, it is not the **only** reason tall people even come to this sub.

The reason why we are ""sister subs"" is because both subs are about height in general, and are two different perspectives. Just how all of the individual MBTI types are ""sister subs."" It's not like we 'elected' it to be that way, it is just a convenient way of phrasing it.

&gt;I don't appreciate having this kind of thing rubbed in my face.

I would have to disagree with you there. It isn't like /u/NovemberOne said ""Hey, /u/Keefee, I want to rub my dick all over all the short girls so you can't have any."" (Okay. That's extreme. Fine.) He didn't say, ""Hey, /u/Keefee, I'm going to date a short girl na-na-na-na-boo-boo."" He just gave a general compliment to all the short women on the subreddit. A statement which, by its very nature, is not directed towards you in any way, shape, or form.

Consider it this way - would it be a big deal to you had it come from a short guy? If Carbonaras or /u/GeoffreyArnold had said ""Shorties cannot be beat. This is fact."" in the same context, would you have perceived it as them rubbing it in your face? Or would you have agreed with them?

You don't stop learning when you grow up, you just use different methods. 

The news should be all about learning what's happening outside your immediate sphere of influence.

Instead of impartial reporting of facts that facilitate meaningful discussion,  we get news generated for profit. 

Two things need to happen: Broadcasters of news should be individually and collectively liable for reporting incorrect information. They sell that info to the public,  and should be covered by the same trade practice laws that govern most other industries. 

Second,  News journalists should be public servants,  rather than personalities. Their funding should be public, transparent and answerable to the judiciary as well as the executive. "

No, he didn't. And they haven't done it that way. At least my ISP hasn't. I haven't denied that they've pressured ISPs to release filters with certain requirements met, but what you're saying about those filters being applied by default is bullshit. My ISP has done nothing of the sort. I don't get the filter unless I explicitly request it.

&gt;especially when they are meddling in internet freedom issues that they have no business even commenting on in the first place.

This is politics. They have a lot of business commenting on this, just as they have business commenting on every aspect of society. We elected them, and now they get to do things like this. It is well within their rights when they have the sufficient support, which they very much do.

GetOffMyLawn_,cfs,1388864071.0,"If you're tired it's too much. Generally when you're overdoing it you are unaware that it's too much. One of the hallmarks of this disease is post-exertional malaise, or PEM, which occurs 12-24 hours or later after the activity.

When it comes to pacing you will have to find your own sweet spot. 15 minutes up and 60 minutes down might be workable. You will have to vary your activity periods and rest periods to find what works best. I use a kitchen timer to time these so I don't overdo and get enough rest. Generally activity is anything where you are standing or sitting up. Rest is lying down. Mental activity (computer work, reading, writing, etc...) is also activity. When I was at my sickest just listening to the radio or watching tv was exhausting. If you have to work on the computer get a laptop, lie down with a pillow under your head and put the laptop on your stomach.

Aerobic threshold will really tell you when you overdo, but you need a heart rate monitor. Strap it on and keep your heart rate below your aerobic threshold. Your max heart rate should never get above the bottom of the range for your maximum heart rate. There are online calculators to figure out your heart rate training zone. I used this [chart](http://loneswimmer.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/exercise_zones.png). You want to be in the very bottom, down at 50%. You may find that 50% is too much, so drop the rate again. There is no hard and fast rule other than keep it down low enough to avoid PEM. Once you get good at monitoring your heart rate then start using Rate of Perceived Exertion. (RPE [chart](http://www.phase5fitness.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/rpe-rate-of-perceived-exertion.jpg).) You want to be down around 2-3. You can't wear a heart monitor 24x7 so being able to self monitor becomes important. When I walk I make sure I go slow enough so I don't breathe out of my mouth. If I start to breathe harder or start sweating then I know it's too much for me. By self-monitoring and working lightly enough to keep my breathing rate down I can usually avoid PEM. If I go slow and steady I can exercise. 

It wasn't until I started monitoring my AT that I was able to turn things around somewhat. I did pacing for years and it helped but it wasn't enough.

I have a hard time bathing too. It can make me exhausted. Use cool water because warm water dilates your blood vessels and lowers your blood pressure, and we already have problems with that. Keep it cool, keep it short. I sit down in the shower to conserve energy. Sit down to towel off or wrap yourself in a terry robe and lie down. Another option is use a blow dryer to dry yourself off. And lie down after you bathe since bathing is an activity you have to pace. "

I'm a calvinist because I have a science background and believe the scientific process and scientific knowledge to be valid and truth.  I support Calvinism as it is the only possible way that God could have been the creator of the Universe and still have science be valid. 

God, being omnipotent and omniscient has full knowledge of the path everything in the universe will follow, because God, being omniscient, set everything in the Universe on its path when he set the Universe in motion. So God knows what everyone will choose to do, because the initial conditions God created the universe dictate what everyone will do. So there is no actual free will. (just the perception of it, but that is an illusion).

But Christian doctrine states that all can be redeemed by faith and faith alone. This contradicts the doctrine of Calvinism.

razzertto,xxfitness,1388864455.0,"I travel to hike in the southwest. I come from flatland Miami where the humidity hovers above 80%. First things first, everyone has said it three times but oh my god, you will need a lot of water (and salty snacks). My husband and I went through four and a half liters of water on one six hour hike and that probably wasn't enough. We were thirsty on the last 3/4 mile and had run out of water. Don't be that stupid. We were with people who had a little extra for a true emergency but we didn't want to bother them knowing that we were near the end. Your skin will also take a beating if you don't adequately cover up and use sunscreen. 

Second, strength training is a huge boon here. I've done several 9+ mile day hikes with 3000' elevation gains. When I was strength training regularly (squats, lunges, more squats, straight-leg deadlifts, plus maybe some squats) I was faster (decreasing my time from 8 hours to 6.5) and had a lot less soreness the next day. In fact, the only thing that bothered me was my calves. Train your calves or be prepared for pain if you're going uphill. The stairclimber is another way to get your body used to propelling yourself up. Increasing cardiac capacity will help you, so almost any HIIT and strength workouts will be great. 

Put your pack on and make sure it fits you well and doesn't cause pressure points. Make sure your boots don't cause pain.  

The thing about hiking at distance is that unless you're a competitive hiker going for some record you're going to have to moderate yourself. Go to fast and you'll gas out later. You have to take breaks from time to time. You need to pause, take in the landscape, marvel at it, and catch your breath. "

Maklodes,TumblrInAction,1388864506.0,"Basically, at the most defensible level, concern over cultural appropriation is about symbols which have real, specific significance in one culture being taken out of context and used in another culture. To take American culture for instance, a piece of paper saying ""John Hopkins University has conferred upon [your name] the title of Doctor of Medicine in recognition of his original research in..."" has a very specific meaning in US culture. It means you went to this institution in Baltimore, MD, studied for several years, and went through some very rigorous testing concerning medical knowledge and practice (and passed those tests), and did at least a bit of original research.

Now say some teenaged girl from Papua New Guinea sees that diploma, thinks ""ooh, cool pattern of ink on paper!"" and gets a duplicate made, and hangs it outside of her door. She doesn't know anything about medicine. She's never set foot in Baltimore. She's never taken the MCATs. She wouldn't claim she's pretending to -- to her, it's not fraud, just using a cool poster from American culture -- but you can see why some people who busted their asses trying to get into med school -- many unsuccessfully in spite of working very hard -- might not be happy about it.

You could apply it to other symbolic artifacts of specific significance in our culture, such as police badges, purple heart medals, etc. I believe that in terms of cultures actually concerned about appropriation, Maori tattooing and Lakota-style war bonnets are regarded as having specific significance in their own cultures which is disregarded when they're appropriated.

However, the tumblr anti-cultural appropriation movement has taken it far beyond that, and treats any cultural diffusion as appropriation. Thus, it's not just things of special significance that mustn't be borrowed, but essentially everything, from fashion statements to food. "

Triplanetary,DaystromInstitute,1388864720.0,"This makes sense, given that the only Klingon who ever developed a means of firing while cloaked was Chang, who was by no means honorable. (Murder as a means of political change - that's fine for Klingons. But murdering from behind a cloak and then pinning the blame on someone else? Not at all honorable.) If Chang was able to figure out how to fire while cloaked, why didn't anyone else do so down the line (aside from Shizon)? Probably because, due to the cultural biases you describe, most Klingons weren't interested in pursuing that line of research. There seems to be no honorable use for a technology that allows you to kill without ever having to face your opponent.*

*On the other hand ""killing without ever having to face your opponent"" is an ideal Romulan strategy. Perhaps Shinzon's ability to fire while cloaked was something the Romulan military (or perhaps the Tal'Shiar) was developing, which he was able to steal while building the Scimitar."

When I tried saying my Mormon friends were not like that, I was downvoted into oblivion.

&gt; Thanks for the apology...

I genuinely didn't mean it like that but I do see how it could come across that way. I had initially written more and had shortened it so that it didn't sound condescending and I guess my edit wasn't very good. Glad we're on the same page now though. I honestly have no hard feelings against anyone here. I do wish people would calm down a little when talking about religion. When everyone gets all nuts about it it's really hard to get to the root of the problem.

For example, everyone is concerned about the Mormon tithing which is something they choose to do. But no one seems to have a problem with attacking Mormons for their beliefs. How is the first thing worse than the second thing? Attacking someone is a heck of a lot more of a problem than giving up some of your income to support your faith."

megdropsoup,weddingplanning,1388864830.0,"We got married October 5, 2013.  The previous year had awesomely warm, non rainy weather every weekend in October so we thought we'd be good.  I did have two back up plans though.  There was a pavilion and the reception hall available for the ceremony as everything was at the same location.  The day before we had the rehearsal outside in the evening under the pavilion.  I wore a knee length sleeveless dress and was just perfect!  Wedding day however, had rain.  Rain all day.  Rain from about noon until about 11pm.  We did get an hour in the afternoon for our outdoor pictures for which I was so grateful.  Many of our pictures had to be indoors which was less than ideal, but at the end of the day we were married.  Going into it, I knew that I was running a huge risk by planning an outdoor wedding so I had prepared myself in the event that we had to change the location of the ceremony.  I was more bummed about the lack of outdoor pictures.  
As it turned out, I absolutely loved having the ceremony indoors.  There were outdoor factors that I had not thought of such as: road noise and our voices not projecting as much as I thought they might.  By doing it indoors, I had my DJ set up a microphone and speakers and everyone heard our vows.  
TLDR: yes, I planned an outdoor wedding and had back up plans which I actually had to use.  As long as you have a back up and are not heartbroken when you have to use said back up, you should be good. "

As proposed, the IT systems will be open to upwards of a million IT staff with minimal protection, with virtually no control to make sure that the information is released on a need to know basis. Privacy of these records should be the *first* priority: if this cannot be assured, the project should not take place - it is primarily about cost savings not medical benefits, so don't stir up panic about epidemics of bubonic plague if we don't do it. And by privacy, I mean that the system should be fail-safe in the sense that the patient has to authorise all persons seeking access.

Tiseye,relationships,1388865100.0,"Couple of things here (nearing 50, in a succesful 25 year relationship).

- women's libidos are not lower than men's. That's a myth.

- sex actually gets better as you get older and not worse. At least in our case, and it was pretty bloody good to begin with. The more comfortable you get with each other, the more open you become and the more you get to know each other, the more you can anticipate and experiment.

- in order to get the most out of your sex life, you need to be open and honest, communicate about what you like and don't like, share some of your fantasies, try out new stuff.

If you're not getting out of your sex life what you would like, and you think this is because of an issue you believe may be resolved, couples counselling may be the way to go if you cannot talk about this with just the two of you.

But if you're planning on sharing your life with someone, it boggles the mind to think that something as important as sex (and it is bloody important) cannot be discussed openly between the two people participating."

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1388865106.0,"&gt; It actually isn't, what is BS is men who reject their responsibility to their children.

They would be opting out at the same moment as a women who chooses abortion.

&gt;Most problems that children have is due to a broken home or parents who are absent from their lives. Men always have a way to opt out of fatherhood....don't have sex or take proper steps to ensure they won't conceive a child. After that, they must accept the consequences of their actions.

That's what conservatives say when they argue against abortion. *Exactly* the same argument.

&gt;I am not sure what your background is, but I am pretty sure that your father had a large impact on your life (either good or bad) that shapes who you are today. The world would be a much better place is more men realized that impact that they have of the lives of their children and were man enough to take positives steps in their lives.

And one way to do that is making fatherhood a positive choice instead of something that is forced upon men or taken for granted by women.

I have hope that eventually those games will be seen as video games by the general public too, just like more hardcore-sounding games.

blackboxstar,mtgaltered,1388865482.0,"Michaels runs coupons all the time.  I got a box set of six 2oz colors for 30 bucks (rather than 60) and was able to pick up the rest of my stuff (brush soap, size 1 roud brush, size 1 flat brush, fluid paint thinner, pallette, and color wheel) for about 40.

I started with tokens.  I put cartoon characters on them.  I experimented with erasing the original ink, painting over the card, etc.  Gave me a chance to get used to my equipment and practice basic concepts.

I took my tokens to the LGS and sold/traded them for $5 each.  I bought a nice leather trades binder and let people know I was happy to trade for standard and legacy staples.

I started altering lands.  I like borderless, but I have also done some fun things will full art.  This allowed me to experiment with color matching.

I took my lands to the LGS and charged $12 dollars from them.

I moved on to playable commons/uncommons.  This let me alter real cards without a lot of risk.  So I messed up my pacifisms, no big deal.

I took my cards to my LGS and traded (for well done playable nonland cards) $20 plus the cost of the card.  I talked to the owner of my LGS and he offered to sell my magic cards for me in his shop, I still keep most of my cards in my binder, but there are times when I have extra cards that aren't moving and I give them to him to get them out of my binder.

TBH I'm still not to the point where I alter much more than commons and uncommons.  My personal goal is to sit down with alters and end up with a decent alter every time before I start altering money cards.

After the initial Michaels trip I took the money I made and invested it in: Ultra Pro leather card binder, archival quality varnish, brown paint, and sleeves.

Tips:

there's a sticky on the front page that goes over supplies.  It's very helpful.

All kinds of people make articles and youtube videos.  Some of them are not that helpful, but others are extremely helpful.  

Don't skimp on supplies.  People don't lie when they say it makes a big difference.

Try not to trade for trash.  This might be just a me thing, but it took me a while to figure out what was and was not worth trading for.  I traded for a lot of bulk cards that were technically worth what I asked for, but will probably sit in my binder forever because nobody plays them."

Trust me I didn't miss what was going on with the character of Alaska. It's not like I didn't pick up on her self destructive tendencies (""Y'all smoke to enjoy it, I smoke to die"" was about as subtle as a jack hammer to the temple or shotgun to the face in that regard). Also the radical uptake in her drinking before she died, yes I saw it, I did in fact read it. I got it, I really did, I am neither stupid, nor oblivious.

I also understand that the book was about Pudge, it was told from his perspective after all. All I said was that the character of Alaska Young seemed weak (as in poorly written/developed) and literally the most critical plot point in the entire novel seemed forced to me.

Xavier confirms there are no plans for a reprint. He suggests posting a message [here](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1079437/reprint-needed) to add your voice to the mix. I'm sure HE would love to reprint it, but the publisher likely didn't see the kind of sales numbers they were hoping for on the initial run(s), and will just hold on to it for now. Maybe a reprint would occur at some point in the future (if Xavier gets a really big hit, for example, and people start looking for his older games), but the board game business is a funny world that way.

* That doesn't even make sense. What does it mean to be equally attracted? How would one define such a thing?
* Does 50% mean attracted to one sex half of the time and another the other half of the time? Attracted 50% of the people of one sex? 50% likely to find any given person attractive? 50% attracted to someone?
* Bi activist Robyn Ochs' definition of bisexuality: ""I call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have in myself the potential to be attracted - romantically and/or sexually - to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree.""
* Do straight or gay people find the same things attractive in every person?
* This question presupposes that there are only two sexes/genders. In terms of sex, let's not forget intersex people, whose genitalia or chromosomes make them not classifiable as distinctly male or female. For gender, let's not forget genderqueer people, whose gender identities fall outside the male/female binary, e.g., they feel like they have no gender, move between genders, or are of a third gender.

Finally, on a personal level: I am attracted to people of different genders in very different ways. I am a bi woman. For the past six months or so, I haven't been interested in any men on a dating level, though I find many men sexually attractive. I just find myself more interested in women or genderqueer folks at the moment."

badaboopdedoop,AskReddit,1388865761.0,"Basically, yes, it is purely semantics. To many religious people, however, it is the name itself that is important.



Two things:

* Most religious opposition stems from the commonly-held Christian belief that marriage is a sacred institution and can *only* exist between a man and woman. 
* Many religious groups believe that their organization's definition of marriage supersedes the legal definition of marriage. For example, the Catholic church doesn't recognize non-Catholic marriages as valid. (*This doesn't mean Catholics don't respect other marriages, it simply means that the under Catholic doctrine, in order for a marriage to be valid it needs to occur in a Catholic church under the direction of a priest in the Catholic wedding ceremony.*)
 
Currently, marriage is both a religious and legal institution. This creates conflict when homosexuals want to be legally married, as many religious people believe this cannot happen. (*I don't personally agree with this belief, but it does exist and is quite common among the religious, and it needs to be respected.*)

Under this proposed system, religious groups can preserve their own sacred definition of marriage, but as far as the law is concerned all partnerships are equal.

We each wrote them independently of each other and did not share them with each other until we were standing in front of each other at our wedding.  I was very hesitant about doing it that way, but I'm so glad we did.  We knew how we felt about each other and it was really neat to see how we expressed it there in front of our family and friends.  We sent to the officiant just so he could make sure we were kind of on the same page.  We set a word limit too so that one of us wasn't talking for five minutes while the other only talked for 30 seconds.  Mine was 150 words and his was 78.  150 was the limit.  We had no particular reason for waiting until one month before, it just worked out that way.  We even memorized them and successfully said them without prompts from the officiant.  
We got so many compliments on our self written vows and they were one of my favorite things about my wedding day.  Good luck writing yours!  "

CalvinDehaze,AskReddit,1388866086.0,"I work in movies, and like everyone I have a day job and also write screenplays, so I'm always studying characters. Where they come from, why they do the things they do, etc. People are not good sources for their own personality, meaning that if you ask them if they're attracted to their opposite sex parent, they'll say no. I knew that would happen here, but I also knew there would be 1 or 2 people like you who answer honestly, or are older and have figured that out. Usually younger people abhor the idea, and I think that's because they're still finding out what they need and if it aligns to what they want. My mom is a hispanic cross-country truck driver who's super independent. Now, I'm not looking for exactly that, but I do find myself attracted to very independent women with dark hair and eyes. Submissive Asians or really blonde and pale don't do it for me. Also, in all of the straight people I know, the people they end up marrying are very similar to their opposite sex parent. (Step or biological).

Couldn't be seaweed or eel grass because it's moving across the channel into deeper water. I'm struggling to get any line in and then it just...sits. It doesn't move.

So a few percent of that meal is the profit that the owner is looking at.  We were also among the top McDs in the country, both in sales and in ratings by the corporate office for quality, service, and cleanliness.

Also, these ingredient prices aren't much different than you can get at the store.  A cheese slice, 10 cents; bun, 13 cents, etc.  So clearly you're paying for the convenience, air conditioning, staff training, stuff to make sure the food is safe, someone to clean your tables when you don't do it yourself, napkins, keeping the bathrooms clean, industrial fire extinguishers and other safety measures, keeping equipment in top working order, and so on."

Triplanetary,DaystromInstitute,1388866308.0,"&gt; Also, it seems highly inefficient to store the raw material for the replicator as generic matter somewhere

But it may be necessary! In ""Ethics,"" Dr. Crusher says that the replicator can't replicate complex organic materials. If that's the case, how does it replicate food? Ships may have to carry a stock of undifferentiated organic material with them for this purpose.

It wouldn't be as bulky as you might think. Mike Wong is a pretty big asshole (and not just because he thinks Star Wars is better than Star Trek :P), but he's also pretty smart, and according to [his calculations](http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/HateMail/Babies/Babies-1.html):

&gt;a Galaxy Class starship carries roughly a thousand people. If each person consumes a few kilograms of food per day, then the total shipwide consumption of food would be several metric tons per day. A one year supply of food would therefore require between 700 and 1000 tons of raw material (let's say 850). If this material is compressed and stored at the approximate density of water, you could store five years worth of raw foodstock in a single 4250 m³ tank. In other words, a single cubic tank measuring only 16 metres across could carry a five year food supply for a thousand people"

From an evolutionary standpoint, having to struggle for resources is bad. If most people are struggling for resources, an obvious physical sign that you do not (i.e. by having enough food to be fat) is a desirable trait.

Again from an evolutionary standpoint, being unfit and unhealthy is bad. If most people are fit and healthy, an obvious physical sign that you are not (i.e. by being overweight) is an undesirable trait.

So when people mostly struggle for food (i.e. in the past, and in present-day third or developing world), being overweight is attractive. When people mostly don't struggle for food (i.e. in the present developed world), being overweight is unattractive."

Zombicide *looks* very cool, but honestly, I was disappointed with it - and I traded my copy away. The gameplay is pretty simplistic and, in my opinion, the rules are broken in some places. You can house-rule around those things, but I just wasn't willing to bother. Without getting into the details, I think it's a beautiful looking game that's frustrating because it didn't really capture the feel of a good zombie survival scenario for me. I felt like I was going through the motions, trying to get excited by zombie kills... and then running up against strange rules that didn't seem to make sense to me and slowed everything down. I couldn't take more than one playthrough.

[Last Night On Earth](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29368/last-night-on-earth-the-zombie-game) is, for my money, a much better zombie game. It's generally set in a more rural location and has fewer zombies - but it lets one player (or two, depending on the number of players) PLAY the zombies, which is awesome. Each side suddenly has a vested interest in beating the other. The zombies are slow, but they have superior numbers. It feels more claustrophobic, grittier, and more life threatening, and there are a bunch of expansions for it that amp up the anxiety.

My two cents. Again... opinions will vary. :)"

My boyfriend, unknown to either of us, has a ridiculous talent for photographing these little guys. So the ladies at the organization began even bringing their older cats to pet adoption days for him to re-photograph. (Usually the adults stay home during kitten season.)

Here are some of his photos: Some are screenshots I grabbed from youtube videos of kittens who go to another location, but the ones not obviously from a video are his. Almost every cat he photographed was adopted within the month of his photos going up, even the adults who had been around for months.

*My biggest accomplishment of 2013 was getting a cat named Bruno adopted. He was 8-10 years old when he was found in a feral colony but clearly domesticated. He spent 5 years with the foster people without a single application. I met him on my first day and he was a LOVE.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1388866642.0,"There seems to be two issues at play: the first is finding a logistical compromise between your libido and hers. It's a good sign that she's taking your concerns seriously based on your conversation and wants to please you more. However, since this is the second time you've had this conversation with her, I want to suggest that you offer her a little help with that. Whatever you decide to do, *stop having identical discussions*. They clearly didn't work the first time, so you need to try something different.

While she may be completely willing to find a middle ground with you in theory, when her libido isn't prompting her toward sex, she may find it hard to put into practice. You two should set clear guidelines for sex - so, for example, you two agree how long it's okay to go without. Neither of you will get exactly what you want - she'll be having a little more sex than she would otherwise and you'll be having a little less - but it should be liveable for you both. Also, ask her if she agrees that you can remind her how long it's been since the last time if she's turning you down; she may not be keeping track, and a gentle reminder that you two agreed on twice-a-week sex can help motivate her. 

The second issue is that you want her to desire you. You may need to re-adjust your understanding of what desire is. She cannot make sexual desire appear from nowhere. However, she does have the desire to please you and satisfy you. That does *not* equal being pressured into doing sexual things. Sex is about so much more than physical pleasure when you're in a loving relationship. I get that you want her to desire you sexually and passionately, but that just might not happen. You have to accept that doesn't mean she doesn't desire you in other ways, and that the lack of a libido doesn't necessarily mean you're pressuring her or that she doesn't want to do these things with you.

One final point: she says that she wants to cuddle and kiss when she's with you, and you're happy to satisfy her needs for emotional closeness. What *type* of sex are you having? What positions are you in? You might have better luck replicating that cuddling and emotional closeness in a sexual situation. So, for example, doggy style can be a very isolating position for the receiver - she can't see you or touch you, and the only point of contact is purely sexual and not emotional. Try positions that bring you two face to face, where you can kiss and caress each other or positions that have a lot of body contact. You two may have inadvertantly slipped into a sexual pattern that leaves her feeling a lack of closeness without even realizing it. "
GreatWhite000,elderscrollsonline,1388866644.0,"Hold on mate. I'm going to call you out on your ""Beta != Finished Product""


A beta tends to be the state of a game where the game is MOSTLY finished, but extremely buggy (ESO was buggy and it's great they held tests). A few features might be added, but the game itself is pretty much complete and only has a few things that need finishing (such as voice acting, as an example). Alpha is when new features are being added. So, beta != polished product. Now that we have a release date, we can assume that they are happy with what they have, despite what people have been complaining about since day one (Horrible animations, combat, et cetera. Search the subreddit and you will find some of the older threads), and that we are going to be getting a game that is fairly similar to what beta testers have played/will play in the next couple months. 

I think ZOS's main problem here is that they are doing what they want. Game developers are of course going to do that sometimes, but it's not healthy for a game if it's developers aren't listening to the players. ZOS seems to ONLY be paying attention to the *positive* feedback, which is not good. Admit it or not, ESO has gotten a fairly negative response from a lot of people. Whether people state their reasoning or not, just having a shit ton of people immediately saying ESO will fail is pretty bad. 

I realise that I'm rambling so I'm going to stop here, and hope that nobody that disagrees with me downvotes me. "

frsp,DebateReligion,1388866745.0,"&gt; I hadn't seen that view before. I see it another way: personhood arises from physical form. A Joe Bonham would have a brain, and thus a personhood.

Here's where we diverge.

&gt;First, I believe nothing is objectively or absolutely right or wrong. That doesn't mean we are justified in doing anything we want, that means that we are fully responsible for our choices, no philosophical excuses are acceptable. Save for extreme circumstances, I wouldn't kill a baby, and I advocate killing babies being illegal.
I instantly feel great sympathy towards babies. This is a phenomenon explained by science. And from my actions and thoughts, you can construct the concept of wrong.

I prefer the Max Stirner approach myself. Might as well go all the way.

&gt;I mean, you've said that I can't get a few stem cells from an embryo, but I can get some from a fetus. At what point am I no longer allowed to get the cells for testing? In both cases the sample cells are killed.

I misread, I thought you meant killing the embryo. I suppose harvesting some cells is just fine, as long as the pregnancy isn't terminated.

&gt;What about flat electroencephalogram, or ""braindead""? Is the soul there?

Maybe, maybe not. You have your heart patients who watch their surgery from overhead.

&gt;Actually IIRC Aristotle said plants have vegetative souls, animals sensory and vegetative souls, and humans all of the former, plus rational soul.

Well, you knew what I meant.

&gt;What was our first ancestor that had all of them? Did our near cousins Homo sapiens neanderthalensis have them? Homo erectus? Australopithecus?

I don't know. Find me the earliest creatures that intentionally made art and then I can tell you.

&gt;Also, couldn't it be that all animals have personhood, but their physical form is restricting it? Couldn't all souls be exactly equal, but differences in genes and context distort them?

This is a very interesting question. I would say that even the most intelligent animals do not because their modes of existence does not go beyond satisfaction of material needs. Ant colonies are impressive civilizations, but it's all about getting a meal. These non-human animals do not create art or philosophy or mathematics or other things that exist as expressions of rational thought as an end of itself.

&gt;This way of thinking is rather alien to me, so please understand if I make really weird questions. I assure you they're all done in good faith (no pun intended).

Well, it's certainly better than having a random person burst in and rage at me about how I'm a cunt."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388866989.0,"&gt;This is just an idea I have, but I think Republican women feel more equal to men as a whole because they are more likely to grow up priveleged. Democratic women are more likely to come from lower income families and larger cities where its possible they felt threatened or lesser.

The problem with this theory is two-fold.  First of all, how Republican and Democratic women *feel* isn't the issue; it's how Democratic and Republican female candidates are *perceived by the public*.  Second, even if that were the issue, the idea that Republicans are more privileged than Democrats is pretty facile.  Neither party is the ""party of the rich.""  52% of Republicans make over $100k, while 47% of Democrats make over $100k.  The wealthiest voting districts tend to skew Democrat, the poorest tend to skew Republican.  ""The Party of Privilege"" is just some flimsy rhetoric both sides fling at each other, and its not true in any meaningful way.

&gt;Slut walks are to call attention to the fact that many women who have been raped have been blamed by people close to them AND the men in power of our country.

You just defined a single cop speaking out of turn in direct violation of his training and institutional standards as ""the men in power of our country.""  

The reality is that very few people actually believe the ""rape myths"" that feminists claim everyone believes.  For example, the best survey I could find on this issue is a survey done by Amnesty International, which found that less than 22% of people think how a woman dresses make her partially responsible, and less than 4% of people think it makes a woman totally responsible.

That's not a prevalent attitude.  To give you a sense of how not mainstream that is, 4% of people **also believe the planet is controlled by lizard people**.  5% of people think jet contrails are part of a government conspiracy to poison people with chemical weapons.  7% of people think the moon landing was a hoax.  9% of people think flouride in the water is a government conspiracy.  13% of people think Obama is the antichrist.  15% of people think the government splices subliminal mind control messages into television.  20% of people think vaccines might cause autism.  

21% of people think aliens crashed in Roswell and the government covered it up.

Think about that for a second.  More people believe that the US government is trying to murder its own citizens with poison gas from airplanes than think how a woman dresses makes her totally responsible for being raped.  And the belief that how she was dressed makes a women just *partially* to blame is about equal to the number of people who believe in Little Green Men.

Have you considered the possibility that a significant portion of the population is just **really stupid?**  Because that seems to be the case here.  

&gt;that Barbie protest was done by Femen, which is not a feminist group. They are paid to do protests by a man who wants to destroy any respect people have for feminists. 

This is kind of hilarious, because most people can't tell the difference between Femen and Slut Walk.  They engage is the exact same form of protest, and protest the same things.  And yet Femen is a scam designed to discredit feminism, and Slut Walk is legitimate activism.

Which means you're arguing that the real feminists are engaging in actions which destroy any respect people have for feminists.

BigFishMcNish,nfl,1388866990.0,I wonder what /u/jacobsmileyface thinks. 
RichardBehiel,space,1388866990.0,"The thing about gravity assists is that the object doesn't actually get its velocity from falling into the gravity well of the object that's giving it the assist, *per se*.

Gravity, in this sense, is just sort of a sticky force that causes the asteroid (or in this case, the third stage of a Saturn V), to catch up to the moon and siphon off some of its velocity.  Of course the moon is much more massive than the stage, and since momentum is conserved, the moon doesn't slow down much.  The stage, on the other hand, gets a huge speed boost.

In a sense, it's like bouncing a tennis ball off of a moving car; the added speed that the ball bounces back with really comes from the momentum of the car, and the compressive force that the ball experiences as it hits the car and expands again is just a way for that momentum to transfer over to the ball.

You may see a man kill another man over seemingly nothing, for instance. What you perceive is that he just killed him for no good reason, however, what triggered him to do so, if anything? The man he killed could have raped someone close to him or done something equally as bad.

Kerithlan,pokemontrades,1388867253.0,"I don't understand what was hard to comprehend, but okay.

Clarification:

Jim is a well-respected trader with a spotless record. So are his friends Simon, Peter, Steve, and Jen.

Peter realizes that there is a glaring oversight in the rules regarding Pokecheck and 6th Gen trading.

The group are all collectors and are unwilling to part with their legit Pokemon collection, but recognize that if they clone each of their trophies once they'll slip by undetected. Eventually, Jim trades the single clone of his Old Map Mew to another subredditor and no one is the wiser, save Jim and co.

(Edit: I realize that the Old Map Mew is against Rule 13, but my point is that simply removing the rule doesn't eliminate this problem.)

All they would have to do is trade the Pokemon among themselves in public, stating that the info checks out, and they'd have a public record with which to refer to when trading them in Gen 6 later.

My major point is that, unlike every other rule on the list here, there is zero way to enforce this policy. You have no way to check them once they're in 6th Gen anymore, and attempting to backtrack at a later date will still be hard to finger anyone with proof as there'd only be the one clone floating about.

I know that this part will be hard for people to wrap their heads around, but any rule or law that restricts the honest individual while threatening nothing to the dishonest one is a bad rule or law."

If you are looking for cheap floor and wall colors, I suggest going to the igloo garage sale. They normally have some very cheap there. 

[Here](http://items.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=show_items&amp;name=&amp;name_type=partial&amp;desc=&amp;cat=0&amp;specialcat=48&amp;status=0&amp;rarity=0&amp;sortby=price&amp;numitems=100) is a list of all the furniture and decorations for neohomes 2.0. It's arranged by price.

I typically look at how the spotlight winners do things and look for inspiration for new ideas. It's very helpful.

You can sort of ""move"" items out of your yard by hitting the up arrow when you highlight an object. This makes it look like it's further out of your yard instead of floating. I did this for my treehouse. 

I suggest that you don't buy seasonal stuff in the season that it's for. For example, the Kiko String Lights that look like Christmas lights, are very expensive right before Christmas, but very cheap right after and during the Spring/Summer.

Make sure to save your house periodically when redecorating. Incase one of your items becomes stuck or lost. 

Some items are glitched in the new neohome, so check Jellyneo item guide first before buying. These items will show up in your shed sometimes, but not allow you to transfer them to your house.

The outside of your house is going to be very expensive unless you do some kind of haunted/Halloween/pumpkin theme. Trees, bushes, and flowers are all very expensive. Ponds and water are also expensive.

Good luck with your neohome!"

Honestly, a lot of people who talk about credit card companies ""scamming"" you are just mad because they missed the fine print on a financial agreement they willfully signed into. I got a best buy card to pay for a student laptop, and heard horror stories about how they scam you with their no interest thing. Most all of those people failed to make a monthly payment, which per the agreement, charges you all of the deferred back interest on your purchase.

2. Pure stupidity--multiple unsportsmanlike conduct/technical fouls/taunting/etc.
3. Bad coaching. OSU couldn't figure out how to stop a WR screen last night to save their lives. Poor, poor, poor coaching. I was very disappointed with that, and I feel the right to call for the DC (looking at you, Fickell) to lose his job.
4. Bad refereeing. Don't need to explain this one. Everyone loves to hate on refs.

But DON'T, DON'T, DON'T attack players for physical mistakes. You think Philly Brown fumbled that punt on purpose? Fuck off, buddy. He was trying to make a play, and it cost him and his team.

The moon is an object held together by gravity. For an object to ""break"" the moon, it'd have to hit it with enough force not just to shatter the rock it's made of but completely cause the pieces to overcome their gravitational attraction for each other. An object with enough kinetic energy to shatter the moon would be large enough to knock the moon out of orbit entirely and *replace it.*

What would be *more* of a concern would be something like that - enough energy to alter the moon's orbit, which would have noticeable changes on tides but probably less effect on plate tectonics (at least in the short term). "

That confident, masculine men are more likely to be sexually successful than insecure, effeminate men is really not an extraordinary claim.  It's on about the same level of ""duh, obvious"" as statement like ""fire is hot"" and ""water is wet."""

TRP does not prevent you from being a decent and kind human being, just like knowing a martial art does not keep you from being non-violent. It is your choice in the end how you use your knowledge.The other thing is that TRP gives this advice unvarnished , not caring that it might not be politically correct or it is not a nice thing to say . If you were from Japan and never saw a violent crime in your life  were going to move to Detroit would you rather someone give you wishy washy don't want to offend anyone, non committal, political correct  statement of "" Its cold in winter "" or say ""Motherfucker you're go to get robbed"".

Here's the US ambulance types: 

&gt;In the US, there are four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck chassis and is used primarily for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.

by_a_pyre_light,Dallas,1388867679.0,"The Londoner and Mucky Duck are both English pubs. The Mucky Duck is owned by the group that does Ringo's Pub, another English pub located at the Shops at Legacy (upscale restaurant and bar strip just up the Tollway 10 minutes from Addison). The Londoner, Mucky Duck, and Ringo's Pub are *extremely* similar. The Londoner in Addison is the oldest of these establishments and features darts, and I think a couple of pool tables (it's been a while since I've been there). The Londoner in Watters Creek, Allen, is by far the best of all of these though. The newest, the largest, with those deep dark, notched timbers supporting everything, full fire place inside and out... it's the perfect pub with a group of friends.

Also, Mucky Duck is a smoking establishment. I cannot remember if the Addison Flying Saucer is, so you may want to check that out before you go if smoking bothers you.

Flying Saucer, if you haven't heard of it before, is a world beer place. They stock around 200 different drafts and bottles from around the world, and the menu is arranged by beer type and region, so you can choose IPAs, kriek beers, ales, domestic drafts, etc. The big thing w/ the Flying Saucer is couches, the beer selection, and the famous ""saucer on the ceiling"", where if you complete their ""World Tour"" program, you get your own personalized saucer glued to the ceiling for all time! Lots of fun.

IMHO, if it's not too far of a drive, the [Flying Saucer on Lake Ray Hubbard](http://www.beerknurd.com/stores/thelake/) is the best choice, because you can sit out on the patio and enjoy the scenes of the lights and stars on the water. 

Social House is Addison's taste of Uptown Dallas. It's the place where you'll find all the primly dressed peeps, and it features a bit more of an upscale appearance with the use of lighter woods, contemporary designs, and specific lighting. It's where the socialites hang out when they're not hanging out in Uptown. If that's your scene, then by all means stop by there. It's not exclusive, it's just not as relaxed as the English pubs and Flying Saucer are. 

All of these places have pretty standard, fairly pallatable bar food, which means none of it is really spicy. You'd be better off checking out some of the great Mexican or Cajun places around for truly spicy fare.

Finally, for pool tables, I know that at least 3 of the places listed for sure do not have them, and at least 2 others are iffy on that. You might be best served by checking out the pool halls like Rack Daddy's or [this great list.](http://dfw.cbslocal.com/top-lists/best-pool-halls-in-dallas/)"

bosh-head,TwoXChromosomes,1388867772.0,"The hijab and other similar articles of clothing are a symbol of oppression against women. It's okay, and even a good thing, that people take offense to others that choose to wear such a symbol. There's no reason that women should be encouraged, as a sex-specific form of ""modesty"", to be covering their hair/face (or entire body in more extreme cases).

&gt; We all know there are women throughout the world forced to do, behave or in this case dress, without their opinion being taken into account.

Including in western countries, by their own family members and communities.

The hijab is not a simple fashion accessory. It is a statement about how women should look and behave in public. Its reason for existing is sexism.

Many justify hijab wearing by saying they get less unwanted and hostile attention from men when they cover up more. But the answer to that problem isn't for women to drape themselves in cloth bags, it's to teach people to behave better. The hijab is a message that blames the victim, that blames the woman who is being harassed rather than focusing on the problem of the harasser.

No one should be proud to wear the hijab or support a cause like this. You are supporting sexism."

One afternoon of talking, flirting, and saying that you ""like"" each other doesn't constitute agreement of anything happening beyond sex.

I understand that there's a lot of sexual tension built up for awhile between you both, I'm just curious as to whether jumping right into it without agreeing you both want more than just sex may end up making things complicated and weird. 

Personally, if I were either of you I'd state my ""like"" for the other person, my want for them to be in my life as a relationship partner, and my hope that the friendship will continue throughout it all. I would want to know that we were both on the same page moving forward, and weren't just looking to hook up.

If you're in a relationship with someone (versus just a ""friend""), there can be significantly less pressure when it comes to sex - as that is eventually part of the deal. When you're still just friends, sex can cause pressure because you don't know where you will stand after until after.

&gt;Ok, Here's what you do: Exfoliate, then rub the area with baby oil before you shave to soften the hair and skin. Shave using a men's razor (one with four blades) and men's moisturizing shaving cream. Since they are made for faces, they are extra gentle. Dab some rubbing alcohol on the skin after you shave to kill bacteria and close your pores. Then apply deodorant (an unscented Dove stick works best) liberally. This will keep you dry down there so you won't chafe and prevents razor bumps. You will have the smoothest giney ever. Mine was always flawless, I was a dancer for four years and did this almost daily. I posted this same routine under my old account and I got TONS of messages in my inbox with girls thanking me for their blemish-free pies.

(okay, maybe I edited out a period)

I struggled with an anxiety disorder a couple years ago. At first I would have panic attacks when I left my house. But eventually, returning and sitting in my room, which was normally a ""safe place"" didn't calm me down anymore. I had another moment of panic as I thought that I would never recover from it. If no place was actually safe, I could never find peace. And then my mind found a way to spin it. It meant that I had complete control of how I felt. ""Safe places"" aren't real - they're just something that I've made up in my mind, and something that I can manipulate. If nothing is safe, then everything is.

Omega037,changemyview,1388868198.0,"&gt; Except for the fact that my beliefs are based on empirical evidence while a religious person's (your) beliefs are based on fairy tales.

This is incorrect.  There is no objectively empirical evidence that God doesn't exist any more than he does.  Also, I never said I was religious.

&gt;  But the notion that I or anyone should change my/their belief in science is so utterly ridiculous it wouldn't hold any water. What rational person is going to reject science? None. And, far more people reject religion for science than the other way around.

This is a false dichotomy.  One can be both religious and accept scientific evidence.  Science merely gives answers about how things function, it does not provide answers as to the meaning behind those functions.

Furthermore, there is no scientific foundation for atheism any more than there is for other major religions, and there are many atheists who hold starkly unscientific views on things like vaccines, GMOs, alternative medicines, etc.

&gt; Sorry, but that's not how falsifiability works. **You can't falsify something that is already false.**

I think your understanding about how science works is extremely lacking.  You seem to be confusing having specific scientific knowledge (evolution, climate change, etc) with understanding critical thinking and the scientific method.

Specifically, you believe that the null hypothesis must be ""there is no God"" and therefore one has to reject that hypothesis to accept the alternative hypothesis of ""there is a god.""

However, I can just as easily make ""there is a god"" the null hypothesis, which then puts the burden on atheists to reject the existence of god.

Since neither hypothesis can actually be rejected since they are both suppositions, there is no way to scientifically falsify either belief.  Which one is ""already false"" is thus purely up to the person setting up the scientific experiment.

&gt; Ever seen a sky daddy? Nope.
Ever seen an angel? Nope.
Ever seen someone rise from the dead? Nope.
Miracles? Nope.
Magic? Nope.
Demons? Nope.

Again, you show a serious lack of education on how science works here.  Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and not having personal observations of an event does not lead to a deductive conclusion that the event can't or hasn't happened.

&gt; The only evidence religious people have that supports their convictions is a book.

The bible is not and has never been considered a book of evidence, it is a book of stories about events.  I was meant to instruct and explain the history and rituals of the religion, not prove the religion is true (since that is already an assumption).  

To give a modern analogy, it is the difference between a user manual for the iPhone and textbooks on circuits, polymers, computer science, metallurgy, and other scientific subjects.  

Treating the bible as the latter and then using it as ""evidence"" is disingenuous.  Even still, disproving elements of the bible wouldn't 
allow you to reject the religion because I could simply ascribe any problems to human error or god testing our faith.  The nature of religions and atheism are, at least at this point, entirely unfalsifiable.

Regardless, my point isn't to prove that you should be religious or shouldn't be an atheist, it is just to say that since there are not objective belief systems, thinking that ""because mine is correct I should be allowed to shun and ridicule people"" is something that everyone would believe and would just end up with everyone getting in each other's faces and being assholes.  

**TL;DR: Since one major impetus of people becoming atheists is that ""religions cause sectarian conflict and discrimination"", it seems amazingly hypocritical that you are basically saying it is alright if atheists cause sectarian conflict and discrimination because they are the one true belief system while the rest are infidels.**"
almightybob1,AskReddit,1388868207.0,"&gt; You have to think about it as ""an omnipotent deity can create any rock, and an omnipotent deity can lift any rock.""

OK omnipotent deity, you can create any rock? Task A: Create a rock you would be unable to lift.

You can't create it? You're not omnipotent.

You can create it? OK, now Task B: lift the rock.

You can lift it? Then you didn't complete task A.

Omegaile,changemyview,1388868265.0,"As some people mentioned and I'll elaborate, some games depend a lot on the input of other players that are not public available, for example rock-paper-scissors like games, such as Pokemon.

If it were a single player game, then you would like to maximize the probability of winning given the rules, and that's doable. But what you are trying to do is to find the strategy that maximizes the probability of winning given both the rules and the other player input, which you don't know.

The rock-paper-scissors playing bot that you mentioned in a comment only works because people's plays follow a pattern. But it's not optimal at all. In fact, if one would look at the source code, one could build a second bot, specialized in beating this bot. In other words, in a game like this, if you make a strategy, and I know it, then I can build a strategy that beats yours. So there is no optimal strategy.

Another example: poker. You could think there is a optimal strategy, by calculating all the probabilities and betting in such a way to maximize the expected profit. But if you did that, I could use how much you are betting to infer the quality of your hand, and play accordingly. And even if you considered that possibility, there would be another strategy I could make to counter yours. That's why poker is a bluff game, and not a simple straightforward calculation game."

by_a_pyre_light,Dallas,1388868567.0,"I don't know of *any* places in DFW that do month to month for a reasonable rate. It's just not worth it to them. They can either lock people into 12-15 month contracts for that rate, or they can do month-to-month for out of town contractors and executives at double the rate for a short period of time. 

My GF and I were in the middle of a move to Austin that got cancelled last minute after her lease was up and we had to go month-to-month. The apartment locked us into a 4 month contract by requiring a minimum 90 day notice (yeah, seriously, WTF?!) *and* jacked the rent up 50%. It was fucking ridiculous.

Since that point, I called a few places asking about short term leases because I hate long term contracts, and every answer was either none were offered and they only had 8/12/15 month leases, or the ones that offered them were ***ridiculously*** expensive.

Further, Irving and Las Colinas are expensive places right in the technology corridor. You're not going to find many cheap places to begin with, let alone with your requirements. I know, I almost moved there 2 years ago w/ a friend and we looked at about 5 places in the area.

Your best bet is to either find a 2 bedroom apartment someone is renting and split it with them, or do what I've done before and find a nice house where the owner is looking for a roommate. I've done this twice, and each time was month-to-month, all bills paid, for about $500-$650, in very nice, modern suburban houses. The added benefits of course include more space via the living room, kitchen, etc. and the houses come furnished everywhere else inside, so you have minimal expenses. Most places don't ever require any deposits or any paperwork fees, which is a $300 savings vs. apartments. "

Make sure the moisture content is about right. Bows like to be kept in the same weather humans do; leaving it in the corner of your living room for a couple weeks should be enough. 12% is ideal for most woods.

Brace one tip against the ground, hold the other tip, put your hand on the middle/handle, and flex the bow. if nothing creaks and it doesn't look like the bow is taking set/warping, get a stringer and string it up. Check the bend at brace to be sure it's bending uniformly. If the bend looks good, adjust the brace until it'd a fist and thumb high, and check the bend (tiller) again.

Exercise the limbs by drawing ten inches a couple dozen times and recheck tiller.

Twenty inches a couple dozen times and recheck tiller.

Full draw a couple dozen times and recheck tiller.

Unstring and see if the bow has taken on excessive set. A bow with a lot of set will be weaker and have a shorter functional life, but if it's uniform it isn't dangerous.

I am pretty used to having dietary restrictions and dealing with them socially-- I've been a vegetarian since I was 6 years old and have always been surrounded by meat eaters. Basically, I do what I want to do (go out, eat out, etc) while refusing to compromise, and I make it clear with everyone involved that that's my intent. For instance, if I'm invited to dinner I make it clear to whoever is making it that I have these restrictions and I offer to bring my own food, if it's too much. If they do want to make food for me, I offer to bring the more expensive ingredients (like raw organic extra virgin coconut oil). It would be the same if I were just a vegetarian going to someone's summer grill-out; I'd offer to bring my own meatless patties and ask them to throw them on for me.

As far as drinks, my team at work wanted to go out for drinks and planned it a long time ago before I went on this diet. I went and just had tea, and honestly I had a fine time. It would suck to go to a party and not drink, but... there are... other drugs in the world that one could partake in, lol. 

Don't be afraid to go out, just make it clear what your needs are and make it happen for yourself :)

Thank you! You stay strong, too! :) It's funny you say that about my cooking-- I hated cooking before I was forced to start because of my diet. Now I'm finding that I'm naturally pretty good at it, and I'm even starting to enjoy it these days. I know my boyfriend definitely is :P

Would you rather we lose 2 or 3 regular season games and get put in the Capital One Bowl? Personally, I'd rather us lose in a BCS bowl against solid competition than win in a 2nd or 3rd tier bowl against an unranked opponent.

Get over it, we lost a game. If the only acceptable outcome in a season is a perfect 14-0 or 15-0 next year then you will constantly be disappointed. If we were perfect every year then it would lose it's luster. I'm hoping you're just emotional after a tough lose and will come down in a few days but if not I feel sorry for you.

ServiceB4Self,TalesFromThePizzaGuy,1388868759.0,"Well, if someone doesn't tip on a cash order I kinda chalk it up as a loss, unfortunately, but with write in tips instead of asking them to sign it, I request that they ""fill out the top copy"", implying that there are more slots for them to write stuff in. 

When they are writing, compliment their house, dog, car, anything to make them smile. Happy people usually tip better.

Edit: also, I've found that asking how much change they want back results in lower tips. Regardless of the tone it can come off as rude (at least to some people), so I just repeat back how much change they will be getting, and start counting it out. This usually results in a ""oh just give me a dollar back"" or something similar. "

A significant part of the reason why I'm childfree is I don't want to make a lifetime commitment to someone I've never met.  If you become a parent, you have to keep your kid forever, even if they end up being a person you don't like.  Whereas with marriage, you get to know your spouse before making the commitment, so it's a far less scary and risky commitment."

Bjorn_Bear,AskMen,1388868819.0,"There is no word to describe this weird ass discrimination. It's not sexism, but it sure as hell is something.

I think saying that Men are becoming more like women because they might drive smaller cars or own a bag that they use to carry things around is just plan stupid. There is a really stupid perception that men area all Macho. That we walk around wearing our Boot-Cut jeans lifting all of the heavy objects and working the farm. Or that we're these warriors going out to battle each day, coming home to our wenches to feed them and treat them like crap.

We're not like that. We cry at movies, some of us are more nerdy and don't like to go outside and lift things. Some of us don't like to exercise. The same goes for women, they are not these creatures of ultimate sexual value, who only do house work and bear children. Women join the Military and Police, they body-build, they work in construction. 

We are both powerful sexes capable of what the other does. So, sure, Men and becoming Women and vice versa. I like to refer to it as the break down of the dumb ass gender barriers we've had for centuries. "

I think it's really easy for men or people who use and enjoy hormonal birth control to throw around ""You should be on the pill"" when it just really isn't always the ideal solution for everyone. There are many different forms of ""birth control"" and it sounds like OP, like many women, has chosen condoms, which is a completely valid choice. I understand that it didn't work out for her in this situation, but that has more to do with the guy she's seeing being an asshole than with her not choosing hormonal contraceptives"

IndependentBoof,changemyview,1388868911.0,"What's great about your CMV topic is that it is an empirical question. That is, it can be tested by science and demonstrated by evidence and it is not just subject to opinion.

With that in mind, I would like to make three key points:

* While your personal experience isn't totally irrelevant, it is an anecdote. I think you'll agree that you smoking weed for a year isn't a scientific experiment. To answer scientific questions, we should rely on scientific data and not on anecdotes, so let's not put too much emphasis on any individual's experience and concentrate on scientific data.
* You have provided a study that demonstrates negative effects of heavy use, and I'm inclined to believe it. However, is your claim that only heavy use is harmful, or that all use is harmful, or somewhere in between? Most substances will be harmful if not used consumed in moderation, even vitamins.
* Medical marijuana has been scientifically tested and shown to be helpful in several situations, as both the [Mayo clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/marijuana/background/hrb-20059701) and [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/features/medical-marijuana-uses) summarize fairly well.

1. When I was younger, all I wanted to do was fit in. In high school, clothes were how people expressed themselves. So, either you dress totally different and be seen as totally different or you buy the label everyone else has an blend in.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1388868978.0,"I think you're confusing two separate issues. To start with: yes, he has a point, a very valid point, and one that is going to find a lot of sympathy on reddit. Sex is not just an important part of a romantic relationship, it's a *crucial* part of a romantic relationship. This is a dealbreaker for him that is just as valid other non-sexual dealbreakers. If he's supposedly putting sex above his love for you by saying it's a dealbreaker, you're doing the exact same thing to him by arbitrarily asking him to promise he'd stop without any type of reason besides your own issues. 

However, it sounds like what's happening doesn't have all that much to do with sex, but instead your own insecurity in the emotional stability and strength of the relationship. I'm going to take a wild guess here, so take it with a grain of salt - I think you're projecting your own ambivilance about the relationship onto him. You say that you ""know it is more than sex for him"", that he is ""super genuine"" and that he's even a little clingy. On the other hand, you *kind of* think you *might* love him. 

Listen, it's not his view on sex *or* your view on sex that's causing the problem here. It's that you are not sure about the relationship, you're not that sure you like him all that much, and you're not sure you want to continue. So you're placing this arbitrary and irrational ""test"" in his way which gives you justification for your insecurity and lack of attachment to him.

What do you do? End the relationship, is my advice. You need time to get over your ex (it is such a red flag that you mention him so much and compare your current SO to him so much) and time to decide what you want.

But my serious answer was all about a black and white day. It was early morning in the pacific northwest, and we were heading out of Wesport, WA - through Grey's Harbor, to the open ocean. We were in a smallish, 19' boat the time. 

The day was ..strange. The fog was so thick, you could barely see a damn thing. The water was practically black because of the fog covering. The buoys in the distance weren't the kind that ring, like bells, they made this low moaning sound with the rise and fall of the Pacific swells. 

Just then, to our port side, breaking out of the fog, there came a pod of orcas. There were dozens of them, that we could see. This one, who appeared larger than most of the others, but that may have just been the circumstances, was coming straight for our small 19' boat. 

Just as he neared us (but was really more like 30 feet away - though it seemed closer), he passed beneath us. That exact moment, as I passed from one side of the boat to the other to follow him, I'm watching this black form with his white markings, barely visible in the black water. 

He passed to the other side and that exact second, the sun burned through the fog and cloud coverings, and this massive black and white form broke the surface of the now blue water into the morning sun, and it was staggering. 

I was scared and amazed all at once. I'll never forget it. "

Zero_Beat,ForeverAlone,1388869014.0,"Yeah I'd say so. I'm a black FA and I often feel like it's part of the reason why things are the way they are for me. 

Being black, people expect you to be a certain way unless proven otherwise due to the portrayal of black men in the media/society. When you aren't those things it's like you become a minority within a minority, you aren't fully accepted by the white or black community and as someone else commented here you're either 'too black or not black enough'. Most of my life people have made comments about me 'acting white' or 'sounding white' but when I happened to move to a mostly caucasian part of the country while studying, it was the total opposite, suddenly people made all sorts of assumptions about who I am and thought I would be a walking stereotype simply because I'm black. You can't win, you're always 'black' before you're simply a person with your own unique attributes.

I've noticed that the women that are interested in black guys often expect you to be this typical kind of black guy and they are probably attracted to those stereotypical traits so once they come to realise that you aren't those things they lose interest. On the other hand, women who don't like these stereotypical traits are more likely to be put off even sooner and won't even give you a chance because they instantly associate the way you look with those stereotypes. These are the types of women I would probably click with if they were willing to give me a chance because I don't portray any of these stereotypes that they find unattractive but of course first impressions are often based on looks so there's not much I can do."

Antidepressants can help you feel better but I found that they make me much more tired, it wasn't a good trade-off. But everybody is different.

When giving prayer before a meal the rest of the family adopts more traditional poses expected of them, and I simply bow my head slightly and quietly listen. I may not agree with her take on things, but it's not my place to speak to things I do not know. I appreciate the sentiments within her prayer, as they are wise and compassionate sentiments.

I may not believe in her religion, but we share many of the same sentiments towards compassion and caring. If her belief is not causing harm to her or to others, I see no reason to speak up. She is where she is in her life, and her concerns are hers. It would be egotistical of me to think I know better when I do not. When issues arise that require a helping hand, I help. I do not attempt to express that my way is correct, or that my philosophical and religious leanings are correct, only that I see the issue she is facing and I see the bias or confusion or ignorance she holds towards the state of things.

There are many things we can agree on, and our commonality is something I can embrace to ease any potential turmoil. Your family may have difficulty embracing your views, but you are still their child. You still share so many wonderful commonalities, so many likewise thoughts and well wishes towards others. It may be difficult, but by embracing what you share you can ease the way. Speak to the compassion, the generosity, the equanimity of view towards other beings, and find that at heart you are both trying to find the most wise and helpful path in your lives.

And as Goombly spoke of, if the situation is difficult due to dependent needs, be cautious. You can partake in their ceremony and ritual while being aware of the purpose of such things and not need speak of your differences. You need not declare yourself to them, yet, as it is not you that will be defining yourself as different. The orange does not declare itself to be an orange, and despite what others declare it to be it does not change the nature of the fruit.

If you'll be dependent on them for college tuition then you will probably need to tell them things eventually, but in the meantime there is no need to stir up the water. Embrace what you share, practice in your way, and show through action that despite your path you are still of their flesh and blood. Observe, and only worry about speaking of differences when a wrong view or wrong action harms. And when such a case arises, speak compassionately towards their religious viewpoint. They are trying their best, as anyone else is.

You have my hopes towards a favorable outcome, however you approach it. I know you will try the best with whatever knowledge and experience you have to proceed from."

derleth,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1388869409.0,"One thing the article gets wrong is why white-collar people don't want unions. In my own experience, the biggest concern is the concept of seniority: You can't do anything until you've put in enough years. It doesn't matter if your ideas are better, if you're new or even less old, you're shit and your opinions don't count.

That works on assembly lines, where only the executives can possibly be allowed to have ideas anyway, but when your whole job is ideas, it's fatal. It destroys the whole reason you chose the career in the first place.

Another strike against unions in white-collar work (software especially) is that some people do it for a hobby, and some hobbies compete with commercial products and win. Linux is a big example, but so are OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Firefox, Apache, and tons of software most people have never heard of but is still essential to keeping our society working. Demanding that everyone pay union dues and follow union rules to contribute to a hobby project is insane, and *not* using the best software just because it wasn't made by a union is *also* insane. **It would *give* the whole software industry to the very largest corporations, and nobody smaller would be able to compete.**"

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1388869415.0,"&gt;Do you feel that in our world feminism is fundamentally incompatible with representative legislatures because we cannot readily find an example of a non-patriarchal one?

Beside the point. Matriarchies have existed and do still exist in small enclaves of human society, but nowhere near as large and dominating as the patriarchal forces of the vast majority of today's super-powered nations.

Besides, your example misses the central point of my argument (hopefully which you did not gloss over):

&gt;Perhaps the **lack of evidence of either is not evidence** that the military is only the result of patriarchy, but **in our world it certainly is**.

The military complex of our world is a direct result of patriarchy. That's all I'm saying."

It's difficult to get in idea of what people want over the phone/internet with the modern idea that something long is a longbow. Sure, you could say that the American longbow is a legit definition of a kind of longbow, but if you're working with all kinds of designs of bows you can't call the flatbow an American Longbow because it wasn't just found in the Americas, and the oldest was found in Europe (the holmegaarde, to the best of my knowledge). Add to that the idea that a recurve is a kind of bow (which should be for certain competitions' sake) when it has for much longer been the distinct and often specially induced reflex, to any extent, in the tip of a bow, and planning a design for someone is nigh impossible.

He saw himself as a guy that does the traditional latter because that's all he's worth. So when others around where doing something else, to him it didn't make sense.

Zones (that you move through) in this game are quite large... and you will eventually end up wanting to shoot at a zombie that's sharing a zone with a survivor (a player)... but the rules state that ranged weapons shot into a survivors zone always hit a survivor first. No chance it won't. 

I get that it's trying to impart a sense of danger and anxiety, but the fact that you don't even get a *chance* to avoid hitting your friends is whacko. Some people have house ruled around that... but I think it breaks the game (moreso).

Illusions_not_Tricks,DJs,1388869657.0,"I do weddings that I get booked for through an DJ service. I wouldnt recommend that you do this wedding in particular, and you seem to know that is a good decision. If you want to learn to do weddings, if you find yourself at a wedding, take some notes on what kind of music is being played. What I usually do is talk to the bride and groom and find out what type of music they want played, and what they definitely do not want to hear. If you have any friends that DJ weddings maybe ask if you can tag along with them and take some notes and just observe.

I then make up anywhere from 5 to 10 playlists consisting of 6-10 songs depending on how long I am booked and usually just start from the top and maybe skip certain songs if it feels like it would kill the vibe/momentum youve built with the crowd. I work requests in as I can (as long as they generally go along with what Im playing). 

So really, I dont think weddings are a very hard event to DJ, but you also have to be able to MC pretty well and introduce the wedding party, do announcements, etc. It really involves a bit of communication with the bride and groom, some and some planning ahead as to what youre going to play/what you are going to say."

Strippers are pigeon holed for a reason, they have nothing i want, but i have what they want (employment etc)

I openly and happily will dismiss and ignore strippers, from either paid employment (when applicable), or from any opinion or impact in anything else.

Being a stripper is like being an ex-con, seriously undermines your credibility and allows others to save time by dismissing what you say and think without having to actually bother listening to you

The difference between me and them is that, if i dismiss them, there is no real world impact or disadvantage to me or society, if they dismiss me, there is a real world impact to them and society.

A stripper is dependant and needs a doctor far more than a doctor needs a stripper, the doctor therefore doesn't consult or ask for a strippers opinion or view, because ""who cares"""

cmagnificent,books,1388869723.0,"I seriously want you to name me a single book that glorifies cancer. Go ahead and take your time. Find me a single book that makes having cancer seem like a good thing. Especially child cancer.

The only point I'll make about TFiOS is that is *fucking easy* to get tears and 'heartfelt' responses from people when you write about child cancer. If you look at my comment below, you'll see that I read TFiOS when a young relative of mine had leukemia. Well, she sadly lost the fight and after I heard, I posted a tiny little blurb on the organizations facebook page (Miracle For Marleigh) as a tribute and for weeks I had people telling me how much it moved them. This happened at the beginning of December and at Christmas eve with that side of the family, I had people coming up to me, my parents, my sister, pulling us aside and telling them how much my three sentences meant to them. I felt like the biggest fraud in the world because it took literally zero effort and less than 90 seconds. I'm glad that so many people enjoyed my words so much, but again, it is stupid fucking easy to get tears and jerk around people's emotions when talking about kids with cancer.

I could write a 1000 word short story in the next twenty to thirty minutes about childhood cancer that would make people cry. It's not that hard. I honestly find TFiOS and books like TFiOS personally offensive because people are taking the pain and suffering of others and turning it into dollar signs for themselves.

It's right up there with the story of the young girl who was sexually abused by her alcoholic father slowly coming to terms with herself and being able to live in her own skin. The second you say 'alcoholic father' you already have everyone in the palms of your hand unless they're a sociopath.

Write a story that makes me cry for that alcoholic child molester father. That's a challenge as a writer. That's hard. Try and make me weep for a monster. Or try and make me cry for the drug addict homeless bum. Our natural reaction as people is to say 'well he brought it on himself' and overturning would be hard. These would be hard stories to write. These would be *interesting and worthwhile* stories to read.

Again, I generally like John Green, he's not the best, but I utterly and deeply despise TFiOS and everything it stands for. It's terrible, it should not exist, John Green should feel ashamed that he wrote it and the people behind the current film adaptation should feel doubly so."

chronic_raptor,crossdreaming,1388869796.0,"Yeah, since puberty there's maybe been one or two times where crossdreaming fantasies weren't part of sexual play.  And those times I was trying *very hard* to find something else.

Sometimes the simple idea of being a woman is arousing, but more often than not, it's simply a precursor to (IMO) normal female arousal.  I've been sexually active with a few girls, and although the experiences are enjoyable and somewhat arousing, I have to be miles away in my head to actually get anywhere.

The idea and practice of penetrative sex from a male end does nothing for me.  I've tried a little bit of anal play, and while the idea is exciting, the actual sensation is lackluster.

And for a good part of my life, I was okay with this.  I just figured I had a weird kink or fetish or whatever, and that it was separate from whatever the ""rest of me"" was.  It wasn't until I actually started exploring the idea of transition that I figured out what I really wanted from life.  It caused me a lot of anxiety--trying to figure out if this was due to some kind of sexual fetish.  It still does in fact, especially when arguing with certain people in this forum who have certain theories that seek to redefine my identity.

But the fact is that it's not an inherently sexual thing for me.  I find that being a woman and interacting with society brings a much deeper and broader satisfaction, and it's one that feels far-removed from sexual arousal.  The release that crossdreaming has given me was very helpful for a long time, and while it still satisfies sexual cravings for the time being, they've begun to transition (with me) towards an eventual and inherent feminine body image.

In my mind, crossdreaming provides a bridge between my body image and my ingrained sexual fantasies.  It allows me to fulfill that role, even through the depression that my body gives to me.  And as my body image tends more and more toward the feminine, I feel less and less as though I don't belong in these fantasies.

**Edit:**  Forgot to mention about dysphoria.  I didn't consider myself dysphoric in the past, but reevaluating can really shed new light on things.  Those days when I would get really depressed because I thought I had to be a man for the rest of my life?  Those moments when I'd catch myself staring at a girl, not in lust, but jealousy?  The times when I held back tears, displays of other emotions, mannerisms, etc.?  The self-loathing that I harbored in my teen years because I thought ""God"" hated me?  They all fall under that category now, whereas before I just considered myself a ""sensitive"" guy.  It has everything to do with framing, and you're welcome to do the same thing to yourself in either direction.  I've just finally figured out that there's a **name** for the pain and depression I've felt over the last decade and a half."

Btw, very happy to see you love fruits.  I remember showing a friend how you can buy cheap, ripe fruits in bulk in Chinatown.  We each got 10 peaches for $2!  Finished mine in less than a week.  Visited her home 2 weeks later and found most of her peaches rotting from that shopping trip :("
esayer,Art,1388869806.0,"I think a few of you could us a bit of an art history lesson.  Roy Lichtenstein might not have been the father of comic books, but he did invent the dot painting technique, where he used an eraser dipped in paint, that he popularized in the 60s. Now, there are thousands of artists and street artists who copy his style.  He is as, if not more, influential than Andy Warhol in the Pop Art movement.

It took me a few months to get comfortable with squatting in general though. I did a lot of bodyweight squats and third world squatting (just hanging out in a squat position) to train my muscle memory/flexibility, and that helped a lot. 

Anyway, try high bar if you want. I still do all three (high/low/front) because I like variety, but low is my main one I focus on for progression."

IndependentBoof,technology,1388869877.0,"I wouldn't say ""absolutely"" because we're talking about a hypothetical environment.

For example, you cite higher dangers of motorcyclists dying in crashes. Yes, that is true in the current highway environment. However, studies have consistently found that most fatal crashes involving motorcycle riders are caused by the car/truck drivers (and often because they do not see the motorcycle). If I recall, these rates have gone up as using cell phones while driving has become more common. If you imagine a scenario where the only car/truck drivers are on ""auto-pilot"" and are aware of motorcycles on the road, then you might hypothesize that riding motorcycles will become much safer than it is now once you take human car/truck drivers out of the equation.

With that said, one part you are definitely right about is that if there's a smaller pool of people who need ""manually driving"" car insurance (assuming this will be distinguished from ""automatic driving car insurance""), insurance rates will go up because there will be fewer people paying premiums."
tallavery,aww,1388869883.0,"I was mauled by a pit bull while out on a run five years ago.

Fortunately, a loving young pit bull came into my life last year and changed everything.

There are bad dogs out there. There are NOT bad breeds out there.

My dog is not cool with small furry things that run -- or at least he thinks it's his job to catch them. Humans can squish him, kiss him, pull his tail or ears and even call him bad names and he's gentle and polite with them.

I would not allow a young child near any dog without close supervision. Dogs are animals and sometimes weird things trigger them. Cats are the same way. I am in the best position to understand your current breed bias, but I do hope over time you will come to feel more like I do. Bad dogs are bad, and it is unfair and inaccurate to condemn one breed for something a single dog did."

ronearc,AskReddit,1388869979.0,"I used to love to tell ghost stories. Mostly, it was just a lark, something among friends, but one night...I nearly scared us all to death. 

We'd walked to the end of the blacktop road that I lived down. It was a brisk, fall evening - unseasonably cool for North East Texas. 

As we reached the end of the road that I lived down, myself and my 5 friends, we stopped at the private fence there and were about to turn around. I then suggested that, instead, we turn right and follow this raised dirt path through the woods. 

Having nothing better to do, they were in, so we were off. The moon was peaking through to thick tree cover over head, being obscured only now and then by a few clouds. But as we walked and talked, a bit more cloud cover came on and the night turned darker and felt colder. 

Then, I noticed one of the old crossties lying in the ditch to our right, about 20 feet below the road bed upon which we were walking. I pointed it out and mentioned that, back in the day - turn of the century - this had been a functional railroad. 

I started to spin this yarn about a ghost train - the remnants of a horrific accident that occurred right around here when the train derailed. If you look around, you can see the shattered cross ties and remnants of the old tracks in the ditches and the woods around this area. This was per-Ghostbusters II, so to these guys, this was an original story. 

I then went on to explain how, the track was abandoned and never repaired, because it was haunted and everyone knew it. Efforts to repair it were abandoned after the workers reported that ghost train, rolling through every night at midnight. 

Of course, I knew, it was getting close to midnight. 

I piled it on thick too. I described the sound of the train tearing through the woods, the rush of it, the blinding light on the front, and the terrible commotion of that ghostly apparition ripping a hole through the very fabric of our reality with its passing. 

Just then, the dark of night was split by a blinding light coming from in front of us. There was a terribly loud, almost screaming, metal rending sound that shook the forest, and the light was getting closer. 

Well, we did what any teenagers might do, we turned and hauled ass, screaming as loudly as we could. We didn't slow down until we were back on the blacktop road and the 'danger' had passed without harming any of us. 

We were freaked the fuck out though...

The next day, in the local paper, there was a story about a 737 that had to divert over the north-western edge of our town, so it could perform an emergency landing at an all-but-defunct military field a few miles from our home - the only field in the vicinity large enough for a jet-liner. 

My ghost train story was a big hit, but I never told it again. There's no way I could have beat the serendipity of that first telling. "

**These are the assumptions**:

* Banks don't work on weekends.
* When fiat (£/$/whatever) is deposited in - on a weekday - the trader in question *will* trade their money almost immediately.

**Therefore...**

* On the weekend, the trader in question won't be able to trade their fiat for BTC because they don't have any fiat in their exchange account. 
* So the trader decides to sell some of his bitcoin to free up more fiat to trade with. Many traders do this (perhaps causing a feedback loop) in quick succession, dropping the price over the weekend.
* Come Monday/Tuesday, money has been deposited in exchange accounts from banks and trade picks up again.
* By Wednesday and slower banks have deposited fiat funds into trader's exchange accounts. On that day we see lots of trading due to this new-found liquidity and lots of enthusiasm as people start buying again.

Check out this [graph](http://i.imgur.com/ggnZdLy.png) of the change of ""Bitcoin Number of Transactions Excluding Popular Addresses"" over the last 3 months or so. There are a few anomalous data points, but that's because of some major event happening on the day.

Another thing! Check this [one](http://i.imgur.com/dD9zg8P.png) out. Change in Market price (orange) and Change in Bitcoin Number of Transactions Excluding Popular Addresses (green). There's something to be said here but I actually need to get on with more pressing work, so I'll leave commentary on that to you.

I'll leave one last explanation. Why am I using Transactions w/out popular addresses? Because I believe the most popular ones are gambling sites/exchanges/pools and obfuscate the actual movements of traders (Also, I believe that the *vast* majority of bitcoin transactions are for financial gain because let's face it, the typical layman bitcoin transaction is for market trading rather than payment).

EDIT: I proposed this idea with my work friend [nearly a month ago](http://i.imgur.com/KeXezNB.png) (although I'm sure better minds came up with it even before then)!

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1388870115.0,"""Gender"" privilege, which is what we are talking about, is an overarching theme and not really broken down into individual cases. We do not say ""Women"" have privilege here and ""Men"" have privilege here, but rather we focus on the entire cultural circumstances and weigh the overall cultural, social, and governmental circumstances regarding gender privilege. In almost the entirety of the world, gender privilege is for men.

So, no.

In cases of prejudice and hate targeted towards certain men for certain things, feminists generally support their causes, but take caution when they are propositioned to act as a feminist for a certain cause since it is the responsibility of those people to form their own support groups and philosophies, because:

1. independence and self-sufficiency is awesome 
2. feminism is specifically about fighting for raising women to equal status of men although it often overlaps with many other issues regarding prejudice 
3. but that does not make feminism culpable for not focusing on all issues egalitarian, and men shouldn't be blaming feminists for not also fighting for their causes anyway"

I told my fiance after he proposed and we went to look at rings that I did not need something that cost a ton of money because I would rather us put that kind of money towards our future together, we found rings that were about the same price each and paid for each others rings which I think is also a custom that needs to happen more in my opinion.

I suppose not, but I don't think im qualified to answer that tbh.

This was sorta my point. Without meaning or purpose its just mindless pornography that serves no purpose other than to get a larger chunk of the pubescent male market. It doesn't need to be in the game. 

When I see a game with [this](http://i.imgur.com/edL1Z60.jpg)  I know that I am not their demographic. They don't want me playing me that game. They want children. 

I am not saying a scantily clad anime character in a video game is not art, no. I'm sure there is someone who can appreciate it. But a pixie wearing a g-string has no artistic value to me beyond giving my inner 13 year old a boner. And as I said, I'm not 13 anymore. So I can easily go without it, I don't need it, I dont seek it and I don't want it.

This is true for a lot of species, not just people.

This is also true for straight people and their reaction to pheromones of someone of the opposite sex. Gay people on average have little reaction to pheromones of the opposite sex, and straight people have little reaction to pheromones of the same sex. Basically, something malfunctions (for lack of a better word) that changes the way that they respond to different pheromones.

Amonette2012,aion,1388870501.0,"Well, a lot has changed. To really get an idea of what has been added, I'd check out the 3.0 and 4.0 patch notes, as there is a lot of new stuff.

There are still arenas, plus a lot more open world pvp at high level, dredgeon etc. 

So in the last two years we've seen five new areas, initially sarpan and tiamaranta which were added at 3.0, and now three new areas for 65 (the names differ between NA and EU but here it's North and South Katalam and Katalam Underground, not sure of the US names). There are two new classes, bard and gunner, new levels on crafting skills which are mostly shite, way more instances and solo instances and things like mounts and housing. 

There are new arenas - I don't know how much you remember about them but as well as the 1v1 there is now a 3v3, and of course the 1v1v1v1 which isn't very popular. Dredgeon goes up to 60, after that there is a new pvp instance set in Sarpan. 

If you're at 49 you're in a good position to level hold at 50 for a couple of weeks, so you can get back into PvP while you're at the top of your level bracket. Everything below 50 has been nerfed, so a lot of the group quests you have you can probably solo. This is what I would suggest - when you get to 50 bind somewhere high up and suicide the xp off to keep you at 50 until you've gotten the feel of your class and gained a little ap for stigmas. I'm not sure everyone would agree with this tactic, as you could just bumble your way up until you get the hang of it and gear up at 65 (which is now easy thanks to a new gear set you can earn tokens for between 61-65), but personally I'd go with the slower route to get your skills back in pvp while you're at a lower level.

Feel free to ask more specific questions!"
fortuna_spins_you,AskMen,1388870502.0,"When going to a club, maybe women dress in what they think looks good on them and makes them feel sexy. For example, there is a reason a lot of women like to wear black dresses. They are flattering. They don't get as dirty. But I can guarantee you that in a club, all those women wearing black dresses are wearing different black dresses.

As someone who once wore flip-flops out and got called out on it, if wearing ""high heels"" is following the herd, what are my other options?

And... men do the same thing! That is how fashion goes for the most part."

Second, I was not in a relationship with a guy when I got into this phase. Why would you assume that I would suddenly lose attraction to someone I was already attracted to or loved? I never said that, nor has that ever happened to me. I don't decide that I'm suddenly not attracted to someone because of their gender. I'm interested in that person for who they are. And I know and love their gender as part of them. But I can and have been more interested in different genders at different times *outside* of a relationship. "

This subreddit may have been hijacked by AAP, but if you read what the ""common"" Indian is thinking, just read the comments section of any of the MSM websites. It's completely pro Modi (not even BJP). And I'm glad for that because AAP supporters seem to be much worse than the right wing BJP.

No, why the hell would I care.

Your friends *living* with girlfriends do this? That's so absurd. If they're so shy, just turn on the shower, poop, and take a shower.

His goofiness was never really given a chance. If Dwight smiled at any point during a loss, media (ESPN) went crazy. This kid is on a Kobe-less, massively injured Lakers. He's also not expected to bring the Lakers a ring this year. Not to mention Swaggy P isn't threatened by being on Kobe's team. I'm not sure if that bothered Dwight, but I doubt there's a power struggle with Young.

Lyn_Never,TwoXChromosomes,1388870611.0,"If she had something orally-transferrable like chlamydia, you could catch that from oral sex.  It's probably fairly low on the list of concerns unless she had an incredibly incompetent STD check in October.

However, bleeding only after penetration (or similar disruption), particularly without pain, can be a symptom of some very serious things.  Those things can wait until Monday, but should wait no longer than next week.  It could also be nothing, so...  I mean, life with a vagina is like this sometimes, it does alarming things and sometimes it's nothing and sometimes it's not.  But someone qualified needs to look at her cervix as soon as is reasonably possible.

I'm not sure what this has to do with the relationship, though.  No, you should probably not put anything in there until she gets cleared by a doctor because you don't want to be aggravating a medical condition, but that is not a major relationship event to forego penetration for a few days (also, if it's a minor thing, it's more likely to heal if you leave it alone for a little while).

If you're wondering about the relationship should this turn out to be a very big deal, I wouldn't borrow trouble.  See what's up and figure it out from there."

Here is a child who brutally stabs grown men to death in a fit of rage, thinking of them as animals, but I never noticed the same attitude come from him until he first turned in to a titan. Those are both very different situations in terms of the emotions they would elicit from the average person. Also, if memory serves, Eren's dad was like ""Son, you could have died. Don't take risks like that!"" when what I was thinking was more along the lines off ""You stabbed him maybe twenty times when just once or twice would suffice. How could a child that seems otherwise normal be capable of that?"" This one event, to me, feels at odds with everything else about Eren.

Kinda sorta. You won't be able to intern at Dropbox or Twitter but you'll be able to intern *somewhere*. You should take the time to improve your GPA, especially for next summer. GPA is only important when it's bad -- when it's good or above a certain threshold, it's considered a non-issue.

One thing for you to consider with internships is how much you (as a student) will love having spending money. Starting the school year with a few thousand bucks of discretionary funds is really valuable. Seriously, you should feel bad for the lazy kids who never get internships and can't afford to go on a date while they're in school.

The most important thing you can have in your portfolio is passion. Project Euler is great if math is your thing. I have a friend who does research at the NSA and he was absolutely addicted to Project Euler while he was making his portfolio. I also know people who make games in their spare time -- not huge things, just little proofs of concept. Another person I know is contributing to the Rust programming language. Do whatever works for you, but whatever you do make sure you do it a lot."

frsp,DebateReligion,1388870914.0,"&gt; Why do you hold your view?

Because man is a religious and spiritual being.

&gt;Well, as an existentialist Stirner is an intellectual precursor to me, especially considering how Nietzsche helped me get out of my existential crisis.

Stirner was kind of a dickhead, though. But, were I an atheist, I'd be very inclined to agree with his theories of egoism and social institutions being merely spooks.

Woody Allen is my existential medicine, since the topic is in the air.

&gt;In that case, would you consider making a stem cell culture, dividing them in 127:1 proportion, using those 127 for research and 1 for implantation (pregnancy) correct? What about 1 for research and 127 for implantation?

Artificial fertilization and implantation violates the natural law in its own way, but it's certainly not as grave as abortion.

&gt;I'm often accused of making those.

You could do a lot worse.

&gt;Many animals play, mourn and laugh. Everything we do can be explained by either a function for such material needs, or a byproduct of such functions.

Religion is a useless (Hellenically speaking) activity, however. It exists for its own end and does not necessarily go back to material needs. If it did, religious phenomena such as asceticism, monasticism, ""dark night of the soul"", and such would be very difficult to explain.

&gt;(I've been actually researching symbolic thought in chimpanzees for a good while since I began this paragraph, so even if just a slice shows, this has moved me to deeper investigation of our closest living cousins)

They're certainly much closer to humans than an ant, but not completely.

&gt;Care to define art?

Aesthetic expressions that objectify human values. Abstract nonsense is not art, though it might be nice to look at.

frsp,DebateReligion,1388871241.0,"&gt; I understand from most of the Christian denominations that the big point of coming into this life is to prove to god that you accept him and his son in some way, shape or form. Depending on denomination this may be as savior, or some other stuff.

The purpose of human life is eudaimonia and this is fulfilled through virtue, but human nature is weakened through sin. This is why we need Jesus. 


&gt;I'm pretty sure an embryo or fetus is not able to accept or know about these concepts, let alone accept them, hence he, she or it has not proven to god that he, she or it is accepted in heaven or not. It may or may not be accepted into heaven depending on which denomination you believe, but not according to all (funny how that works).

As a Catholic, the Church teaches that we entrust dead babies to the mercy of God. Theologians have speculated that people who have not reached the age of reason prior to death may be enlightened at the moment of death and be able to make a rational decision.

&gt;Also, please, I am engaging in a healthy debate, no reason to fall back to ad hominem attacks in order to get some moral high ground.

Just in general you're gonna have the most fun if you stretch it to around 2 weeks (although it can be done in as little as 4 or 5 days) and give yourself a very loose flexible schedule/route. The trip is the most fun when you can stay an extra day here and there or keep going and cover extra ground depending on your mood that day. Also, along those lines, know a few places you definitely want to go but don't be afraid to leave a lot of room for sleeping at whatever random state park is an hour down the road. I like to just look for green squares on my gps that are the right distance away and just show up. Finally, it'll be much more interesting if you stick mostly to state highways rather than interstates, if your gonna just ride 40 or 70 the whole way you might as well fly. That said, really watch out for small town cops, they love to make you leave a pocketful in the middle of nowhere for doing like 10 over the speed limit or rolling a stop sign. Similarly, if your a pot smoker be very careful in some states and go wild in others, do your research on the issue and definitely don't smoke in the car within a day of Utah or Arizona or Kansas to name a few. Hope this helps and I'd be totally excited to give you more specific advice if you've got questions."

Seeing as I wasn't exactly emotionally attached to the guy, I decided that I wasn't quite cut out to teach someone the ropes if they weren't interested in learning so I stopped talking to him. Had I developed an actual connection with him, who knows things might have been different but as it stood, I had nothing to lose and I felt that letting him go early before he developed feeling was the best decision.

They will just reduce your taxes owing. Then if your employer deducted income tax at source, you would get the difference between that amount and your taxes owing.

They will reduce taxes owing by 19,500 (15% of 130,000).

People always confuse credits and deductions. Deductions reduce taxable income and credits reduce taxes owing. Look at Schedule 1 of a T1 return and the credits should make more sense.

The biggest reason that people cite for this is the separation of church and state

Qoute from this link : [http://churchesandtaxes.procon.org/?gclid=CMuM44u65bsCFbA7Mgodb2EAVg](http://churchesandtaxes.procon.org/?gclid=CMuM44u65bsCFbA7Mgodb2EAVg) 

&gt; Proponents argue that a tax exemption keeps the government out of church finances and thus upholds the separation of church and state. They say that churches deserve a tax break because they provide crucial social services, and that 200 years of church tax exemptions have not turned America into a theocracy.

Just to add to this a little bit the tax exemption also enforces the idea that the church can't / shouldn't lobby or influence politics since they are financially stakeless in the system. 

also this points for some history on this: 

&gt; The first recorded tax exemption for churches was during the Roman Empire, when Constantine, Emperor of Rome from 306-337, granted the Christian church a complete exemption from all forms of taxation following his conversion to Christianity circa 312.

So just from those 2 qoutes we can see its a mix of  trying to keep the church and state separate and a matter of not wanting to charge your religion/god money.

esayer,Art,1388871663.0,"A) If he did have assistants help with some of the paintings, (which I doubt) artists throughout the history of time have use assistants.  You think Michaelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel by himself? B) You are over simplifying Lichtenstein. He painted for over 60 years and was one of the most influential painters of our time.  He also experimented with several styles before settling on the comic book style, and even then kept refining and experimenting with subject matter.  ""The essence of Lichtenstein’s procedure lay in the enlargement and unification of his source material, whether its original purpose was to tell a story or sell a consumer product, on the basis of strict artistic principles. This involved a strengthening of the formal aspects of the composition, a stylization of the motif and a ‘freezing’ of both emotion and action. At its most extreme, for example in Tension (1964; Paris, M. Boulois priv. col.), the process of formalization, combined with one’s awareness that the motif is only a segment of a larger narrative, transforms the image into a virtual abstraction. By such means Lichtenstein emphasized that comic strips and advertisements were not realist, as is often assumed, but highly artificial pictures that convey their messages with a sparing use of pictorial conventions. A constant if restrained irony and a gentle sense of humour contribute just as much to the cheerful lightness of Lichtenstein’s work as the balanced, completely harmonious composition.
By enlarging his source material, Lichtenstein emphasized the banality and emptiness of his motifs as an equivalent to the impersonal, mechanized style of drawing. This led to speculation as to his intended criticism of modern industrial America. The formalization and irony could be taken to support such a theory, but Lichtenstein ultimately would appear to accept the environment as revealed by his reference material as part of American capitalist industrial culture."""

When carbon is put into your soda its done under pressure to force the gas into the liquid. When you drink that fizzy drink the gases now come out of the liquid with the same amount of force that put them into it. 

So what you have is little pressure bubbles suddenly building and expanding tiny nooks and crannies in your body, thereby stretching them. If you stretch tissue suddenly that has been at rest for a while you might get pain sensations (think of what happens when you stretch your ligaments there is pain there too). 

At least thats my theory on it without any real research so take all of the above with a grain of salt. "

He runs into him while getting his robes on his birthday with Hagrid, and instantly dislikes him. Then he finds out all the other stuff and it solidified."
bluetick_,AskMen,1388872010.0,"Think about it. 20 years ago, young people still had relationships, still had dates, still made plans, still connected with each other *all without the constant use of phones.* Flash forward, we rely wayyy too heavily on that communication. We don't leave enough up to general trust. I don't need to know what you do all day, and you me. I'll see you when I see you. When we get together to experience actual face-to-face communication, we can connect and talk about all those things like people have been doing for thousands of years before iPhones. Texting is such a fucking chore some times and if you ask any man in a relationship ""have you ever had an argument started over a misconstrued text message?"" I promise you will get a sea of rolling eyes. It is the most hands off (no pun intended) form of communication and the most simple message can be taken a 1,000 different ways because there is no body language, tone, context, etc. 

A great example of this are text sentences that end with a ""."" and those that don't. HUGE different right, women are really good at using the period as a form of passive-aggressive cannon fodder. I fucking hate that and would rather avoid it. Not to say you do this OP, but past girlfriends pulled that card and it made me want to stop texting altogether. But you can't because you are roped into a ""text conversation"". Now you're in too deep. Stopping the texting leads to problems all its own. It's a goddamn mess sometimes and it's avoidable.

I'm like you OP, I recently started talking to a girl though I don't think it is ""dating"" per se. We usually do not text just to text, instead it is a means of basic plan-making and I'm more than ready to talk to her when I see her. I think it builds anticipation for our interactions. I think about her more because we aren't constantly checking in with each other. I wonder what she is doing, how her day went, etc. during the day. If your new SO is still making plans with you, he is probably thinking the same things. It's healthy IMO.

Plus, I think your new bf is wanting to set a precedent. Better to establish early that he isn't much of a texter than to start off like Tommy Two-Thumbs and eventually wane in his texting activity, worrying you tremendously and leading you to post in AskMen ""He doesn't text me as much as he used to..

I normally don't read comments on the MSM websites (I've Disqus blocked), but I was curious after this downvoting started and went ahead to see if there's a change in perception among the general public of this country after the Delhi elections. Nope, it was very minimal, and in fact, I've usually seen AAP supporters getting downvoted there in those articles.

Though I'm a BJP supporter for 2014, I've been critical when they've fucked up. And I've only offerred balanced criticism against AAP. Even then, I was downvoted. So surely, there's an AAP vote brigading too that's happenning."

bombeater,changemyview,1388872160.0,"&gt; Well, basically, yeah. Welcome to human interaction 101.

Well, basically, that sucks, and there's absolutely no reason that we, as a society, can't decide to change it.

Several discussions are going on here. One of them is the debate on whether or not it is morally legitimate to pull a girl who just broadcast her disinterest in physical contact into your lap as long as she doesn't have a negative response.

What you're saying about ""human interaction 101"" is irrelevant to that specific debate. 200 years ago, slavery was ""human interaction 101"". The fact that something is expected or socially condoned does not mean that it's morally or ethically sensible.

Your comment about what is ""more respectful"" is a good one, and it plugs into the point I'm trying to make: the way we decide what constitutes ""respectful enough"" is determined in very large part by ""human interaction 101"": widely-accepted social expectations that are ingrained in our culture. The point I'm going for is not that pulling a standoffish girl into your lap is *currently* considered unreasonable, but that it *should* be, and that anyone who respects the feelings of other human beings should be able to see why.

In other words: Why is OP's desire to touch that girl more ""reasonable"" than the girl's desire to not be touched?"

The problem is the assumption that competition will always drive down prices, and that the price drop will be enough for everyone to be able to afford medical care.

To relate to the physics analogy, competition always puts downward pressure on prices at the very least.  It's true that it may not be enough to drive prices downward if there are other forces putting sufficient upward pressure on the prices.  Still, there is no real-world example I can think of in which more competition has put upward pressure on prices.

&gt;it also seems to assume that people will always have a choice... which is certainly not true when you have a burst appendix.

Okay? So what.

&gt;Because these prototypical guys who are ""blue pill"" and ""oppressed"" in LTR relationships, are looking at relationships from a perspective of ""how can I get her to love me?"" instead of ""I love her."". It isn't a sacrifice if it's the second case.

Irrelevant whether or not you think you're sacrificing or ""doing it because I love her"". End result is the same. 

&gt;These selfless acts, when reciprocated, are some of what makes life engaging with a significant other.

Sure, it might buy you temporary happiness. I would agree with that. 

But now what? That now becomes the standard of what she ""expects"". She can't go back, she will only push for more. And now that she's used to getting her way, it will only magnify. You don't fight you battles around the essentials, you fight them at the fringes.

&gt;It isn't that women are the problem. It's the person expecting to find happiness in a relationship that's the problem.

It's both. Guys act a certain way expecting one thing, but because aren't what he thinks, he gets something else.

I've never seen you around here. Lurk more if you're still swallowing and don't understand TRP yet.

Omegaile,changemyview,1388872687.0,"First of all let me say that if you make an assertion, you probably know better how did you find out about it then me, that are reading this for the first time. Maybe you remember which website you read it. Maybe you remember some details that could be put on to google.

Once there was a guy who was trying to convince me that there was some sort of conspiracy. I asked for a source. He gave me some very tangential information, that could be explained by multiple things other than a conspiracy. I read it. Wasn't convinced. Let it go. If (assuming that I took him seriously) I decided to google myself, I would have found equally useless info, and would have kept trying to find something, probably without success. And one could always say that the sites I went wasn't good enough. On the other hand, if he gave me the source, then I know that's enough for him. If it didn't convince me, then there is nothing else this guy can do to convince me.

Other time, someone said that countries where prostitution is legal tend to have more cases of human traffic for sexual exploitation. I was very skeptic, googled a bit, didn't find anything and asked for a source. The guy gave me, I looked, didn't read the whole thing, just skimmed and looked at the graphics/tables. And, although it had some data gathering problems, it indeed was evidence for the affirmative. Enough to change my mind.

&gt;You damn well know that all I'm going to do is Google whatever I was talking about and post the top link anyway

Yeah, it's really pointless if you do this, which is why you shouldn't. Asking for source is not for when the subject is easy to find.

I know that what I gave here was mostly anecdotal evidence, but I think it touches on one of your problems. You seem to give much attention into what most people do, by measuring upvotes for example when you say:

&gt;Just look at how dodgy top links on worldnews and TIL are. The top comments usually refute the 1500+ voted post by saying ""your post doesn't say that"".

And while I agree that most people won't dig up the sources, some people will, and providing non trivial source whenever possible is advisable."

The internal monologue of the person being coerced should not and can not have anything to do with determining whether an action was ""wrong"" or ""right"". If the only difference between the two scenarios is that in one case the OP regretted his decision after the fact, then it does not change whether what the girl did was ok. Either she was ok in trying to convince him to do it, or she should have never tried in the first place, knowing that he may regret it after. Take your pick.

Now, if the girl *had* somehow coerced him, like by threatening to spread nasty rumors, that would be a different scenario. However, that's not what the person you were replying to was asking. He was asking whether, given the exact same scenario, the OP feeling coerced  after the fact would make this rape."

I was devastated and thought about quitting but didn't since I could mostly avoid her dept., well, my boss didn't know we had broken up and about 3 weeks after we had an opening in my dept. and he transferred her to it (he admitted he was trying to be GG boss and let us see each other at work since we kept it professional there), she was supposed to be working directly under me and I had to train her, it was awful. After about 2 weeks I was about to quit but she didn't show up for 2 days in a row to work (strict no show policy where I work) and my boss fired her that day. Those 2-3 weeks were the closest thing to hell I could imagine."

We can probably safely assume that, if 61% of all dog attacks reported in the media were committed by pit bulls, at least 50% of all fatal dog attacks were committed by pit bulls (less that 5% of the US dog population). 

To be fair, there is a skew: a large number of the dogs in the US are essentially incapable of killing a human (dachshunds come to mind). That being said, the proportion of fatalities committed by pit bulls is the cause for the breed being maligned. "

CheekyLittleCunt,yugioh,1388873024.0,"There's another TG card that shuffles TGs from your grave into the deck to draw cards. I'd probably play 1 because if it ever gets to late game, you'll run out of monsters. It's also chainable and can be used midgame. 

I would also try maining or siding a grand mole, it's annoying spot removal. 

How's shard of greed working out? When I play the deck I play triple upstart (but mainly because I play triple upstart in everything). 

Have you tried Beast King Barbaros? 

I'd also side  the seven tools in order to make room for 3 Forbidden Lance. It gets you past crap like BTH and Prison better as it can be used the turn you draw it, but also acts as as a good ATK modifier to help you run over more monsters.  Seven tools is a good side choice though, especially game two as it helps you get past things like trap stun. Also find some space for book of moon. 


Your side deck doesn't seem too well equipped for this meta. I would side 3 Banisher of the Raidiance, a Macro, Soul Drain and  D-Fissure. It might affect your deck negatively, but shutting down a whole mermail deck is better. Against spellbook you need to side in the Banishers and the Macros and also Mistake. Once again, negatively affects your deck but shuts down your opponents deck? Worth siding. 

You need to be prepared for evilswarm Exciton knight when every opponent tries to pull it out. Hence side in veilers and fiendish chain. (Fiendish chain is more fragile but will keep the Exciton in check during your Battle phase too) 

Fire ferret is a great choice for the side too. Harpies (and hunting ground) will screw you over. Think of siding dust tornado and definitely Mind Crush (will help against bujins too). 

That's all I can think of for now. I'm a longtime T.G. Stun player :)

Let's say that your theory plays out. The U.S. starts adopting countries left and right. First, it's Madagascar; they see the benefits, they beg, and we accept. We realize that they have an excellent resource, and we're keen to accept them into the country. You now just inherited all of Madagascar's issues. The grinding and abject poverty, the bloodshed, all of it. Your navy will now have to allocate resources to help them out. Your army will have to put boots on the ground to stop the bloodshed. 

But the U.S. is big, so what's the big deal? Our army is massive. It should have no issue cleaning up Madagascar. But it isn't just Madagascar. Let's use the countries that you mention. Greece, an economic failure, has citizens that expect certain standards of living that we, as Americans, cannot provide for them. I don't think that acquiring Taiwan would bode well with its unfriendly neighbor, China. Unless you'd like to embark in an all-out war with China, I suggest you leave Taiwan alone.

You want the U.S. to eventually take over everything? Do you see the issue with one singular entity ruling over everyone? It gets its way. The reason you hear of all this talk about stopping Wal-Mart from taking over the precious ""small businesses"" is because **choice, as you currently know it, will vanish into thin air once you support Wal-Mart by purchasing an orange that is $0.10 cheaper instead of purchasing one at a local produce store simply because of the immediate benefits of the $0.10 more affordability.**

The U.S. government will, in your world, eventually become the choice that you have. Waging war? You're in. Death penalty for minors re-established? You better not commit a crime. Marijuana re-criminalized once more? Burn all of your marijuana before the police come and get you. You will eventually have to abide by whatever your overlord tells you, as you don't have the freedom to leave.

**The moral of the story: the world is so delicately sanctioned and partitioned for a reason. Disrupting this is not easy, and it might be impossible to do so.** Even if it weren't impossible, it would still bring mass misery to every citizen of this singular government. Britain, a country that was once an insanely powerful superpower, has lost dozens of its once-owned lands, for example."

A misguided understanding of human nature deriving both from specific socio-cultural traditions as well as a general tendency to understand others’ behavior as a product solely of their essence, their soul, as opposed to a more complicated combination of environmental and individual forces.""](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=psychological-power-satan)

personally, i don't see our human ability to make choices as evidence of some supernatural version of myself who gets to decide which of my thoughts turn into actions and which do not.  genes and external environmental circumstance determine how my brain and body auto-process the world.

i also don't see anything incredibly important about the fact that i don't have free will (simply because the choices I make are predetermined by the systems of causation that exist according to the laws of nature, that doesn't mean the choices I make matter any less in the fate of the universe).  i simply think recognition of the fact that humans probably don't have free will would lead to a deeply more compassionate society, where we understand that those determined to commit acts of evil are indeed dangerous, but themselves extremely unfortunate and unlucky people."

jojewels92,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1388873348.0,"- With a credit union you're a member instead of a customer. Credit unions are not for profit like banks are and because of this they can offer lower rates. 


- They offer credit cards at much lower APR's than banks do and they typically come with more rewards. For example with my credit union even their debt card comes with ""community rewards"". 0.25% of my purchases go towards my charity of choice every quarter but I also get 0.25% in rewards also. Just for spending money like I would normally do. The credit card is even better at 1%. 

- Free ATM's and  Credit Union Sharing nationwide. There are  thousands of ATM's I can use for free anywhere I travel basically. And most credit unions participate in networks so if I have an issue I just need to find a partner credit union and I can go in and solve my issue there. 

- No fee accounts, with stipulations like ""you must do 2 of the following things to be a free member"": Be a student under 26, sign up for paperless billing, have  $5 minimum in your savings account, use direct deposit, etc or have military status or veteran status. It all varies.

My credit union also offers lots of little things that help you out like emergeny loans, ""account protection"" meaning you can't bounce a check or overdraw, it simply get's denied, without the account protection thing you can sign up for ""roll it over"" meaning if you DO overdraft they will cover it and you have 15 days to pay them back +$16 and that's all you pay OR if there is enough money in your savings account they roll over enough to cover your  overdraft and then you get only a $3 fee. 

Overall there are very, very few downsides  to credit unions in my opinion. I would never go back to using a bank again. "

DrinkerofJuice,changemyview,1388873374.0,"I think you're misattributing a universal behavior to a white-only trait.

Reddit is a predominately white site, to be sure. Not looking it up, let's say 85% of the users on this site are white. When you get a group of people that are a heavy majority in one group, there is absolutely always going to be ignorance and elitism no matter what. You call it ""white-culture,"" but I would argue that it's human culture

You get a majority group of Blacks, Indians, Chinese, whatever group of people you want, and I can guarantee it would be the same.

If Reddit was a predominately black website, there was be just as much ignorance and elitism as there currently is, it would just be coming from a different group of people.

I don't think what you're saying about Reddit is inherently wrong, but I think you're missing the mark about the point of it all. When you start to lose empathy for other human beings just because their group is catered to, I think you lose your perspective on human nature.

It's easy to say that white people specifically are the bane of society, and that their problems don't matter because they have it easy, but white people are just as human as the rest of society, and it's entirely meaningless and coincidental that they're the one's on top. Like I said, if it was Black people on top, the same problems would absolutely still be present.

If you're going to be upset with a group, don't be upset with white people, be upset with human nature. We're all the same, it's unfortunate that we're not all socially equal, but that's how it is and always will be, no matter who is winning."

It was one of those 'he said, she said' deals and I don't believe he was someone who'd commit, but that's just anecdotal shit with a sample size of one. The study mentioned in this article is based on a sample size of 270 and found that there is no statistically significant difference between the rate of false reports in Salt Lake (8% of rape charges) and the national rate of false reports, so I'm skeptical of your claim that the problem involves women thinking they were raped when they really weren't.

Triplanetary,Games,1388873603.0,"The civil war storyline was originally going to be very dynamic like that. The modder who's making the [Civil War Overhaul mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37216) discerned this from examining some of the defunct mechanisms that Bethesda made but ultimately abandoned:

&gt;Skyrim's civil war is a much bigger animal than you could possibly imagine. The underlying framework of the civil war was designed to be a completely dynamic series of campaigns for holds, incorporating elements of strategy and diplomacy to bring your opponent down. In the planned version, it's my guess that the designers were going to create some kind of map menu for the player to decide which hold he wanted to hit next, and allow the enemy to counterattack as well. Regardless, each hold was to be won by doing up to TWELVE RADIANT QUESTS, as opposed to up to TWO in vanilla skyrim. There were quest rewards, series of dialogue, and it was far more dynamic than any other kind of radiant quest in Skyrim. Dialogue was recorded, scenes were created, and scripts were set up. Somewhere along the line, likely in the last stages of development, the devs look like they ran out of time and could not complete the dynamic campaign. So what they did was hardcode the gears of this radiant masterpiece to ONLY allow a very limited set of quests that operated entirely linearly."

violacat,books,1388873699.0,"I'm a little late to this thread, but here's my perspective. I fall into the ""young adult"" age group, and I read all of John Greens books. Yes, they were formulaic and unrealistic, but I still loved them. I think it's because the characters were teenagers, but also smart, intelligent, witty, quirky, just *interesting*. It gave me hope that there were teens out there who cared about books and art and searching for the meaning of life, *in addition to* (because a YA novel rarely succeeds without) romance and popularity, etc. And maybe, sometime in the future, I could find, befriend or become one of those people."
red_one2012,MakeupAddicts,1388873699.0,"[Here's my Collection !](http://imgur.com/a/uEb6j)

I put all of the product names in the album but here are my thoughts on some of the items.

**Mascara:** Most of these are just samples from beauty boxes and I probably wouldn't buy most of them. I generally use Clump Crusher or the Clinique High Impact for every day use. The clinique mascara is my holy grail mascara, love love love it.

**Gel Liners:** My favorite black gel liner would be the MAC Chromaline hands down, this is incredibly waterproof and will not budge. My least favorite is the Maybelline one, the formula sucks on my eyes and the color barely shows up. However, I can use this as a good base for eyeshadow.

**Pencil Liners:** I looooovveee Urban Decay's 24/7 pencils, they really last on my greasy lids and the variety of color is excellent. These would be my all-time favorites. Honorable mentions go to the Rimmel Soft Kohl pencils, these work really well in my waterline. Least favorite has to be the Rimmel Scandaleyes in Deep Blue, the formula is really hard and it drags on my lids. 

**Liquid Liners:** The Physicians Formula pen has a really great tip and I love using this one, except I didn't realize I got the Black version and not the Ultra Black. ONLY BUY THE ULTRA BLACK !! The one I have is not really dark enough imo. 

I would also recommend the Wet'n'Wild liner for an inexpensive option. It's very black and doesn't budge once applied, although the finish stays a bit shiny. Some matte black shadow will fix this if you don't prefer a shiny liquid liner.

**Shadow Sticks:** The NYX pencils definitely work well as a base for shadows but they melt off my lids if I try to use them on their own. The Urban Decay pencil lasts as long as the 24/7 liners but this particular shade has a bit too much glitter in it for me and might set too quickly to blend well with eyeshadow. 

However....the Laura Mercier Caviar Stick is the best shadow pencil I have ever used ! The color is gorgeous and it will not fade away after it's been applied. I cannot recommend this product enough.

bb0910,bisexual,1388873808.0,"I agree that it's kind of bullshit that female bisexuality is truly more accepted overall, but risk of sexual/domestic abuse seems like a big jump in making a connection to that.  

First of all, in domestic abuse you could have either a gay or straight partner, and sexuality wouldn't be an issue with a gay partner.(At least as far as accepting that a woman can be with another woman.)  Second, a sexual abuser is an asshole in the first place, it's more of a problem that they sexually abuse rather than don't accept bisexuality.  Would a person be more likely to sexually abuse a bisexual?  Perhaps, but this is not society at large we're talking about here.(I hope.)

Finally there's the chicken and the egg argument, was an abused person bisexual to begin with or did they experiment sexually after being abused?  I'm not saying all bisexual people had to be molested to be bisexual but it does happen to a lot of people I know at least. (Anecdotal admittedly.)"

I have no idea if I did anything to counteract the skid, but I think I must have. 

Second: Another driver turned left across my lane, causing me to t-bone them on their passenger side. My airbag went off and stunned me a bit.

testudinidae,OkCupid,1388873907.0,"So, I have a story about this.  Back when I was still on the market, a girl messaged me who had a son.  I was not looking for someone with a child, and I indicated so on my match questions.  Her match percentage was, accordingly, only like 70-something-percent, which is lower than I generally entertained.

So, she messages me, and we talk a little bit.  She asks me if I wanted to meet her and I told her that I wasn't sure it was a good idea, since I wasn't looking for someone with a child.  

She did a very good job of acknowledging that my feelings were valid, and explained that she just wanted to get to know me.  She wasn't looking for a father for her child, she just wanted someone to go out with and see where things go.  And (big important point), she had no intention of introducing me to her child unless things got VERY serious.

So, we ended up going on a few dates.  She was lovely and a blast to be around, and we definitely had chemistry.  It didn't end up working out because I was going on dates with a few other people at the time, and I ended up in an exclusive relationship with a different one.

A quick qoute from the article for a rough idea of our modern cultural idead: 
&gt;Between (very) roughly 1900 and around 1940, there was a movement towards more gender distinction in clothing, first for toddlers and then for babies, including more frequent use of pink and blue to signify gender.

To understand what masculinity really is, and what we are really talking about when we talk about masculinity, what we really have to understand is *male depression*.

What I want to suggest is that what we call masculinity is actually a state of being in which a man is at his most confident and sexually potent, the inverse of a depressed male.  Since we traditionally see the inverse of masculinity as femininity, this can be a very hard concept for many people to grasp, and I'm not sure how to articulate it well.  I'm going to try though.  But basically the idea that the feminine is the inverse of the masculine is completely wrong.  Which is why we tend to get confused and think that a man doing ""girl things"" is anti-masculine, when in reality *doing things you enjoy* is always ""masculine"" because it makes you happy, and for men, *masculinity is happiness*.

When men are happy, unstressed, and confident, their testosterone levels naturally increase.  When men are depressed, [their testosterone levels drop](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/547830).  [Their libido is reduced and their sex drive diminishes.](http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/sexual-health).

Likewise, if you inject a man with testosterone, [he will be happier, more energetic and more confident](http://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20030103/testosterone-may-help-depressed-men).  When men have higher levels of testosterone, [they tend to become more dominant](http://cogprints.org/663/1/bbs_mazur.html).

When you look at evidence like this, what begins to emerge is a remarkable intuitive pattern.  Men who are happy and healthy have higher testosterone, and are more likely to seek out sex, and more likely to display dominance.  Men who are depressed are less likely to seek out sex, and more likely to be submissive.

There is a very complex feedback loop at work here. When a male feels happy, his testosterone increases and he becomes more interested in sex. When a male feels dominant, his testosterone increase and he acts more dominant.  This is very useful to humans as a survival trait, because happiness and depression are affected quite a bit by other factors that relate to survival success, like [healthy diet](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130916103530.htm), [good sleep](http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-sleep-disorder), [general health, social recognition, etc.](http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2005/12/major.html).  

The Paleolithic male that was a successful hunter/gatherer, who enjoyed the respect of his tribe group, who secured shelter for himself in order to maintain good health and get good sleep, would naturally tend to be happier.  In turn, he would then desire to seek out a mate.

Meanwhile, the male who could not find food and shelter, who lacked peer recognition, whose health was poor and failing, would sink further and further into depression, eventually leading to suicidal mentation and self-annihilation.  This, I think, is part of why suicide rates are so much higher for men.  We are *programmed* to self-destruct in case of failure to thrive.  I think this is also why *exile* was a popular form of punishment in early societies.  Expulsion from the tribal group is so life-threatening it would trigger a downward spiral into depression, so exiles would rarely be seen again...they would head off into the wilderness, fall into despair, then curl up and die.

Now, getting back to  try to imagine a scenario in which a *prelingual* Paleolithic man is attempting to mate with a female.  They can't have any kind of conversation, because they haven't developed real language yet.  Everything has to be communicated through instinctive body language.  They flirt through eye contact, touching, grooming, etc.  You can see this behavior in all primates, and in all primate species (yes, even bonobos!) primate sexual interactions are male dominant.  The male approaches and mounts the female, the female surrenders to being mounted.

As we developed as a species, and especially as we developed language and ideas about ethics and propriety, and has our societies grew larger and more complex, we had to construct elaborate gender roles to control sexual behavior.  But underlying these social constructs are the hard-wired instincts.

Watch people dancing.  And not fancy Victorian dancing, but like at a night club.  Watch how *sexually liberated* people dance. Grinding up on each other, touching constantly, etc.  There's a reason prudes hate dancing -- it's that paleolithic, prelingual mating ritual resurfacing within the confines of what we currently consider acceptable behavior.

So, opening doors.  To be clear, we are not talking about *holding a door for someone*, which is just common courtesy because you don't want to smack someone in the face with a door.  We're talking about the gesture of opening a door.

There's a reason feminists get surly about men opening doors for women.  They'll say it's because it implies women are too weak to open doors, but that's bullshit.  Opening a door for a woman is *dominance display*.  It is literally a man taking control of the surroundings for the benefit of the woman. He is subtly communicating that he is in control; not of *her*, but of the world around him and thus around her.  This, if she's not over-examining it through an ideological lens, makes her feel more secure in those surroundings.

This sort of dominance display is what is hardwired into us, in this feedback loop between testosterone and libido.  The man holds the door open for the woman, displaying dominance. She walks through the door, acknowledging his dominance. His testosterone increases, he becomes more interested in her, and she becomes more interested in him.  A ""date"" will consist of many of these micro-interactions, steadily [increasing both the male and female testosterone levels](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/01/24/in-speed-dating-study-testosterone-rises-in-both-sexes-as-love-ignites), thus making sex more likely.

Now, there has been a 22% drop in the average males testosterone levels since 1980, the peak of mainstream feminism that culminated in the ""Decade of the Woman.""  So that's kind of weird, right?  Masculinity has come under heavy fire in the last thirty years, and men in the West are in the midst of a serious *crises of masculinity*.  

We've all been told to embrace our ""feminine side,"" but men don't have a ""feminine side,"" because femininity is **not the inverse of masculinity**.  In reality, the inverse of masculinity is *depression*.  So when you discourage boys from being masculine, you aren't making them more feminine, you're making them *unhappy*.  You've forced them into a social construct that is inhibitive of healthy expressions of masculinity, and what happens is they get more depressed.  Their testosterone levels drop.

I hope all of that made sense."

bombeater,changemyview,1388874205.0,"Literally every single serious relationship I have *ever* had with a psychologically functional woman--romantic, sexual, or otherwise--flies in the face of this. I am 28. My last three relationships all lasted for around 2 years, and the breakups were all either mutual or initiated by me. *All* of them went through seriously rough times when my faith in the relationship was challenged, but I was absolutely certain every single step of the way that we were still a team and my girlfriend had my back. My partners made me soup when I was sick, tolerated my temper and self-pity issues when times got rough, and never held grudges about disagreements or mistakes that I made.

I am still friends with all of my exes; I still have a sexual dynamic with two of them whenever I'm in town. All of my relationships had healthy sex patterns for at least 50% of their duration. *More than one* of my girlfriends actively sought out other girls for us to have threesomes with, even though I never said a word about it, and there was little to no drama in the wake of those activities.

I have lived and dated all over the country, in New York, Boston, Cleveland, Los Angeles, and elsewhere. I have socialized in all sorts of circles with my partners, and we met all kinds of rich, handsome, successful men. I have never been cheated on.

In fact, I have never even been dumped for another guy, despite the fact that I am $50,000 in debt with student loans, covered in an atrocious amount of body hair, have a nerdy profession (programming) with nerdy hobbies (fencing and video games) and a nerdy appearance (long hair, glasses, chubby), and I am literally a sexual submissive who enjoys being tied up and humiliated by women. All of those are traits which, at one point or another, I have seen listed as dealbreakers by TRP advocates.

In fact, almost everything about me is a dealbreaker according to TRP methodology. I treat women *exactly* the same as I treat men: I tell them what I want and what I expect. I'm open about my feelings. If there are problems, I bring them up as quickly and compassionately as I can manage.

This is why I disagree with damn near everything I have ever read about TRP views. They all seem like descriptions of another *universe* to me. I don't understand how someone can possibly claim to have empathy towards women when they have clearly missed something that I see in almost **every single woman I have ever met**.

I have only ever had the kind of experience TRPers seem to describe once in my life, and it was with a woman who I later discovered was into some pretty severe substance abuse, and very likely suffered from undiagnosed severe manic depression and paranoia.

*This* is why I don't get TRP. The only woman I've met who acted even *vaguely* like TRPers describe was ... well, literally crazy, for lack of a better term.

So what do TRPers do with my viewpoint? They rationalize it. ""You only *think* you've never been cheated on. You'll see what we're talking about when you finally get betrayed,"" as if one bad experience would negate all of the preceding positive ones. 

How do you explain the fact that I'm a beta disaster according to every reasonable TRP syllabus, but get laid regularly, treat women and men equivalently, and that the vast majority of my closest and most trusted lifelong friends are women?

Is it really more likely that I *happen* to have met and dated the *only* minuscule handful of women in the country who *happen* to be capable of real love, or is it more likely that most guys have unrealistic expectations and project their disappointment on to women in general?

I'm sorry if any of this came off as condescending or disrespectful. I am genuinely interested in discussing this kind of thing, but it's so hard because it is really quite difficult for me to see where TRP supporters are coming from. I hope some of what I've written was edifying for you, and if you can reconcile my story with the TRP perspective without resorting to ""You just got lucky"" or something, I'm very interested to hear it."

afropunk3,blackladies,1388874286.0,"I hate to inform you of this, but your reference for the statement that ""Mitt has a very problematic position on Black Americans"" is a parody article from a conservative publication (The Daily Caller). The whole thing was intended as a rather unfunny joke focused on the so-called ""absurdity"" of racist code language. Unfortunately, despite the arguments of many conservatives, race-baiting/dog-whistle politics has indeed remained a key strategy for Republican victories over the course of the last 40 years. I would also point out that the Republican party really used to be an ally of our community in the times of slavery/reconstruction, although the party completely changed its tune on blacks after the Dixiecrats migrated to it and permanently changed its perspective on social issues. As for Mitt Romney himself, I really do not think that the man is a racist; his father was certainly a strong fighter against Richard Nixon's attempts to engage in housing segregation (if you want to hear more about the incident in question, I strongly recommend listening to the episode of NPR's ""This American Life"" that discussed this topic in-depth).

However, I'd say that you are completely right in your insistence that we should all come to terms with racial differences and stop pretending that ""colorblindness"" is a thing. Research in neuroscience/cognitive psychology has continually confirmed that ""colorblind"" individuals actually test much higher for subconscious racial bias than the rest of the population (some speculate that this is due to the great deal of mental stress that must be expended to suppress latent prejudices/fears). We cannot learn to accept others until we have properly learned to accept ourselves; however, in time, I do hope that real co-operation amongst the major races can become a big part of our society and culture. Undoing the hatred, resentment, and horrors of generations past is truly slow work, but it is also a noble task that must be completed for the sake of the future.

As far as this whole MHP flap goes, I still feel that the panelists and the host of the show were mildly irresponsible to have that sort of discussion. It just wasn't appropriate, and frankly, I interpreted it as mean-spirited and unnecessary. I do not believe that Melissa Harris Perry is in any way a racist, but I still refuse to defend her statements. "

porpoiseoflife,lotro,1388874448.0,"It wasn't that you had ""slaughtered"" the Professor himself. 

It was more that you had given their favorite dog a hard kick in the ribs. Right in front of them.

Let me try to explain this. Hopefully I can do it in a way that isn't rude or insulting.

In the starter zones, there is an innocence still. In Breeland, that innocence is shown in Staddle, where the simple Hobbit folk just want the bandits out of their way so they can get back to the important business of farming. It is also shown in Adso's Camp, where they are trying to build an inn between Buckland and Bree-town. 

And just as with the Breeland Hobbits, It can be found almost everywhere in The Shire. Hobbits don't care for the turmoil beyond their bounds. The only ""true"" problems from the outside can be found outside Bamfurlong and the goblin nest north of Brockenborings. Until then, it is all pies and mail and bugs and slugs. Well, the occasional wolf is thrown in for entertainment value, of course.

Even in the serious lands of Ered Luin, they pay little true attention to the greater conflicts. In Celondim, wine-making is still the most important industry and not even an invasion of goblins is allowed to interfere with that. And in Thorin's Hall, there are dwarves who, much like Redditors of a certain genre, just want to find out what's in the safe. Seriously. 

Once we get outside the three starter zones, these ""needless"" quests are very few and far in between. The greatest concentrations are found either among the elves of Lorien or the Hobbits of Oakbarton of Evendim (unlike the few ""less-sensible"" Hobbits that can be found in the ruins of Ost Forod) and Maur Tulhau of Enedwaith. Those are the pleasant ones. The true drudgery comes when these tasks are the gateway flags in order to break through to the next tier of quests. (Forochel, Enedwaith, and Dunland come directly to mind.) 

For once you have experienced the frustrations of those highly annoying tasks, that needless back-and-forth back in peaceful Bree-land will be one of the more fond memories that you have. The vast majority of the playerbase has this opinion. They treat these zones like old people treat their childhood memories. They are loved. They are cherished. They are fond thoughts of a simpler time.

And then you went and pissed on them. Publicly.

Now, the ""casual"" remark was out of line. As was the WoW comment. Yet under the circumstances, you should feel fortunate that the profanity filter didn't have to kick in too much. These quests have been mostly the same since the game originally launched, and the old guard is quite happy with the way they are.

Yet believe it or not, this is an extremely common complaint. A lot of newer players wonder about this. And the reasoning is quite simple: the books have barely gotten started by this point. The lands are still mostly at peace. The trees have yet to be burned in Isengard. The Hollein Gate of Moria has yet to be opened. The Nine have only barely begun to pick up the trail of the Ring. Even Gollum is still more concerned with fish than he is with his precious. Well, maybe only a bit, but he still hasn't picked up Frodo's trail. 

The War has yet to start, yet most new players wonder where the War is. They've read about it. They've seen it. They want to be there, and expect to be thrown directly into it. Instead, they're helping build wine casks, finding lost cogs, delivering mail, and helping an old Hobbit get married to the love of his life. And so they get frustrated and try venting on the chat channels...

And then this happens.

I'm sorry that it happened to you like this. Yet it is predictable. It happens all the time. And for as long as the oldtimers are fond of it and the newcomers are frustrated by it, it will happen again."

&gt;That there are crosscutting factors is not in doubt, but the evidence of this privilege is fairly clear.

Statistics would be helpful.

&gt;Generally when people claim to be able to ""enlighten"" they are perpetrating a scam

Lol... what? Straw man much?

&gt;I've made no such claim (that disparity and privilege are the same) at any point; it is your assertion that we are discussing a disparity that is not a privilege.

We're talking about disparities in college and graduation rates. You're attempting to explain this disparity as evidence of a ""privilege"" for women to attend *and graduate* college. You have yet to demonstrate how it's a privilege, but your to-be-substantiated claims above seem to be defining it as discrimination.

&gt;What makes a disparity a privilege?

Disparity and privilege are not one in the same and it's not really possible to define it as such. Privilege in the context of gender is not an assortment of specific benefits here and there but rather cultural context that gives one gender a set of advantages over others. 

Sure, there is plenty of disparity in our society regarding women having access to certain things that men aren't, but it's not immediately a privilege just because.

And what I am trying to get you to realize is that men are not being actively pushed away from universities either. Nor are men who go to college benefiting at a lesser rate than men -- they are clearly benefitting more. Not to mention, the rate that men are attending college is actually increasing, not decreasing. There is no evidence of privilege here. Perhaps other factors are at play, but the fact that there are many resources for women to get to college is not disproportionately advantaging women over men.

CPU: Intel  I-7, given that your using design software and 3D rendering it may be the better option for you. But I wanted to leave that up to you.

CPU Cooler: A large heat sink and fan that sits on your CPU, preventing overheating. Part chosen mostly because of high reviews and known quality of, in addition to liquid cooling.

MotherBoard: a few important reasons behind this choice, first ASRock is a quality brand, second it has several PCI-e x16 slots for GPUs, allowing for SLI later on. Third, 4 RAM slots allowing for expansion later on. Fourth, because it has 8 SATA ports, meaning you can add additional HDD and SSD as you need them. Finally Fifth because the board supports RAID, something you suggested you would be interested in.

Memory (RAM): the Mobo has 4 RAM slots, allowing you to add two additional modules in addition to these 2 for a total of 32 GB of RAM. 

Storage: 256GB SSD, high reviews and known manufacturer.

4TB drives, lots of room for anything you need to fill it with. Well known manufacturer and good reviews.

Video Card: GTX 780 Ti, will handle any game you throw at it, this card is damn powerful and known for being fairly cool and quiet.

Wireless: built into other board.

Case: You mentioned Green was your favorite colour, I looked around but wasn't able to find a ""sexy"" green one, mostly all Military looking. However this is a high quality, sleek black case with a window so I hope it meets your requirements.

PSU: 1000W should be plenty, will allow for SLI.

Drive:  cheap and reliable.

OS: Windows 8.1 is the latest version of Windows, its shockingly fast in terms of boot time, after switching from 7 my boot time dropped from ~1 minute to ~25 secs. It would be even faster on an SSD.

Monitor, same one I'm using and I've never had an issue. High quality, good colour, and good brand.

Keyboard: You mentioned Razor and this would go well with your mouse. Mechanical keyboards are generally considered superior.

Feel free to ask any questions, There are definitely a few choices for parts and I would love to help you customize this to best suit you.

EDIT: thanks for kingofkingsss for suggestions, they have been taken into consideration."

I think the differing advice so far — observe the itch, mentally 'scratch' it, or actually scratch and get back to meditating — is interesting. For me personally, it's important not to scratch the itch. 

I'm a tingly person. The reflex may be driven by boredom, nervousness, stress, etc., not even a genuine itch. Nevertheless, I'm sure that for each time I'm tempted to scratch during meditation, I'm probably unconsciously itching in daily life. 

When meditating, I try to dismiss the itch by following advice I got many years ago — refocus the attention on a different body part. For me, that's where I'm feeling the most tension, i.e. the second most attention-commanding area. Then I'll switch to the third, and so on, noting everything going on besides that pesky itch. I find it somewhat pleasurable to feel the itch fade away during the process. "

Hajimotto,gaybros,1388874905.0,"I am aware of research being done into theoretical before time. However, in the event that it is fully discovered then it will be removed from the list of unanswerable questions. Science constantly tackles that list and removes questions and this is not a bad thing. It just means that correctly we are not able to answer the question fully. Evidence and reasoning are simple constructs that we create in order to try and make sense of the world around us. The more that we learn about complex ideas the less sense that our previously held models make. Morality is a construct of evidence and reasoning just like science and both require different aspects of the human existence to be created. Science seeks to answer why something is the way that it is and religion seeks to answer if this is the best possible way to exist.  
  
We all live in complete lies. Everything you know is a lie to some extent. It is a shadow and simplification of the truth so that it can be grappled with my a single mind. I believe that an atom is a specific way and that it behaves in specific way, however, if this idea is scrutinized it will show that I in fact had a false model of the atom. It is the same way with beliefs. I do not have all of the truth that exists in the world and I never will. There are parts of the human existence that I will never understand, however, I am able to accept that I am only human and accept that I will not be able to answer all questions that exist and some cannot be answered. Why is the human existence full of suffering and must it be so? Can I limit the suffering of others? Is it right for me to impose my values on others? These questions do not have a simple answer and religion provides a framework with built in evidence and reasoning to attempt to answer some of these questions.  "

For 1968, 2001 is incredibly ahead of time. It's one of the few Sci-Fi films that stand the test of time. The use of practical effects, the score and sound is utterly astounding. The story can be picked apart, but the actual production is better than a lot of sci-fis out there. It would only be butchered with unnecessary CGI if it was remade.

The Shining too isn't dull for most. It would seem you're simply not a fan of Kubricks style. He had a very specific approach to film making that built tension, atmosphere etc. You can pick apart the story and not enjoy it, but they're both brilliant produced and directed."

No, you're mixing my statements up. I was explaining the one statement:

&gt;Perhaps the lack of evidence of either is not evidence that the military is only the result of patriarchy, but in our world it certainly is.

Not

&gt;A feminist military could possibly exist, but it would contradict itself.

Which are two different statements, buddy.

&gt;I'm not missing the point, you've just been talking in circles so long you forgot the question actually I asked.

Can't produce a convincing argument? Insult the other person's words. Not really a fail-proof strategy though...

&gt;I disagree, but more than that I don't even know what you really mean.

Maybe you need to read what I wrote again...

&gt;The answers you gave are not answers to the question I asked.

Hahaha. Yes they were. 

&gt;Answering that you cannot find an example of a feminist military today, in no way responds to the question of whether a feminist military will one day be possible.

I think what you mean to say is ""Answering that you cannot find an example ... in no way absolutely proves that a feminist military will one day be possible"", however that ignores what I actually said, which is that ""matriarchal militaries"" don't exist. Feminism != Matriarchy. And I actually acknowledged this for you already. Are you trying to argue with a straw man?

Besides, I already explained very thoroughly that feminist theory very specifically indicates that it is against using the military. Don't know why you keep mulling over it as if I haven't stated this. I literally began the conversation with this...

Also, if you're going to give up arguing in good faith you might want to simply stop posting.

I didn't get my first serious Girlfriend until I was 15, I played heaps of Video Games, loved my Computer and barely interacted with my Parents. It was just kind of a phase that I went through I guess.
The worst thing you can do and I know this is hard, is start tearing away things like the Computer. He should be doing his exercises, but if he doesn't want to, that seems like its going to be a mistake he will have to make on his own and learn from on his own. I know that might be a really hard thing to do, because he's your son and you love him, but just be there for him the minute he changes his mind. 

You're not failing as a Mother in anyway. It's a given that a boy without a Father figure in his life might have difficulties with social activities. That doesn't mean that he won't function as a person, or that he's missing out with something. If he wants to stay that way and doesn't seem generally unhappy, then there isn't much of a problem. I'd say just keep up what you do. Keep an eye on him and make sure he isn't super unhappy.

You sound like a good, genuine, caring Mother. Your Son might not appreciate it now, because he's at that weird teenager phase. But if you just stick by him, even when he doesn't want to talk to you much, or is disjointed, it will pay off in the end. He'll get a bit older and appreciate what you did for him.

Hang in there."

I would say, yes going into debt over a wedding is dumb, and spending all your life savings is dumb too. My wife and I had a fairly large wedding with roughly 200 attendees, total cost of around $40,000 (mostly due to open bar), but we got some great deals on venues, food, etc... by knowing people that worked there or owned businesses we used (cake, photography, etc..). It was completely affordable for us and our families, and was a great night that everyone had a ton of fun at. More importantly myself and my wife had a blast, and an unforgettable memory that will last us a lifetime. I don't really understand the hate people dispense on others for wanting to have a nice beautiful wedding.

I mean, come on, if you're so deliberately insulted like that you have to admit that condescension isn't out of the question. Maybe a little patronizing, and somewhat irritating to be the recipient of, but not totally unreasonable given the circumstances. 

Besides which, the question itself invites quite a lot of contempt in the answers. It wouldn't be fair to automatically discredit an attempted answer as condescending and therefore unworthy of consideration. 

I don't really see the need to attribute emotional context to a message unless it's very heavily implied or done for the purposes of a research paper is all."

When I send off payments for my garbage collection service, again, it doesn't go to a bank, but to the collection company's main office.  When then company I work for receives checks, they never go directly to the bank, rather we have an accounting department that makes deposits as we receive checks.  The only time I have ever seen direct deposit is through a payroll service for paychecks.  Also, here is my banks statement on the issue: https://www.wellsfargo.com/help/direct-deposit/  Specifically, ""Income received from your employer, Social Security, pension and retirement plans, the Armed Forces, VA Benefits, and annuity or dividend payments may all qualify for Direct Deposit.""  No where does it state that all types of payments qualify for direct deposit, nor does it suggest receiving payments from customers in the form of direct deposit.  I could be wrong.  Maybe I'm just not familiar enough with how my bank works.  You are the first to ever suggest that a Tenant could direct deposit into my bank."

The more muscles a woman has, the more testosterone, and the more horny they are.
  
At far as stories, there's a ton. The owner of Jet Set got fired after this 18 year old straight kid with braces came up to me and my director (who also did straight porn) if he could do straight porn with us. We told him no and he started crying, and told us that the owner made him suck his dick to get into straight porn. The owner was a slimy piece of shit that would cruise gyms and tell young straight guys that if the did gay porn, that would lead to straight porn, which was not true at all.

The backstory: he's a truck driver. He was OTR one time and 2 girls in a small car in front of him suddenly slammed the brakes on. He (of course) couldn't stop, and killed both of them. Turns out they had dropped a joint and were scrambling around for it and accidentally hit the brakes (or maybe it was reflexive - who knows). He stayed out of a truck for ~ 2 years, thought it through and decided he had to live with, then found a way to live with it. I think he's one of the bravest people I know, and he's also one of the most professional truckers I know. Doesn't txt while driving, pulls over when he needs to, and is ALWAYS aware of what's around him.

This kid chose to commit a horrible and senseless crime. I truly have no sympathy for him. He's a rapist."

southernbelladonna,dogs,1388875690.0,"My dog survived parvo.  We adopted him and 2 days later he came down with it.  Our first vet quote was also in the $2000 range, but we made some calls and found a different vet who offered to treat Tyson for half that (and let us set up a payment plan).  He stayed at the vet for a week.  After he came home, I spent several days giving him all his fluids with a syringe and smearing nutri-cal in his mouth because he still wouldn't eat/drink on his own.  

He was skin and bones by the time the parvo had run it's course.  And he developed several other secondary conditions (an all-over yeast infection and some respiratory problems) because his immune system was shot.  But he pulled through and is now a big, healthy baby. [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/wjDWDEy)

Having said all that, don't beat yourself up over your decision.  Yeah, your vet gave you the pessimistic outlook, but she wasn't wrong about there only being a 50% chance of success.  Deciding to not treat is a valid option.  I had to make a similar choice with a cat (kidney failure) and chose to put him down rather than pursue further treatment.  It sucked and I felt super guilty, but sometimes it's the best thing to do."

silverionmox,europe,1388875943.0,"&gt;So you are saying that the bonds will fix Greece? A banking union is going to fix the productivity in Greece? How, in detail please? The bonds are going to fix the internal devaluation in the south? How, in detail please?

*Nothing* was going to fix Greece in six months. Why do you put the bar above stratosphere? Why should the Euro be able to magically cure any economic ailment? If Greece still had the Drachma, they would still have had a debt crisis. And what then? Devalue? To get a debt cut similar to the 50% they achieved during negotiations, they would have had to devalue with 50%... i.e. all imported goods would cost 100% more. Do you really think the people of Greece would have fared better in that situation?

&gt;There are far to many assymetric shocks, internal devaluation

Internal devaluation is what you get when you refuse transfers. It's a cure, not a problem.

&gt;The Eurzone is not a good currency union.

It wasn't because of the inflation paranoia and paranoid attitude of some rich countries. The euro crisis basically ended when Draghi said: ""the ECB will do anything necessary to keep the Euro afloat"". At that point stability returned.
 
Now the ECB can more or less play its role as the lender of last resort, and financial gamblers trying to corner a single European state in times of trouble will have to face the risk of all their owned debts turning into thin air. Now the banking union is coming too, and the banks will no longer be able to count on an individual state bailing them out. We're progressing.

&gt;and yet you expect them to compete having a currency that is essentially adjusted to the needs of the north, mainly Germany

That's a problem, the ECB still issues too little money. Now that we're nearing deflationary territory they'll hopefully be calmed enough to let the reins float a little. On the bright side, that means the ECB now has room to create about 1% of the EUzone GDP in euros.

&gt;And, you also forget, the bonds cements that the Eurozone do not care one bit about treaties and the law. One is not supposed to put in conditions like that, nor take over anyones debt or bail anyone out according to the current treaties.

I find that argument a bit disingenuous. You complain that the Euro isn't an effective currency but would refuse to give them the legal tools it needs to be one. I'm glad the ECB eventually did what it needed to do."

MrDubious,Entrepreneur,1388876204.0,"Sure, and that's all reasonable. The context that's important here is that the conversation was initially mixing organic marketing on Facebook with paid advertising, and the reason his posting became so popular is that it was implying that with the right blend of paid advertising approach, it could offset or drive the organic engagement. This became a firebrand conversation, because [even Facebook says their organic reach is dropping](http://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-admits-organic-reach-brand-posts-dipping/245530/). 

I don't believe it's in any way accurate that the paid approach will drive organic growth, except for in a few small niche environments, or from national brands with an existing audience. That ""formula"" only works for a few specific industries, especially at the small business/startup stage, and it's an important distinction that needs to be made. This isn't about growing real fans; it's actually a much more traditional ""Pay to Play"" form of advertising. 

Additionally, his experience of ""double the conversion rate on Facebook ads to Google PPC"" is a study in bad data interpretation. Comparing ""Like conversions"" to PPC sales conversions gets you nothing but a big fat apples and oranges salad, and is especially jarring given that in many, many studies, CTR has been substantially higher on Adwords, and the higher intent has generally led to higher conversions. 

I readily admit I'm not a marketing or ad guy, and am not speaking from a competitive place, but as a developer who's worked on projects from startup to enterprise, I've seen marketing buys at all levels, and some of his points just don't align well with the vast experiences of most. 

That being said, he's done a killer job here, as noted, at marketing himself, so screw FB advertising: he'll probably beat his monthly sales revenue in salary at the marketing gigs he'll be offered from this."

silverionmox,europe,1388876241.0,"&gt;I'm betting it won't take much longer for all the disenchanted and disenfranchised to pull the proverbial rug from under the EU proper.

And what then? A return to national currencies? And what then? How much will they like the devaluations... I totally agree that the EU lacks a social dimension, a EU-wide health insurance for example would be great. But if you think that national governments somehow are better able to shield the people from the international markets, I am obliged to laugh in your face to cure you of that notion.

&gt;More on point though: the ECB might just be the only EU-wide institution that actually operates properly. The system as constructed might be okay, but the banks themselves are holding untold billions of useless paper/non-performing assets off-balance sheet. In essence that crap renders many of the big banks insolvent in the long run.

And how is that the fault of the EU? The national states did the bulk of the bailouts, precisely because there was no banking union yet to handle crises like this, and because they had to because they relied too much on a few intertwined big national banks."

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,California,1388876278.0,"If you think Santa Monica will close the airport and make it a park you severely underestimate how much Santa Monica dearly loves their developments. They will say the airport park and Cloverfield are adequate open spaces and they will sell that into ""mixed use"" condos immediately. 

Imagine that area with thousands of more residents. To give it perspective: the santa monica trailerpark is 3.8 acres and they are turning that into 377 units with ground floor retail. The airport is 227 acres. That *will* become condos. Do you truly think that is a better fit for the city and surrounding areas than the airport?"
