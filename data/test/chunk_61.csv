&gt;How long before he realizes that the leg-lengthening was for nothing?

I still don't see how it was for nothing. It's 3 inches of height. 
A 5'5 guy growing to 5'8 would make a noticible and important differnce in that persons life. It would stop him from being ""that short guy"" and make him pretty much average. In celebrity terms it would be the difference between Josh Hutcherson and Mark Wahlberg.

A guy who is 5'10 growing to 6'1 would make a noticible difference. I'm sure we've all seen the women who claim they despise men shorter than 6'0 and won't talk to a guy unless he is taller than 6'0

I don't see how it would be any different for somone going from 4'11 -5'2.

I mean I have it somewhat bad at 5'4 but at the same time there is guys out there who would literally kill to be my height. I can't say what it's like to be 4'11 but if he actually went through with the suregery and said he's happy he went through 8 monhts of torture I would imagine it would be a bigger deal for him going to 5'2 than it would be for me going to 5'7"

Diredoe,AskReddit,1390271778.0,"I worked at a liquor store for a few years, and one day two teenagers came in, a boy and a girl. The boy went back to the coolers, and then came up to the counter with a case of cheap beer. Well, this kid was obviously under 21, so I asked to see his ID. 

He just looks at me and says, ""It's for my dad."" 

""Sorry,"" I tell him. ""But you need to be 21 to buy alcohol."" 

""But he's disabled."" 

""I'm sorry, but it's illegal for me to sell you alcohol if you're under 21."" 

The kid and his female friend (I assume it's his sister) storm out, leaving the case on the counter. I tell my manager about what happened, she laughed it off, and I put the case back. 

We're standing by the security monitors when we see a van pull up into our parking lot. One of those vans that was modified to be handicap accessible. The kid from earlier and his sister get out, and we watch as they get his older man out of the back, and this guy is in a wheelchair and hooked up to oxygen tanks and the like. My manager turns to me, says, ""You get to deal with this,"" and hides in her office. 

Bitch. 

The guy and his kids enter the store, and immediately starts yelling at me. ""All I wanted was a beer, and you're making it difficult for me! Can't you see how hard it is for me to get around? Don't you care?"" etc. 

I tell him the same thing as I said his kid, but try to me as compassionate as possible about it. ""I'm sorry sir, I realize how much this sucks for you, but I *cannot* sell alcohol to a minor. It's illegal. If a cop came in while while your son was buying the beer, then I'd be given a massive fine and the store would lose the liquor license."" 

Eventually we reached a deal. Next time he wanted a beer, his son would drive him over, I'd bring the case out to the van, and the father would hand me the money. This way, the transaction was between the store and the father. As they were leaving, the girl said something along the lines of, ""Well, obviously they don't *care* that you're disabled."" 

I never saw them again. 

And that's how I got yelled at for not selling alcohol to a minor. "

Adhering to a religious doctrine in that kind of world requires a measure of faith, which many people simply don't possess.

In short: why would I seek out Christ for guidance when I can simply turn to the internet? Why go to a church for community when I can go to school? Why follow the teachings of one when I can learn the teachings of many?

kempff,cheatatmathhomework,1390272064.0,"As others have said, -10^2 is the negative of the square of ten, not the square of the negative of ten. And this is not the only weirdness built into the traditional method of writing algebraic statements.

Wait till you get to trig and you have to deal with ""cos^(2)x"" and ""cos^(-1)x""! 

By the way, no self-respecting mathematician would be so careless as to write the ambiguous ""-10^(2)"" in any context. Only a textbook author would do such a thing.

But as for the product or quotient of two negatives being a positive is concerned, try thinking of it this way:

* A negative number is what you get when you subtract a number from zero: 0 - x = -x.
* A negative times a positive therefore is negative: (-x)(y) = (0 - x)(y) = 0y - xy = 0 - xy = -xy.
* A negative times another negative ends up positive: (-x)(-y) = (0 - x)(0 - y) = 0^2 - 0y - 0x + xy = xy.

i_330,AskHistorians,1390272151.0,"Okay, so just a little bit of background before I get into the specifics of the JFK/Malcolm X relationship. Malcolm X wasn't aligned with the Civil Rights Movement, was extremely anti-integration, and didn't advocate a nonviolent approach to civil rights; instead, he was of the opinion that cooperation with white America would only subjugate black America further, and that violence was the only effective means of liberation.

So this is where we get to the ""chickens coming home to roost"" bit. That remark is part of a longer speech ([available here, for your reference](http://www.malcolm-x.org/speeches/spc_120463.htm)) titled ""God's Judgment of White America"". Basically, Malcolm X excoriates JFK in the speech as the head of a vast white propaganda machine that was secretly controlling the Civil Rights Movement in an attempt to use it for their own political gain and eventually destroy it from the inside out by creating divisions within it. So, when JFK was assassinated, Malcolm X saw this as an instance of white America finally being punished for its crimes. Hope this clears things up for you a bit."

In movieverse, Greenwood is just changing into Mirkwood, (In the books, Mirkwood has been Mirkwood for much, much longer.) so this girl's never seen real action. Ever. She's used to peaceful Greenwood, so has she been on a couple of hunting trips or what? I highly doubt even exceptional talent can trump the fact that there are Elves exponentially older than her, Elves who have actually *seen the horrors of Mordor during the War of the Last Alliance in the Second Age and watched their king, Thranduil's father, die with two-thirds of their army.* But, hey, the 300-year-old who doesn't play by the rules totally gets that position! Because fuck logic!

That, the romance arc, and the healing scene were the biggest issues I had with her. The healing scene wasn't just cheesy, but it was very un-Tolkien. For those who don't know, Elves who fight and kill have less of a skill with healing because they have devoted themselves to taking life instead of preserving it. There are some exceptions with older and more powerful characters -- and Tauriel is not one of them, being a young Silvan Elf. Aethlas is a plant with healing properties only usable by kings. When Frodo was stabbed in LotR with the morgul blade, Aragorn used it to prolong the blade's effects and Arwen strengthened it so that she'd have time to bring him to Rivendell, where Elrond -- who is thousands and thousands of years old -- was able to heal him. Logically, Tauriel would **never** have had the ability to save Kili, and they shouldn't have had her do it, since it'd bring out her flaws and just how young she is. It'd be better if they'd put that scene in a context where someone like Bard, a rightful king, was able to do it."

dakru,AskMen,1390272412.0,"I'm going to leave some of the other parts of your story to other people and focus on this one:

&gt; In addition, every single male friend I've had over the past couple years has tried to hook up with me at one point. I have 2 very close male friends and about 15 less close male friends. Literally every single one has made a move on me, despite no hints from me that I was interested. The worst part is that after they make a move and I turn them down, they tend to stop being friends with me! As if they didn't really like my personality or want to be friends with me the entire time, and now that I won't fuck them, they have no reason to stick around.

There's nothing wrong with them expressing sexual/romantic interest and making a move (the thing that would be wrong is if one of them didn't take ""no"" for an answer). Women generally don't make moves (sometimes because they don't think they're supposed to, and sometimes because of the same fear of rejection that we all have), so if men stopped there would be hardly any relationships happening at all (unless women stepped in to pick up the slack). If you want men to make moves less often then you should understand that yes, this would include fewer guys you aren't interested in making moves on you, but it would also include fewer guys that you are interested in making moves on you.

You say you gave them no hints that you were interested, but please try to understand the men's side for a second. We can't ever wait for 100% certainty of a woman's interest before making our move because women don't generally give the overt and clear expression of interest that would be required for 100% certainty on our part. Instead they focus on subtle hints, as you say you do. The problem with hints is that by nature they're ambiguous. Sometimes guys will miss them, and sometimes guys (knowing that women usually go for hints of their interest instead of being more overt with it) will see hints where none were intended. Remember, one woman's ""but I was just being friendly!"" is another woman's ""why won't he take my hint and ask me out?"".

Another issue you point out is that they seem to lose interest in friendship afterwards. Surely you understand that they might feel awkward after getting rejected, right? Or that they might not like to be reminded of their rejection? If they were friends with you when you were unattractive then it's really unlikely that they were just sitting around waiting for you to become attractive."

AryaBreaksBad,WritingPrompts,1390272414.0,"So I like music. I decided to use a five minute song as a timer for this little writing thing, which seems like it'll be fun. The song closest to five minutes was 'wide awake on paradise boulevard', a mashup of katy perry, green day, and coldplay. I recommend it.

Besides that, I'm not really sure what to talk about. I'm not sure if i'm even doing this right, but i guess it doesn't really matter either way. This is pretty fun. It's not often that you get to just say whatever is on your mind, is it? I also find it interesting that i can be typing a sentence and think of 8 different things to say, but by the time i get to the end of it, I have nothing left to say. It says a lot about what we can understand about ourselves just by thinking. How often do you just stop and think about thinking, and how you think about everything in your life, and how often you think about thinking about your life, and yo dawg i heard you like thinking so i thought about thinking about thinking about your life. (i thought that was pretty funny). 

But really! There are a lot of times when if you stop and think about what you are doing, you realize a better way you could go about finding a solution, even when there isn't a problem. I don't have an example for this on the top of my head, but you'll get it eventually. 

It also says a lot about how you react to things in life, if you can just think before you decide what to think. Like if you consciously decide to only take notice of the positive things in life, you will be a happier person, I guarantee it. Looks like the song is coming to an end, so i'll stop here.

At least, it should be. And it's typically been written as such. In 3.x edition, it's actually got some mechanical repercussions. Like, can't a Barbarian not be Lawful? That kind of garbage. And hey, who's to say that your particular bent on interrogation isn't motivated by Good tendencies? 

That said, your group seems to be telling you that alignment doesn't matter, and you can go around murdering peasants because it's the easiest, most efficient way to steal their pocket change, and your alignment won't change. That, to me, says that alignment is not a concern.

So don't let it restrict you. Let your character be who he is, and who you want him to be. Who cares about that one tiny blank at the top of your character sheet waving its finger like a disapproving nanny?"

Okay, first off, you posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1vm51z/tomorrow_im_going_to_approach_some_girls_at/) asking for advice and tips approaching girls.  The top comments are, in order:

1. Some advice and tips
2. More advice and tips
3. A comment noting that it can be hard
4. More advice and tips
5. A question asking for clarification
6. More advice and tips
7. A few jokes.

From which you conclude that you shouldn't even try?  Are you under the misapprehension that this is a logical conclusion?  Because, news flash:  It isn't.  You asked for advice and are completely ignoring every bit of it you received.  If that's how you roll, why ask for more advice?  Are you going to edit your post with an ""Update:  Meeting girls is a bad idea, going to look into dying sad and alone"" now?

Anyhow:

&gt; If approaching girls isn't a good idea, how else can I meet girls?

Of course approaching girls is a good idea, you idiot.  As you were clearly told when you asked for advice on it and everyone gave you detailed tips on how to do it.

That being said, approaching girls is a good idea in general; it's not for everyone.  (Like, well...me.  I don't do very well with doing cold approaches.  No big deal.)  If it's not for you, then the next best choice is online dating.  Failing that, try to meet and get to know girls through school, work, or a hobby, and then ask them out once you've got to know them.  (Warning:  If you're the kind of guy who can't approach girls, then you're probably the kind of guy who will get to know a girl, start falling for her, but hold off actually telling her.  This is a great way to fuck everything up; at some point you absolutely must let your target know ""hey, I'm interested in you"", generally by saying those exact words, and the sooner the better.  The alternative is an abysmal pit of failure and plaintive cries about ""why am I always friendzoned?!"".)

Edit:  I also see you posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1vly3c/if_i_go_up_to_a_random_girl_tomorrow_whats_the/) asking about the odds of rejection.  The answer is ""very high"", because it's high for every single person on the face of the planet.  But let me answer the question you should have asked, which is ""I'm super worried about the chance of rejection; is this a huge problem which will ruin my life if I don't get over it?"" to which the answer is ""yes"".  We can basically divide the world into people who are afraid to ask for what they want, and the people who have a *chance* at getting what they want.  Pro tip:  Try and be in category two.  If you're so worried about, eg, the odds of a potential employer rejecting your job application that you won't apply for jobs, **then you will never get a job**.  Rejection can sting, but if fear of rejection is big enough that it's impacting your life and stopping you from applying for job (or hitting on girls, as the case may be) then that's having a huge negative impact on your life, and you need to fix it."

Diredoe,AskReddit,1390272703.0,"Look at your average TV show that takes place in a high school. Now realize that it's pretty much all wrong. 

There was some bullying, but it's mostly in the younger grades, like elementary school and middle school. By the time you reach high school, it's really faded a lot. There was still some bullying in my high school, but it was pretty rare. 

Not really a whole lot of judgement. There were some things that made people stick their noses up (in my day it was pleather pants), but if you kept to jeans and a t-shirt you never had anyone making comments on your clothes, even if they weren't designer brand or whatever. Just make sure they fit. 

Nobody cared if someone was a jock or cheerleader. In fact, there was quite a bit of overlap than any concrete lines between cliques. I was very firmly in the nerd category (glasses, bad hair, bad clothes, very shy and quiet, watched a lot of anime) and I hung out with a guy who wore earrings, had a foot-tall mohwak, and had a letter jacket. One of the more popular jocks was huge into theater. There were two cheerleaders who came to anime club meetings.

squeadunk,AskWomen,1390272706.0,"I don't know but I'm wondering if there is a subreddit that could help you or facebook groups that could help you find a ""community of like minded people.""

One thing I think is kind of neat about all of her pictures is that aesthetically it looks like her friends/community are quite different.  Obviously they share the bounds of culture/religion but many women are hijabi and wear traditional modest clothing while other women wear hijabs with western clothing, and still others do not wear hijabs at all.  

I cannot believe you are the only non-practicing muslim/believer.  But since you're non-practicing it does make it harder to meet people because you're not active in a religious community that has similar beliefs.

I'm kinda rambling here I think, but don't compromise yourself and I'm sure there are some online community resources out there that you can access :)"

Probably the biggest reason for the advice is a cultural one: motorcyclists are very conservative and risk conscious in some ways: it's a survival characteristic. (You think this is absurd? Well, we started wearing safety gear like leathers and helmets at least a decade before pilots started wearing parachutes, and about 50 years before cars got safety belts).

So since I'm very conservative myself, I'd find it difficult to take out a loan. However it would be rational if the cost of not having a bike (e.g. car fuel bills) was more than offset by the cost of having the loan (interest).

It's a really easy role to afk free farm when the rest of your team is on the ball to prevent ganks, ganking themselves and keeping control of the map (via wards and pushing lanes). At the same time, you can hand your carry the opportunity to farm on a silver platter, but if they're not good at it (like me, buh) or make bad calls, then that can really throw a game. There's a huge need for supports, mid, offlane, gankers, mid-game carries to keep control of the map for the carry to do their job.

whiskey-monk,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,1390272833.0,"When I was 14-15 I was jumping on a trampoline with a few of my older guy friends. They kept doing flips and jumping really high, so me, being small and at the time 110 lbs, would end up taking the brunt of their weight/force as it reflected off the trampoline. 

Eventually, because of all the people on that small thing, if we didn't jump at the same time, you'd be landing right as someone was pushing off. That with all the rubber pushing me up more than I normally would, I started slipping up. My friend jumped close to me, I went very high, foot landed on the edge, I slipped, and landed right on my neck on the safety bar before falling off and into the mud. I hear a snap, curses, gasps, and my sister screaming, ""OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!"". 

I see a flash then feel myself being picked up. My sister is holding my head. She caught me falling on camera and we watched it--you can see me slipping, basically snapping my neck (you can hear the crunch), and falling limp in the mud below. 

This was almost ten years ago and my sister deleted the video after a few rewatches because she didn't want our mother to see it (and thus get in trouble). I wish I still had it. It was on one of those old RAZR phones so I don't even know if it was transferable anyway.

TiburonVolador,Spanish,1390273231.0,"Hi there, this is indeed quite the odd question, but I may have an answer for you: [Taringa](http://www.taringa.net/) is a website that I have always known to hold many links and posts regarding a wide array of media and discussions. For a long time this was a reliable source for downloads, anything from PC games to whole music discographies! I am quite certain that anime is very much present there.

As for dubbed anime, I think it is a great idea! Oddly enough, dubbed anime has always been BIG in Latin America, I remember watching many when I was younger. They are all Mexican dubs, but have always been beautifully dubbed and I can honestly say that they achieve the rare balance of not being immediately distinguishable as a distinct variety of Spanish. Heck, Dragon Ball Z is ABSOLUTELY HUGE in Latin America, and there is an entire generation of people from Tijuana to Ushuaia that grew up with it. To prove it, said fandom has spawned the likes of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N85YNZVVgZc), a jewel of current Latin American internet culture.

Anyhow, that's all I can think of. As many other Latin Americans, I quite dislike Spanish dubs, but Spaniards may have very dedicated communities that you should check out, if you find them."

steve496,49ers,1390273294.0,"We also presumably will try to wrap up Aldon long-term.

I don't have a clear enough idea of how those long extensions will affect our cap next year to say for sure.  With the contracts we already have, plus a budget to sign next year's rookies, we're a couple million under the presumptive cap.  We can clear some more space by cutting people, although the only three people who we could cut that would clear more than $5 million are Willis, Gore, and Rogers, and Willis *so* is not happening.  There's 5 more that will clear between 2 and 5 million, but 4 of them (Crabtree, Staley, Vernon, and Brooks) are also not happening, so the only real option there is Glenn Dorsey.

So, depending on your assumptions regarding what sort of cap room we need to allow for extensions, I'd expect us to be able to keep 1 or 2 of the following 5 players (all of whom will take something like $5 million AAV to retain):

Frank Gore
Anquan Boldin
Donte Whitner
Carlos Rogers
Tarell Brown

Of those, I think Brown and Rogers are least likely to return; I don't know how the front office will prioritize Boldin, Whitner and Gore.

Also note that an alternative to cutting people outright (in the case of Rogers and Gore) would be to ask them to take pay cuts.  I doubt Rogers would, but Gore might consider it.

So... Boldin is a maybe.  I can imagine working out a 2 year (or so) contract with him that would be mutually agreeable.  We'd need to make cuts elsewhere to fit it in... but it might be worth it."

I went clothes shopping recently and tried on some skinny chinos. I used to wear skinny jeans but this was 2 and a half years ago. Anyway, not sure if I just wasn't used to them or what but they were really tight on my calves, thighs, crotch. Can't remember about ass but think the only place they did fit was my waist/hips.

Just wondering what your perspective on that is. I guess I cycle and walk in such a way that my legs get a good work out. When I flex my calves you can see my defined muscles. In reference to the crotch tightness, I'm also a subscriber to /r/BDP - I've had the issue before. I used to buy my chinos from just one shop because I liked the price and cut on the legs but, among other things, they were tight around the crotch so I had to find somewhere else to buy some."

&gt; She said her friends met a guy at the bar who started buying them shots.  He was touching her shoulders and mainly paying attention to her or so she says.  She said she got my text, he saw it and grabbed her phone telling her to ignore it and have fun.  This pissed me off to no end but I didn't say anything, I let her tell her stories.  

Pissed off is an understatement. Assuming her recollection of events is true, she let another man tell her to treat her boyfriend like a piece of shit. She said okay. 

Btw, despite alcohol being a factor here, it's interesting that she remembers the night fairly well. 

&gt;She said she made out with him and he drove her car back to his place and they had sex.  

Where were her friends during all of this? Cheering her on? Abandoning her? Was there no one else to drive her home? Didn't anyone see your girlfriend was drunk and was making horrible decisions? Ultimately it's her decision to cheat on you in the sleaziest way possible. But come on, not one of her friends tried to get her out of this situation? They sound like pieces of shit if you ask me.

And one more (painful) thing...she chose to fall asleep with him that night. After he and she disrespected you in the club, after she made out with him, after they had sex with one another, she then just fell asleep as the little spoon (assuming he had the courtesy to not kick her to the couch when he was done with her). 

Honestly, this situation reeks. Get out of there. Go no contact. Find a woman who doesn't turn into a slut when she has some drinks. And enjoy the rest of your life without her. Good riddance.

Is complaining about a movement that claims to represent a group of people enough to be considered hateful of that group of people?

&gt;If they really wanted to be taken seriously, they'd respond to criticisms with rational arguments rather than more shouting.

How? I'm very curious how you'd go about engaging in civil discourse with feminists in a public forum in the real world. If you happen to know any noteworthy feminists willing to have a discussion then please let the people at r/mensrights know. They've been dieing to find someone just like that.

Yet he comes nowhere close to the Machiavellian ideal, he does not rule a kingdom, he has quelled no rebellions, commanded no armies. Never has he had to keep small-folk contented. He has never done much to keep the kingdoms stable. This and more is exactly what is required of a prince who truly wishes to remain a prince, and rule over a stable and prosperous kingdom. Little-finger has over played his significance, terrorized withered and used political pawns and has never contributed to the statecraft of the kingdoms, even when he was given real opportunity to do so.

However if guys actually said this to you then likely they mean that you aren't very good at showing your interest. Remember that a guy generally isn't going to make moves or ask you out just because he's interested in you; he's going to have to have some sort of indication from you that he wouldn't be wasting his time.

This means you're going to have to work on being better able to flirt and show a guy you're interested in that you are indeed interested in him. ""Rough"" is the one of the last words that describe an effective flirting style for a woman who wants a man to ask her out. There are only a few things (like ""aloof"") that are worse. You want that feminine charisma that includes smiling, being playful, and being able to show your interest through light touch.

The other option is biting the bullet and actually making the moves / asking guys out yourself. I think this is a very good option for women to have in their arsenal of approaches to guys they're interested in, although it doesn't have to be the only one. It's a bit harder and you have to face the chance of being rejected but it lets you avoid any frustrations with trying to communicate through subtle hints."

dancingspring,AskReddit,1390273882.0,"DS9 is also my favorite series, but I think your friend erred in starting you off with it. A large part of what makes DS9 great is that it is essentially a deconstruction of Star Trek. Where TOS and TNG are based on the innate goodness of humanity and the ultimate triumph of rationality and justice, DS9 takes the same ideals and explores how they play out in a system that's inherently unjust. 

Kirk's response to the Kobayashi Maru - ""I don't believe in no-win scenarios"" - could be a metaphor for pre-DS9 Trek. When Kirk or Picard are forced to choose between two bad options, they demand a third solution. And someone finds it! The lesson is, never compromise your ideals. When Sisko is forced to choose between two bad options, in comparison, there is no third solution; the choice is what decision he can live with. But despite all that, the core message is the same: people are good. People will do what is right, when it really comes down to it, even if they're unhappy about it or conflicted. It's a messier optimism than earlier Star Trek, but, I think, ultimately easier to accept, because we can identify with characters who are fallible.

Dinaroozie,FeMRADebates,1390274027.0,"Ah, I should clarify. I agree completely that socially enforced gender roles are the root cause of the problems that face both men and women. I think fighting against them is something that feminists and MRAs should both be doing.

However, first off, I don't think it's fair to imply that MRAs *aren't* doing that. Certainly there is a camp of MRAs that seem to think that gender roles are awesome and feminists are ruining everything by breaking them down, but there are also MRAs that are opposed to gender roles.

Second, fighting the root cause of something isn't the only way of fighting it. For instance, I work in a very male-dominated industry (the games industry). The idea that women don't belong in gaming culture sucks, and I challenge it whenever it comes up. Yay me - I'm fighting the root cause of the problem, and I think it's important that people do that. However, there are also government grants for women in games, both in terms of scholarships for education, and for funding projects run by women. And there should be! The fact that I'm fighting the patriarchy by arguing that women can be good programmers too might mean that my granddaughter doesn't face the same problems that my sister does, but I think we should help my sister too. I think this is unlikely to be controversial among feminists.

The MRM should, and does, fight against patriarchy (although I doubt they call it that). However, that's not the only job worth doing. Indeed, I think a common (and fair, as far as I can see) criticism of the MRM is that they mostly talk about unfairness - 'raising awareness' if you will - but aren't hands-on enough about solving it.

For what it's worth, I'm not trying to attribute malice to anyone making this argument. I'm somewhat skeptical about the intentions of that particular author, but in general I see no reason to hate on someone for saying ""Hey MRM, get on our side, help fight the patriarchy!"" However, I think that carries a pretty strong implication of ""Feminists are already doing everything that needs to be done to help men with the issues they face"", and I think that's not really true. For what it's worth, that's not a criticism of feminism - I'm not of the opinion that it's feminsts' job to dedicate resources to helping with men's issues."

codayus,AskMen,1390274034.0,"&gt; acceptance of a fetish or sexual preferences

Acceptance as in ""she accepts that I have it""?  Critical, of course.  If someone can't accept who I am, they might be my friend, but they're not my SO.

Or do you mean ""...and she shares them and agrees to participate""?  Because that's a very different question.  And the answer to *that* is ""depends on the fetish"".  I have a lot of interests, desires, kinks, and fetishes.  Some are pretty important to me; some are mild curiosities.  If my SO shares enough to the big ones, I don't much care how many of the minor ones she shares.  On the other hand, she couldn't share enough of the minor ones to make up for not being a willing participant in the big ones.

Or in concrete terms:  I'm really into D/s; as a practical matter every successful relationship I ever have will have elements of D/s in it, and my SO will almost have to identify as a submissive or some variant thereof.  On the other hand, I find pegging can be kind of fun occasionally, and it's nice to mix things up a bit sometimes.  If my partner likes it too, great.  If not, no big deal; I could happily live without it too.  But if she can't accept that I like pegging (eg, if she has some weird idea that this makes me gay or submissive, and the mere fact that I've done it before and would be okay with doing it again changes her view of me), then we can't really be partners.

&gt; If you have a fetish and a no they didn't indulge me story, feel free to share.

I quite like anal (well, anything to do with butts, really, but including anal).  My SO finds anal penetration extremely painful; even a pinkie finger, inserted super slowly and with tons of lube hurts like fuck.  She has basically said that anal sex is therefore off the table until and unless that changes.  Which is fine with me, because it's not a huge thing.  (Besides, I know she's do it if she could, which takes a lot of the sting out.)

On the other hand, I broke up with an ex for...well, a lot of reasons.  But the proximate cause was her complete lack of interest/refusal to be submissive.  (She thought she wanted to be a submissive; turns out that just liking the movie *Secretary* isn't enough.  Who knew, right?)  Perfectly fine for her, and last I heard she's engaged, so I guess things are working out for her.  But not something I'm okay with, and I broke up with her.

**TL;DR:**  I require **acceptance** of all my kinks, and for the relationship to work, I'd need her to share/participate in some (not all) of my larger kinks.  I certainly don't expect someone to share *all* my kinks.  :)"

GoNavy_09,worldnews,1390274206.0,"I'm pretty sure they already do that though, considering that the top 1% pays literally 3x that of the high end middle class. Since about 1995 the most wealthy people in the nation have payed for well over 30% of the nation's entire taxes. Now that number is around 40%. 
Think about that. 1% of the population pays almost half the nation's entire needs. The top 10%, they pay about 70% of the *entire country's* bill. But yeah, you're right, that's not enough. They don't need all that money, I mean so what if they pay for 70% of all roads, food stamps, schools, police, firefighters, libraries and all the other hundreds of thousands of things this country uses on a daily basis! They should pay more, dammit! Those filthy freeloading job creators trying to get away with only 70%! Fuck those guys for being successful!! 

That's the problem with statists such as yourself. They have more than you, you don't like that. And so tax this and tax that and take this and take that, and then you wonder why the economy is in the toilet. If you don't like rich people, stop with the faux-intellectualism and have the cojones to admit it. Statists wouldn't know philosophy if it slapped them in the face with baseball bat. Philosophy is about the state of being, morality, what is right and wrong, what is duty. Utilitarianism, liberalism, consequentialism, nihilism, etc are all philosophies. But a ""philosophy"" that says you can arbitrarily take with force from anyone who has more than you isn't philanthropic, it isn't just, it isn't moral, its just rationalized thievery. As I said, you are literally no different that the Pope was way back when. Is the implementation different? Sure. But you know what's better for people than they do, so it's okay when you use military force to make someone do what you want, because after all, you're right. Problem is, what happens when someone says *you* have too much? I mean after all, anyone who isn't starving is already better off than basically the rest of the world, so what's your excuse? Why are you busy on reddit when you could be volunteering? Why do you pay for things you don't need when you could donate all your extra income to UNICEF? 
Bastiat put it very well, *The law is justice—simple and clear, precise and bounded. Every eye can see it, and every mind can grasp it; for justice is measurable, immutable, and unchangeable. Justice is neither more than this nor less than this. If you exceed this proper limit—if you attempt to make the law religious, fraternal, equalizing, philanthropic, industrial, literary, or artistic—you will then be lost in an uncharted territory, in vagueness and uncertainty, in a forced utopia or, even worse, in a multitude of utopias, each striving to seize the law and impose it upon you. This is true because fraternity and philanthropy, unlike justice, do not have precise limits. Once started, where will you stop? And where will the law stop itself?*

injoy,Christianity,1390274393.0,"Ah, see, I resonate with *so much* of that.

I guess I struggle with the thought that sometimes the ""peacemaking"" thing might be violent, if done within the auspices of authority.  Like, for a lone Christian to lay down arms is a testimony, yes, but for a government to use the sword as a ""terror to bad conduct"" (Romans 13:3-4) is a good, godly thing.  And so I would extrapolate from that that a *lawful* and humble, regretful use of violence would be allowed, although certainly not mandated.  Christ on the cross was certainly very non-violent, but what about Christ driving out the money-changers?  Paul didn't defend himself with *violence*, but he certainly used arguments and the law to preserve his life.  Why would the lack of self-defense not apply to making self-defensive arguments as well as physical violence?

I have huge respect for your position and am strongly swayed toward it.  I teach my children using a Mennonite school curriculum (Christian Light).  :)  Matthew 5:39 in particular is hard to argue against, to me.  I'm just not quite convinced that total non-violence is biblical, and not just pro-peacemaking, anti-vengeance, self-sacrificing... I guess I am not sure that self-sacrificing  (which I agree is biblical in the extreme) necessarily translates to total lack of self-defense.  Can't we defend ourselves in the name of peace and harmony on a larger scale, i.e., a lawful society?"

AccountHaver25,SubredditDrama,1390274507.0,"My theory for why people don't take genderqueer seriously is because of the Internet. Genderqueer people probably couldn't explain their feelings until they saw genderqueer communities on the Internet. Not to say genderqueer communities didn't exist before the Internet because they did. This has made people skeptical of non-binary identities and they see it as an Internet fad.

This is coupled with non-binary genders being ignored. Most people don't know that there are people who aren't exclusively a man or a woman or either at all. This makes it easier to be skeptical as people were towards binary trans identities. Indeed in the future /r/TiA may claim to be supportive of actual genderqueer people and not fake genderqueer people like they are doing with trans* identities in general."

i_lick_telephones,AskWomen,1390274544.0,"I'm only 21, so lemme see how I'm doing so far:

* Did I travel: Before my 20s, I have lived in London, England, been to Scotland (no memory), been to Canada, New York, most other states along the east coast several times, Texas, etc. Exclusive to my 20s: Went to Disney World for the umpteenth time and went on a cruise to the bahamas/virgin islands

* Accomplished goals?: Still working on it. I'm about to graduate with my bachelors of science for sociology with a minor in criminal justice, so that's a goal pretty much completed.

* Friendships: Yes, I've made some truly wonderful friends, and met nice people in general.

* Successful relationships: Yes, finally. Here's to hoping it'll stick.

* Dream job: Not yet. I'm waiting till I'm out of school for that one. I'm too young to expect for that now anyway.

* Move out: I live away from parents, but they pay for my bills. So yes and no.

* Graduate: I will have my bachelors diploma by 21, so yes, I will be on time for that.

I still have most of my 20s left, but things look okay most of the time. Maybe it will all change for the worst, and this is the best I'm going to have it. I think I'll be okay though, and have a lot more to say when I hit 25 and then 30. Everyone goes at their own pace though, so no one should worry too much."

The funny thing is, I somehow still manage to be insanely productive with school work (though it causes me much anxiety). I'm in grad school and have a 3.9 GPA, but I do nothing else really. I find that having the routine of classes and work to focus on is a nice distraction from being in my head all the time. The in-betweens are awful though... Cried on the train ride to school so many times last semester. It also causes me not to have any energy to devote to anything else so I end up feeling completely overwhelmed when there is not even that much going on. Everything I have goes into school. I don't even know what I want to do with my life, so I feel disconnected from that too, even though I devote so much of myself to it. I feel bad complaining about how I feel when there are people who can't even get out of bed, but the fact that I manage to hold together some semblance of a life means that no one that I love or care about recognizes how hard I'm struggling every day and how much it takes out of me to do this."

onionnion,technology,1390274963.0,"I need to clear something up for the sake of conversation going on here:

ISPs typically advertise their speeds in mb (megabits). This number is NOT the same as you usually see when you're downloading stuff via your browser and even CLI download utilities; those things almost always use MB (megabytes) which is a larger form of data measurement:

1b    = 0.125B

1kb  = 0.125kB

1mb = 0.125MB

and so on.


Here's a good, simple calculator for this: http://www.matisse.net/bitcalc/ (please don't crash the server).

For example purposes, they're launching a theoretical maximum in SK of 300mb/s downstream, meaning how fast download speeds are:

300 * 0.125 = 37.5MB/s

Here in the US, I'm forced to use Time Warner Cable. Their advertised price for my plan is 15mb/s downstream, 2mb/s upstream (upload speed):

15 * 0.125 = 1.875MB/s

2 * 0.125 = 0.25MB/s, or 256KB (kilobytes)

Honestly, my downstream has actually been very good (the limit has been more 2MB rather than barely under that) but my upstream has only hit half that amount at most, so in my area I get surprisingly good service from them, but it may also just be my amazingly good modem (Motorola SB6141)."

But if you've ever watched her, you can't tell that she's really, really nervous.  Almost everyone I know who is a good public speaker is actually scared inside, but they've learned techniques on how not to show it.

If you ever want to have job that is above entry-level, you're going to have to be able to speak in front of others.  Instead of stressing out about this, think of it as an opportunity to better yourself - like a cool new tool for your job toolbelt.

The whole point of taking a communications class is to learn how to communicate better.  If you were already comfortable speaking in front of a group of people, there'd be no point for you to take that class.  Everyone else in that class is in the same boat.  

You might be the most nervous person there, but I have never in my life met an undergraduate who was *not* nervous speaking in front of the class, no matter how confident they seem.

MrTinkels,AskMen,1390275179.0,"Ok here's the thing, **every girl is different**. What may work on one, won't work on another. With that being said... 

Step 1: If you've already got a pre-set date for when it's going to happen, text her that day before the event and say something like ""Hey, I'm really looking forward to tonight. =)"" or some shit. If you two are super comfortable with each other, don't be afraid to make it a little raunchy. Main objective here is to just get her mind going in that direction and build some anticipation. 

Step 2: **CLIP YOUR FUCKING NAILS.** File them too so there aren't any sharp edges. You're gonna be rootin' around in there and you don't want to tear her up. Also just practice good hygiene. Brush your teeth and shit, take a shower, take a shit, whatever you need to do in order to just focus on her. 

Step 3: Alright, now that you're prepped, it's time to prep her. Don't skimp on the foreplay, dude. You want her to feel like a horse's mouth before you even get near there (sorry for the bad visual, guys.). Make out, fondle, tweak a nipple or two, world's your oyster man. Just put in the leg work to make this amazing. 

Step 4: Alright, you're down in the trenches now, man. Panties off, between her legs. First things first **don't freak the fuck out.** The female vagina can be intimidating the first time you're face to face with it and I've seen full grown men wet themselves in terror. It's gonna have all sorts of weird smells and tastes, but if she's fairly hygienic they won't be unpleasant and you'll grow to love them most likely. Just take a moment to get the lay of the land. Maybe do a little mental cartography and jot down a map in your head of where everything is because you're not really gonna be able to see it once you dive in. 

Step 5: Still not there yet, sorry bud. This is where you kiss the inside of her thighs, graze your lips across her skin, let your tongue dance it's way down to her groin ever so slowly. Get close to her slit then pull away, make her squirm a bit. You want her to be almost to the point of begging for it if you can help it. 

Step 6: Get in there. You want to focus mostly on the clit because shoving your tongue into her opening isn't gonna do much. Lick it up and down, on either side, in circles, and watch her reaction. Shit, try sucking on it too. You want your mouth to be pretty on it too. Think of eating a really ripe peach. That's how you want your mouth to be. Just go to town man. Use your fingers too! Put one or two inside of her and start pushing in and out slowly. With your palm upwards, curl your finger as if you're telling someone to 'Come here' and feel the top of her wall. Search for a spot that feels... fleshier than the rest of it and focus on rubbing that and watch her reaction. If nothing is happening, start shuffling around to other spots. Explore her! She might have a button on the bottom somewhere and you'll never know if you don't push everywhere you can!

Step 7: Long haul. Do. Not. Come. Up. Until. She's. Done. If your tongue get's tired, deal with it. Clamp your lips around your tongue and use your entire head to move up and down to catch a break, but you stay in there and you persist, goddamnit. 

Step 8: Lavish in the glorious victory that is making a woman orgasm. Eat a steak, smoke a cigar, enjoy life. "

Life-in-Death,vegan,1390275245.0,"About to go BACK to school.

I was a bit like you.  I was paralyzed trying to figure out the ""perfect"" career.  Trying to figure out the ultimate life.  So I was scared to commit to anything until I ""knew.""

What I wish someone had told me is that you will have many *careers* in your life.  You will probably end up doing something you have never heard of.  Or something that doesn't even exist yet.  And that your job doesn't really matter necessarily.

You can do everything you want to do: travel, do good works, etc. while you have a normal job.  

One of my good friends was a top White House lawyer.  Now he invests, has tons of money, gives it all to vegan organizations and just started a vegan cheese company.  

Another was an Engineer.  Then he wanted to write.  He now runs a magazine and travels the world for stories.  

Another never went to college, she waitressed, ran a restaurant, then in her late 20s went to college.  Now she is in grad school studying forensics.

Another got a degree in Library Science.  She then restored art.  Till she put a hole in a valuable piece.  She then was a receptionist.  Then got into UI for a huge company.

I have worked training dolphins, studying rhinos, managing restaurants, teaching, consulting, working in science labs (almost went to med school)

And I am still changing what I want to do.

But the word is ""do.""  It doesn't matter where you start.  You can always make a left turn.   

And you don't need a million degrees.  It depends on what you want to do.  I've been hearing about Coursera? on reddit lately.  Free online college courses from great universities (no credit unless you pay, of course).

Get a job.  Get a car.  Start taking classes in something.

jianadaren1,AskSocialScience,1390275248.0,"In absence of evidence that it's some sort of conspiracy, it's pretty clear that these loans aren't profitable enough to be issued at lower interest rates. [The FDIC reported in 2005 that payday loans ""may not necessarily yield extraordinary profits""](http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/2005/wp2005/cfrwp_2005-09_flannery_samolyk.pdf) (pg 10).

First, these are extremely high credit-risk loans: they're targeted to people who almost by definition have bad credit and low income. The FDIC estimates that $6.02-$9.17 per loan is lost due to credit risk (Ibid).

Second, they are very small loans of very short duration so high annual rates are necessary to profit on any individual loan - the FDIC estimates that the average loan is between $230-$260, the average duration is 14 days, the average fee is $39-$47, implying an average APR range of 390%-580%. In order to cover the default risk alone, they'd need to charge at least 60% (still usurious and twice as bad as credit cards).

But that's not the only cost, they still need to operate the business, which the FDIC estimates costs $19.08-$26.94 per loan (though this is mostly an allocation of a fixed cost rather than a marginal cost). So even just to break even, you need to charge crazy rates to approach profitability, and these places often don't. 

In short, this is a shitty and inefficient industry and it would appear that the banks want nothing to do with it."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390275287.0,"&gt;It's supposed to provide a level playing field where men or women can approach each other in a casual environment without the threat of personal rejection.

I'm not sure that's true.  It's a place to meet people online for those that are unable to, don't want to, or don't know how to meet people in person.  I don't think it has anything to do with approaching each other.  I can see *why* people might think it's good for having anyone be able to approach anyone since in person rejection is harder for probably everyone, but I don't think that leveling the playing field is really the purpose.

&gt;What it does is allows people to be way more picky than they would ever be in real life.

Uh, people can be just as picky in real life if they wanted to.  They just aren't because there's less selection.  The beauty of online dating?  If you really want to be picky, you can be, because there are so many people on there.  Let's assume percentage matching is accurate just for the sake of argument.  Let's say someone goes to a bar and they meet 5 people.  How many of them are going to be an 80+% match?  Through online dating, you can filter *just* by match percentage if you'd like, or just skip the ones that aren't a match.  You have a higher probability of finding people that are actually compatible, where in person, you have to hope to get lucky, and people are probably more likely to settle for ""good enough"" rather than ""great.""

&gt;Despite what people say, it's really hard to get a feel for someone's personality based on an online profile. 

I think this is where people fail.  Online dating is *not meant* to get personality.  That's not the goal.  Imagine these people are ""dating applicants.""  You use their profile to judge their qualifications, maybe email them or talk on the phone to see if they're interested, and then you meet in person to see if their personality will fit.  

That's exactly what I did and it was a piece of cake.  I realize I can't judge someone from their profile, so I don't.  I see if we're compatible in the ways that matter or if there are any major red flags.  Then I send a particular style of message, and if conversation continues, we meet in person.  That's not even a date, that's to see if we *want* a date.  If we get along, conversation flows, have a good time, etc., then we go on a date and go from there.  I've done it a couple times and have yet to be on there for more than 2 weeks.  If you understand how the system works, it's easy.  It's not equivalent to the traditional way of meeting people, and if you treat it like that, then that's your fault, not the system."

Omega037,changemyview,1390275414.0,"&gt; This isn't about me being poor, rather, it's about quality.

Except that your inability to afford it is fueling your opinion, not facts.  In other words, if you had been offered a free lifetime subscription, you would probably be happy about the model and excited about how great the quality is going to be.

&gt; They can work, but I still believe that the micro-transaction based model is better (Mainly in regards to community).

Perhaps, but historically some of the largest and most dedicated communities have been subscription-based MMOs.  Certainly the largest and longest lasting ones have been.

&gt; Though I do think for the level of quality that ESO provides, it does not warrant a subscription model.

I think the quality will be the same regardless of the model.

&gt; It would work just as well as with a micro-transaction based model, and throw in a upfront payment in with that and it might possibly even gain more profits than a subscription, but Zenimax using the the sub model is just money milking.

Honestly, I am not sure how you can simultaneously accuse them of being both ""money milking"" and yet supposedly using a model that would generate less profit.

They are choosing the model that they know through actual market research is better.  They have millions of dollars on the line and likely hire top firms to do this analysis.  Your opinion is just supposition.

&gt; Side note; I would give you a delta, but you changed my view not on this question but on the question regarding subscription based models. I'm sorry. ;-;

According to the rules, deltas are given when any part of your views are changed in any way.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1390275632.0,"&gt; Source: graduated top of my law class, became lawyer at largest firm, worked my ass off, realised I was getting exploited getting paid a pittance relative to my charge out rate, did the maths on your investments, realised I'll become a millionaire when I'm 40, stopped thinking like a drone, started my own business, now a millionaire at 27.

If your source is truthful, it works against your point. The fact that you graduated at the top of your class and became a lawyer at a large firm for your area already puts you ahead of the curve.

I've read The Millionaire Fastlane, and like a lot of the books that its author DeMarco criticizes, it's mainly focuses on engendering broad, positive philosophies along with generally agreeable / unspecific advice. It's stuff that most higher-salary professionals and business owners already hear enough and agree with, but it's orthogonal to Nemester's comment.

There's a reason why we hear from a lot of venture capitalists ""invest in the person, not the idea"". That these ideas worked for you says more about you than it does for the ideas (which are in all honesty broad). Your own comment all but confirms it. You were already around the top of your law class, had a tendency to work your ass off, and cared about money (enough to care about what age you'd become a millionaire). If all that is true, I'd have predicted you'd eventually become a millionaire, relatively early on. It's really not *that* difficult.

My younger sibling became a multimillionaire at 23. He owes it to no self-help book. He told me he literally got most of his life philosophies from me (very flattering). The difference was that he's more competent and harder working and able to implement ideas more effectively. That's it. The guy is just fucking autistic/focused, observant, and hard working. Graduated with perfect grades while dual majoring in the toughest two majors at the top engineering school. He was recognized in multiple honors societies so he didn't even need to be social to have the connections. How much can the average guy rely on the exact path he took through life?

I don't mean to be a downer and dash the dreams of people stuck at the top of the bell-curve, but there are clear justifiable reasons why a lot of people here prefer to talk about specific topics such as the ones in this thread. The par folk need to be led with specifics. The above-par people have already got most of it figured out and still want ideas they can judge for themselves. You can offer suggestions like The Millionaire fast lane, and they'll have the personal drive to look through it themselves and compare with other suggestions (like Nemester's and others').

(Just in case there's any confusion, I'm not trying to excuse laziness. I've said clearly that it has mostly to do with hard work, focus, and positive attitude.)

That being said, The Millionaire Fastlane is great. Starting your own business is great for people who don't mind the sacrifice and (what the book refers to as) ""monogamy"". Note though that a lot of people in this subreddit seem to have understandable aversions to ""monogamous investments"", but I'm sure the smarter ones will be able to judge the risk/sacrifices vs the rewards. It's not a reason to dismiss what Nemester is saying though."

Mephrael,AskReddit,1390275641.0,"&gt; Go read Lord of the Flies. It shows it perfectly.

Lord of the Flies was more a study on the idea of humanity descending into chaos without strong authority figures to hold them in line. The fact that the characters were all children wasn't a core component of the story, or at least so I personally believe. 

I was 28 when my ex admitted to cheating on me for the last time, this time with someone who was supposed to be one of my closest friends. I'm very glad I didn't have to drive anywhere when it happened, because the sheer amount of conflicting rage and sadness may well have resulted in vehicular manslaughter. About the only reason I didn't do something permanent to either of them was due to a mutual friend that I respected greatly talked me down from going all jolly green hulk."

shosta-bro-vich,AskReddit,1390275650.0,"I feel like many people like to paint a picture of the shitty American high school. Mine was not so bad though. However, I should note, at this point, that I come from a very small, college prep school. I found that many of us were too caught up in our own business that we mostly just kept the insults to a minimum. There were never any fights; the only violence was minimal, and swiftly dealt with. The only shit that ever happened would be that pathetic drama queens would sometimes start awful rumors. My best friend was the recipient of a lot of stupid gossip and drama that caused her a lot of grief, but she quickly withdrew herself, and is doing better now. Generally, those drama queens fell out of favor within a year or two after their popularity rose. 

However, this was my school; one that had a graduating class of less than 100. My sister did go to a much bigger school, probably 10 times the size, and I do hear of a lot more shit that went down there. My dad also teaches at a big school, typically one with lower income families, and he also sees more vulgarities than what existed at my school. 

Overall, I feel like the general stereotypes of American high schools is a bit overdone. There is no incessant cycles of bullying that exist, normally. Kids are not fighting around every corner. If anything, bullying is concentrated to small groups of people, or just two individuals themselves. Sometimes that bullying can escalate to an overwhelming level; other times, the individuals forget about it because the subject is futile. There are factions in every school, and sometimes the factions (like nerds and the social butterflies, or if you prefer, populars) disagree on fundamental levels, like differing interests (""You watch Star Trek? What the fuck?"") or differing apparel (""You're wearing 4 inch stilletos to school? What the fuck?""). 

Overall, however, we were prepubescent teenagers who tended to think every small problem or conflict was a ""big deal,"" when in reality, it wasn't. These overreactions led to the small amounts of ""drama"" that existed in high school. Looking back, though, I can honestly say that modern depictions or ideas of American high school are overly dramatized. Especially when you have certain tv shows like Glee. My high school experience in no way came close to that. That show only contributes to the overwhelming stereotype of American high school. Maybe the difference between this stereotype and real high school experience is that each one of us made a choice about what we wanted our experience to be. I chose a path that allowed to exist free of any drama, and so I led a pleasurable existence free from unnecessary chaos. 

Well damn, that was a lot of words. Sorry for the word vomit, here's a tl;dr!

Tl;dr - American high school may be portrayed as an adolescent shit-hole, but in reality, these stereotypes are overplayed, and I found  plenty of opportunities to grow because I chose to not get involved in pointless drama.

Edit: Words..."
mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1390275651.0,"&gt;Even a high SMV male will become mocked and ridiculed by women if he lets himself go. You're not guaranteed to be George Clooney when you're older, you gotta constantly work to achieve that. 

But the difference is that a man of age 60 can work at it and succeed in sustaining his SMV.

A woman of 60 eventually puts in so much workout time that she ends up looking like a dude. My oldest niece has a mother-in-law who tries to neg her for not working out hardcore, and my niece just blows her off by telling her that she's titless and has bigger delts than some guys.

The nice actor boy let himself go. For women -- except for the rare genetic freaks who just have it and the even more rare one who has a good plastic surgeon who doesn't make her look like a circus freak -- there's no surviving the wall. You can't fight back against it. 

And even if you do maintain your figure, it doesn't change the fact that the ovary mill is shut down and that's just that. Like it or not, lots of guys are going to pass on Sophia Loren.

* My very first flowering plant was deliberately a half ass attempt under a light with the sole purpose in mind of finding out what the process is like. My second was months later outside with 7 plants in the ground and 2 in buckets; I did good enough to impress my 'sensei' at the time and pulled a hefty harvest. 

-The bigger lesson was learning how to properly cure and store. Right off the bad I taught myself how to deep cure the buds which payed off. When storing the buds I learned that

A) Not to store donkey dicks, or too much stem. Over a couple months, the miniscule amount of moisture in those massive stems is enough to harbor mold.

B) Anything bigger than quart jars are not optimal for curing, moisture control, or storing. Half Gallon jars are also too big because buds get smashed at the bottom. Stick to wide mouth

C) It's more difficult to cure bud in very small containers due to moisture control.

- I lost about 1/5 of weed my very first true harvest. It's a learning process. I how ever ride a very fine line between deep curing and the risk of mold (about 4 weeks from the ground to long term storage ready.) It's risky, but the finished flower is worth it. 

-I condone you to keep a vigilant eye on the flower for the first two weeks after harvesting; don't be afraid to let it dry a little fast, because slightly hot burning flower is better than no flower.

-Also once storage ready, you want to keep the container opening to a minimum, because oxygen makes the flower brown and spicy over time (months.) I suggest you keep a personal nug/desk jar full of 2-3 weeks worth of flower at a time so your not reaching into a main container every time you wish to smoke.

---

* ""Which strain is good for transitioning?"", this is a little tricky, because I'm not sure exactly what you are wanting to transition to. 

-Strains like blue dream can be tall, but has amazing flowers worth smoking. I won't comment on production amount because my plant was crossbred. Seams to finish a little later.

-Afgoo isn't difficult to feed, but I know of it to have a retarded growth pattern (genetics?) which requires scrogging, production is 'fair', the scent is like insane sweet pineneedles, the buds would be better described as particularly large fluffy gems, very potent.

-Can try OG if you are interested in a super dense indica. Shorter stature, massive leaves and annoyingly thick vegetation. Amazing producer but the amount of foliage makes growing and trimming a challenge.

-NYCD is actually a great producer, and is greedy for extra nutrients. But even clones can be overly aggressive vertical growers, with colas that can double in height during flower. If you are super aggressive in topping &amp; training it, it will make a great scrog plant as its flowers are concentrated at the cola's when you top. [I had to top mine every week in a desperate attempt to keep it below 7ft outside.](http://i.imgur.com/XEcY45J.jpg) I was more lenient on the one in the greenhouse and it had two tops that could reach higher than the canopy with colas the size of my fists. (The more you top, the more tops you'll have, but the buds will be respectfully smaller, clean up below the top canopy, and the buds will all be sized perfectly for normal use; I prefer it that way. Lots of weight.)

-**Honestly, in my experience,** I have to suggest green crack. It smells great, has a balanced smoke and the buds are denser than average. It's a slightly above-average yield, grows quick but never gets out of control. The limbs are a little weaker &amp; get weighed down quickly in flower. Branches develop randomly up and out with out uniformity (not nearly as bad as afgoo) but is rather predictable once you've watched the plant grow. Where some strains win botanist favor with their foxtails, oversized calyx or blue/purple color, GC wins with it's sweet narcotic scent, gemlike trich.development &amp; it's signature [light green flowers with short-curly rich-orange stigmas](http://fadedfools.com/medical_marijuana/greencrack4.jpg). I recommend you scrog it, or support the limbs with sticks all the way around the growing container.

---

* Tips? Ig I just have to say, start simple, don't overwhelm yourself, and don't be afraid of screwing up because *it is only your first time.* Keep your nutrient program to a minimum with no more than 1-3 products. If your in soil, make sure it's not heavy, and breaths well (add perlite). The more oxygen the roots get, the faster their metabolism is.

No. No it can't. Something that has been ""redrawn to fit the scene"" cannot be produced by tracing over lines of another piece. That would mean that it was not redrawn to fit the scene, as it would be an exact duplicate of the original. If it were not, then there would be no point in tracing to begin with.

&gt;Ukiyo-e isn't a common art style.

Yes it is. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of surviving ukiyo-e works that were produced prior to the 19th century and there are many modern artists that practice this style.

&gt;It's a genre of woodblock printing common in the Edo period of Japan around the 17th-19th centuries.

Yes. It's a genre of woodblock printing common in the Edo period of Japan, *which OP chose to use in his work*. Did you forget to read the part of the title that says ""Reenvisioned[sic] as Feudal Japan""?

&gt;yes it is

No it isn't. I can use unsupported statements as arguments too.

&gt;Look at this blatant Chinese knockoff. compared to the real one. So you're telling me that ""Ash"" and ""Pikachu"" are clearly not the same because of a lot of differences?

That's called false equivalence. You're showing me a specific character that was drawn by a second artist and equating it to an artist using a similar art style for his characters.

&gt;Like I said, it DOES look like the original inspiration for Ned's head is from the picture I linked, which still applies my argument that it was copied/redrawn from an existing piece.

Even if what you were saying is true (which it undoubtedly is not), this wouldn't support your argument that the work in OP is copied from an existing piece. You've seized on a superficial resemblance of two characteristics and ignored the lack of congruence of the rest. I pointed out the tuft of beard because it was the first thing that came to mind. Look at the rest of the face. 

* The ear is not present in your picture.
* The hair is wavy and flowing rather than jagged.
* The cheekbones are gaunt and protrude.
* The facial hair connects to the head hair.
* The nose has a concave bridge rather than a convex one.
* The eyebrows are uplifted rather than furrowed.
* The tongue is visible as if the figure is mid-scream.
* The neck looks emaciated, with a prominent adam's apple rather than fat.

And those are just the features of the face. The rest of the figure, the clothes, the body language — none of it is even remotely similar. About the only two things that *are* similar are the bulging eyes and the grimace. It's certainly possible that this piece served as the inspiration for the art in OP, but it is far, far from being a copy. If that is your point of view of art, then I shudder to think of your perception of other pieces, including masterworks, that borrow heavily from previous developments in style and form.

&gt;Regarding Ned's head, there's no way in hell any other ukiyo-e artist would have their subject all look the same when their heads look that direction at that angle, which is why I quickly recognized the original piece. Don't make assumptions.

marco262,AskReddit,1390275846.0,"Throwing in another vote for ""Call them back before giving them any sensitive information.""

I once had my bank call me to let me know that someone had made a suspicious charge on my account. The girl on the other end gave me the details, I confirmed it was false, and they canceled my card and gave me instructions for how to contest the charges.

She then forwarded me to another person who could sign me up for a new card. She asked me for my full name, my SSN, my birthdate... it was right about then that I realized what I could be getting myself into. I'd already given her my SSN, but I told her that I didn't know for certain that she was ACTUALLY with my bank, and that I didn't feel comfortable giving her more information just now, and I would call the bank back later that night.

She was very understanding about it, thankfully. I checked my bank account and confirmed that someone did make a fraudulent charge. I called the bank back later that night, and first confirmed that someone DID try to call me earlier that day, then signed up for the new card.

TL;DR I was lucky I didn't just give my SSN to a scammer. Never trust a received call when giving out sensitive info. A legit organization will understand.

This was towards the end of my senior year. I was walking from my english class to go to the bathroom to wash ink (pen exploded) off my hand when the fire alarm went off.  So as usual everyone gathers outside school and then after about 10 minuts we go back in. It was a normal day after that until last period when I was then called down to the office. They told me someone pulled the fire alarm on the 3rd floor (near my class) and they looked through the hallway logs (forms every teacher has that kids sign to leave class for the bathroom) and thought I had pulled the alarm. As I deny it they then asked why my hand was discolored as I couldn't get alot of the ink out but they didn't believe me and said the discoloring was from ink that shoots put when you pull the alarm. I ended up getting suspended and then kicked out of NHS (National Honor Society), Tri-M (Music Honor Society) as well as getting stripped of many scholarships and awards.

most_of_the_time,AskReddit,1390275935.0,"I had gestational diabetes which is the same as type 2, it's just induced by pregnancy.

This is how my doctor explained it to me:

Your pancreas is like the driver of your insulin, which is what regulates the sugar levels in your blood.  The pancreas is trying to keep the car on the middle of the road so that your sugar levels are steady. Diabetes messes up the steering so that it overcorrects.  So you have too much sugar and your pancreas is like ""OH NO STEER LEFT"" but it swerves all the way to the left, and you drive off the road, and bam hypoglycmia. 

This is why when you have diabetes you are supposed to eat more, smaller meals throughout the day, to keep your sugars level. If your pancreas has to steer to correct it's going to be driving all over the road. You shouldn't do it with cookies and dorritos though, those have too many carbs in them. My nutritionist told me 3 snacks and 3 meals a day, 15-30 g of carb per snack, 30-45 g of carb per meal, 2000 calories per day.

Edit: The reason the snacks need to be low carb is that carbs enter your blood stream quickly and really spike your sugar. So the point of eating more meals throughout the day is to keep your sugars level, but if your meals are carb heavy they will spike your sugars instead."

_masterofdisaster,NBA2k,1390276073.0,"Ok I had this problem too. Any time I would start a new mode. myGM or myCareer, this is what would happen.

*MyGM- I would make 2 roster changes and it would send me back to the main screen. If I tried to open it again, it would take me to a Timberwolves in-game MyCareer save that I had previously deleted. The MyGM never showed up again and the Wolves myCareer was un-deleted.

*MyCareer- It would let me play in, and complete, the Rookie Showcase, but would send me back to the main screen after it showed me my VC earnings. I would open it up again, and it would send me straight to the interviews, skipping the post game talk with Jackson Ellis and stuff with the agent. I would get to the second question of the second team interview before it cut out again. I would open it again and it would send me to my un-deleted Wolves MyCareer in-game save.

If either one if these is what happened to you, here's what I had to do (twice). First, I removed my account from my Xbox One. This step is very important because if you don't account stays on there when you create the new account. Then, I created a new account, myPlayer and Microsoft. Now it should start fresh, albeit losing previous gamerscore, VC, and progress on other modes (not sure about myTeam, I don't play it).

- **Did you travel?** Yes!  While in high school, I registered myself for one of those high schoolers study abroad programs (The Experiment in International Living), got a hefty scholarship for it too so I could actually afford to go.  My mom had me and my older sister in private high school at this point so money was tight...dad was a deadbeat.  I went to a super rural area of Japan to study the language and to this day, that experience has still impacted my life and outlook on life.  In college, I registered myself for a similar type of study abroad thing to Taiwan (this one sponsored by the Taiwanese government, it was VERY cheap...basically airfare + $500 USD for a summer).  I think you have to be Chinese for it?  Kind of like that govt. sponsored trip all Jewish people can have back to Israel.  Anyway, I worked during summers and during my college semesters to save up money to do trips like that.  Went on a vacation to Japan as well on my own dime.  But if you're still in school, it's definitely easier to find a school exchange program, and I have NEVER met a person who did study abroad and didn't like it.  Usually they gush about it annoyingly, like me...haha.  My college happened to lack these programs for Asia, they only have connections to Italy.  I don't mean to scold anyone, but what I do wanna say is if you want to travel...get a passport, save up some money...you can totally travel internationally on a budget.  Especially to Asia, where your biggest expense is the plane ticket...once you get there, food and everything else (depending on the country) is cheaper than in the US.  I keep a Google Map of ""where I've slept"" in the world, meaning I don't count places I only passed through.  I've been to many countries by this point but I am not done exploring.  Traveling is a huge love of mine, and is something I try to make time for and save up for.  A lot of times my parents are against me doing stuff like this, or friends bail out and don't want to travel anymore.  It happens...but I still manage to travel internationally way more often than your typical American.  I think everyone in the world should go to another country and see how life is like there.  I've been to a good number of North American areas as well, though they don't excite me as much as international travel.  Groupon Getaways has really been tempting me, but I haven't got anyone to agree to come with me on those yet.  I actually find it easier to plan for a trip on a budget....it gives me a solid goal when I look at pricing.  While you are young, I would say go for hostels and all that other budget stuff....it's way easier to do while young, and you'll probably meet a lot of people your own age doing backpacking on the cheap as well.  Potential for new international friends :D

- **Have you accomplished your goals?**  Okay, I'm not really sure what my goals are.  This could be a problem.  I just want a job where I can support myself and be happy with the people I love...

- **Did you have great friendships?**  Yes.  I have a few friends that are very close to me.  I also lost a few friends that used to be very close to me.  I have been through betrayals, but I've been through great times as well.  I'm slowly learning how to recognize toxic friends and shed them, and how to protect myself against those who want to step all over me.

- **What about successful relationships?**  Sure.  Though compared to others I am pretty immature in terms of romantic relationships.  My first boyfriend and I got together when I was 21, and we stayed together for 3 years.  Half of that time, in the beginning, it was a long distance relationship.  In the end it didn't pan out and we broke up...good riddance.  I'm now with a guy whom I love, and I'd say it's pretty successful...we're over 1 year now.  But it's an ongoing effort, so I can't fully answer this, I guess.  I'm only interested in long term relationships.

- **Did you land your dream job?**  Not entirely sure what my ""dream job"" is, never have been.  But I love what I do.  I work in post production, making commercials.  I get to do art for a living.  It's great!  In terms of that, I would say I'm successful.  A lot of classmates from high school seem very aimless right now....most went to grad school or law school and most are still trying to find jobs.  I was working in my chosen industry while still in college, which helped me a lot.  Seems like those in my undergrad class who took backup jobs ended up doing their back up jobs instead of really getting in to what we went to school for.

- **Did you move out?**  No.  Me and my boyfriend were in serious talks to move out together (he has roommates) this 2014, but that has been put on the backburner.  It's difficult to find an apartment that's &lt;$2000 and in a good location here, so for now we're just going to remain in separate apartments.  We both have fairly cheap rent for the time being, so we are saving up instead.

- **Did you graduate on time?**  Yes!  I was worried I wouldn't.  I was working nights pretty much full time during senior year of college....and it felt like a Catch-22.  I needed to work to make tuition.  But because I spent so many hours working, I was failing my classes.  A couple teachers and even the department head had a talk with me, urging me to quit to focus on my schoolwork.  I took their advice...luckily I hoarded money like Scrooge so I did have enough to carry me through the rest of the year.  Graduated on time!"

A **mandoline** is a vegetable slicer with a sharp blade set in a tracklike housing so that you just wipe the potato, for example, back and forth on it and perfect thin slices pop out the bottom.

**Julienne** is the name of a style of chopping where the cut pieces come out like french fries.

Some mandolines have a single blade, some have a single blade set at an angle, some have a pair of blades in a v-shape. For everyday use, the v-shape blades seem to be the easiest to work with.

My mandoline has a set of inserts that allow me to modify how it cuts the food. I can slice thick or thin, and I can julienne narrow or wide.

&gt;And if there is anything that I have learned in life, you will not find that passion in things. And you will not find that passion in money. Because the more things and the more money you have, the more you will just look around and use that as the metric — and there will always be someone with more. Your passion must come from the things that fuel you from the inside. That passion will be grounded in people.

Being introverted and quiet are both okay, but why not be social, as well?  You don't have to be the life of the party, but you can still have a good time and enjoy the company of others.  Make some friends, meet their friends, go to any social gathering you're invited to, and talk to people.  It might be hard at first, but you'll eventually learn to enjoy it.

&gt;does it get better for the quiet guys?

Let me rephrase the question that I think you're really asking.

&gt;Will life be handed to me on a silver platter if I continue doing nothing about it?

The answer is no.  How did you get a job, a home, and a car?  Did people just give those things to you, or did you work for them?  You have to put in some effort.

notskunkworks,relationships,1390276329.0,"I'm really sorry man. Times are going to get tough for you, but only for a while. It will pass.

It's important to remember that people aren't always at their best -- they aren't always strong, wise, sober, or sharp of mind -- and they all can make mistakes. The reasons for these mistakes range can be carelessness, poor character, drunkenness, malice, immaturity, depression, loneliness... you name it, there's a reason why it occurred.

Some folks who lack empathy for others categorize these things as excuses. They're not excuses unless you refuse to be accountable for those mistakes. No matter what reason led you to make that bad decision, you have to own both it and its consequences.

Your girl knew she fucked up. She fessed up pretty quickly. She was willing to be accountable for her mistake. These are good things. They might lead you to think she's willing to be accountable for her mistake.

The problem is that she didn't make one mistake, she made *many* mistakes. There were plenty of opportunities during that night where her voice of reason should've kicked in and said, ""This is not a good idea."" For whatever reason, it did not.

It is easy to forgive one mistake, because one mistake can only have so many reasons. How easy is it to forgive many mistakes with so many more reasons? Doesn't that speak more to someone's character than to a moment of weakness?

Very tough questions. In your position, I would be struggling too but ultimately I would move on.

&gt; Why would it matter to me what you do? You're a single woman, you can do what you want.

Not to belittle your pain, but this would be the perfect response if you were in a romantic comedy movie, the kind that starts out with the guy being cheated on and dumping his girl and ends up with him super-fucking-happy in another relationship. It's pretty amazing, really."

dunkybones,electronic_cigarette,1390276345.0,"I hand rolled a variety of dutch tobaccos for years. I found vaping to be a natural fit to my smoking habit because there is a fuss factor to vaping, just as there is to hand rolling. You also can't draw on a hand rolled cigarette like you can a filtered cigarette, you have to puff on it a little and draw more slowly, just like vaping.  I think of vaping as much more akin to smoking a pipe than a cigarette.
  
I still prefer tobacco based juices, high in VG, at about 12 mg. Higher nic content and/or PG ratio is too harsh for me, Dutch tobaccos are remarkably smooth.  
  
Finding what flavors you like on what gizmo you like is terribly subjective, and requires an open mind and some experimentation. Ant search on this sub for a good starter kit is going to lead you [here,](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/starter-kits/products/kanger-mini-protank-2-starter-kit-vv) where they seem to always be out of stock, but it will give you an idea of what to look for.  
  
As for flavors, you have to experiment to find what you like, but Bombies, Indigo, Heather's Heavenly, are just a few sources that people around here hold in high regard. And remember to keep an open mind, it may turn out that you like to vape watermelon or cotton candy, and you just don't know it yet."

Lecks,TumblrInAction,1390276488.0,"&gt; That's exactly what I'm trying to say. They do almost nothing but complain about feminists online. For ""activists"" they sure don't do any actual activism.

Holding meetings to discuss relevant issues, putting up posters promoting their viewpoints, attending protests holding signs to show solidarity on certain issues. Do those things not count as activism?

&gt;I still don't sympathize with their overall attitude. Men still hold the majority of power in mass media, major corporations, and government. 

And how much of that power is used for the benefit of men as a whole and not just the men holding the power. The way I see it is that the majority of people at the top, the people with power, are indeed men but that doesn't mean men are the ones with power. Especially when you look at the bottom and, again, see that the majority of the powerless are also men.

&gt;We are in no way an oppressed minority.

I don't agree with people who say men are oppressed, but they're not as widespread or as central to MRA's as you make them out to be. The ones I know of just want their voices to be heard and the issues they raise taken seriously.

&gt;As for civil discourse, if the people shouting you down aren't willing to have it with you, then don't. Take your conversation elsewhere. Yelling back at them never helps.

If people in the real world don't want to hear it and the people online demonize you where do you go to have that civil discourse? Sometimes becoming the opposition is the only way to be heard."

ztj,science,1390276506.0,"I've experimented with drinking sugary drinks and not drinking anything but water over the last few years. I've found that I don't gain any additional weight when I'm drinking sugary drinks, but, I don't lose weight either. I found it much easier to lose weight when I cut the sugary drinks. The only link i've been able to find for myself between when I do or don't actually gain weight is that I gain weight if my diet is relatively low nutrition. Plenty of calories but not much in terms of actual vitamins and such. But, if I switch around to consume the same amount of calories, but, i get it from mostly vegetables/fruits/nuts/etc. then I'll lose weight.

I know the common concept is calories in - calories out = calories gained, but, I find that ludicrously over simplifying things. I know not everything I eat is digested well or at all. Clearly there is some gradient to caloric absorption that varies from food to food.

TL;DR can't comment on the article, but, relatedly I have found that my weight changes relate more to WHAT I eat, not how many calories I get from it and consumption of sugary drinks does not translate to weight GAIN for me, but, does prevent weight LOSS."

DrinksWellWithOthers,YouShouldKnow,1390276586.0,"Are you posting the right thread?  This is about customers being able to redeem their empty Starbucks store-bought bag at a Starbucks store for a cup of coffee, and a bunch of other places that appear to be Starbucks stores that don't honor anything promotional from Starbucks. The customers aren't lost, they went to a place with a Starbucks sign that sells Starbucks coffee and they can't use their Starbucks coupon.  

This isn't the customer's fault, it's a confusing and frustrating situation for the customer and difficult for the employees to explain.  No one has wandered into the 'wrong' Starbucks.  The customer isn't at fault here, and neither are the employees.  I've learned that I can't use my Starbucks promotions at Starbucks in airports, bookstores, or any other Starbucks that isn't a stand alone Starbucks.  It sucks, but it's not me, the customer's fault, for asking if I can use my coupon and get turned down.  It's a labyrinth of licensing rules that shouldn't matter to the consumer.   A Starbucks should be a Starbucks, and I should be able to buy and cash coupons at any Starbucks.  It isn't the customer who 'screwed up.'"

With my current boyfriend....well...I just turned 26 and since last year, I've noticed I'm already being more like my OWN mom!  Kinda scary!  But I'm way more in to cleanliness now.  I actually make my own bed and scrub everything...typical stuff mom would nag me about before.  I used to be so messy.  So I end up being the one who cleans my boyfriend's place.  He has two female roommates but they don't clean, I have no freaking idea why they are so nasty.  *Deep breath*, but I don't wanna get in to complaining about those guys.  So far, I have a nice balance with my boyfriend because while I may take care of him in certain ways, he definitely reciprocates.  He's the chef in our relationship, and he'll baby me when I feel down and out.  It's nice having reciprocation.  I primarily clean stuff, do the dishes, keep his room clear and do the bed...organization stuff."

You have a whole community of people here who are perhaps better-suited but I read the thread and I didn't see anything that really got at a counter-point so I wanted to offer one as food-for-thought. 

I don't think your husband is doing anything wrong. 

You are hurting, you are hurting bad, and that's their game. They can hurt him through hurting you, by making you miserable and crazy, by making him the immune one. They are making this power balance such that you feel so fucking crazy that they bombard you and leave him alone. Isn't that the game here? He is punished through their mistreatment of you. They clearly hate you (because they are crazy) and him 
(because they are crazy) and so they've taken an approach that pits you against one another. 

You are in the middle of the situation but when I read your post my thought is, ""It's working!"" Their plan is working. Your husband's advice seems spot-on to me because only by tuning them out (either through a cease and desist, changing your number, just flat-out ignoring them) can you both win. I **totally understand** why it hurts so much that he can't really do anything about this and so do they. That's why they are targeting you...because you are helpless and he's helpless to stop them. And your response is super, super reasonable. You write: 

&gt; While I actually do agree 100%, I’m feeling incredibly sensitive and I just need to feel defended by him. I’m tired of being the only one insulted while he gets none of it and I just keep getting patted on the arm and told to “ignore it.”

And I get it! Not in the I've-been-there way others do, but I have enough empathy to totally understand why this is maddening. Your conscious mind KNOWS he's right (say nothing, stay strong, just ignore them) but you can't help but feel betrayed that the person you love has put you in this position. Except he didn't, his family did because they are crazy, and there's nothing he can do to stop it. Trying to bargain or address it would only give them amo and so you're backed so far into the corner you can't move. And since you can't get mad at them (I mean, you can, but it does nothing and gives no catharsis) he's the only one left to be pissed at. Because in a round-about way he's quasi-responsible even though he didn't do it and can't change it. And even that makes you kinda crazy because your conscious mind knows one thing and your heart is screaming another thing and you're just stuck in the middle. 

You talked about that email, but let me ask you this: if he *had* specified no-contact, would it change anything? No. You can't change crazy. Crazy just continues to be crazy. He could have whispered it or shouted it from the rooftops, they would be doing the exact same thing. You cannot change their responses, only your reception and your availability. You can go to the police. You can change your number. You can tune them out. But there's nothing he could say/do that would make it better. There's plenty he could say/do that would invite them back into his life and cause more drama and heartache. So I think he's just trying to rebuff any inclination in himself to get involved knowing he'd only open the door and prove they got to both of you. 

And, you know, I feel for him. I imagine if he could trade places, he would in a second. It must be so much worse for him to watch you, someone totally uninvolved in his screwed up family, take the bullet so clearly meant for him. It's like the scene in Full Metal Jacket wherein the Drill Sergent makes the offending private eat the Jelly Dough-nut while everyone else has to do push-ups because the other soldiers didn't ""help"" the drill sergent get this guy in to shape. You are often more cruel targeting your anger on the wrong person because regular people with actual empathy take the full brunt of that. 

My point, I guess, is that there are no good solutions. You are frustrated in him that he can't solve it, defend you, make it better and that's totally fair. But it is not that he WON'T do it, it is that he very literally can't. You can push them further away, you can take legal or social steps to make distance, you can let it roll of your back...but you can't make them stop through logic or compassion or anger. 

**Here's where I go out on a limb**: take it with a grain of salt. It seems like you might be asking for the wrong thing. It is not that he can do anything about his family, but it is possible that what you need is more from him with regards to your own pain and frustration. You need more than 'I'm sorry'. You need hugs and snuggles and reaffirmation that he loves you, that this is crazy nonsense, that you're just fine and that you don't deserve it. That is a real thing you can ask for and have. You can ask for the emotional support you need, you can ask for the foundational love that gets you through the harassing texts and the mental warfare, without asking for the concrete solution that stops it. He might be so locked into the (stereotypical) guy thing where he's trying to solve the problem (that he can't solve) instead of tending to the emotional fall-out. That might be a short-term band-aid to help get through whatever next steps you have to take, be those legal or what have you. 

Again, I might be out of line here saying anything at all, but I thought it might be helpful. If I was wrong and it isn't, I'm sorry.

&gt; The inspection reports portray an industry struggling to meet basic manufacturing standards, from verifying the identity of the ingredients that go into its products to inspecting finished batches of supplements.

&gt; Some firms don’t even have recipes, known as master manufacturing records, for their products.

&gt; Others make their supplements in unsanitary factories. New Jersey-based Quality Formulation Laboratories produced protein powder mixes and other supplements in a facility infested with rodents, rodent feces and urine, according to government records. FDA inspectors found a rodent apparently cut in half next to a scoop, according to a 2008 inspection report.

Check out the contrast the author describes between the ""aristocratic race"" and the ""lower orders"" in the first paragraph.  If you up the artist he's talking about ([Utamaro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utamaro)) you'll find lots of works showing aristocrats with long, aquiline noses.  ""Long"" noses would be a more accurate way to describe the ideal than ""big"" noses.  You can see the long noses depicted on ""beautiful"" women on [this page](http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/ukiyo-e/japan.html) (check out the Koryusai and the Kuniteru.)

See also the section starting on the bottom of [this page](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/NL08Ad04.html) and going onto the next, which claims there is archaeological evidence for ""tall noses"" being the beauty standard during the Edo period.  

So Japanese stereotypes about ""noble"" versus ""ugly"" facial features predated the 19th century.  The 19th century was when Japan began to attend to their national image in the eyes of the world, which in the context of 19th and early 20th century western racism meant positioning themselves as a ""civilized"" race [separate from and above other Asians](http://books.google.com/books?id=HTMyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).  I would guess that was when the existing beauty standards were incorporated into the concept of the national race.

TheColorOfStupid,MuayThai,1390276974.0,"&gt; the UFC and others have always shaped it's rules, scoring and even cage/octagon in a way that gives the advantage to those with that strength.

What makes you say this?

  I'd argue the unified rules helps strikers and hurts grapplers.  The gloves make it harder to sink in a rear naked choke.  The time limits, rounds and stand ups give grapplers less time to finish their opponents on the ground.  Banning knees to the head of a downed opponent makes side control and north south position less rewarding.  Making headbutts illegal took away a key attack from many top wrestlers in MMA at the time.  Banning strikes to the back of the head, neck and spine makes back control less rewarding.  Wraps and gloves make it easier to punch the head because there is less risk of breaking your hand. 

The rules weren't put in place to help American wrestlers, they were done to make the sport less brutal (or at least seem less brutal) to satisfy law makers and make MMA re legalized in many states.

&gt;They could also make changes to the octagon shape, size, width, soften the canvas, disallow elbows on the ground

This would make MMA less realistic and give an unreasonable advantage to strikers.  And how does the octagon shape help wrestlers?  It makes it harder to take a guy down."

bunker_man,TumblrInAction,1390277099.0,"&gt; Spending so much effort into nothing but demonizing feminists only makes them look like the misogynists that they're accused of being.

I think they know that. Their issue is that they have no choice but to be seen as this, so they think that if they manage to damage the reputation of those accusing them, then in the long term it will help them be accepted. Seeing as how the feminism of ages past has already given way to a tiny minority of the more extreme, they see this as a trend it's possible to take advantage of. Since they're still young, they probably think they need more time to organize for more practical things, and need time to get a better reputation.

&gt;If they really wanted to be taken seriously, they'd respond to criticisms with rational arguments rather than more shouting.

They do actually do this sometimes. They're not ONLY the ""bash feminists based on nothing"" crowd. Sometimes those things even overlap. 

&gt;Not to mention there are quite a few of them that do seem to actually hate women.

This is probably true. They would probably say that it's not that their movement is sexist, but rather that by the nature of working for one group, that extremists will side with it the same way that black gang members might side with groups legitimately trying to help black people. If you ask me, the nature of movements named by gender in this day and age is merely asking for sexism, and anyone actually interested in progress would have started an all purpose unisex one. 

And also that the name ""mens rights"" by it's nature sounds too aggressive, and should have been something more neutral seeming even if they were determined to make a term for men specifically. (Maybe something with the word boys instead? Who knows.)"

Then he doesn't know you very well does he? Sounds like manipulative bullshit. 

&gt;  if I were to have casual sex with someone he would totally forgive me and not think that I don't love him.

Sure, sure. Sounds like he's just saying that because that's how he wants YOU to react. He wants YOU to forgive him and say you still love him if he cheats on you. He wants you to feel bad for not loving him enough and trusting him enough to not care about him sleeping with someone else. MORE manipulative bullshit.

&gt; Saw nothing wrong with sharing with me his feelings in an honest way

Of course! Better to get the truth out there. But I suspect he is using this as ONCE AGAIN more manipulative bullshit: ""How can you react this way when I am just being honest?"" and ""Why do you care that I cheated on you when I was being honest and told you about it?"" *completely ignoring* the emotional impact his words and actions can have on you. Acting as though because he is being honest, you should be happy with whatever he says. 

&gt; sex is really not a big deal for him.

If it is for you, and you don't want him sleeping with other people, and you believe getting MARRIED means a commitment to ONE person forever... then you have incompatible morals and beliefs about marriage, and if you ignore these and end up marrying him anyway he will cheat on you. 

&gt; Most important is having each other forever.

Having each other forever ... and any other person he feels like fucking. He wants someone to come home to and sex on the side too. If you aren't on board with this, then you are not compatible.

Holy fucking shit sticks Batman... are you serious?

I'm so mad at all my past GYN's I could poop. only I can't because my bowel is fused to my uterus thanks to endo. I spent 11 years trying to get answers to these almost-identical to endometriosis symptoms. I have a family history I can date back to the 18th century, but my doctors all said that It's not endo, Its *just* fibro, because Fibro causes pain like endo. Blergh!

Glad I have a good GYN now who was and is willing to test and confirm both endo and fibro. Hopefully you have a good GYN too.

I'm so sorry that your diagnoses wasn't something more manageable, you have no idea how often I wish it was cancer just because there would be and end to that in some form. But the silver lining is that now you can name your demons, and now you know what you are up against. There are alternative therapies that work really well with managing fibro, if you haven't already looking into it, lymphatic drainage has been a real help for me. There are also medications you can try to help with the pain, they wont always work but they are worth trying. There are diets and exercise programs, Meditation and mindfulness exercises, if you aren't already trying these they are good to add to your regime. 

since you are working primarily with a neurologist, I would ask about Small fiber peripheral neuropathy, Its very similar to fibromyalgia on a pain level, but it lacks the symptoms like (non-pain induced) fatigue, IBS and malaise. It can be tested for in some countries with certain facilities.

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1390277393.0,"The packaging, and thus, the experience, are part of the product. That's why luxury brands (think, Guerlain, Chanel) have more scent. In general, MUA provides solid recommendations, although it can easily pass over lesser known but better products. 

If you're interested in say, Chocolate Soleil, you can figure out from reviews that it's certainly good, and that people like the pigmentation, packaging, color, and chocolate scent. If you look for dupes of it, you may well discover that for your budget, NYC bronzer in Sunny is close enough (I actually really adore NYC Sunny. It's great for a well blended contour that is slimming without being at all noticeable). 

I've not tried Beauty Blender dupes, but I'd definitely say that it's not at all like a cheap triangle sponge. The BB is actually really nice, and I'm hoping there will eventually be an amazing dupe of it. 

Essentially, MUA tends to pick solid products (with the caveat that people are different: Clump Crusher is flakes galore on me), but not necessarily the best value products in that category, if you are only looking at the final result. "

You don't have a point. You have a bunch of words strung together into something that resembles a sentence, but it is devoid of meaning, relevance, and rational thought.

You claim that misandry is okay and funny (like wtf) and then when you're rightly called out on that bullshit, you backpedal and try to claim that the original misandric poster isn't doing anything wrong and everyone else is somehow mistaken. No, fuck you and fuck your shitty logic."

Mephrael,AskReddit,1390277445.0,"&gt; Do you really believe that the people on the island would be as cruel to each other had they been adult?

In the context of Lord of the Flies? Yes, absolutely! The whole book read like the authors choice to use teenagers to illustrate the point made for a compelling tale, but the theme would have worked just as easily applied to any number of alternate scenarios. Society is an intellectual construct, and if you remove all available supervision and structure, while also applying the right kinds of psychological stress, such as survival, you'll find that the walls will break down pretty fast. 

It will rapidly become a ""survival of the fittest"" scenario, and the age of the ""participants"" is largely irrelevant. 

&gt;thats merely a side effect, not the problem-causer.

in terms of our original discussion, this is not a point we disagree on. My point is primarily that age is irrelevant, as if you apply enough psychological and/or emotional stress on someone, they will act erratically. Deep down, things like age, gender and maturity cease to mean anything, and if someone is affected the right (or wrong, depending on your perspective) way, they all fall away, leaving the raw, unfocussed, instinctive creature underneath."

GeoffreyArnold,short,1390277525.0,"&gt;If I have learned anything from my christian upbringing it is that one should do the right thing. 

Doing the right thing is often a very difficult task.  Not only the actual doing part (because doing what is right is often harder than doing what is wrong), but also simply the whole ""knowing what is right"".  

For instance, I already have a little moral dilemma arising from your post about ""Ride Along"".  So, on the one hand, I don't want to pay for a movie that aims to insult me.  Therefore, I said I was essentially going to steal the movie (through bit torrent). But stealing is usually wrong.  But, it's not universally wrong.  I can think of several scenarios in which a good argument could be made in which stealing would be ""right"".  So, if stealing isn't universally bad, is it justifiable in this case?  And if not, how else can I see the movie without enriching the bad actors who produced it?  (And here I meant ""bad actors"" in the moral sense, though I'm sure the two thespians in this movie also aren't so great).  "

You can't just throw out your opinion and then be like ""no, I don't want mine challenged"". If you don't want people to comment on your opinion, then keep it to yourself.

Also, I'm throwing out the term ""sexually objectify"" because that's kind of exactly what we're talking about. Did you think we were somehow not? I'm not sure why you're shocked I used the term.

It may also interest you to know that Andrea Dworkin was very supportive of trans people and transitioning, just like a lot of radical feminists. I'm not saying that to dissuade you in any way, just a point if clarification.

I am also critical of gender myself, and I would very much like to live in a world without gender. Try as I might, though, it just doesn't change who I am. I am still me, still a woman no matter how much I wish I wasn't (clarification: not because women are a bad thing to be, but because being trans is so fucked up).

Anyway, I hope you find peace and self-contentment in doing this. That is the whole point if transition, after all. If you ever want to talk about dysphoria or anything else with a non-judgmental trans person, feel free to pm me.

We still use ancient technology on the antenna's themselves like FC/APC and replacing these pigtailed cassettes is a royal pain sometimes. 

To answer your other questions: I can't really say what software we use for the databases because it is all home-made and native to Unix platforms. Let me say that if you don't understand C++ and Perl you'll never be able to sort through the raw data files.  The raw data comes in a very specific format that gets decrepted so many times before it can be archived and made available to the scientists/projects/missions. Yes it is always on, there are no downtimes because we monitor the space crafts 24/7!

A general rule of thumb is to keep the data aviable for 30 days but sometimes the scientists will call and ask to restage data from a certain time frame.  

1 petabye doesn't begin to scratch the surface of the size of data that comes in an hour when there is an active downstream.

a4bh3,personalfinance,1390278161.0,"My first year teaching went like this...

7:15-3:15 required to be at school. I had a 25 minute lunch, and an hour of prep time. I managed to socialize with other teachers during my lunch. I found it really helped me recharge since I'm a social person. I also would arrive at 6:45 to make sure I was ready for the day.

I coached tennis in the fall and spring. For the days we practiced, practice would run from 3:30 until 5. When we had a home game, I'd be there until 6. For an away game, we wouldn't get back until 7 or 8 (we'd typically grab a bite to eat on the way in...sometimes I'd have to pay for their meals because I worked in a very poor, rural district and the kids didn't always have money). Two or three weekends during the season there were tennis tournaments, so those would run from 9am until 5pm or so on a Saturday. 

Being an English teacher, I had to grade papers and had to do a lot of reading (the same books and plays that the students were reading). Often this would keep me working for a couple of hours after I got home, or I would lose a weekend every other week.

The winter was better because I didn't have tennis. But I enjoyed coaching tennis, so I missed not coaching it (as masochist as that sounds). 

Some weekends I'd help run ACT/SAT prep as well.

I'm not typing this because I want pity, just trying to be real. I enjoy teaching but have moved on to the college ranks. I get paid better and for me the work is better. 

Ultimately, teaching is rewarding work. You do get vacation time around Christmas and in the summer where you can recharge for a couple of weeks, but even then there's stuff to do. Once you develop a routine you can save yourself several hours per week, but until then it feels like you're drowning at times. 

Being able to mold young minds is perhaps the most awesome responsibility there is."

It's about putting the bullshit in to perspective. Prioritizing the importance of that instance in your life. Or in this case, *de-prioritizing* the moment. 

In the end, this person doesn't matter. He's stuck in some ignorant primitive mindset that makes him useless to the human race. He is of no importance to you, and by default that makes anything he says a waste of breath. 

He can go on and on for eternity spouting his gross-ness but it won't change the fact that you are right and he is wrong. And I think you're bad ass so add that to the list of things he isn't!

It would be more better for them to keep putting out more classic games on the 3DS eShop (there are some already and they're super fun).  What I think people would really like as well is re-releases of beloved N64 games on the eShop; either on the 3DS or the Wii U. Nintendo already has a vested interest in increasing 3DS console sales, especially since that's their one successful system right now, so this would be a better move. 

Before the iPhone and other modern smartphones were out, the Nintendo DS was out.  And it innovated a lot of awesome stuff with the touchscreen that Apple and Android games use today.  Remember drawing a path for the boomerang in Phantom Hourglass?

At first, it was mild interest, but then the (to her) implied backstory caught her rapt attention. 

When I came back to the room after changing out of my work uniform, she was systematically reading *all* of the codex entries (thanks to the flashing icon on the Pause Screen), and we ended talking about the series over drinks most of the night - what she'd picked up would be comparable to someone who's only seen Star Wars Ep. IV, and had no idea about the rest of the series.

As a fledgling sci-fi author herself, what she was amazed about the most was how the series had taken key characteristics from so many sources and combined them seamlessly into one universe.

1. *Toledo* has the best record in the conference and MAC West at 15-2. Undefeated till they lost to Kansas. Have 5 players averaging double figures in scoring including Julie Brown who leads the MAC in assists at 6.8 per game (6th overall in NCAA).

**RUNNER UP**

2. *Ohio* has the second best in conference and best in MAC East at 13-4. Really hurt by the loss of D.J. Copper who averaged about 15 ppg, 6 apg, and 2 spg during his 3 years there (Mid Season MVP of Greek League now). 

3. *Akron* has 2nd best in the East and is tied for 3rd best in conference at 11-6. They also beat Ohio so that gives them an edge over EMU. Really hurt by lose of Alex Abreu due to drug charges and Zeke Marshall who lead the NCAA in blocks per game last year at 7 bpg(Undrafted now playing for Maine Red Claws D League team). 

4. *Eastern Michigan* 2nd best in the West and tied for 3rd in conference at 11-6. Managed to play 4 ranked teams, 3 in the top ten, but lost to all of them (Duke, UK, UMASS and Syracuse). Freshman Ray Lee scored 38 points at 12-15 and 3-3 from the 3 point line against Texas Arlington.  

**POSITIVE RECORD SO FAR BUT NEED A GOOD RUN**

5. *Buffalo* 9-5 overall 3-1 in conference.  Javon McCrea leads MAC in rebounding at 9.4 rpg.

6. *Kent State* 11-6 but only 2-2 in conference. Mark Henniger went 6-6 from the field and 8-8 from the free throw line against Niagara scoring 20 points.

7. *Western Michigan* 9-7 overall, 2-2 in conference. David Brown leads MAC in scoring at 18.9 ppg.

**NEGATIVE RECORD NEED A GREAT COMEBACK**

8. *Bowling Green* 8-9 overall, 2-2 in conference. Closest team to being at or over .500. I graduated from this school recently. Coaches son Chauncey Orr plays for them. Richaun Holmes leads MAC in blocks at 3.24 per game.
 
9. *Miami* 6-9 overall but 2-2 in conference, last team to be at .500 in conference. Lost first 4 games. Despite this they are on track to a better season than last year where they went 9-22 and 3-13 in the MAC. Quinten Rollins leads MAC in steals at 2.53 per game.

10. *Northern Illinois* 7-9 overall, but only 1-3 in conference. No basketball version of Johnny Lynch for them. Highest scored only at 10 ppg.

11. *Central Michigan* 7-9 overall 0-4 in conference. Young team 4 of 5 starters are sophomores, new coach as well. Looking to see some improvement from last year.

**NEED A MIRACLE**

12. *Ball State*. 3-14 overall 0-4 conference. Miserable year so far, 2 of 3 wins come from a non division 1 team (Taylor NAIA and Oakland City Div. 2). "

harle,GameDeals,1390278518.0,"Syder Arcade is one of the better shmups available on Steam atm imo. If you were on the fence about it before, it's definitely worth checking out for $2.50 if you like sidescrolling shmups.

Firstly, it's quite punishing. There's no brief hit-invuln that other shmups have adapted. If you cross a string of closely-stacked bullets, you take all the bullets. This might be considered a detriment by others, preference I guess. However, you can become temporarily invincible via your special attacks. The efficacy of which varies, sometimes it's more efficient to just ram stuff while your special's going off. The overall result is that you can 100-0 if you make a mistake, but are still able to survive pinch moments if you plan for it.

The graphics selection mode is pretty cool - you can either play it in modern, or any stylized modes mimicking the graphics of past arcade systems - gray2-4-8 bit, amiga, cga, ega, vga, even a hipster mode, among others. 

Music's not bad. I can't really think of any particular track that stands out, but it gets you pumped up sufficiently.

Movement wise, it's a little slippery though. You can change direction of your ship and you fly faster going forwards, but the more speed pickups you get (or if you enter boost mode), the harder it is to dodge bullets too. Sort of double edged in that regard. There's no clear hitbox, so you may end up taking shots you meant to graze, even if they visually were outside your ship."

Wyboth,xkcd,1390278524.0,"&gt;We're talking one or two posts a day. That seems manageable.

Every day, for the rest of my life. I understand that it seems insignificant, but it will become incredibly annoying the longer I have to do it.

&gt;These are already posts that you were planning on deleting. How much work is it really going to be to flair them instead?

They'd even out. I'd have to go out to xkcd.com to see what comic number it is, then click the flair button, type in the comic number, and hit save. Alternatively, I would leave a comment informing them of the rule and remove it.

&gt;Additionally a flair'd post has educational value. When submitters see that posts without comic numbers get flair'd they can notice and it can dawn on them that there post should include a comic number. The educational value of deleting a post is smaller - only the submitter will ever see that moderator action has been taken.

Buuut, if a submitter goes to the frontpage and sees that all comic posts follow the ""xkcd ####:"" format, it will be even more obvious that he or she needs to submit with that format. Moreover, I can add the rule to the submission text. I think that's more obvious than flair.

&gt;Again, we're seeing one or two posts a day on this subreddit. Based on that I'd take it further and say deleting ANY discussions on this subreddit will be harmful.

But, if I don't enforce the rule, then maybe half of the submissions will follow it, and that would defeat the purpose of having the rule (since users still would not be able to tell which comics are new and which are old). Deleting discussions hurts. I get it. I have to choose between the lesser of two evils here, (maybe) having to delete a few discussions early on to get the ball rolling, or abandon the rule. I think the second is the greater evil. *Hopefully* everyone will see the new rule and I won't have to remove anything.

&gt;How many hours a day are you on Reddit? How quickly do you see things?

&gt;Basicly this doesn't seem to me like something you as a single mod can constantly, timely keep on top of.

I'm on about 4-5 hours daily. The first thing I check is this sub and its modqueue. I understand that I can't be on all the time to delete these posts. I'm going to try my best to catch them before they get too big.

&gt;I think you're hurting the subreddit.

&gt;Having comic numbers on threads would be nice. Deleting discussions on a small subreddit like this is horrible. I've suggested an alternative approach, I hope you'll consider it.

We'll see. I'll try my method for a week. If people can't remember to add the prefix and I have to delete too many discussions, I'll switch to your method."

Plus i'm pretty sure when ranked mode(if?) it comes later on people will be able to Ban her or whoever from matches. So then people will have no choice but to learn other characters, Then they going to complain that the next person is OP and this cycle will never end.

The new shaper Feris, I've seen him 2 - 3 shot people being a jungler or just in lane as predator, I've also seem him lose tremendously.

dianthe,gifs,1390278664.0,"They are good dogs but they are not an easy breed to have, here are some pros and cons:

* They need a good amount of grooming - I brush mine for 30 mins once a week and every day when they are blowing their coat. Never shave your Samoyed unless it is a medical necessity. 

* Get used to having white hair on *everything* you own. You will also need to vacuum every other day to keep your floor clean because these dogs shed a lot. 

* They are an energetic breed so they need exercise.

* They are usually very clingy, they want to be with you *all* the time so if you are in a situation where the dog will be left home alone for most of the day Samoyed is probably not the right breed for you. 

* They are a very sweet breed, you will hardly ever find a bad tempered Samoyed. They are very affectionate. 

* They are an intelligent breed (there are exceptions to this of course! I have one smart one and one dumb one) but are also usually very stubborn so training them takes patience. 

* They are very talkative - some bark, some howl, some whine, some do all of the above, so probably not the best breed for you if you like it quiet. 

* They are generally a healthy breed, their life expectancy is 12-15 years. Some health problems to watch out for: hip dysplasia and eye problems are the two main ones so make sure the breeder you choose screens for both. 

* Many of them are runners and most never achieve a reliable recall.

DragonFireKai,Seattle,1390278861.0,"The whole thing was calculated, as is everything Sherman does with regards to football. The man's basically the nfl equivilent of lex luthor. He already told the front office he was going to put Crabtree on blast before the game even started, much less before he actually shut him down with the game on the line. And think about what that decision is doing right now. What's the worst thing the media could do to the hawks right now? Put a microscope on the offense, with multiple young players playing well beneath expectations right now. What are they doing instead of relentlessly grilling Russell Wilson on his horrendous ball handling? They're zooming in on Sherman, who said,

&gt;If you want to judge me, I can handle it.

So he's taking the heat because they can't question his ability. Furthermore, think about what this does to the 49ers. Crabtree was supposed to be the next jerry rice for them. He didn't perform, so they got randy moss to show him the ropes. He was still *mediocre*, so they brought in boldin to try and develop him further. Then they entrust their season in him, and Sherman shuts him down, and then, just to dig the knife in further for emphasis, he waxes eloquent on how easy it was for him to do. How *mediocre* of a challenge that was. All the while it worms under Crabtree's skin, and in the back of the minds of kapernick, harbaugh, and everyone else on a division rival that Sherman's gonna play at least twice next year. It undermines not only Crabtree's flagging self confidence, but the team's confidence in him. Next year, if Crabtree is kinda open, and kapernick tries to cram it into double coverage once, then this whole charade has paid for itself in Sherman's mind.

Sherman wasn't one of those guys who got boosted to just barely passing so he could play in college, he graduated from Stanford with a 3.9, and is working on his masters. In communication, the art of manipulating people through words and actions. What do you think we just saw last night?"

dakboy,personalfinance,1390279093.0,"I have to side with the fundies on this one. I have not spoken to a single teacher who is tasked with teaching common core and fully believes in it. The ones I know personally (as opposed to my kids' teachers) are very much against it; our first grader's teacher basically told us ""we don't fully agree with how it works and where we can, we take liberties in how we implement it. But we are required to teach this way."" 

Common Core wasn't designed by educators. Think about that. A complete redesign of how kids are taught had no significant input or approval from the very people who have done it their whole careers. 

2 other anecdotes: 

1. When my first grader brought home math homework in September, I had to search for explanations of how it was supposed to be done. I took AP Calculus. I have a degree from a respected engineering school. Someone had to explain to me how *1st grade math* was to be done because it's not  1+1=2 anymore. Triangle diagrams, number sentences, I'm not even sure they use words like ""subtract"" and ""take away"" anymore. 

2. A friend has a 4th grader. In September, he sat down with his wife to help their daughter with her math homework. After 2 hours, 2 of the 3 of them were in tears. Not because they couldn't do the math, but because they couldn't figure out the correct ""common core way."" "

sockalicious,changemyview,1390279263.0,"It comes down to being about sportsmanship and the old debate about role models and whether professional sports are supposed to be about role models or entertainment.

NFL athletes are all super special people, even the undrafted rookies on the scout squad.  They have a special blend of genetic talent, personality traits and hard work that make them stand above the common cut.  The very best of them get together and work with their teams, and it enables them to do things that normal mortals never could dream of doing.  But part of how they get there - hard work, teamsmanship, good sportsmanship, perseverance, never-say-die ethic - those things are available to any old regular Joe.  Those things are available to me, and others, and watching these young men grow into their roles by using those skills is an inspiration to me.  I also think it's important for young people to learn these skills from folks they look up to and pro athletes are certainly setting the bar in terms of being those role models.

Sherman's rant was mixed; it was part passion, part confidence, part insecurity, part name-calling.  He may well be on a team with Crabtree one day soon; wouldn't that be awkward?  He may catch cold for the next SF-Stl game next year and Crabtree comes out and dominates him for 280 and 3TDs.  Wouldn't that be awkward - especially if Crab mans up afterwards and takes the high road?

What we forget is that these are not professional entertainers; they are extraordinarily high achieving young men with issues of their own - and if you study high achievers: they *all* have issues.  Sherman got to work one of his issues out in the spotlight and it reflects poorly on his character as an athlete, a team player, a sportsman and a man of integrity.  This is not entertainment - it is more than that - it is a valuable lesson for people watching.  The lesson is, ""Don't be a jackass like this guy.""

I believe people can redeem themselves, especially from a minor misstep like this; and I think for me the entertainment is going to come from watching to see if that happens, or if this jackass winds up like Pac-man Jones."

deschutron,depression,1390279276.0,"First, I declare this: I believe that depression comes from beliefs, though I can't point to the evidence to confirm it.

First of all, remember that people get through this. Depression doesn't have to last forever. And life is good when you're out - sunsets are more beautiful and food tastes better. 

Second, what's demotivating you? I think your ultimate goal should be solving that. Although I think that if you could solve it right away then you would have already done so, so don't worry if you can't solve it now. 

In the short term, you should get some confidence. 
Confidence does not come from inside, it comes from validation. Do you something that you're good at. Anything that goes from you trying to do things to a feeling of success is good. If you have some real friends, spend time with them. That might give you the boost you need. 

If you stay at home and try to think your way out of depression, the odds are against you. As you get more depressed, your available mental resources decrease. Besides, your depression might be caused by an absence of knowledge that's readily available in the outside world.

Getting out of depression is like pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps. Going from when you can hardly do anything to realising your full mental potential. But it is possible. Computers do it every time you turn them on.

While sometimes there are bad surprises, on average, the better you get, the easier recovery will be."

[Here](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf#page=28) is a pdf of the CDC findings. You'll find here that they don't include ""being made to penetrate"" under rape. Of note are the numbers in column 2.1 for rape under the 12 month period and in column 2.2 for made to penetrate under the 12 month period. They're virtually the same.

&gt;And how the hell can you even argue that a mugging is less traumatizing then being sexually assaulted? Having something stolen from you on threat of violence is not the same as having someone tear off your clothes and forcefully subdue you while violently ramming their dick into one of your bodily orifices. And that's not even counting the possibility of unwanted pregnancy, forcing them to either go through the excruciating process of childbirth on their own, or have an abortion, which in many places can practically make you a pariah due to outspoken pro-lifers.

1: Rape is non-consensual sex, not violent sex.

2: Muggings can be violent and even fatal.

3: The legality and cultural acceptance of abortion is another issue."

I went through a range of different 'potential causes' initially I was told (back in 1998) that this only ever happens to victims of sexual abuse. I knew that wasn't the case but My doctors thought I was lying. Then I was told it must be thrush (it wasn't) and I received chemical burns to my vulva. This is now what they blame for the visible scarring on my nerve, and this is why I opted to have the scar tissue surgically removed. (involved cutting the clitoris) But I had pain before this, I have pain after this, its probably psycho-somatic at this point but My lap is on the 7th of February so I will know for sure if thee is causation there, or if its just a coincidence. 

If there is endometrial scarring on the vestibule, My diagnoses will officially change from Chemical-VVS, To Endometriosis-VVS"

I think the deal breakers you filtered out are relatively ok because they are very objective. This however, is not.

I just find it hard to believe you only found 10 chicks on OKC who you found attractive and met the objective deal breakers.

I'm going to reiterate what other people have been saying. Women are humans, not unicorns. Stop making someone up who doesn't exist and just go out and meet someone who does. You might meet someone who is ""too fun"" and actually enjoy yourself."

iSeize,AskReddit,1390279645.0,wtf am i watching
nickgreen90,letsplay,1390279646.0,"* **Gamertag/Name:** Nick, Nickgreen90.
* **Channel:** [GreenForceGaming](https://www.youtube.com/user/GreenForceGaming)
* **Subscribers:** Right now, about 48. May or may not increase to 50 by the time someone sees this
* **Age:** 16.
* **Channel Age:** Approximately one year, one year and a half? I have about 2 years total of experience tho.
* Preferred Genre(s): Puzzler, anything by valve, most things other than FPS's. Basically if if it runs on my laptop, I'll play it.
* **A/V Recording Method:** Typically I use fraps and a blue Yeti, but I'm willing to record audio separately if need be.
* **Timezone:** Eastern Standard Time. UTC is apparently -5 hours
* **Systems:** I primarily use my laptop and Steam as well as non-steam indie games, but I am looking at getting a capture card very soon, and when that happens, I'll be in the market for PS3 captures.
* **Personality:** Basically, I'm good at some games and really, really bad at others. I'm not a completionist (on all games at least), but I do spend a fair amount of time exploring any game possible. I am mostly a friendly, engaged commentator, and I am prone to making countless references, jokes, and sarcastic comments. I always try to be as friendly as possible (unless I'm playing with one of my closest friends, in which case I may trash them quite a bit in jest.)
* **Video Trailer:** I suppose a fair illustration would be [this,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEP3gYO7rxc) although I kind of suck at picking out videos when asked for an example.
* **Additional Information:** I live in the US, North Carolina specifically. I'm still in school obviously, but I am free most weeknights afters 6:00 or so (after about 7:00 January-March 1 2014) and almost always on weekends. I prefer doing let's plays with people in my timezone so that less has to be worked out, but I won't discriminate. I tend to keep swearing down to a bear minimum or not at all. One serious issue for me is that while I have a higher end laptop, it's still not going to run upper tier games. Anything by valve works fine however, so take that into account I suppose. I really enjoy them too, as you can see from my channel. 

As of late, I'm looking for someone to do some awesomenauts with, as well as sampling some MMO's maybe, such as RIFT. TF2 is one of my games that I am good at, so if you also have some skill, I'm looking for someone to do some server domination videos with. I have a fairly versatile Steam Library, and I am not above mods. I look forward to working with whoever so chooses! :)

DuckyFreeman,AskMen,1390279689.0,"It's gotta be your own thing man. Whatever works for you. Some like lube, some don't. Grip strength, stroke length, speed, that's all about what works for you. The only way to figure it out is through a long and awkward process that most of us went through at 13 or whatever. 

I recommend that for lube, you go to the store and buy some KY jelly. It's water soluble, safe, and is very effective. I prefer the ""natural feeling"" stuff, but I don't think you wanted to know that. The glans is generally considered the most sensitive part of the penis (especially for someone who grew up uncircumcised like you), but the bottom ridge (so to speak) can also be very sensitive. 

The most important thing, in my opinion, is your mind (it's your biggest sex organ!!!11). If you're stressed, and looking at it as something of a chore, it will never work or be enjoyable. Have you seen the 40 year old virgin? Where he makes a night of rubbing one out, with candles and soft music and porn? It's a funny scene, and a little ridiculous, but the premise is right. Just like sex, you gotta be in the mood. 

Also, porn can definitely help, like others have suggested, but I don't think it's necessary. I'm sure you don't know what you like yet, and you'll probably end up with some woman screaming as she gets torn to pieces by some guy grunting like a hog. That's cool if you're into that, but it can be distracting to start with. Go to www.fuq.com (NSFW obviously) and look at all of the categories, click around, watch videos until your pants get tight.

It doesn't matter that she's living under his roof. She doesn't belong to her father. 

That said, I don't think younger sister would be out of line to talk with her parents about her concerns, especially if she's so seriously concerned.

As far as choosing to not use legendary pokemon, I never said my opinion should become the law, I'm not that full of myself. The reason I choose to not use legendary pokemon (among other reasons) is that in this gen, I love taking the time to breed out a ""perfect"" pokemon because they made it much easier this time around without RNG manipulation, but you can't do that with legendary pokemon. Chandelure was the best answer for *my team* because I have a scizor on my team so it provides a free switch-in with flash fire to take 0 damage from a fire attack and hit hard and fast with overheat, which is now powered up by the fire attack I was running from. I looked at other fire types, and this one simply worked best. As far as the eligibility in UU, the rest of the team except 1 is made up of OU pokemon so it wouldn't be eligible.

p3ndulum,poker,1390279805.0,"The skill is in being able to hedge your bets.

If you can reasonably determine an opponents most probable range of holdings, you can hedge your investment in the situation based on the level of risk that is involved.

Knowing how to do math is integral poker skill. If you know how many cards are in the deck - both by rank and suit - you can measure your ""outs"" against the odds that are being offered by the pot.

If you invest a lot of money into unfavourable situations and very little into favourable ones, you can't win at poker.

An unskilled poker player might have the math skills to do well in poker, but if they never learn how to use it in poker, they might not ever know whether they were making the right decision or not.

There's also being able to craft an image that you can use against your opponents. There are things beyond the numbers that lend to a players ability to induce mistakes out if their opponents.

An unskilled player might not ever think of these things, but instead thought of the game more like a game of War or Go Fish, where everything is by guess work and at the whim ofthe deck.

If you know what you're looking for and have a breadth of experience, or an innate gift for the game, then you could bring a substantial edge with you when you sit down at a poker game.

The ""luck"" part is what the dealer does, the *skill* part is in what an individual person does when the action is on *them*."

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1390279829.0,"I used to attend [FGC-affiliated](http://www.fgcquaker.org/) Meeting quite a bit for a few years, fell away a few years ago due to it simply being a bad time in my life when I was having lots of existential crises and didn't feel up to going and being social.  Am considering going back as they were the most 'real' I'd ever seen of any religious group, extremely focused on humanitarian causes/charity work and getting people motivated to actively engage in it as well as exceedingly anti-war/promoting of peace and community building, all with no strings attached or attempts to proselytize.  My background: I was raised conservative/evangelical/Baptist/fundamentalist lite™ and it was ultimately incompatible with my mindset because, well, I'm a guy who is romantically attracted to other guys and I refuse to be ashamed about it or commit to a lifestyle of celibacy or lie to myself and force myself to marry a female (the latter two things are the only way they'll accept you, even so, you're still likely to be looked down upon or treated like a mentally ill person who is to be both pitied and not fully trusted).  

I enjoyed attending Friends' Meeting, found it to be very ecumenical and open-minded...   there were a lot of Bohemian types as well as pretty much the entire spectrum of sexualities.  They didn't bat an eye about me being gay and were very supportive, open and affirming;  very patient, kind and good people.  You get a few large, loud personalities or people with God-complexes in the mix like any other collective but they are generally calmer in that sort of environment, which seems to make wildly different types of people work well together, not an easy thing to do. I respect that. If I had to choose a religion to stick to until my dying day, I'd probably stick with the Quakers.  Second choice would probably be Buddhism.

The Meeting House I attended was of the main, socially liberal/progressive branch. Of the more socially conservative branches of Quakerism,  Friends United Meeting is one of the more popular, with most (though not all) following a more traditional Christian service format with hymns, sermon, etc and there is a much heavier focus on one of the standard flavors of the Christian Bible.  In FGC-affiliated (liberal) meetings it is generally believed that God/The Divine/Gaia/Whatever you decide you follow speaks directly to the individual and there is no need for a head-figure or pastor as an intermediary.  They also don't tend to be Bible-centric but more open to simply embracing truths in whatever text they are found.  That branch tends to follow more of the silent-worship format, though it's a misnomer that meetings are completely silent, which I've found only happens rarely.  Much of the time the silence covers 90% of the service time, which most would consider a form of meditation, most folks silent with eyes closed and a bowed head.  Sometimes there's a completely quiet full service but much of the time it is occasionally punctuated with individuals occasionally popping up to speak or sometimes even sing as they feel moved which can be either inspiring or annoying depending on what the message or song is or how it is delivered. I also like that they don't seem to reject those who have no faith/atheist/questioning/are of a different faith.  The Meeting I used to attend often played host to Buddhist Nuns or Monks when they were in town and rented their worship space out to the local Sikh group who wasn't quite large enough for a building of their own as of that time (which would have been unheard of and tantamount to heresy/apostasy in the churches I grew up in).  There were also a lot of Buddhists (mostly Tibetan) in the mix during many of the Sunday services.

I hope this wall of text gave you a good picture of things as experienced through my eyes and ears.  I can't and won't tell you what to pick as a belief system because that is a deeply personal decision which nobody can tell you for sure is or isn't right for you, only you can decide that for yourself.  My own experience with them was great overall, very compatible with my own stereotypical aspie mindset, they literally did not give a flying fuck about my quirks and encouraged me to work with their kids helping to do crafts and discussing things like friends would instead of being in a role of a teacher with authority and a captive class, a format I really dug and wish I'd been involved in when I was younger.  However, collectives like this differ based on location and the types of people who attend as well as throw their mind and influence into the ring with all the others, and they dictate a large part of the focus and direction of the group.

When we finished eating we were thirsty because we didn't order drinks because the chicken was so damn expensive. So logically I thought it would be a good idea if we filled this giant chicken bucket with soda from the soda machine. Now we are walking around town with a kfc bucket full of Dr. Pepper. Only ten minutes after leaving kfc with the bucket we realize the left over chicken grease in the bucket has formed a gosh damn oil slick on top of the soda. So now what? Logicaly, I came up with the idea to just set it in a Pizza Hut bathroom. So Into Pizza Hut I walk  with a kfc bucket of soda and 10 seconds later I walk out. My friend came with me. The second bucket was on his head with eye hole cut out.

Alcohol. 

Edit: Yea, we visited a grocery store just to go to the office supplies isle so we could cut eye holes into our bucket helmet before we visited Pizza Hut, and walked around town with a fucking bucket on my friends head.

While walking, this guy started walking with me and being overly friendly, outwardly he looked somewhat attractive, which alone made me suspicious. Other things that made me suspicious was that he seemed kind of drunk and he wanted to know where I was headed. I was curt with him and kept walking. I refused to answer his questions and said I wanted to be left alone. He soon left me alone.

FYI [Hiroki Kuroda](http://www.baseball-reference.com/japan/player.cgi?id=kuroda001hir) gave ~3.30 ERA when he was 37 and 38 on the Yankees. That is for a GB pitcher, and with Jeter at SS.

[Tanaka](http://www.baseball-reference.com/japan/player.cgi?id=tanaka003mas) at 25 is supposed to be an even better pitcher than Kuroda.

Dave Schoenfield of ESPN wrote this recently, with the apt comparison that Tanaka is Japan's version of Clayton Kershaw. Same age, and Kershaw signed $215M/7 yrs, so Tanaka should grab ~$130M/6 yrs.

But then (from a vegan site):

&gt;One form of vitamin K, called vitamin K2 or menaquinone, is found in animal products but in only one lone plant food—natto, a fermented soy product that isn’t a usual part of most western vegan diets. This isn’t a problem, though, because humans have no requirement for vitamin K2. We also have bacteria in our gut that produce this form of vitamin K—so we’re covered either way. - See more at: http://www.theveganrd.com/2011/06/fat-soluble-vitamins-do-they-stand-between-vegans-and-health.html#sthash.n1GXATZ6.dpuf

If OP does find the artificial sweeteners disgusting, you can add a tablespoon of lemon or orange juice to a cup of water, its just enough to give it flavour, most citrus juices contain 7 calories per 20ml spoon, and you do get a tiny bit of vitamin C, Zinc and other goodies from this, compared to almost no nutrient value from artificial  flavourings.  

If OP is like me and just likes to snack for the sake of snacking, My number 1 tip is to buy a bag of popcorn kernals and learn how to air-pop it in your microwave. A bit of pepper  on it, and for 30 calories a cup, you can munch between meals and not go over your limit."

There's a small part of me that would love to revisit lots of times, times where there's a life wholly dependent on you:

* When you fall asleep with a baby in your arms, also asleep;
* Early mornings - oh so early, peanut - but, ""It's a beautiful day, Daddy!!  Wake up!!""
* Days when you walk into the kindergarten, and you get crashtackled by a blue-eyed small person who is squealing with delight.
* Christmas days where Santa's totally here, Daddy!  Wake up!!
* Cold nights with blankets, watching a cartoon movie and eating cheap popcorn.
* Glorious summer days when you're teaching how to swim.
* Fun afternoons painting furniture.
* Weekends just gaming - Zelda, or Mario, or Banjo.

They are all precious, and they will never come again.

But that first day.  That first moment you hold your child, and everything just makes *sense*.  That was the best."

I've known a lot of girls who wanted to start a modeling career thinking it would be fun, easy, and fast money--it's not, it's a job like any other job and a lot of people don't get how hard it is. But it's easy to just network with photographers and get some good shoots that you can send to agencies and end up doing some commercial work for magazine or TV ads. There's always photographers who will do TFP/TFCD work with you, which is that they shoot with you and you both get the photos (either in print form or digital form on a CD) to use for your portfolios. No money spent for their time or yours--definitely don't do anything with a photographer who wants *you* to pay *them* to model for you, especially when you're starting out. That's where the majority of the scams are--a lot of them take both your money and photos and leave you high and dry.

All in all, it can be fun if you're not looking for fast money or trying to become famous, because it never works out that way. Good luck!"

No one deserves to be insulted like that, even if you make a massive and unforgivable mistake of cheating on him. Your looks are more than fine, you are a beautiful woman. It will just take time for people to trust you again that you won't cheat on them. Keep your head up, ignore that what people say and only go for that which makes you happy.

The cheater should absolutely be held accountable, and I will say that it is 100%their fault that cheating occurred, as they are the one in the relationship.

Takuya-san,Games,1390280733.0,"&gt;... Part of the reason they don't is probably the game engine they're using, of course...

I already mentioned that, mate. However, there's two problems with using this as an excuse:

1. While they can't achieve the excellent fighting mechanics of Chivalry and Mount and Blade, there are tons of modders who have designed *far* better combat mechanics for the games, proving that while you can't have the *best* combat mechanics with this engine, you *can* do far better.

2. This just gives another reason for why the Gamebyro engine is crap, and why it's stupid that Bethesda insisted on sticking with it from Oblivion to Skyrim. Oblivion/Fallout 3/New Vegas were the peak of Gamebryo engine's capabilities, after those games were made (I'm aware NV wasn't developed by Bethesda), it was a perfect time to be working on a new engine (either from scratch or taken from elsewhere). Instead, they pretended Skyrim was using a new engine when it was just a crappy attempt to squeeze more power out of the outdated and crappy Gamebryo engine."

* Tons of crashes at the flat-out right at T5

* Lots of ""sorry"" messages

* &lt; 1 minute lap times


This is more ambitious of a guess but I'll bet that the people who wind up on the podium won't be the 3 fastest (Besides Corossive of course).

 Brands Hatch is a very blind and unforgiving track, and different from most other tracks in the sense that one mistake will literally ruin your entire race. Getting on the podium will depend much more on staying on the track than it will being one of the 3 fastest out on track.

Aelonius,amiugly,1390281085.0,"The first 'emotion' invoked when I opened that album was literally like ""Damn woman, why are you here. You look great"". I think that the way you look is pretty good, but there's a few things you could keep in mind.

Right now, a lot of the pictures are you when not smiling fully. Sure the first one is a bigger smile but it is a very forced smile. Personally I love to see pictures that weren't taken as a portrait or selfie, as they tend to capture much more emotion than a selfie. I'd like to see you smile, brightly and without reservation. 

Clothes-wise I dig the first two outfits but I wonder if you can try and build from that. Nice accessories, more/different colours and the like. 

If you smile more and variate between your clothing and hairstyle a little bit more then I definitely think you'll be a good 7,5/10. Right now, with the lack of a smile I find it around 6,75 - 7/10"

I was in the living room the other day and we had football on all day and I heard the sportscasters creaming themselves over Tom Brady and Eli Manning.  To me it's just so... boring.  However, if there's true competition, skill and effort put into a game, I'll watch.

ztj,science,1390281132.0,"So the reality of how this plays out is that when I am not eating with nutrition in mind, I don't plan my meals at all. I end up eating less, usually only once or twice a day as an actual ""meal"" and then snacking on garbage food the rest of the time. Also, in this comparison, calories from sugary drinks aren't included. I've eaten nutritiously with sugary drinks added and without, as well as eating unplanned/garbage food with and without sugary drinks. If I add all the calories when i drink sugary drinks, it typically adds about 350 a day based on the label.

Also, when eating nutritiously, I'm not eating garden salads. I eat things like black bean couscous, greek pasta salad/olives, marinara, whole wheat pastas and breads (wheat that hasn't gone through the industrial refining process is really high in a few key nutrients, same with rice), tofu, bananas, almonds... so many almonds. I snack on almonds. And whole fruit blender/smoothie drinks (as in, a few pieces of fruit/vegetable are blended entirely and consumed entirely. Not pressed to just get the sugars. Beets are great for this, tons of nutrients and sweet as well, just gotta watch for stains). I do sometimes eat salads, but, generally it's with a decent amount of questionable dressing such as store bought caesar so I view these as more of a treat.

Interestingly, the primary mechanism that drew me to all these foods (besides my sense of taste and such preferences) was looking for lower sugar and salt and higher potassium, magnesium and calcium as well as other useful nutrients, but, those were the main goals. Finding that I ended up consuming the same caloric range daily was just a coincidence. I really just ate what I needed to satisfy my hunger.

And it's worth pointing out here that I am certain there are people with an entirely different problem. Rather than simply struggling with drinking sugary drinks at all, some people may seriously binge on it. I know people who must consume a gallon of soda a day. A ""big"" soda day for me would be two 20 oz bottles. That's ""only"" 560 calories. But 560 calories repeated over a week is supposedly more than enough to gain a pound of fat. If that was true I'd weight like 500 lbs from years of regular soda drinking.

My only real ""theory"" (term used loosely) on what causes the difference is based on the notion that refined foods make it too easy for my body to acquire and then store the energy from foods and that the foods that have higher nutrition value simultaneously have harder to digest energy sources. They tend to be fatty-veggy foods with complex carbohydrates and tons of nutrients. Whereas when I'm eating poorly it's entirely processed, refined, industrially manufactured foods that are super easily digested. But, I also wonder if maybe having more nutrients available makes it so my body is less likely to store energy as fat since it is needed to build new cells or whatever other maintenance is going on with said nutrients... well, it's an idea anyway.

Other dietary oddities that might be relevant are that I typically don't eat much, if any cheese when I'm shooting for nutrition. There just isn't much value in it. But, I'll eat it when I'm not paying attention to this. Other than cheese, I consume almost zero dairy besides what might be in breads I eat. I'm mildly lactose intolerant. I also avoid meat in general, but, I'm not really a vegetarian. I'll have fish or poultry or eggs. I actively avoid mammalian meats, though.

Oh, and I have had a full blood workup and physical recently and I have no heart health risk factors (though I was losing weight at the time and that put the triglycerides on the high end of the acceptable range, apparently).

IndignantChubbs,TrueAskReddit,1390281293.0,"Well, first, hatred of elites is basically mandatory. My stance is that elites are to be condemned and fought against when they act cravenly or stupidly, but should not be hated as a group. Hatred is detrimental to a person and a movement, and it's unfair unless you're familiar enough with a person's individual life to render a judgment about his/her moral character. All elites are in a position of unjustified power, but the legitimacy of their social position is not a sufficient criterion to judge their entire moral character.

Beyond that, lots of hatred for conservatives and liberals and basically anyone who isn't anarchist, in my rather limited experience. I just loathe the elitism and intellectual arrogance of the place. It's very doctrinaire, which is contradictory to what anarchism is about. I dunno, it just makes me sad that that place is the face of anarchism for redditors, and that in general anarchists appear to be really angry young people who have no sense beyond ""smashing capitalism"" and then the world will be better.

12 Days - thematically off; but as a game it's actually got some nice mental meat to it. A trick taking game that's simple enough to understand and quick to play.

[Timeline][Cardline] - more historical than fictional/fantastical, not the greatest replayability

[DragonHeart] - thematically works but it is a strictly 2 player game. very simple to play but looks like it has some strategy to it

[Forbidden Island/Desert] - cooperative but has strategy, simplicity, a light theme that could appeal to her sensabilities maybe

[Chaosmos] - has a lovely scifi theme. it isn't too hard. But it IS on kickstarter. But they DO have a print-n-play version. You could print out the game as is. (penny sleeve the cards. *maybe* mount the board on to foamcore and then she has the game until the real version arrives by mail to her house which will have little figurines and such. The real game is shaping up to be quite impressive visually.

[Mice and Mystics] - a fun fantasy game for 2 or more players; cooperative; HEAVILY themed; strong narrative. beautiful game

[Munchkin] - it's hard to say. 8 year olds are 8 year olds. Thematically there's a lot to like for her. That said the game has a lot of bell curve problems for the advanced gamer. It's a fine introduction game and if she's only played chess maybe it would be a nice break but you want three people minimum and four ideally.

[Defenders of the Realm] - if you want to go big because your other choice is to go home. DotR is your game. Lots of figurines, fantasy theme (it has a bloody dragon). Cooperatives, 2+ players. Easy to learn, replayable, strategy. it has it all."

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1390281405.0,"401k/IRAs and other retirement plans are the guarantee. They are the backup, the safety net.

No one says you can't also work on your get-rich-quick schemes. I have worked with startups on the side (a typical 40-hour work week isn't *that* much), and some of the people I've worked with on these projects are rich and entrepreneurial as fuck, but they still have IRAs and other tax sheltered accounts. They still have safe investments.

They didn't have to bank all of their own money/retirement on a single investment like a business/startup. They can use connections, angel investors, venture capitalists, and other sources of capital for their startups. They preferred to share/spread their risk to others, and have a safe, guaranteed backup themselves. Nothing wrong with that.

You don't have to go out of your way to avoid solid advice. Nemester gave obviously ""safe"" advice. No one says you have to stick to one specific strategy/tactic while working your way up."

When yeast come out of dormancy they're initially unable to regulate what passes into and out of the cell wall. Too much sugar inside the cell wall can destroy the organelles, resulting in a dead cell.

From your description it sounds like fermentation has progressed normally. You should cool it down (slowly) to get the yeast out of suspension before packaging and it will probably resolve your bready flavor. The longer you wait the cleaner the beer will taste and look."

Dharmasabitch,funny,1390281464.0,"True feminism already seeks to address gender inequality issues for the benefit of both sexes. The whole spirit of seeking gender equality is that all people are people so we shouldn't divide the population, but delegating a new voice to fight discrimination against men only creates contention where there should be cooperation. I understand that many well-intentioned not-sexist men subscribe to men's rights because they feel alienated by modern feminism, but that's due to poor representation by sexist women who misunderstand the goals and ideals of true feminism. Men who care about gender inequality should openly identify with feminism and make other men more comfortable to be vocal against sexism in any form, instead of creating an antithesis to just generate more contention between men and women who have the same goals."

BigFishMcNish,nfl,1390281565.0,"The thing is, is that he truly *was* a liability in the deep middle for pass coverage. He said during this past off season that he wanted to be ""able to do what Earl does"" in that regard. Well he improved drastically and around week 10 of this year, his senses heightened and he was just breaking on the ball immediately especially in the intermediate passing game. He's just been shutting down horizontal spread offenses since. 

His skills and capability has always been there but it finally came all together this year and then he took off half way through the season. He's bringing elite play to the middle of the field which was needed because last year our weakness was defending shallow passes. 

Earl is still more important to our defense though because without Earl we'd have to switch up our scheme or at least make our corners play way off and Thurmond is the only that seems to proficient in that way (better than Sherman even at times). We need a centerfielder for our defense to work and putting Kam in at our version of a FS would be dumb for the team and for Kam because that's not his style of play--he doesn't have the range and he wouldn't be in position to help in the run as often. He's always been a box safety but he proved he can play deeper than this year if needed to. I also say that based off of last year, he's worth his contract and some people in Seattle were afraid to say that we may have over paid. But thank god his all pro break out year occurred after his lock up because we'd be in deep shit. We're going to pay Earl  about 10 mill a year."

ztj,hearthstone,1390281632.0,"This is a computer game and it can have whatever rules that are desired. There is no special reason it has to emulate any existing card games in any particular way. This should be the guiding tenet of designing an all-virtual card strategy game like this. Other elements of the game already reflect this, such as the massive amount of accounting going on for minion states, health, etc.

As far as other games, I have not encountered this problem in hundreds of real games. Even getting just four of a card in a Magic booster draft would've been extremely lucky and rare, particularly if a neighbor picked up on your collecting of certain cards. It's important to remember that Hearthstone is already not a true draft. There is no draft competition. You can't get any idea of what the competition is drafting and draft to counter or prevent their deck construction.

I mean, really, there is very little in common between hearthstone arena and real life CCG drafting. The developers openly recognized that on stage at Blizzcon and that is why it's called Arena, not draft.

So I stand by my opinion that it would be entirely reasonable to maintain card count limits in decks. Not that it isn't interesting as is, but, eventually it would be cool for the game to be taken a little more seriously, which is why I alluded to the possibility of more modes ""crazy arena"" vs ""serious arena"" or whatever."

You should have one *weekend*  away from it all - worries of building a new family, stressful wedding plans, and what you're losing.  I think it would be more helpful to be away from the city, away from everything that's stressing you, to just be with your friends surrounded by nature - where it's simpler and your problems feel so much smaller. If I was guy, I'd choose to go camping for the bachelor party and save the burlesque show for a night with the wifey. 

On Valentine's, I often see a bunch of men lined up all the way down the card section. All of them deciding on their last minute purchase. Why not buy cards several months ahead of time? Store them in a box marked ""snow gear"" or ""birth records"" to dissuade snooping. Having a wide selection of birthday cards on hand has been helpful so I'm surprised more guys don't do this.

iLoveMuse,loseit,1390281681.0,"Even since losing just 10lbs I get significantly more looks from men (went from 130ish to 120ish), and I totally understand what you mean. For as long as I can remember, getting looked at or having my picture taken has always made me anxious and annoyed. You'll get more used to it over time, but I think even when I achieve the body I want, being looked at and having my pic taken will still make me nervous to some extent. 

That being said, I was unable to overcome my sabotaging behaviors (binging out on delicious things while high) until I started intermittent fasting. I now only eat between 12 and 8, or sometimes 11:30 and 7:30. So now, when I think about wanting some delicious thing in my mouth at 10PM, I remember that I'm past my eating window and promptly forget about it. If I absolutely have to have something, I'll have some unsweetened vanilla almond milk; the whole container is only 120 calories, so one serving is practically negligible, and fills me up pretty well. But this is only a last resort, because sweet or salty flavors are what tend to trigger me to eat more. 

All this doesn't mean that I don't still slip up on occasion. I've been sticking to ~1200 calories per day for the last few weeks, but on Saturday night I ended up at 2200 after a cheese quesadilla, half a protein bar, some chocolate milk...you get the point. What's most important is that you don't spend an excessive amount of time beating yourself up about the occasional failure, because, at least in my experience, that only results in more failure."

I personally could take or leave hockey, but I like beer and hanging out, so...

Masculinity can be a tricky subject amongst trans men and/or lgbt people. There's a lot of judgment going both/all ways. If people are giving you shit for being a masculine (trans) guy, though, you might be better off without them. The social should enhance the personal."

When I design, depending on what it is, I have always taken the user experience or the customer experience into account--for print or for web. Right now I'm in Brand design as well because I have these skills, which will hopefully lead to more branding projects.

A PR of 4 feet will be tough, but is more than possible, like /u/bitbee said, especially at your age. 

Like /u/superchou mentioned, you also need to weight train. Superset deep squats (if you can't do a deep squat, de-load and do as much weight as you can, even it's just the bar) with box jumps. 

I've improved 36 inches over the course of 2 years (I'm female and was shooting for 40 feet).

You should also try box jumping drills [like these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAPAtrMhv_o). But do them faster as you get better at them. Those helped me so much I can't even tell you. Also being that tall, work on shortening your stride slightly coming down the runway so you don't reach when you get the board. I'm 5-11 and had issues reaching for a few reasons, but stand in baby powder, then run down the runway to see if your strides are even and not too far apart. If they are, work on getting them just a bit shorter and more consistent.

She also seems to not know how to blend, like, at all. Not only that, but she's basically a scam artist. She claimed her skincare products (iQQU) were FDA approved- guess what? One of them was actually denied approval by the FDA, and another one she never even tried to have them check it. I don't see how anyone can respect her after convincing young fans to put dangerous chemicals on their faces, all for the benefit of her wallet.

Not only that but she preaches so much about natural beauty, when she has gotten fillers and other cosmetic procedures done. I don't think there's anything wrong with plastic surgery or other cosmetic procedures at all- it's just that I don't understand why you would talk so much about accepting your natural beauty meanwhile getting your cheek muscles relaxed. It's kinda hypocritical. She continues to sometimes admit to the procedures, sometimes deny them. It's weird.

Edit: http://michellephail.tumblr.com/post/3025093924 check that for the iQQU scandal. Look through their posts for other shit on her."

I'm already as active as I can be at this stage, so at this point any weight loss has to come from diet until I can shift enough weight to reap the health benefits in order to increase my activity. 30lbs is just a numerical goal, obviously as I go along I plan to test my physical limits and increase my activity gradually, But I have a lot to lose and diet is the most important factor in large-scale weight loss."

These shakes really help and make getting all your calories much easier. 

**Gaining Shake**

* 16 oz (475 mL) milk
* 1 Cup (235 mL) uncooked oats
* One large scoop of all natural peanut butter (dont have an exact measurement on this). Maybe 1/2 cup (120 mL)
* 1 - 2 scoops protein powder (measurement varies)

**Optional**

* 1 Banana 
* Olive oil or coconut oil

Blend, drink, relax, knowing you just had 800 - 1500 calories. 

If you live in a market where there is a Costco, Costco is your friend. Just the supplies for these shakes will pay your membership fee over buying them at the store. 

Also, you cant take breaks for weeks without expecting to regress. You need to set a schedule and stick to it. You might want to look into something like Starting Strength to build a base. Couple that with a high calorie diet (sounds like you're naturally skinny) and you should start to see some progress. "

This is due to a combination of saving energy for when it matters and the overall effects of playing an insane number of games the last 4 years. We will quickly see in the playoffs whether he has actually dropped off at all defensively.

2nd is his offense. If he simply wanted to, he could take more shots and challenge KD for the scoring title. He could get more free throws. He could post up more. But he doesn't, because it's draining, and I think he wants to shoot 60%. This is why I didn't understand the jealousy comment he recently made regarding KD's shot attempts. He's jealous that he's choosing to shoot less? 

Anyways, it's possible that KD has surpassed LeBron, but I really doubt it. We will find out in the playoffs."

keakealani,singing,1390282377.0,"Well, if it's at all possible, can you meet with the show's music director or your school's choir teacher and just work a little bit one-on-one? While obviously actual voice lessons is always ideal for learning how to sing (especially quickly), it couldn't hurt to spend a little extra time solidifying your singing if you're not super comfortable with it. 

Another piece of advice, though, is not to hold yourself up to a standard of what a certain role or song sounds like, and especially not to imitate another singer's voice too closely. Each voice is unique and no matter how hard you try, you can't healthily imitate another voice exactly. Plus, it's better artistically to put yourself into the role rather than parroting what you have heard or seen in the past. You got cast to be you, not to be an imitation of somebody else. So try not to feel pressure to perform exactly like another singer, but just sing your own voice. (I know that sounds like a lame motivational speech, but it's actually true in singing.)

Beyond that, I agree with /u/Emanemanee that precise diction will be really helpful. Singing clearly is really highly valued in musical theatre style so it's definitely important to make sure you are being accurate both with vowels and consonants. A well-formed vowel can also facilitate a lot of other good singing habits, like good breathing and resonance. 

Also, since singing is mostly about breath support, it's always a good idea to focus on breathing when you sing. Even before you vocalize, it can be very helpful to do a few short breathing exercises. There are many variants, but a general breathing exercise focusing on inhaling and exhaling efficiently would be a great way to start your warmup. "

Esoteric_Indulgence,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1390282405.0,"As someone very close to your age, my solution was moving from physical stores to online stores. 

All my business clothing is from [Unique Vintage](http://www.unique-vintage.com) because I've found most outfits are tailored well to their sizes, they're well made, and they had the young, but professional look that I wanted.

For a wider range of styles I shop at [ModCloth](http://www.modcloth.com). They also have a nice range of clothing; anything from casual to party to business. The only thing is their selection is so large that it might take a while to find what you're looking for.

For special occasions and splurges, I like [Mac Duggal](http://www.macduggal.com). If you're willing to do some online searching, some of his older collection clothing can be found on discount store sites. But he has a range of prices for a range of occasions for almost any age. 

My older sister likes Wet Seal, but I've never shopped there, so I don't know much about their styles or selections. You could also consider looking at handmade clothing available on Etsy. I swear there is always something awesome being made by people on Etsy. The only draw back is you might have to wait for them to make it before they can ship it."

At least, from what you're experiencing at the moment, trying some more projected bras seems like it's worth it.  Just a shot in the dark, but you might like some of the recent (last season and the new spring season) Curvy Kate bras.

yummycorndog,penpals,1390282565.0,"I have a little story. It's not mine to tell, it's a co-workers, but my favorite co-worker, and the only one I am friends with and connect with on an emotional level, despite being 2 guys. 

I opened up to him about a lot of my life, used to be a drug addict.. bi-polar.. etc. And he opened up to me about some of his experiences. He is a bright guy, 24, insanely good at math and in college to become an engineer. He told me he was in a Call of Duty tournament and won $10,000. Anyway, on to the story... 

He was living in Mexico with his dad (he's a white-washed Hispanic guy), and was working as an auto-mechanic, they had their own shop. Mexico is a very corrupt place, and by some way or another him and his dad were making lots of money, but they were the legitimate ones. He told me they made big deposits to the bank very regularly, he was 18 at the time. Apparently, the bank teller who knew about these big deposits they were making, informed some not-so-legitimate people about it. They went to the bank one day, and as they were walking out, there were 5 cars waiting for them. His dad said, ""Run."" And Francisco ran. They shot him in the arm, he has a scar of a bullet hole in his arm. They (the mafioso's) took them to a remote location where they were growing opium and marijuana. Francisco and his dad were forced to labor 14 hours a day growing the crops. They were fed 3 meals a day, of tortillas with beans and rice and cheese, a meager meal, basically. And they drank disgusting murky tap water. He told me he was fatigued one day, and could not work, and the guy (a mafioso) walked up and hit Francisco in the face with the butt of his gun. 

He was there 14 months. In captivity. How he escaped? Well, one day the mafioso's were not there. They didn't have to work, stayed in their confines, and the girl who brought them their food came 3 times a day. On the 2nd day, they still weren't there. On the 3rd day, Francisco and his dad said fuck it. And when the girl came to give them their food, they beat the living hell out of her and ran. 

I don't know exactly what happened after that, but Francisco and his dad were safe. His dad had some connections through his auto-shop, and vindication was in demand. The 5 mafioso's were murdered dead, and the bank teller was sent to jail. 

Francisco has back problems, from being forced to sit in a wooden chair for 5 days straight, and all the other stuff that happened to him. He hates water, because of that experience, and only drinks enough that he needs, he usually drinks soda. His name actually isn't Francisco, it was something else, but he changed it, his last name too. 

I've never told this story before, and like I said, it's not mine to tell. Oh yeah, he really likes Dan Brown, and I think he saw his reddit AMA, I don't think he's a casual redditor though. 

Francisco is the only friend I have in my life right now. He's intelligent, kind, and extremely rational. I don't understand how he is so high functioning after that experience. I love ya, bud. Thanks for being the only person that means something to me right now. "

I am personally someone who loves knowing exactly what is needed and expected of me, because to me that is good communication. It's also a good model for creatives who work well under pressure and close to a deadline.

I recently started an illustration job that was very loose in the beginning and everything was ""oh use your best judgement."" But then the edits were insurmountable after I'd already laid everything out. So I told the client a list of things I wanted them to think about and anticipate (race/clothes/context/etc for characters I was drawing) and tell me BEFORE I start so less time would be wasted on edits. Once they started doing that, the project has been flying by and the edits they do need are minimal and not a complete re-haul.

For others, it might not be so great. But honestly, that just comes down to compatibility. You find the right designer for your management style and vice versa.

The mod is very fun. There is a massive amount more zombies, of which are actually a threat. Roaming through towns and cities isn't a matter of sprinting house to house and going on your merry way assuming you don't run into a bandit, you have to hide from zombies as well as players. Getting in a firefight is a threat in the city because of how many zombies are around, you can kill someone, but you can't take their gear unless you kill all the zombies that follow the sound of your gunshots and no other players hear the inevitable volley of shots you'll be letting off.

keakealani,singing,1390282898.0,"I agree completely with /u/ghoti023. In particular, I want to stress the idea that most of what you are doing in an average lesson is going to be valuable in your practice session - everything from warmups to the way you approach a certain phrase to the physical movements you're asked to imitate. Even if your teacher isn't directly writing you a practice journal, you should generally feel comfortable that you can take those exercises and practice with them. 

I do want to stress the value of communication, though. If you are having these concerns, you should absolutely bring them up with your teacher. If you're not comfortable doing so in person or you don't want to use up your lesson time to have this discussion, perhaps you can email them or schedule a time to call and chat. 

While I think your teacher's method might be valid for some students, it's absolutely possible that your learning style doesn't mesh with what he's teaching you. But, you don't know if he's doing that because he misunderstood your learning style, or because he genuinely doesn't know how to teach (or at least, teach to you). I really think it's a good idea to chat with him and let him know that you aren't quite getting what you expected from your lessons. You never know 'til you try. 

But, it should be stressed more often that no two teachers are alike. There are many schools of thought in education, and teaching singing is no exception. And, most of us are influenced heavily by our own learning styles - we teach best to students who learn like us. While obviously a great teacher will be flexible and teach to many different types of student, some teachers need a lot more of a push to do so, or may not have the experience to teach to a student who needs something very different than they provide. This is totally fine! But it means that you may be looking for referrals to another teacher in the area rather than continuing with this one. "

He's also been a bit less careless with the ball. 

This is important, because he's our best guy to create a shot for himself off the dribble and close games at the free throw line. When he's commanding enough defensive attention to take some of the heat off of Harris, Joe stretches the floor for everyone else on offense.  

Going forward, though, I think the keys to us really firing on all cylinders will be Tobey and Gill. If Tobey can be a bit more decisive and Gill can earn more minutes with his defense, I think we could compete with anyone we face. "

1kachan,canada,1390283084.0,"I will try to simply this without going into details, it was my economic views. I was very attracted to socialism in high school. I thought collective ownership of the means of production, the expansion of the welfare state, 5-year planning, heavy regulation of industy, corporate taxes, as well as progressive income tax were wonderful ideas. 

As I grew older and more versed in economic policies, I began to grow less and less left-wing and more centrist. Political Science was helpful for that, so too was living on my own and realizing how being fiscally conservative was beneficial to my life.

I also began to read ideologies and policy positions from a variety of different positions such as libertarianism, communism, social democracy, classical liberalism, and etc. 

I would say now I am at a point in my life where I am socially liberal and fiscally conservative, a non-authoritative right-of-centre. 

I disagree with the CPC as much as I disagree with the LPC and NDP. My vote is a compromise and right now the Liberals look like they have my vote. I have to compromise my social views with my economic ones. None of the parties are a true reflection though, we need electoral reform. "

keakealani,singing,1390283261.0,"I remember hearing a Radiolab episode a while back that talked about this, and linked the vocal fry (or ""creak"" as some linguists call it) to a new ""prestige dialect"" amongst young women. I think it's interesting for a variety of social reasons - I agree with the article that it has an affectation of being ""laid back"" or ""too cool"", which are attitudes all too common amongst young people, especially young women. 

And even though I'd like to think I'm pretty aware of what's going on in my voice, there are definitely times where I catch myself using it! And even when I'm not truly frying, I tend to speak at the very bottom of my range and it can be fatiguing over time if I'm holding a lot of conversations. The irony is, I tend to fry more when I'm tired, which makes me even more tired and turns into a vicious cycle. 

I do tend to turn to my supported, projecting ""singer's voice"" when I'm talking a lot throughout the day, though - it really does wonders to reverse those early feelings of vocal fatigue I get if I'm talking unhealthily too much. 

Also, it's worth reiterating also that hydration can also help stave off some of these effects as well - speaking a lot can dry the throat an awful lot and sometimes we're less conscious of our hydration when speaking than when singing. It's a very good idea to keep a water bottle around or take regular water breaks if you are speaking a lot throughout the day."

It is a lot less demanding and some groups don't even have an all-days portion of pre-tour. Plus, it will help wean you into corps.

But, if you insist on Cavaliers, don't internalize your frustrations. Talk about it with other members, especially other rookies or ""new guys"" I think the Cavaliers say. You're in the same boat as all of them.

My coach and I really had to work to stop me from running like a 400m runner down the runway. When I finally did, my jumps were much more powerful. The shorter strides eliminate the reaching, which puts your take off leg right under your hip (where it's supposed to be) for take off, and makes for a much longer, more powerful jump.

If you're in a field house and have a padded mat, try to do your bounding drills on that. It'll save your shins. 

Also -- single leg squats, single leg bounds, etc. If you have access to a pool this winter, try going through all three phases in the shallow end. It helps hip flexor strength as well as allows you to go through each phase consecutively but in slow motion, making sure everything is perfect."

It's a sad thing when you realise that someone is only being nice to you because they need the emotional and/or physical validation. This was why my ex got with me in the first place, and why she cheated on me repeatedly.

Unless, and until she targets the underlying psychological issues that lead to her needing physical validation from others, you need to stay strong and keep away from her.

InfinitelyThirsting,AskWomen,1390283651.0,"Men and women are physically, biologically different. One of the biggest examples is skeletal--men are built for running, and women are *factually* significantly inferior when compared to men, because of the adjustments our skeletons make for childbirth. The fastest women in the world, who win races and marathons? Have times that are equaled by high school male athletes. And a lot of sports include running, as well as brute size and strength.

It doesn't mean female athletes don't try as hard, or can't be as interesting, but if you actually compare statistics, then the reality is that women just can't compete on the same playing field as men, in most sports. It's not about a woman representing all women--it's that statistically, no women will be able to compete with the top men.

kosif,AskReddit,1390283814.0,"I used to live by a high-school, and one night they had a football game. I came home to find my motorcycle moved to the sidewalk, and someone parked in my spot. So I parked behind them, blocking them in and waited on my porch, which was about 10 feet away. 

Sure enough, a few mins later I hear some dude with his family return to their car, and start flipping out about how they're blocked in. So, I walk back over and tell them it's my car. Dude starts getting pissy with me, saying it's public parking... up until the point where I point out all the ""do not park"", towing company signs and the address to my place painted across the spot. He then starts blustering about how he didn't see any of that, so I ask him why he thought it was appropriate to move my bike so he could park. He didn't really have an answer for that one.

I hated living by the high-school."

Shit, I'm one of TWO with two parents who work their asses off and I drive a 91 Ford Escort that was bought for $800, and that's more than many of my friends have, who can't even get their license because they can't afford to pay for car insurance, let alone a new car. Most can't afford to go buy a classic car and restore every part, or even have the time to invest in such a project. And it reeks of materialism ""My daughter had one of the hottest cars at school."" Who cares? Is that what really matters in life?

He is very lucky he could afford to do all of these things. Many are not able to have enough money to build their own computer for 12 children, buy 12 cars and have the time for them to restore all of them, allow them to all play a sport, be in Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts...

And the thing on not being a picky eater bothered me, someone with food allergies. What if your child has food allergies and can't eat everything? I'm allergic to many kinds of foods and can't eat any desserts or go to parties and eat like everyone else can. But this guy made it sound cocky.

in my case, i worked at a payday loan store that cashed checks and had a variety of other services too.  we followed state and federal money service business laws and often our policy was even more stringent.  

consider the various types of fraud.  there is the one you are speaking of, where the money is legit but the reason for using the money is an illegal or fraudulent purpose.  legally, a bank can freeze those funds.  its not likely to happen, and certainly not with a payday loan store, but we have seized incoming funds such as western union when we have been alerted internally that the source is likely illegal.  there are certain flagged names and places, for example, within the western union system.  

then there is the scam where someone buys something and says their shipper is going to come pick the item up, so cash this huge check and pay the shipper out of it.  

or do a mystery shop of western union, check cashing, or moneygram services by cashing this check and wiring most of it back to our company.  keep your commission and do a quick writeup online about the service!  

or the nigeria, prince, wealthy, etc. 

these checks come in SO FREQUENTLY.  Not to mention fake insurance checks, travelers checks, etc.  If you're not on the lookout, not only is your company liable for the money, but can be fined for aiding in the fraud.  

So yeah, we weren't giving you money or performing your service until we knew damn well and good what type of thing it was for and if that ""made sense"" logically in context of the situation.  

That said, it's all just because of the particularly structured money laws.  If they were more lax nobody'd ever ask a question.

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1390284709.0,"I have several but my favorite is:

""*The mind is not a vessel to be filled...
It is a fire to be kindled!*""

--Plutarch

Quota-based educational style was really stressful to me.  I didn't take rigid structure which I hadn't created very well. Yet I had my special interests which my parents were kind enough to indulge and give me a fair amount of freedom on, pretty much what kept me sane. Even before I discovered this quote, when I was in the flow with one of my special interests... it really felt like I cast aside my worries,  time disappeared and my mind was on fire, in a good way. The quote reminds me to feed my passions and mind the fuel they need in order to keep journeying through life with a clear head and a reasonable amount of sanity intact.

A close second:

""*Esse quam videri.*"" 

--translated from Latin as ""To be, rather than to seem,"" a statement on being authentic and representing yourself as truthfully as possible; am considering it as a first tattoo.  It challenges me in that, I have to wear various scripted personalities to accommodate various situations, so in one way folks aren't really perceiving the real me.  However, my motivations, intentions and feelings are true even if by proxy of the scripted personality thingy so they are still getting the real me in many ways. ""*Artists use lies to tell the truth...*"" and all that."

keakealani,musictheory,1390284732.0,"In addition to /u/instantwalrus's comment, I'm also a bit concerned about 

&gt;it explains concepts without using musical notation at all, mostly using references to a piano keyboard instead

This seems like it could cause a lot of ambiguity - piano keyboards, for example, don't really adjust for enharmonic spellings, so arguably someone could misbelieve that a D major chord consists of D, Gb, and A. It seems like it's wordier and more difficult to explain why that's wrong on a piano keyboard than to illustrate stacked thirds on a staff which clearly show the relationship each pitch within a triad have to each other. 

I think there are probably other reasons with using a keyboard-centric approach to explaining music theory, not the least which being that actual keyboardists don't read music based on diagrams of their instrument, so the people who will have the most familiarity with the keyboard will be the least likely to benefit from this approach. It seems rather counterintuitive, to me. 

Plus, I feel that it's beneficial to learn theory in a way that can apply equally to all (or at least most) instruments and backgrounds, as it seems limiting to assert one instrument's layout as being more crucial to understanding theory than another. 

Edit: This is not to say that pictoral explanations can't be helpful or that keyboard knowledge isn't important, but it seems limiting and I'd be worried that it leaves important information out. It's a little like learning how to speak a language but without learning to read or write - you may be able to communicate some ideas, but it seems like it's leaving out a pretty crucial piece of the puzzle.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390284864.0,"Um, all I;'m gonna say is this line of thinking is way behind the times.

Conservative thought has been useful for much of history, but it's not relevant to the 21st century.

A little history.

For most of history, we had no healthcare, no technology. The way for the species to survive was basically by breeding as much as possible, with only a few people actually surviving. In the 20th century, this led to a population explosion as we kept reproducing, but our advancement in medicine and the like has allowed us to live much longer, with lower mortality rates and stuff. But now we're becoming OVERPOPULATED, and it's hurting the planet.

That being said, we can't continue the old way. It's outmoded and suited for a different time. In the modern time, it's okay to have a lower birth rate. It's good that we are more able to control reproduction. We dont WANT the population to keep expanding. It's harmful to oursleves and the planet. It's unsustainable. Liberalism is what makes us adapt. If we don't cut back on reproduction in modern times voluntarily via these liberal ideas, we're gonna have problems in the future, and probably have to adopt 1 child policies like china or something. 

That's the thing with conservatives nowadays. Their ideas are good...but not in the modern times. We don't need the same attitudes we needed in the past, heck, continuing them will be harmful. "

ecclectic,Welding,1390284898.0,"All else aside, there is something to be properly discussed here.

A few questions:

1. Is that structural channel, or formed sheet?  I assumed it was 3"" channel at first, but I'm not so sure after going through the pictures again.

2. Is this a private residence or a public venue?

3. Was any of this done through proper channels? (Clearly the welds weren't inspected, so was any of the building done to any code?)

I'm not expecting answers, but things to think about.

Really concerning things:

Aside from the poor welds:

1. The beams seem to be bent.  Not just a little, but at least 2 degrees.

2. They aren't even joined at the cross-members, which would have been the most obvious place to do it.

3. The top flange seems narrower than the lower one.

4. How is the floor actually secured to the beams?

5. What is inside the brick-work columns?  Either they are fake, someone put WAY more work into hollowing them out to fix them around a steel post or, god forbid, they are actually just brick columns.

Mephrael,AskReddit,1390285077.0,"&gt; they don't really seem to like me all that much.

I've spoken about this on reddit a number of times, but one thing that many parents seem to forget is that, at some point, the relationship transitions from parent/child to adult/adult with a hint of blood. The goal of raising a child shouldn't just be to push them forward, but also to make sure that when they get to adulthood, that you can have a continuing bond with them. 

People think blood is enough, but it isn't, and when you either resent your family, or feel you have nothing to say to them, then you shouldn't also have to feel obligated to stand by them. 

As hard as it is to do so, I say to you, trust your instincts, they were trying to tell you something then, and they will always continue to do so. Believe in yourself and your ability to adapt and grow, and one day you'll wonder why so many of these choices and activities worried you so badly. I was once not so dissimilar, though for wildly different reasons. I hit my breaking point one day and decided to stop being the victim, trust in myself, and seek my own path to what felt right.

Good luck on your journey, fellow traveller of life. Remember that good things can be found in the least likely of places if you look hard enough!

Use condoms every time, but try out different ones (ribbed, bare skin, and a size up if the ones you're using feel tight or restrictive).  Talk to her about adding in a hormonal contraceptive in addition to that.  I would recommend pulling out before you cum I'm addition to this as well.  Have a talk about what you would do if she got pregnant, it's important to be on the same page, and if these talks are too embarrassing you shouldn't be having sex until you can just suck it up and talk.  My little brother is around your age .so I feel obligated to throw in the STD+ pregnancy safety part as well.  That being said....



Remember, it's about fun and passion.  Just enjoy yourself.  You're not both going to finish every single time you have sex, at least not at first.  If all you think about is the climax then it's going to be even more difficult.  Putting a little lube in the condom before putting it on can help it feel more sensitive.  When you're getting to know each other's bodies, I personally think it's a good idea to avoid pornography as well as masturbation.  Her touch will feel better when you haven't made yourself cum recently.  You obviously know your body better, so sometimes it can take a little longer for someone else to get you in just the right way.  Tell her what feels good.  Guide her hands.  Be vocal, make sure she knows you're into it.  A lot of guys will be silent because they're used to suppressing the sounds so no one in the house will hear.  If you have privacy, make a little nose, I love it when my husband doesn't hold back, it's a major turn on.  Ask her what she likes, tell her to give you some indication when you hit a good spot.  Find and become best friends with her clitoris.

Again, have fun.  Above all be very open and honest with each other.  If you're not going to finish, it's ok to tell her.  You're still getting to know each others likes, and you both being Virgins means you're learning everything for the first time, including what you like others to do to you.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390285422.0,"It favors the rich, but I'm not sure there's much that can reasonably be done about it. We already guarantee everyone a lawyer, but obviously paying for a lawyer would give you a higher standard of service. Paying public defenders more would cost a ridiculous amount of money and wouldn;'t be worth it.

We could alternatively ban non state funded lawyers, but this could have serious problems since it would grant the state a monopoly where it makes no sense for there to be one, and let's face it, it would be easy in such a situation for public defenders to collude with judges and stuff and the entire justice system undermined. I'm just speculating, but the consequences of such an action could easily be negative, and it seems unnecessary to ban an entire private market in the name of fairness, when this in itself would not HELP the poor one bit.

Normally, when I promote nationalization, like say, of healthcare, I expect the results to generally exceed the current standards people currently deal with. I'd expect a single payer system to cover everyone, for instance, meaning people who dont have good care will get it. But with the poor already recieving public defenders, it just doesn't seem worth it to ban private lawyers to spite the rich. To go back to the health care analogy, it would be like saying we cant have private doctors because they make the state doctors look bad...rather than trying to improve the quality of the state doctors. 

In short, bad idea to ban private lawyers. The solution is to find a way to improve public defenders if it can be done. And I'm not sure that it can."

Yearning to have a body that is different than the one you have in some way - especially when the thing you want to change is immutable without cosmetic surgery -  shows that you have not accepted who you are. It causes a rift between who you are and who you think you should be, and you end up wishing you were something that you are never going to be. Which is harmful.

When turned inwards, you develop a negative self image, rather than a positive one. Because this happens gradually over time, you don't notice that it is the root cause of why you are unhappy. If you cannot accept yourself, you certainly cannot accept another person. Which makes for a lot of failed relationships.

Having unrealistic expectations is harmful. When you have unrealistic expectations of yourself, you damage your own self-esteem."

2. A thought experiment doesn't require a basis in reality; it's merely the examination of a hypothetical procedure's consequences (see: Schrodinger's Cat, which assumes we can completely isolate a point of spacetime from observation, or the Infinite Monkeys at Infinite Typewriters, which is patently impossible). Heck, part of the point of thought experiments is that their nature makes them impossible to empirically perform, so we work them out logically and mathematically. 

Whether or not the physics works is even less applicable to philosophical thought experiments - yes, it's technically impossible for me to teleport myself, but teleportation is an analogue for ""identical patterns of matter and energy from which a supposed consciousness originates."" Is the consciousness the result of a pattern (the ""clone"" is a perfect copy of me but is not *me*), or is it independent of the pattern (the pattern is merely a facet of my interaction with the world; as long as *a* pattern exists then I exist)."

That means if you don't take pains to grow the capital - instead of dipping into it for living expenses - you're going to wind up short come retirement time.

Meanwhile, start looking into options that will allow you to get some of your non-IRA money into retirement accounts.  A self-employed 401(k) would be ideal; a Roth 401(k) at a real place of business, even better.

bass10,AskMen,1390285592.0,"I'm generally quite, shy, and a bit introverted.

It's made some aspects of life very difficult for me - especially relationships.

I've been described as the strong, silent type or stoic by some. Laid-back by others.

I don't show a lot of emotion publicly, so I think people would be surprised that I'm a really sensitive person. I feel other's joy &amp; pain and I feel really bad if I hurt someone's feelings or feel like I let them down.

I have quite a few friends, but I'm very guarded and don't allow hardly anyone to really get to know the true me. And, in turn, I rarely get to know anyone else beyond a casual level even though I'm genuinely really interested in people.

I'm fine in a work type environment. I have no problem contacting or talking to someone I don't know if I have a reason to.

Casual encounters are another thing. I have a real hard time interacting around people I don't know - even if the majority of people there are friends. A lot of times people take my quietness as me not liking them and I hate that I make them feel that way because that's rarely the case. I typically over-think what I'm going to say and end up barely saying anything at all. At parties I usually plant myself in one spot and don't move much from it. I feel like everyone notices that I'm not talking to anyone and that just makes me feel more awkward. It's not that I don't want to interact - I really do. A lot of times I feel like I'm in a bubble. I see someone I really want to talk to, but I just can't break out to do it. Most of the time when I get home I think about the missed opportunities and things I should have said. It's really frustrating and something I'm trying to overcome.

I'm someone that really hasn't taken many risks in life and I have quite a few regrets of things/relationships I didn't pursue. Recently I've tried taking some risks and some of them have been positive (I've felt really proud even though most people would think it was no big deal) and some of them have really backfired beyond what I expected.

a1blank,Steam,1390285595.0,"I don't disagree with you, I think.  I'm still making up my mind.  I've purchased a few games in early access (and backed a few on kickstarter).  I also own minecraft.  I think it really boils down to if you trust the dev.  Each of the games I've backed seemed to be trustworthy and had enough of a game ready that they could at least give in-engine footage (Minecraft, Stonehearth, DayZ, Star Citizen).  In my case (especially with Minecraft, DayZ) it boiled down to this: would I feel like I got my money's worth if the game stopped all development at the point that I purchased it.

I agree that there is (or at least could be) a huge problem of encouraging devs to never finish.  One idea I had to deal with this is that steam needs to support a way for devs to state publicly when they expect the game to finish.  Then steam gives them a year or so of leeway and if they haven't finished after that point, refunds the game out of the devs pocket.  Maybe valve could even hold a percentage of all earnings while in early access that only get released to the dev once the game is finished.

Really, I don't know what should be done about the situation.  I think that in some cases, it's a very positive thing and allows devs far more flexibility than they could have gotten otherwise.  In other cases, it clearly isn't a good thing.  As I said, still making up my mind."

Esotericgirl,relationships,1390285609.0,"If you're going to stay, he can get an air mattress, and if need be you can put a lock on the inside of your bedroom door. 

The already suggested scheduling time in certain areas can work providing you both follow through with it and are agreeable. 

It's a shitty situation, but so far you've handled it like a champ. You absolutely don't need to put up with anymore of his bullshit. Don't let him talk you into getting mixed up with him again anymore than you absolutely have to until you can get out of this situation.

To be blunt, I see bad things happening there (emotionally, potentially physically, and quite positive mentally) if he's going to continue to act this way and you stay living together. It will most likely escalate, and it sounds like you really don't need that right now. You have more important things you're trying to do, and those are things that will most likely better your life if you do them.

Is there anyone you know of (friend/family) where you could stay for the next few months while you get yourself back on track? If they would accept less than what you're paying now (or if they would be willing to do a rent free but you help clean or something option), you'd be able to start saving even more for another place which, lease ending soon, you should be doing anyway.

The other option is to check into what it would take to get out of your portion of the lease (this *IS* absolutely doable in most circumstances). Often there will be a chunk of cash that you'd have to pay as an early termination penalty. Who knows, maybe you could find someone else to take over your rent, and you could just switch the names on the lease if your landlord would be open to that idea. It's absolutely worth looking into. 

If you can afford to pay for your portion of rent/utilities there, you could afford to pay the same portion somewhere else. There may very well be rooms for rent, or inexpensive efficiencies with utilities included in the area. Saying you can't afford to leave IMO is easier than working hard to get the hell out of dodge... and it sounds like leaving is what would be healthiest for you. 

It certainly wouldn't be as *CONVENIENT*, but it's something you can do if you really want to.

You can get along without most furniture for a few months. Air mattresses are very inexpensive as are folding chairs and card tables (what kind of furniture do you truly **need**??), your computer can be set on the floor. Anyone that knows what you're going through and is a true friend isn't going to give you shit about not having furniture! So it really comes down to: *what do you really need*?

I don't understand what you mean by your PC not being portable. Never come across any of those before. Sure they aren't convenient, but unless it's built into your wall, it can be moved.

You may have to sacrifice some comforts, but at least you'd be away from his bullshit and be able to concentrate on doing what you have to. "

Arlieth,killingfloor,1390285675.0,"Knowing the requirement bottlenecks and multi-classing means you'll level up significantly faster than trying to do it one at a time.

* Support (obviously)
* Commando by killing Stalkers with Bullpup
* Sharpshooter by killing trash mobs with 9mm Pistol
* Medic by healing teammates

and if you so choose, swap the bullpup with an M79 grenade launcher and combine that with your hand grenades for a compound explosion versus Fleshpounds. Or buy a Flare Pistol, but it's really much more fun being Firebug for that. 

It used to be a lot easier to level up Demo as Support because the M32 was a lot cheaper, but oh well.

Frisky2Times,weddingplanning,1390285995.0,"&gt;1) All things that prepare for a plausible dissolution of a marriage undermine the sanctity of the sacred eternal vows that inhere in marriages
2) prenups are such things
C) therefore prenups undermine the sanctity of the sacred eternal vows that inhere in marriages.


In most countries around the world, marriage is controlled by the state. Most of these provide an avenue for divorce in their laws ( I believe the only exceptions are Philippines and Vatican City). 

If, as you say, ""All things that prepare for a plausible dissolution of a marriage undermine the sanctity of the sacred eternal vows that inhere in marriages"" is true, then the fact that your country (most likely) provides the facility by instrument of law for you to divorce (should you chose to), then, by your rationale, your own marriage is already ""undermined"" before you even undertake it.

I think you have a very young and naive view of marriage. Everyone changes over time, the best that you can hope for in any long term relationship is that you both change together. If you had every found yourself married to someone whom you could not stand, and they could not stand you, I think you would have a very different view on marriage. "

sockalicious,personalfinance,1390286059.0,"I had something like this.  It was a $400-ish bill from Banana Republic which I recalled having paid; when I spotted it on my credit report six years later, it was marked as a $40 bill that was never paid.

I called up Banana Republic and surprisingly, they had clear records of it.  I had accidentally overpaid the bill by $40; but I had been a couple days late so they charged a late fee of $2.50.  However, they then cut me a check for the entirety of the $40 overpayment, leaving the late fee on my account.   Over the next 60 days they charged me two more late fees of $20 each for not paying the $2.50 late fee, then closed the account with a balance of $42.50 as delinquent/never paid.  I had moved across country around this time so I guess I never got the letters.

All I had to do was listen on the phone as the nice customer service lady figured out what had happened.  At one point I said ""so wait a minute; you guys sent me back my $40, when you should have deducted your $2.50 late fee from it; and then you dinged me with $40 in fees and a bad credit report for this?""

She wrote off the delinquent balance and promised to write a letter to the credit agencies explaining that the charges and the account closure for delinquency had been a mistake.  A few weeks later I checked and that report had disappeared from my credit report leaving a flawless record.

If you need to do this or anything like it, I recommend putting on your big-boy hat and being unfailingly, delightfully polite.  I am sure if I had been rude to the nice customer support lady at Banana Republic then this never would have gone so nicely for me."

KeepSantaInSantana,sex,1390286185.0,"Generalizations are generally a big no no.  Some women can't orgasm, or haven't figured out what is quite right for them.  I'm on the opposite end of that spectrum, although there are a few times when I don't finish,.for example, when having an extreme quickie.  While orgasms are great, I also really enjoy the act of sex itself.  I like getting my partner off and making him cum.

I'm assuming you're a virgin or fairly inexperienced, so just a little of advice for the road.  Before sex ask your partner to tell you what she likes and what feels good.  It is likely that it will take some time to get into each other 's rhythms, and if you assume she can't orgasm because it didn't happen at first or isn't happening easily, you will kill your sex life before it starts.  This generalization leaves a lot of women feeling unfulfilled for years before they become more adventurous and confident with their sexuality."

ladycousland,dragonage,1390286229.0,"My canon play-through: 

DAO: Female human noble dual-wielder whose party usually consisted of Alistair, Zevran, and either Morrigan or Wynne depending on what type of banter I was in the mood for. Had a generally helpful/paragon-ish personality with a smartass remark thrown in here and there. Convinced Zathrian to cure the werewolves, destroyed the Anvil and gave the dwarven crown to Harrowmont, sided with the Circle of Mages, saved Connor and Isolde by sending Morrigan into the Fade, and killed the high dragon but kept the location of the ashes a secret. Executed Loghain myself after our duel and then took Morrigan up on her offer in order to save both myself and Alistair. Romanced Alistair and put him on the throne with myself as queen. In Awakening chose to save Amaranthine but fully upgraded the Keep which allowed it to be rebuilt within a few years; all party members survived and the Architect was allowed to live. Spoke to Morrigan before she used the mirror but did not offer to go with her. 

DAII: Female warrior Hawke with a delightfully snarky personality and great hair. Firmly on the side of the mages the whole way through as both her father and sister Bethany were apostates; as a result had rivalries with Sebastian and Fenris. Also developed a rivalry with Merrill over Hawke's refusal to help her mend the Eluvian. All other party members were friends, except for Isabela - I intended to force her to return the Qunari relic but she ran away with it, never to be seen again and left me to fight the Arishok. Left Bethany behind during the Deep Roads expedition and she was forced into the Circle upon my return. Romanced Anders and stood by him even after he blew the Chantry up. Helped the mages to defeat Meredith and the Templars (and Fenris, who had defected to her side) and at the end of the game left Kirkwall, going on the run with Anders. 

There are a few things I might have changed on order for it to feel like a ""perfect"" import (choosing Harrowmont, allowing the Architect to live, not being able to keep Isabela in my party) but for better or worse this is my canon DA play-through. "

It sound great in a lot of ways, and I think the fact that it is a class and community thing has great potential to keep people involved for longer.

I tend toward the meat-head thing myself. But, I'm also an introvert that is *happy* with 30 minutes on the bike, or an hour with an audio book while hitting old-school weights.

I had to apologize for ragging on a few of my friends in Crossfit, and for a couple of the same reasons cited in this (marginally) funny video.

However (you knew there was a however), I have seen some genuinely scary shit in videos, heard some bad stories, and had 2 friends laid up with injuries. There's nothing unsound about the Crossfit ideas, but I think there are some things to be concerned about with respect to how they are implemented. Rhabdo is serious shit, and if it happens it probably means they were coached wrong. Dynamic moves over body or head with Olympic weights are a no-no due to the risk of catastrophic injury; find a different tool (cables!) or movement with the same impact. When proper form starts to break down, fucking stop; muscling out that last squat with your hips out of whack is a fast-track to injury. Community can go sour and turn into mobs that push people to do things they're not ready for; trainers have to stay on top of that shit and check in with students constantly.

My initial take was that maybe you jumped the gun a bit if sex but not oral was off the table?  To clarify, you can stop whenever you feel uncomfortable, and if panties coming off make you uncomfortable, then please, continue saying something.  But what if he didn't want sex?  I mean, you can't give a blowjob without taking off his boxers (well, I suppose you could, but you get my point), right?  But that didn't lead to sex either.  I went down on an ex a few times before we ever had sex, so it's not like it doesn't happen.  Maybe he was thrown off because he wasn't actually going for sex, and yet, that's what he was shot down for.  I'm not saying you were wrong and please don't think I'm accusing you of anything (it's hard to write this without it coming off sounding a bit wrong), but maybe there was a bit of miscommunication.

&gt;He says that he doesn't want to get blue balls and that's why he doesn't want to do anything ""unless we have sex"".

This doesn't make sense at all.  Very bizarre.  Were you clear that sex could happen at some point?

Slukaj,truegaming,1390286377.0,"I think the amount of bitching about it is pretty ridiculous. But hey.

Look, guys, it gives more freedom to two key groups of people: the developers and the consumer. 

* It gives the consumer the ability to gain access to a game that has yet to be released with the caveat that the game is unfinished and they're paying to basically be a tester. They're basically paying for the privilege of not having to wait for something. They're buying impatience. 

* It gives the developer a forward on profits. Game development is fucking *expensive*, and many indie-devs cannot generate the amount of money necessary to fund the entire development of a game. It also allows the developer to collect information from their players which is used as test data to fix bugs.

It gives the two primary groups involved in game development an added choice, and choice in a free market is incredibly important. Nobody is being forced to make a choice, but having the option is always better than not having it, even if the option is usually bad. 

A lot of people also conveniently forget well known examples of what is essentially ""early access"" release: Minecraft and Kerbal Space Program. 

Minecraft was in development from May of 2009 up to it's official release in November of 2011. The game was in development, but still available for purchase, for *two and a half years*. 

Kerbal Space Program has been in development since 2011 and is still *unreleased yet available for purchase*. There isn't even an ETA on a possible ""official"" release.

The problem people seem to have with Early Access is the ""I'm excited for X and want it now, but I can't get over the fact that it's not done!"" 

With an early access title, you're *paying to have the opportunity to not wait for something.* That's literally it. You can either wait for a product (like me waiting for [Routine](http://www.routinegame.com/)), or you can just buy it now. If you would be ok with waiting for the game if it weren't available on Early Access, then Early Access isn't for you.

It's pretty fucking simple. 

EDIT: Also, with this:

I wanted to shoot a former biology undegrad working on a waste paper (in a Ph.D program) for using microgram notaton for discussing municipal waste streams (things measured in hundreds of thousands of tons per year) and composting (another thing measured in short tons).

This meant the paper was describing 1.65561e17 micrograms of landfilled waste (annually).  Which basically means absolutely nothing to anyone in the waste industry, as they work with 100's of tons per day, and subsequently the research in waste in the U.S. is almost always in short-tons (possibly converted to metric tons or has a table with both values clearly marked).

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1390286511.0,"&gt; But what I am suggesting is that all of thee ideas - which can make 'big money' - absolutely do not involve saving, frugality, investing, paying off debt. The opposite - they require spending, risk-taking, investing via debt.

You know, I actually agree with that last part, depending on the debt. I usually assume most people are referring to high interest petty debt like credit card debt. That doesn't help investments for many of us. It's too small of an amount to make a difference, and interest too high to leverage

However, one of the most common ways the middle class elevate themselves into millionaire status is through real estate. Mortgage interest is low and a lot of people with the means to pay off mortgage immediately don't bother to sell their stocks and other investments just to pay it off soon. They do risk reward analyses based on specific percentages (adjustable rates, refinancing, tax deductions, and all that factored). That mortgage ends up being enormous leverage and growth engine for net worth *iff* real estate value rises. It just goes to show that debt isn't a huge deal depending on context. So on that point, my own experience does agree with you on that point.

Besides mortage and other very low interest debts though, most of the time it's not that feasible to go into debt. Besides, an average bank won't loan you hundreds of thousands of dollars at low interest just for you to make market investments or even to start a business unless you have collateral. I am admittedly more familiar with equity financing than debt financing.

&gt;  I think the average guy can make 'big money' - but he very well will not if he tries to follow Nemester's advice.

The average guy fails when he tries to start his own business. This shouldn't stop people from trying, but they should have backup plans, and I see savings/investing as just that. Without a backup, there's a good chance Average Joe ends up being a vagrant after overinvesting in a business.

A lot of people are looking for safe plans, and I don't blame them for that. Even in a thread where OP is talking about venture capital, trading software, and the like, we still have wide array of suggestions ranging from going to China, to running off to Alberta, Canada to the tar sands. It depends on people's own risk tolerance and idea of ""big money"". For some people, a six digit salary (just barely 100k) is enough."

DPaluche,mathrock,1390286560.0,"I guess I'm just so impressed with Pete's writing that none of that really bothers me. (According to my iTunes Library, my Invalids play count is over 1,700) I had no idea that Invalids didn't have a real drummer for quite a while. His melodies and rhythms can be quite hectic, but at the same time, they aren't arbitrary. There's a lot of careful planning that went into the writing of Eunoia (I imagine). One of the main reasons I like math rock is that you can't always just bob your head along to the music the way you can with music written in 4/4. You have to put some effort in and get a feel for the song before you can really groove to it. But when you do figure out how all the rhythmic structures fit together, it feels really rewarding. It tickles me and makes me smile like an idiot. I can't help but drum my fingers on the table, my lap—anything—while I'm listening to Invalids or anything else with a funky arrangement of time signatures. And the stuff on Eunoia took me longer to ""figure out"" (I'm still trying to figure out some of the rhythms. School Social... WTF) but Pete's music has been—at least for me—the most rewarding to figure out. 

Edit: I should also add that I've approached Pete's music both from the perspective of a listener and a musician. Pete wrote Eunoia using this tablature software called Tabit, and he posted the tabs online, so I was able to download them, load them into Tabit, slow the music way down, or play each track individually if I wanted to, which made it easier to digest, I suppose. It certainly made it easier to learn how to play."

Writing is an art.  By careful selection of words and phrasing, one can imitate the affects of a wide range of personality types, educational backgrounds, and emotional states.  One can speak in the tone I am using now, as a teacher or mentor, through the use of formal modes and complex clauses. 

Or, quick as a flash, I could drop into a more colloquial and informal style, and just talk right at you like we're the best of friends and always have been.  How you doing, buddy?  You enjoying this digression?

Alternatively, I could use the rhetorical device of bdelygmia, which might lead you to think I was angry and outraged, and that I held you in great contempt.  I would look something like...you stupid, ignorant, half-witted, uneducated, plebeian [motherfucker](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell).  

That you are so fucking obtuse that you couldn't grasp that I was using acting as a fucking metaphor for flavorful writing can only be evidence that you are the spawn of mental deficients; probably bred as the result of two defectives escaping their pens and rutting in a hallway, turned over to the uncaring state and raised without love or nurturance, to become a drooling half-wit yourself.

Takuya-san,programming,1390286766.0,"I agree with your comment, but it's worth noting that AMD *does* invest in some tech - that is, direct performance-related features like memory bandwidth, video ram (better multi-monitors if you care for it), and GPU compute performance (with Nvidia is following up in, but AMD has a big head start on Nvidia there).

GPU computing will likely make PhysX much less relevant in the near future, which will give AMD a big advantage assuming they can survive the ""war"" financially til then.

If I had unlimited money, I'd definitely pick an Nvidia card nearly every time at the current stage, but I don't think AMD's future is as bleak as you make out - indeed, if the stars align in the right way soon, AMD may be winning on most fronts in terms of video cards."

Use a couple TDEE calculators (see the sidebar) to estimate how many calories your body uses in a day (including exercise). Add 500 to that, that's how much you should be eating. Smartphone apps like Myfitnesspal make it easier to count calories."

Blaming that on capitalism is not correct either. There is absolutely nothing free-market about what they're doing.

Vietnam is definitely not ultra-capitalist. If it was it would be easy to start a business. In the World Bank's [Ease of Doing Business Index](http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings) it ranks 109th in the Ease of starting a business category. It does not do well overall either. 

Its a bureaucratic single party system that does some non-technical manufacturing.

You want to be proposed to, as does he. If *either* of you does it to the other (singly) then someone is going to be left out and hurt.

The issue here shouldn't be who asks who, but whether you both want to spend the rest of your life together. If you do, who asks who a question shouldn't be a problem.

Just because he has never mentioned this before does *not* mean that his feelings are any less valid than yours - and your post makes it sound as if you feel that you are entitled to being proposed to because you're the woman and you've ""wanted"" it for longer.

You don't know that you've wanted it for longer, you are absolutely assuming. 

He may just now be mentioning this because the discussion became serious (whereas maybe your previous mentions of wanting to get married were lighthearted and just touching on the subject).

You are acting entitled and that's not a great start to a marriage.

If you truly both love each other and want this, discuss a mutual proposal. Who the hell cares if it's ""traditional""? 

If a love is real, it makes it's own traditions.

Run around like crazy until school started at 8:30. Usually zero breaks until 3:30. That includes no bathroom and usually eating while standing making copies. Work at the school until 7pm. Go home (using travel time to grade), eat. Cry. Lesson plan until one or two am. Sometime you pass out by midnight.

Many of the issues were a result of the alcoholic, and as such we were not receptive of AA members in our groups. 

We were not dismissive of AA, or AA members.  We actively encouraged and supported AA members desire to gain, and maintain sobriety.  They themselves may have even had an alcoholic parent.

Really, growing outside is a lot like indoor. General difference depending on your climate will be denser flowers, faster growing plants, decreased risk of *harmful* pests, increased risk of molds.

**Really what you need to know is:**

Outdoor starts around May (late spring) depending on your climate.

Essentially you want to sprout the plant about 2 weeks before putting them outside. You want to put them outside when night lows are approaching ~38* F as you want to avoid any chance of frost.

First start by introducing the plant outside for hours at a time for about 3 days before leaving it out 24/7. Direct sunlight, especially in temperate or hot areas can damage/bleach the delicate foliage without being conditioned first.

You want to watch &amp; protect for rain &amp; condensation particularly between mid-late flower.

Optimal positioning will be a space that has the most exposure East &amp; West, that will face the tilt of the sun (especially in the fall)."

xMissElphiex,HIMYM,1390288112.0,"I'm neutral in the fact I don't like the way either of them are handling it but I think if I had to pick a side it's probably Team Lily.   

I think it was wrong for Marshall to attempt to keep the fight from happening by using sex. I think Marshall is wrong for making such a big decision without even so much as calling his wife. I think it is wrong of him to bring up something that happened almost a decade ago, to me that threw a wrench into the character of Marshall. They had their time apart and they were both unhappy, when he took her back that fight was done. He dredged stuff up for the express purpose of hurting her.  

All this being said, while Lily also isn't handling this situation particularly well, I think it's a bit weak defending Marshall by saying she's been the more selfish one throughout the relationship. Yes, she has done the majority of the, isolated, ""selfish acts"" but Marshall has also been consistently selfish through the series, just in much less obvious ways.  

Lily has sacrificed a lot, through the series, in order to keep Marshall happy. Sure she had a few breaks, but generally speaking she has been supportive. She didn't push him into taking the corporate job, Marshall found out that she had the debt and took it *upon himself* to help her pay it back. Running off to San Francisco was an awful, awful thing to do to him, I fully agree with this statement but I can't hold it against her because she had been with the same person for 9+ years and put her big dream on the back burner so that Marshall could become the lawyer and has never doubted his ability to be a lawyer. Marshall, on the other hand, has blatantly told Lily that she would never become a great artist and that had to give up *her* belongings in order to pay for the floors in an apartment *he* pushed them to buy (see S3, E19). Now that she has a chance to make a name for herself in the art world Marshall is getting pissy because she's not there in the way he's used to her being. 

Honestly, they're both being awful but I really kinda side with Lily. "

sorator,Ingress,1390288255.0,"Remember that you can overlap friendly fields, too!

And you can keep layering them for as long as you have portals/resonators/XM to work with... so you can make it really difficult for them to clear the area.

I do *think* though that you need to make the big outer field first and then the inner small fields, and not the other way around, if you want them to layer and overlap. I'm not sure, but it *looked* like it when I was playing with this; the small field I completed before making the big field was a lighter shade of blue than the other small fields that I completed *after* the big one."

ThePinkPanther2,AskWomen,1390288281.0,"Sometimes I question why I feel like they're *creepy*, or why I feel creeped out, because maybe it's just me over thinking the situation. Maybe they are simply nice people who have social anxiety. I don't know. 

Yet I trust my intuition and gut instincts. When I feel creeped out by someone, there's something I don't trust about them. That's exactly my meaning. I may not know *why* exactly but there's something *off*.. a complex combination of minute mannerisms, physical boundaries being crossed, and micro-expressions. Maybe an unsettling look in their eye, a smile that isn't genuine or holds an ulterior meaning. There could be a number of different reasons. All I need to do is keep myself at attention around them and to not let my guard down.  

Recently, I met this one guy who creeped me out. He was average looking, polite, talkative and confident to some extent but a tad socially awkward, and he never came into physical contact with me. At the time, I thought to myself, ""I genuinely would feel scared to be alone with this guy."" A few days later and I was still wracking my brain trying to make sense of it. 

The intensity in feeling definitely made an impression on me because it's not something that normally occurs - the first time actually on that level. My intuition tells me to never leave an open drink in his presence. To not find myself alone with him in a dark corridor because something *not good* could happen.  

It's a rape-y feeling and I don't know precisely why I feel that way. I hate that I feel and think this about someone I've only met on one occasion. A relatively normal, awkward guy who happens to have lots of friends and a great career ahead of him. He's not some shady character we can all identify or be aware of, this guy is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

Thom0,gaming,1390288464.0,"I haven't played Heavy Rain in a while so I can't really remember the entire plot, I do remember it being the most consistent and stable plot out of the 3.

It's more so to do with David Cage being a terrible writer than anything, its difficult to have plot holes when you have something like Aiden in your game or some how developing magically superhuman powers on the spot. Aiden was the biggest dues ex machine I've ever seen, he was the laziest plot device I've ever seen someone  have the balls to use. Aiden could do what ever was necessary for the plot, anything at all and he would someone do it. Cage avoided what should have been massive plot holes and areas where he had written himself into a corner by using Aiden to pull some shit of or to magically have an ability that solved the problem. No matter what it was that he did it is never explained or even hinted at before, he just fucking does it and thats that. It's awful writing, its worse than most of the stuff you see churned out of Hollywood for the summer. The whole train sequence was horse shit, it started of normal and then fucking lost it once she used the car to distract the police men. Somehow Aiden could magically and safely get her off of a moving train when she had literally no other way out, the same for when she needed to get past the blockade. It was so lazy, really bad story telling and the story is kind of Cage's niche. How come Aiden's range appears to shift and change almost at random? How come he's invisible while the others aren't? How come he can do anything while the others are more limited? The answer to everything is because the plot demands it, Cage fixes his shitty writing by using cheap plot devices.

Don't even get me started on Fahrenheit, the plot for that game was almost non existent and was absolutely not consistent. Beyond Two Souls had Fahrenheit moment's as well, there were times when the plot jumped to the left and you were questioning what the fuck is going on. Remember the party scene? They suddenly went all Salem Witch Trials on her, I thought it was a dream sequence because it came out of no where. 

The Arabian documents mission was shitty, how come in that mission Aiden can go to the other side of the building yet for the rest of the game he can't go that far again? The emergence of the double agent was weird, I couldn't tell based on Jodie's reaction whether or not this was part of the mission. 

There's so much that falls apart if you look at it and I don't have time to list it all out., just so much. The plot was a mess being held together by the world's most convenient ghost.

most_of_the_time,needadvice,1390288534.0,"I think it is interesting that in typing out your life story you spent so much time talking about how smart and what an achiever you were as a child, and about your failure in college.

It seems that your identity was Smart Achiever, and now that you have shed that you are a little lost.

The good news is that everyone your age is a little lost, and you are ahead of the game in that you have already realized you are not perfect and invisible and that achievement can be empty, a lesson a lot of Smart Acheivers don't learn until 30 or 40. 

There is no shame in wanting a marriage and a family as your primary goal. But unlike a lot of goals, that goal is best pursued indirectly. To pursue that goal, the best thing you can do is to first become comfortable with yourself. Find new things you like about yourself other than your intelligence. Cultivate new hobbies. Journal to learn about yourself.  Becoming comfortable with your identity is a lifelong process, but it can easily take five years to be comfortable enough that you are ready for marriage.

Once you are there, you will be a person with many fine qualities you can name and hobbies you are passionate about. You can then find someone compatible with those traits and passions. 

Of course like most goals in life worth pursuing, a happy marriage isn't guaranteed. That is what keeps things interesting. It's about the journey. You aren't supposed to do anything with your life, you are just supposed to live it.

mauispartan,reddevils,1390288714.0,"Frankly, I am a fan of Mata.  I think he is great going forward, playing behind the striker.  But he and Rooney basically play the same position, except Rooney is far more ""Scholes-esque"" meaning that he drops back in the center, and doesnt mind getting dirty doing it.  Now, I figure a player like Cabaye, who I am also a HUGE fan of, would give us a little more stability in the central areas of the pitch.  Him and Carrick?  Yes please...

Again, being completely honest, I am hoping for the signing of a solid winger.  I think we made a huge mistake in not completely pursuing Lucas Moura.  That kid is going places.  Not only would he fit completely into our style of wing play, but hey, nothing like a player who can actually show some flair.  Hell, I think even a bid for Lavezzi would not necessarily be a bad thing.

&gt; I have a bad feeling about this ""transition phase"" that Moyes thinks he is in. I support Moyes, and think he needs more time and funding to implement his style. My real judgement of him come in the summer transfer window and also where we are in the table by January 2015. I can understand why people would want to give him AT LEAST 2 years, but I am less patient. I think his approach to the summer transfer window will be key to me. I want to see him act viciously, and ferociously... just merciless. The second the window opens he needs to be putting bids in. Not ""looking for the right player"", but buying, actually making something happen! The season and holiday months before the window opens is where you look for players and negotiate where possible. Once the window opens we need to nail down our targets with acceptable bids, no embarrassment please. Now moving on to our targets... well what am I going to say... Robbie Savage was a bit intense and over the top by saying we need a 12 man overhaul. But we are going to need at least 3 players... and at least another 2 for the following season.

I completely agree.  Gary Neville's analysis of the whole transfer saga with Moyes is correct.  We do NOT need a complete squad (~12) player overhaul, just 2 or 3 high quality players.  The kind of players that lift the energy level of those around them.

Overall, Im not holding out on Moyes purchasing any players during this winter period.  But, I do expect him to knock down doors as soon as the summer window opens.  It seems that he knows he has to move quickly once the doors open, as he has apparently started the scouting in the last few weeks."

Jersey, linen, brushed cotton fabric types are great for layering in warmer weather. They breathe well and you'll be able to maintain the lovely inspired looks I saw on your pinterest page.

He's not quite as good so far as he was at Real Madrid but he's still performing really well considering it's his first season. This pick is also not based on just his performances at Arsenal. As I said this is based off of yearly performances and for the first half of 2013 he was Real Madrid player and at Real Madrid he was probably the second best player on the team. I'm not just posting this because he's an Arsenal player now, his stats really do show that hes the best chance creating midfielder in the world.

*Edit: added the point that in the first half of the year he was playing at Madrid and performed really well to the point where many considered him the second best player on the team after Ronaldo."

TofuRobber,makeyourchoice,1390289180.0,"This is all hypothetical and mental jousting so let's have fun. Or you can also just ignore this because I'm just doing it to waste some time.

IR goggles can still be fought against. At best you are only physically dangerous with your eye beam and you can't exactly do that while wearing your goggles. Let's say you are up against three armed normals. If it were at night you'd win easily since you can hide in the shadows. If it were during the day then it'll be a bit harder. I'd say that the eye beam itself needs about a one second concentrated blast to pierce through a person, so no instakill cause that'd be cheap. 

If you attacked first, one would die but the other two would easily be alarmed and take cover. You can still blast through their cover but you can miss and they can move. They'd be able to locate the direction of your beam but not your exact location. If they are armed they can fire in your direction and you'd still die easily if hit so you'd still need to take cover/wear armor. Because you cannot stay invisible and use your eye beam they should be able to see you as you attack and they can still easily dodge take cover and attack back. if you don't have any movement augments then you can only move as fast as a normal person. Eventually you'd win but it wouldn't exactly be easy. 

They could easily take hostages if you tried to stay hidden. They could have explosives like grenades. If they found out that you become invisible in shadows then they could easily aim directly at those places. If it's bright out then you'd be forced to show yourself if you wanted to move from shadow to shadow and if they see you they can anticipate where you will end up and attack there. 

If they tried to run and ended up in dark place where you can utilize your IR goggles it still won't be easy. They can simple aim at the entrance and attack when you entered. If they didn't and hid in the darkness you have the advantage and would probably win. If they also had IR goggles then you are at a disadvantage because you'd have to take off your goggles before attacking or destroy it by attacking. If they're using firearm then they can simple shoot you with the goggles on. If they didn't have goggles and you were using them they could have a flash grenade. If it catches you off guard then your sight would be useless for a while leaving you offense and defenseless. If they didn't do any of that and they're good, they'd listen to your movement and would be able to pinpoint your location with that. They could still hide and you wouldn't be able to see them even with the IR goggles.

Overall I'd say that you are only at your best at night against few people, no more than 10. Anymore and it's no longer certain you'd win. Offensively, covert missions and the like are your forte. In a situation during the day or in a place with limited shadows you are extremely disadvantaged, even against normal people. You have poor direct combat stats but your covert ability is top notch. Once you're caught though it's gets a whole lot harder. This doesn't take into consideration your mental abilities and I don't know how well you would be able to use that in combat.

Orelle,infj,1390289271.0,"I'm just going to say it. I'm kind of a horrible girlfriend, technically. I don't really get smothered because the moment I begin to feel overwhelm I dial back the relationship. I'm amazed I'm in a relationship. I don't know how it happened. The only way to snag me is to respectfully semi-stalk me, because even if I initiate the flirtation (as I am wont to do), I get distracted and disappear. I've charted a course running in circles around other people's worlds, and the only way someone can really get to know me is to climb in my sidecar and come along for the ride. 

It's not fair, but it solves the compatibility issue for me. I'm spread thin, I'm warm and friendly with everyone, I'm emotive, my idea of 'fun' probably isn't normal, I don't always make the safest choices, nor do I always make consistent choices, and if they survive all that — seeing what they're getting into — without bailing, becoming jealous or compelling me to ditch them, *then* I check out their route and make them part of my orbit. *Then* I become my loyal, harmonizing, meet-you-halfway-and-a-half self. 

Upon reaching that milestone, I'm impressed and pretty affectionate for a spell. But then life calls, and I cool off. I require patience and good humor. I hit my stride after *years* with someone, not months. I don't have to have a companion (I tend to achieve more personally without one), but — having someone who really 'gets' me, is trustworthy and enriches my life — I prefer it. I've known my boyfriend for so long, I feel time spent together 'counts' as my alone time now. And if one of us doesn't feel like holding hands (not my favorite thing) or something, we just let go, no words involved usually. We're not demanding. He understands my needs and isn't threatened by them.

I work with pressure seals and I'm skeptical of that claim.

ixAp0c,skateboarding,1390289898.0,"Find a simple spot to re-learn the basics, preferably one close by that you can skate to.  

A parking lot that isn't used much is a good choice, if you go to a spot regularly even alone you will get used to skating there more and find new ways to skate the same spot...

Some simple curb manual pads and curbs to ollie off can be easy to find in parking lots usually if theres buildings in them.  Sometimes ledges too, or different gaps, just have to get creative with what you have.

I only skate with 1 friend and it's fun, my little cousin is starting this year and he is going to skate with us when he can, but that's already 1 more person...  I guess the longer you skate the more people you will find that want to skate / to skate with...  

But skating alone has its benefits, you don't have to wait for someone to get their turn on whatever your skating, you get tired and decide when you want to leave (sometimes friends get tired before me when I am just getting into a session and want to skate for another hour or so but I have to cut it short because they are tired), simple reasons like that.


But it's good to have a group if your skating properties with higher security etc., or sketchy areas where people might harass you all alone, safety in numbers kind of thing.  

But yeah man you can do a lot with a nice curb if you wax it up to get back into it.  

I wouldn't recommend going to try any insane shit until you are comfortable being back on the board again. "
FollowerofLoki,polyamory,1390289902.0,"To be perfectly honest, I think a lot of couples get into polyamory not realizing that adding more people can make an already rocky relationship worse. It's kind of a joke within the more experienced parts of the community, even. ""Having relationship problems? Add more people!"" 

There are also a lot of people who don't realize that there are a lot of assumptions within a monogamous relationship that just doesn't work in a polyamorous one. Communication *has* to be stronger, because otherwise people get left out, feelings are hurt, things get blown out of control. 

So, I mean...you could just as easily turn it around and ask how many monogamous relationships do you know that have failed as a direct result of monogamy. It's not the relationship model that's the problem, it's that some people don't go into it with full knowledge, full honesty, or any amount of preparation. "
tylerpoppe,aww,1390289903.0,"Nope that's not true. It was a rumor that has been dunked. Here is an excerpt from the manual: 

&gt;Exige Hardtop Roof:
The Lotus Exige has been conceived and configured as a sports coupé with a removable roof. The aerodynamic performance of the bodyshell including the front spoiler, rear aerofoil, roof panel and tailgate have been tuned to provide the optimum handling balance with the roof panel also contributing to the flow of cooling air into the top of the engine bay.
The roof panel may be removed for better access to the interior for servicing, and the car may be driven without the roof fitted, but wind buffeting and increased noise levels will be experienced. In order to avoid discomfort, and so as not to compromise engine cooling efficiency, it is recommended to restrict usage in this configuration to lower vehicle speeds.


Some have done the soft top conversion which is where the issue comes in because you really need to do a little drilling to make it a proper [soft top conversion](http://www.lotustalk.com/forums/f157/how-install-soft-top-exige-27090/).

But Japan probably should encourage immigration. It has a very old population that will die off drastically within the next two decades and its population will start to actually shrink unless it allows heavy immigration and tries to assimilate them so a white man from America and a black man from Kenya could both learn to be **Japanese**.

(more realistically, people from other Asian countries)

In general the only countries that are very successful at assimilation like this are USA and Canada. Next best are wealthy European countries like UK, France, Netherlands, Germany.

It's said Japan is a very racist culture and even second generation Korean immigrants aren't considered truly Japanese. This will have to change.

EDIT: heh have you seen this? Apparently ANA got in trouble for putting a long nose on a Japanese man pretending to be American

Life-in-Death,bestof,1390290120.0,"It is not ""get in trouble"" for being late, you can't be late.  

There are 34 kids that need to be in a classroom at 8:32 am.  They are not legally allowed to be in there without an certified teacher (and the classroom is locked).  They can't be in the hallway unsupervised.  Administration and the deans will have to figure out what is happening ""Why are all the kids here?  What class is this? Is Ms. X in the building?"" Then they must find a place to escort 34 kids, or get the key to let them into the class, find a certified teacher who is not currently teaching (but who is probably desperately trying to prep for her first class) to get them to watch the students.  All this is happening in the beginning of the school day when admin and deans need to be dealing with late students, etc.

It is an entirely different type of job.  (You need to pee?  Sorry.  You can't leave your classroom.)  But more so the work day *begins* once we get home.  Everything in the classroom from 8-4 has to be planned, created, formatted, printed, copied, stapled, labs prepped, equipment ready, classroom set up and cleaned, chemicals mixed, supplies purchased, powerpoint created, papers graded, grades recorded, tests created (at minimum 3 versions of each!). BEFORE your day starts.  That happens from like 5 pm-7am.

I'm saying that because both are independently issues of gender equality opposing either **or both** is to oppose gender equality. Which is a different thing from saying it's gender inequality to oppose one but not the other.

As for everything else, reasonable people can believe that equality isn't always the right thing. On say the subject of class most reasonable people these days don't believe in strict equality. But having a reason to believe that an unequality is the best way does not mean it's no longer unequal.

I don't think someone is necessarily sexist if they support some manner of gender equality as long as they are consistent in when they consider other concerns more important.

Yes, what bio entails is straight forwards.  When I had to teach intro environmental science or epidemiology there aren't curriculum for those.  When I taught chemistry the first time I had to reteach myself half the concepts.  (I had never learned nuclear chemistry before.)

TheMarkHasBeenMade,FinalFantasy,1390290826.0,"The old style really puts the ""fantasy"" in the name for me. The magic, sword fighting, airships, and castles seem most at home in a more medieval setting, and there's a lot that can be done with sticking to a traditional old-world system. 

FFIX was a fantastic display of this. Charming old cities paired with characters whose fighting capabilities were limited by their specialties give more of an iconic feel to it all. Each character's personality reflected his or her fighting abilities, it played strongly into shaping who they were. And each battle class was represented, so you could utilize whatever strategy you wanted while gaining unique quirks in the plotline depending on who was in your party (and party of four is totally the way to go, I think). 

Its being an open world to explore and discover, shrouded in mist and full of moutains, oceans and forests, sets the tone for adventure that isn't limited to where the plotline is at the moment, and allows you to feel like you're really trekking from place to place. You get a feel of what you're going into with each location. 

All that being said, FFVII is easily my favorite of the series, partially because of the modern twist and the message it sends. I think Squenix has forever been running with the ""modern future"" idea as part of a new game's marketability, though, as it was a staple of one of their most popular titles and it ""fits"" more of the modern gamer's genres. And they've beaten both the setting and the cast of characters to a pulp by just transferring character archetypes from game to game. FF these days is bland and overhyped, and I think the company could do wonders if it stopped trying so hard to make a futuristic game full of swords and magic and expected a bit more of its characters as people and components of the story as a whole.

Illivah,Ubuntu,1390291441.0,"I have met many people of all sorts of different levels of education. I have met several people who took no interest in anything I found interesting. But I have yet to meet someone that doesn't want to learn. They may not be actively trying to learn anything, but they still enjoy the feeling.

I can also say that teachers are by and large more interesting and motivated than the general population. That's not a major block to their teaching until long after they've become dissillusioned. That happens far more than it should.

Involved parents do help a lot - kids will care a LOT more when their parents are involved with their education. And kids that don't care at all are almost always lacking parental support. Culture is a major thing as well, IE what the non-parents push for. Even a handful of local businesses or professionals volunteering to teach kids for a day would be huge if it were done even once a year. Once a month would be even better. 

Growing a desire to solve problems is definitely a biggy though. Don't learn XYZ piece of science just because it's useful, learn it because it's hard, and learn it in preference to other things because it's also true (while, say, astrology can be hard and completely useless). Learn math for it's elegance and for the great triumph of understanding after working in frustration for an hour or more. Learn to play the violin because it's not only beautiful, but to practice something so complicated brings satisfaction to your mind.

The only time I seem to have real problems is when I'm invited to someone's home as a guest.  Many (especially older) Germans don't realize what vegetarianism is, it seems, and will often offer chicken or fish.  Or prepare food with meat stock or even bits of bacon and ham.  I've compromised my eating standards a few times here, but only out of politeness because someone's mom plopped a Wurst or ""Steak"" on my plate.

My reason for not eating meat has always been because of the way meat is produced (hormones, questionable feed) in the US.  Germany is more careful about these things and in fact won't import a lot of US agricultural products for that reason.  So I usually remind myself of that when ""forced"" to eat meat here in Deutschland."

katiebug0313,AskReddit,1390291677.0,"My mother in law divorced her husband of 18 years. She divorced him because they would fight a lot about money, lack of sex, and also because he had sleep apnea, he slept ALL the time (and wouldn't get treatment for it). After she divorced him, he was crushed. They had 4 kids together (my husband being one of them), and because of it, the kids had to split up. 2 with mom, and 2 with dad. At the time, my husband was 12, and for two years, him and his sister would try to match him up with friends' moms, but he was never interested in anyone. He only wanted his ex. 2 years after they divorced, he died in a car accident. 

With his death being so sudden, it (of course) shook up the entire family, and even MORE so with my mother in law. 

She ended up marrying a douche bag that didn't respect her or her kids at all. He cheated, lied, and cost her hundreds of thousands of dollars.

There's been times she's admitted that she battled with feelings of guilt after their divorce, even while he was alive. And even more so when he passed away. She's even said if he was alive today, she would go back with  him.

Life-in-Death,vegan,1390291827.0,"&gt; Paleo trumps vegan diets because people go through a bit of education before they start. They don't when they become vegan.

That is quite a sweeping statement...and odd considering how many people come to the vegan board everyday in their research in wanting to become vegan.  

&gt;If we had an enigmatic leader like mark sisson or rob wolf for veganism,

That is why I can pretty much ensure that veganism is legit because no one is getting rich off of it.  One or two ""know everythings"" is dangerous and cult like.  I rather have a community that is constantly bringing in new research that isn't afraid of upsetting a dogma of a charismatic leader.  That is like saying you wished ""science"" had one or two people that just declared what it right.  That will never be the best method for truth, that's a cult.

&gt;The key to paleo is to eat more veggies and less desserts

That sounds a lot like veganism to me.  Except I know quite a few paleos and all I ever see are eggs and chicken wings.  

&gt;There's blogs dedicated to former vegans who switched to paleo and became healthy

Yes, and there are blogs of people who became healthy through the veganism.  But more importantly, there is actual science and research behind the veggie end.

&gt;Going from the SAD diet to vegan isn't an improvement if all you do is still eat very little veggies and a lot of processed food

Of course not, and going from SAD to a diet of all bacon-wrapped lard isn't going to improve it either.

The real point you left out is that a healthy vegan diet is healthier than a paleo diet."

In cases of emergency, the driver will use his punch to hammer out the letter E on the transfer, and randomly put additional holes in the piece of paper. This turns the transfer from a regular piece of paper into a MAGIC TRANSFER, and allows the holder ofthe MT unlimited travel on the TTC until the end of the TTC business day at 5:30am. Why would one be issued? Well, let's say you lost you're wallet while on the bus. I'd give you an MT to allow you to backtrack your steps. Each driver receives their punch on their first day of employment. It has a unique shape so that a punched transfer can be traced back to the driver. Yes, the TTC does think like that.

First of all, I love that you are so open with your feelings with me. But what you said the other day hurt my feelings. Although I completely understand you have that evil thing called testosterone that makes you want to fuck anything that walks by, it still doesn't change that fact that it bothered me what you said.

Switched off is where you started.  You really don't to understand what being a member of this forum says about you as a person, and why someone wouldn't even *bother* to try and change your mind, do you?

The only kind of people who find a forum like this amusing for more than a second or two are ideologues who desperately need other people to confirm their worldview in order to inflate their own fragile egos by confirming, without any challenge, that they are somehow superior to the people they are mocking.

That kind of person isn't the kind of person who can be swayed by reason.  You people are here because you're self-righteous boobs and sanctimonious sheep who only feel safe when baaing together.

Why would I waste my time trying to convince you of anything?  People like you won't even acknowledge the sky is blue if such facts threaten to crack open the edifice of your ideology.  It's a pointless waste of time.

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1390292848.0,"&gt; By February everyone knew the Lakers were going to be a low seed nonfactor but the A Block was reserved for them more often than not

Could have sworn the Lakers early-April were the team no one wanted to face... until Kobe got injured.

EDIT: Yikes the Laker hatred is high over here. Just as an FYI to /r/nba, ESPN was talking about a dysfunctional 7 seed because they were something like 24-10 in their last 34 games before Kobe got injured. Even though they won a few games at the end of the season without Kobe, obviously they had no shot at beating the Spurs with Kobe injured. But the Lakers getting unceremoniously swept out of the first round is not grounds for the Lakers not being a threat with a healthy Kobe. "
i_lick_telephones,AskWomen,1390292854.0,"The article said the models are still ""incredibly thin and impossibly beautiful"". Well, if the photos are really untouched, they aren't really impossibly beautiful.

My 2 cents? Mixed feelings. On one hand, cool, making progress for body acceptance. I like the non photoshop and the tattoos coming through. But I still have some issues. On one hand, I don't like how they are really making a campaign out of it. Maybe I just prefer subtlety, but I'd prefer if they just did it without making big mention out of it. But, in their defense, I realize they're attempting to make a big deal out of so as to make their efforts clear for other companies to follow suit.

Additionally, I am not a huge fan of the whole ""go natural"" thing. I am when it comes to photoshop which literally cannot be achieved without the aid of computer technology, but I think the models should still wear a full face of makeup if they so choose. Makeup is natural too. Just because you're not born in it, doesn't make it unnatural. And it's achievable by any one in the world, unlike photoshop which you can't do in real life. I would like to see a few of the models wearing makeup to show that there's nothing wrong with wearing makeup, if you want to.

Lastly, the article is right. The girls are generally thin still. But I realize they are still advertising a product, not just making a statement. And the bodies I see in there do look realistic to myself and most other women's bodies I see. I highly doubt they're going to bring a fat woman in to advertise their lingerie. And while I know why they don't, it still comes across as slightly limiting. I know not every body type ever can be represented, but perhaps even putting in a chubby or slightly overweight woman might be refreshing."

mundabit,birthcontrol,1390293007.0,"Nordette (30 µg ethinyl estradiol, 150 µg levonorgestrel) I have tried Yaz, Lutera, Loestrin and Diane. Nordette was the only one that took control of my periods.

I started trailing BC when I was 10 years old after getting my first period at 9 and not having it stop. I tried all those above brands and gave them a good 6 months each, I started Nordete soon after my 12th birthday and within a week my period stopped.

Because I was no longer bleeding daily my health improved dramatically. I was no longer anemic, I was no longer in daily pain, I no longer had daily PMS. I no longer had to worry about daily seizures, black outs, vomiting or migraines. I still had most of these issue during placebo week, and I never was able to skip a period without BTB, but It was amazing.

As a teenager I never had issues with acne, I grew to a 36G cup and I actually did lose my 'puppy fat'

But mum developed DVT and PE when I was 19, so soon after they took me off oestrogen-based BC and i was told that as long as I live in Australia and the law stays the same, I can never have oestrogen again.

Soon after that my breasts shrank, I developed cystic acne and I grew a beard. My period returned to being almost non stop (7:12 compared to 21:7) and I started having seizures again, I was vomoting 3-5 daily, I struggled to keep food down, but I managed to gain 20lbs. I started having problem using the toilet, the cramps in my abdomen were so intense it was just unbearable to open my system, It became incredibly painful to sit down or to walk. PMS came back too, achy breasts, migraines, depression you name it.

I was throwing up my POP and it was useless. I got a mirena put in about 3 months after all this started, and within 27 days I had expelled it. I finally got Implanon put in mid last year. Bleeding still hasn't stopped but my vomiting has reduced to one per day, I haven't has a seizure in a few weeks now which is good too, But I still really struggle with pain. I started getting breast discharge this week, my GP says Implanon is to blame, I think that's bull and I'm getting a  second opinion, But take from that what you will.

Coming off the BC and going through this has made my GYN realise that endometriosis is a likely concern (I pressured GYN's to look since I was 9, I have a family history and the symptoms were always there) so hopefully I can get some help soon, even if it wont involve going back on my beloved nordette."

mkvgtired,news,1390293032.0,"I just think it needs to be noted that the way the single party in Vietnam runs the country is far from capitalist. Leaders engage in international trade, so one of the facets of capitalism is there, but even so I would not equate what they're doing to capitalism. They are utilizing a part of capitalism, not the entire package. 

It would be the same thing to call Hugo Chavez or Robert Mugabe capitalists. Sure they engage in international trade, but you have to boil down the definition of capitalism pretty far to say all of these people are capitalists. 

&gt;Capitalism isn't ""supposed"" to be great at feeding a few greedy people, but that's what happens in real life.

All Western nations, however, do much more closely adhere to the tenets of free market capitalism, and they typically have the highest standards of living in the world for the middle class. 

&gt;What I dislike is when people pretend the guys running an authoritarian state aren't capitalists, because it doesn't fit their ideals, even though these guys are doing capitalist business on a global scale. And I also dislike it when people resort to fallacies and false assumptions when their take on a subject is put into question.

Again, engaging in international trade isnt the definition of capitalist. Protectionist policies, similar to the one's we're discussing are *exactly* what Adam Smith saw as the problem with the trade systems at the time. He also saw monopolies like the Dutch East India Company as in impediment to free trade. Keeping with the theme, the need to go through the Communist Party of Vietnam to do business there would be a similar impediment he would be against. He also stressed the importance of a meritocracy, which automatically does not give preference to a person based on political party affiliation. 

Every country has some degree of trade. North Korea trades with other countries, but its economy is not capitalist. Its leaders indulge in Western produced products, but simply purchasing something does not make someone a capitalist on the whole.

I dislike when people invent their own definition of a concept and expect everyone else to adhere to it. "

hurston,DebateAnAtheist,1390293184.0,"This! The history of it all is the really interesting stuff and shows why Christianity is what it is today. Let's take this a bit further back.

To start with, Yahweh was one of many canaanite gods. Some of the (Jewish) tribes in the area of Israel started to favour Yahweh over the other gods. There were conflicts in particular with followers of Baal over this, but eventually Yahweh went through being head of the Pantheon, replacing El, to being the only god.

There are two reasons why this particular tribal god became popular today. Monotheism was an unusual concept at the time, and it is this that is the first driving force behind the popularity of Christianity today. The idea that there was only one true god was at odds with the idea that this god was a tribal god, as there were many other peoples in the world, so Yahweh became a god for the entire world under Christianity. The idea that people should be converted to the one true religion developed as part of this, and is the second driving force behind the popularity of Christianity. Polytheism lacks this. The linchpin for world dominion was making Christianity the official (and only) religion of the Roman empire. This in turn meant that the French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and British empires were also Christian, who spread Christianity throughout the world. Control of sex and marriage meant that you had to both be Christian in order to have children, which ensured the children were brought up as Christian.

Islam is a development from Judaism and Christianity, which changes the formula somewhat. It replaces conversion with conquest, as we can see in places like Sudan, and adds death for apostasy (in some places). The latter is particularly important, and ensures that followers are not lost, as is happening in western nations right now. Islam now has a potentially stronger future than Christianity, but is hobbled by one thing. It recognises that a western style education is a threat to it, so in many areas there is no education for women and mostly religious education for men. This makes predominantly Islamic areas economically weak (apart from the oil rich ones), which in turn weakens the religion on the world stage. It will be interesting to see how this develops in the future.

Of course none of this makes any religion more true than others. Certain beliefs, perhaps deliberately inserted, make the religion spread where others haven't, but doesn't make it right."

Boxers would be these swollen freaks with no body fat, severe depression, shrunken balls and crazy mood swings. 

Heart attacks would go up, suicide rates would go up, brain haemorrhages would go up, not to mention ring deaths from being punched by freaks of nature.

PED use is high at the moment because regulation is shit but at least there is some regulation to stop it from being ridiculous. The answer is to have stricter controls and encourage out of competition testing like the program Nonito Donaire signed up to.

Cycling was completely fucked with dopers but they spent a long time sorting it out and now it's clean again. That's what boxing needs to do. "

namrettik,fatpeoplestories,1390293646.0,"&gt;Also it is much easier to get about towns and cities by walking and cycling in comparison to the US, which is not pedestrian friendly at all.

Depends on the city.  Particular Indiana city: barely any sidewalks, constantly seeing people who couldn't afford a car/to take the bus walking in ditches, crossing 50mph roads, biking along the narrow shoulder, etc.  Particular Oregon city: Bike paths on practically every major road and many minor ones, sidewalks everywhere, great public transportation.

From my experience, it seems related to how conservative a given area is.  The more liberal, the more public transport/sidewalks/bike paths.

Moreover, the US quickly expanded, making our towns built around long-distance transportation, rather than transportation built around our towns.  I grew up having to drive 6 miles for gas and food, 15 miles for school, and 40 miles for Wal-Mart (and fast food until I was in my teens) - all because the town was founded on a railway that stopped moving people decades upon decades ago."

I'm only level 3, started today, but here's my input for what it's worth. ^(And yeah, I'm two weeks late to the party. Soaking up info cause I'm already obsessed, so I'm backtracking through the subreddit, heh.)

Especially at levels 1 and 2, unless you have three portals almost on top of each other, you're not going to have the link range to make a field with them anyway. I had two pretty close to each other but couldn't link them because range is just shit when your portals are all L1. So, you may as well drop one res for the claim bonus and then move on - unless you don't have anywhere else to put your resonators, in which case you can fill up to 8 for the added cap bonus. (I also had like four portals that I couldn't field up because of the more important crosslinks in the area, which was a bit frustrating.)

Once you hit L3, you can actually get some decent link range, especially if you have a few link boosters as well; I was able to go into one of the nearby towns and make several 1-5 MU fields and two 50-ish MU fields. (And boy was I excited about those 50s!) But I'm in a pretty rural area, and our portals are sparse and pretty spread out, so I needed to use at least two R3s in order to make any kind of link. So, there were several portals that I just claimed with an R1, because I didn't have enough R3s to link them into the network. One of the L8s in the area also pointed me in the direction of more close portals, but I wasn't able to take advantage of them because I didn't have enough resos left, and didn't have the time to drive out there.

So: If you're able to make fields, then absolutely do so, but that's not always an option, and especially in rural areas it's not *that* rare. And if you can't make a field, you're probably better off placing 1 res and moving on.

(Especially considering that it isn't 1res for 1 placement and 1 capture vs 8res for 8 placement 1 capture 1 cap and link and field - it's actually 24 res for 24 placement, 3 capture and cap, 3 link, and 1 field. If you don't have 24 res available, or don't have 3 portals that you can link, then you're better off placing 1 for the capture + placement and saving the others for when you *can* make a field.)"

 Acceptable inquiries are 'where'd you get your purple heart?' It allows someone to expand upon it if they wish or they can say Iraq and leave it at that. 

If you've got a Purple Heart it wasn't a nice experience and most likely you were not the only one injured. It's like asking, 'hey remember that time your best friend was killed in that car wreck?  yeah I want you to think about that again'.

Also, a Purple Heart is the same award they give to troops killed by the enemy so it doesn't matter if you are missing a limb or got a tiny piece of shrapnel in a non vital body part you get the same award so a lot of guys feel kinda embarrassed that they are wearing the same award you get for losing an arm. I know a guy who got one for getting a miniscule piece of shrapnel in his face that looked like a white head. He was embarrassed as fuck when people asked because he had buddies lose limbs in the same mortar attack, and contrary to popular belief you can't refuse a Purple Heart although everyone has stories about a guy who did - they are bullshit. When you get treatment a PCR is submitted and on it if it says 'wounded by enemy' the process is automatically started without your consent."

smootie,relationship_advice,1390294455.0,"Reading your post filled me with rage.  So many things have been going wrong for so long.

It was unfair of her to test you (when she decided to stay in the guest room).  You are right to take some of the blame.  You were (and are) far too passive and allowed this nonsense to go on for too long, but she is also to blame for being passive-aggressive about the situation and not talking to you about her misgivings and fears like an adult.

You are losing the most important person in your life and you're fretting about *how to approach her*?  How about just walking up to her and telling her exactly how you feel?  Stop walking on eggshells around your own relationship!  You say that you are desperate and that your relationship is worth fighting for, yet the inaction continues.  She wants some **passion** from you, not journal entries and counselor-prescribed scripts.

Stop being so passive and take ownership of your relationship.  Tell her assertively how you feel.  It doesn't need to be poetic or perfect - just honest.  If you can't get through to your wife without counseling, then you really shouldn't be married to her in the first place.  Engage her, and show her that you have opinions and desires.  Take her out for a nice dinner without checking with her about where she wants to go.  You should already know her favorite restaurants, or pick a lovely new place you've never been before.  Get her flowers or gifts for no reason, without waiting around to get her reaction.  

But the real question here is why you want to salvage this relationship.  From what you've written, she doesn't seem like a very nice person.  Do you really want to be with her, or are you afraid of having to start over?"

derleth,TiADiscussion,1390294527.0,"First off, they deny and minimize the fact men get raped, and especially the fact men get raped by women, usually due to alcohol or other drugs. This means rape ties into their general narrative of men victimizing women, women always being the recipients of male evils, and their nasty undercurrent of women always being victims, as opposed to active people with agency and an existence beyond the bad acts of men.

Second, most SJWs are first-world upper-middle-class white people. Rape is, statistically, the worst crime that could reasonably happen to them. Terrible diseases are potentially worse, but they're not usually a crime; other crimes are more common, but they're either nowhere near as bad as rape or they don't happen to SJWs. Therefore, the SJW myopia born of a lack of global perspective (notice how they apparently didn't realize the difference between Sami and Inuit peoples during the whole *Frozen* debacle) gives rape a huge importance in their eyes. Child soldiers, child abuse, genital mutilation, and honor killings all pale in importance to rape, because none of those other things happen in places where Tumblr and Reddit draw their userbases from."

You don't have to buy super early if you're in the US, flights to and from Japan stay pretty much the same price up to the week you're flying. The price fluctuations stem from busy travel times, so you picked a good time in that regard. If you have a perfect flight at a price that you like, buy it. But I don't think they're available until like a year before anyway. 

What you will want is an international no-fee credit card. I have the Bank Americard Travel Rewards Visa. I think you can set up a pin but I just sign. I took cash out of 7-Eleven atms using my normal BofA debit card. You'll be hit with fees but it's not a big deal. The bigger deal is the exchange rate, which you can't control. Japan is more cash-based but you can use credit for a lot of stuff too.

pretzelzetzel,Fitness,1390295169.0,"No, your goals are very different from those of a rower. Rowers have different goals themselves - sprinters need to be stronger and are less concerned with endurance, whereas long-distance rowers are obviously primarily concerned with endurance and generally are not overly muscular.

Your goals are primarily aesthetic. Aside from mentioning that it is impossible to accidentally get jacked, (and imploring you to read the side bar for this kind of thing), you should also know that getting 'lean' is a function of caloric intake vs. expenditure, and getting muscular is a function of training. I'm not especially knowledgeable in exercise science, so trusting the sidebar on this subreddit is a good idea for you. However, I think I know the kind of body you think you want (I'm assuming something like Brad Pitt in Fight Club, like every other teenaged boy?) and you have to know that that requires a great deal of dedication not only to weight training, but also commitment to a very strict diet. Once you've achieved the body, it's not difficult to maintain, but it can be difficult to achieve. 

If you're 77kg at 183cm, you are not going to do yourself any favours by losing more weight. If you want a ""toned"" look, you are going to have to work hard for it, which will include gaining weight. Without the aid of drugs, it's generally considered impossible to gain serious muscle without also gaining fat; that's just the way the body works. Eat big, get big, then cut the fat. Simple. Not easy, but simple.

I recommend doing Starting Strength, and doing it exactly as it is laid out. Don't give up when it seems hard. If you look at yourself in the mirror one day and say, ""Oh, gross, I've suddenly gotten unbecomingly muscular"", stop lifting. I would wager my very livelihood that this will not happen, but if it does, there could not be an easier-to-solve problem in all the world.

Looking good takes hard work. You can't simply lose fat and have muscle magically appear where the fat used to be, and have a hard body and a six-pack. You must lift. You're 16 and male. Get under the bar and do it."

There are way more credible sources citing how even if the during the gestational periods when nerves, pain sensors, and the parts of the brain that detect pain develop, that certainly does not mean pain is detectable at this early point. Pain is only detected (or ""felt"") by the fetus by at least the 24 week mark. And isn't that what's most important--whether the fetus can suffer or not?

And yeah, I'm with you. When it's the choice between the mom and the late-term fetus, it only makes sense to terminate the fetus, even if it means some suffering is going to happen. It would not be long, enduring pain, but swiftness followed by death. Maybe an anesthetic could even be administered to these fetuses in necessary late-term abortions, if pain is an issue."

Lady_of_Shalott,relationships,1390295905.0,"&gt;GF has shown improvement in some bad habits, but I don’t think she’s earned it yet. 

Started off on a bad note here before you even got to the gripes about your girlfriend. An engagement isn't something she needs to earn, it's a step of commitment you make *together*. You don't just willy nilly propose one day out of the blue when you decide she's been ""good"" enough for long enough.

But even without that, it doesn't sound like an engagement is a good idea for the foreseeable future. She doesn't trust you? Without trust, *you have no relationship*, much less a marriage. If she can't trust you to be your own person, trust you to learn from your mistakes, etc etc, you have no business being together because you'll just bring each other down.

And speaking of no business, her family has **NO BUSINESS** pushing for engagement (or kids, or anything else). They aren't the ones in the relationship. They aren't the ones who will have to go through a messy divorce if things don't work out because you were pressured into a decision you weren't ready to make/wasn't in your best interests.

You seem like you're making a good effort to make things work from what you've written here, but she sounds like she has a lot more work on herself that needs to happen before you take any serious steps toward commitment. I'm not saying you should break up with her, but you need to ask yourself if you're willing to wait and see if she can improve further, and support her through that process, or if you should cut your losses and try to find someone who doesn't stress you out so much. Because you mention stress a lot in your post, and goodness knows you probably get enough of that from school. You don't need it in your relationship, too, imo. But in the end sticking it out or not is your choice. I just definitely wouldn't get engaged yet if I were in your position."

loona_lovebad,casualiama,1390295957.0,"I would say that I'm sorry to hear that, but going through a few years of an (undiagnosed until recently) major depressive episode has really helped me put my life in perspective. Once you've reached your lowest of lows, you can reflect upon that experience; being knowledgeable of your lows helps you envision your future highs/successes. Realizing that life changes for the better if you simply become proactive about making little positive changes to daily life has helped motivate me.

Now, that all sounds fine and good - but as anyone suffering from depression knows - making even one tiny, little positive change is mentally wrought with incredibly difficulty. I have only recently, within the past two months, been motivated to make positive life changes after: first admitting to my psychiatrist that I was, indeed, depressed and that I finally desired and NEEDED help, and, second, getting put on an antidepressant (Prozac) for the first time in my life. It has helped me IMMENSELY. I wish I could say that it wasn't medication that changed me, but it was definitely the key to open the door for me. I now feel and remember the person I had loved and lost somewhere in college... indeed things get better, if you take baby steps in your journey out of depression!

I don't know, dude. I've never met her or you. That part where she ignores you most of the time is a pretty good indicator. In my experience, people who want to be friends with someone will try to talk to them with some regularity. 

""I don't want to date you but I hope we can be friends,"" is a very common soft rejection tactic used by young women who can't stand the thought of someone disliking or being mad at them. 

So, you know, from my limited information perspective, not acting like someone who is interested in your friendship + common conflict avoidance tactic seems like a pretty good bet for ""doesn't want to be friends with you."" 

Conversely, you're not acting like a friend either. Friends don't stalk people's social media and pine for even a sliver of contact. Those are the actions of a person who has not gotten over their crush.

Slothrox,darksouls,1390296161.0,"I recently completed my SL1 run for the sole purpose of invading in the burg and the parish at low level.

My build takes many different forms, usually completely dependant on who I'm up against. I usually like to judge the player before making a decision on how to treat the invasion.

If they are acting a if they have never seen an invader before (E.g. Shield raised, trying to access bonfire), I will run off ahead, switch my gear to match gear that is only available in the burg and then return to them for a fair duel. Sometimes I'll place some lovely titanite in the centre of the arena as an incentive to win. I win about 75% of these battles due to my experience, but when I lose, I know that the new player feels the same sense of achievement that we all felt when we beat our first invader.

If there are a few phantoms, I will beef up my armour and go for the kill, usually dealing with the phantoms first so that the host gets scared, then you can really draw things out and toy with them which is a lot of fun.

In the parish, if the gate to the Sunlight Alter is closed, I'll run over the bridge and open it, then find the host and lead them to the bonfire where I point down to it, bow, wave, and then black crystal out. They always look very happy when they're spinning around in circles over and over!

The funniest experience I've had is creating a little path of prism stones which lead into the small room under the first archer in the Burg, placing a Dung Pie on the balcony and waiting behind the door. Providing they don't see me doing it, new players will usually go and pick it up, and when they do, I greet them with a maxed out Fire Tempest, much to the amusement of my house mates watching. Not only do they learn not to trust anything in this game, but they get a nice insulting gift too.

Also, naked fist fighting is utterly hilarious, especially with ball-crunching parries and jump attacks off the stairs.

So to try and help you understand the appeal, for me it's giving new players an experience that will keep them interested in Dark Souls, because the bigger the community, the better the game is for all of us."

silverionmox,europe,1390296338.0,"&gt; …but that's the point. No choice has to be made, unless you make one up.

Politics is making choices:

""The cuts to the European Commission's funds for technological research in 2013 ""could be as much as 150 million,"" John Higgins, director general of the EU's biggest IT lobby Digital Europe, said. [...] According to an internal document seen by Reuters, Kroes believes that half her research budget - roughly 140 million euros - may be sacrificed to help fill a 360 million-euro funding gap for a global nuclear fusion reactor project based in France called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). [...] The overall EU share of construction costs more than doubled from 2.7 billion euros in 2001 to 7.2 billion euros in 2010.""

""In May the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, asked member states to stump up an additional €1.4 billion to tide the project over to 2013. They rejected the request and **suggested instead tapping the EU's existing research budget**. ""

So it's indeed a choice, and it's not a choice between funding ITER or funding nothing. Continuing to give priority to ITER will suck away funds from all other research areas.

&gt;As I pointed out to you in another thread, even when only taking German numbers, the entire ITER budget would only amount to an increase of renewable subsidies by 4% (800m/20bn)... 

Which is completely normal because those renewables are actually producing energy already. Running costs of fusion plants won't be zero either. Total cumulative investments in renewables are still below total investments in fusion - fusion already has been funded for decades and has always performed over budget, over time and below expectations.

The EU doesn't have a say about German funding, the whole problem is that the states don't want to increase the budget to fund the cost overruns of ITER so other things will have to be sacrificed.

Renewable energy subsidies are on the way out, anyway. The industry has been lifted over the mass production threshold. Meanwhile, the not-*really*-a-serious-accident (according to nucleophiles) at Fukushima is projected to cost 250 billion to contain. **250 billion**. And Tepco is being kept alive for the time being by an additional 64 billion in state funding."

Commod0re,funny,1390297315.0,"What exactly are you going to support the house on? You have to start digging at some point, and starting under the foundation is a bad idea for several structural reasons, and potentially at least one practical reason.

First off, if you start digging under the foundation in order to make room for supports, that leaves part of the existing foundation unsupported while the digging is going on. This would put undue stress on the structure that it was not designed to handle, and could damage that very foundation. There would also be an additional challenge in actually preparing the ground to have new additional foundation laid in between, because it has to be level and packed in well enough to support the foundation, or else the house will sink slowly into the ground as moisture turns it into dirt-jello.

Finally, some houses have their foundation laid directly on bedrock, which would make digging down an incredible and expensive challenge.

Anyway, if you really want to go deeper instead of higher, it would likely be easier to demolish the house, do your digging, and start with a fresh building. Hell, if you tried to dig under the existing house to begin with and damaged the foundation in the process, you'd probably have to then demo/rebuild anyway, so may as well not waste the time to begin with :P"

Same thing happened at my Nan's funeral. I had a dressplanned out but on the day I had a hormone issue and I couldn't fit in the bra that suited that dress, we were in a hurry so I had to wear the bright orange bra. Didn't realise until I was in the sunlight standing in the carpark of the funeral home I noticed my black dress was see through and I was showing off bright orange underwear to grieving people.

I've gone two years and my SO is nearly antipodal to my location. Then there is all the immigration paper work people have to put up with.

You'll get to see her every weekend. The drive will cost money and be uncomfortable but you're better off than most here.

It's not hard to be happy with the right person. But highlights for me have always been good sex (and related acts) , cooking together, going on tramps, going to the beach (not sure if TX has *any* water). If you're out of shape then get in shape. If you could be better in bed then take biology lessons. None of these cost much money.

We communicate with each other every day and generally don't share much with other people. Given we're both introverted this keeps the relationship pretty strong.

Really though, we've had a lot in common from the start and that's what is most important.

We see each other for 1 month every 6 months. The flights are expensive. But in September all that will end for good when we move in together. You must have a plan to end the distance.

WeaklyDominant,AskReddit,1390297741.0,"Well, within America, there are several types of schools.

There are public in-state schools, which are usually able to offer lower tuition for in-state students because they are subsidized by taxes/state funding. There are private universities, which tend to not have the same sort of subsidy (but do often get lots of government money via grants and whatnot). And then separate from those two types of non-profit colleges, there are also private for-profit colleges like the University of Phoenix, which cater to an entirely different demographic.

Different factors affect the different types of schools differently. For example, when tuition rises for in-state public schools, as it has quite a bit recently for California's UC system, that's often because there is less funding coming directly from the state, and thus the university system needs to make up the shortfall via tuition. But rising costs in, say, the University of Phoenix's tuition are likely to have the same cause because its funding mechanism is entirely different.

I won't ramble on too much longer, but one prominent argument from the right (political conservatism) is that college is so expensive in the US largely because the people attending college don't bear the true cost of attending college, or at least don't bear it in the present. The government subsidizes student loans, which encourages students to take on higher amounts than they otherwise would, and the government is ultimately the one guaranteeing the loans, so there's the same sort of moral hazard issue. What this means is that universities don't have the same sort of market pressure to keep prices low because the consumers 'paying' the high prices often are not really 'paying' the high prices to the extent you'd think.

Of course, there are certainly responses from the left that justify this type of debt-subsidy--namely that education has positive externalities (benefits on people other than those bearing the cost) through things like improving communities, generating scientific returns, etc. That doesn't necessarily justify the high cost of education in the US, nor does it explain why it's higher here than elsewhere (where the same externalities apply), but it *might* explain why the government is justified in subsidizing these loans. Which in turn would explain the high costs.

Hope that's informative! Happy to offer more on this subject, but don't want to hog too much space if people aren't interested."

They take promotions that would reduce their fleixble time, where women hold back for the kids.  They get promoted by bosses more because they aren't maternity leave risks (this is illegal in most countries but happens anyway).  They do more riskier work that pays more or in general jobs that society values and pays higher anyway.  For example more women would be teachers and social workers.  That's professional, hard work requiring a degree and experience and there is value in it.  But not money.  Men dominate fields where the is more actual money to be made.  Society won't value bankers or analysts with the same warmth it does nurses and teachers but it sure pays them more.

But somebody just ignores all these different factors and just groups everything together and rounds it all off and concludes women make less than men.  In most countries for the same job it's very illegal to pay a man one wage and a woman another.  That's inviting a law suit and very few companies are that stupid.  It happens in the type of firms or situations where people negotiate their own salaries but then you can argue who is to blame for that?"

In states with less funding going toward higher education, the in-state schools need to generate more in tuition if they want to provide the same services.

Certainly *some* schools no longer need to exist, and *some* schools are probably no longer worth the money to attend them. But other schools are definitely worth it to attend as evidenced by the thousands of students clamoring to attend them each year.

Also, a lot of this comes down to whether you view your college as boosting your learning/educational prospects, or rather as a signaling mechanism of your merit. It's entirely possible to believe that going to Harvard won't actually make you smarter but that it's *still* worth it to attend Harvard because of the signal it sends on your resume (I don't attend Harvard, but this is similar to the belief that I have about my college). In other words, even if knowledge is out there beyond the university, it can still be worth it to attend the university for other reasons."

Of course Sasuke isn't dead. He is Kishimoto's love child with his massive ego. We also both know how much of a troll Kishimoto is with his plot twist(s). Maybe it isn't a dōjutsu. It could be some thing like Itachi did to Naruto... just by pointing his finger at him he was under Itachi's genjutsu. Thats why although I love the way it looks, but its not canon. So I can't ""accept"" it. You never know, maybe Sasuke's sword was booby trapped with some ultra powerful genjutsu when it fell so conveniently by Madara's side.

Thats why I will not bend my nindo. Canon is canon. The rest is fan fic. The protest continue! I will not rest till justice is served! Down with corruption! Up with moon blackjack and hookers!

Edit: Barney's tailor does everything for a third of the price. So $4000 suits. I think we can be less conservative with the number of suits then, and go for 6 suits a year, so $24000. Putting his salary at about 400k. Robin's family money: $140 million

billybadhands,AskReddit,1390298396.0,"My business partner and I were going through a tough period. We didn't know each other very well when we first decided to go into business together. He was younger than me and still fairly immature. I needed him though. He possessed several contacts, and had experience in the market that I was trying to enter. Our relationship was very rocky throughout. There were good times when we made considerable money together, but we also went through plenty of troubled times. Even though I didn't always show it to him I did appreciate him and in some ways loved him like he was my own son. He also looked up to me.

There was one particular bad period where past addiction issues resurfaced with him. I was going through some pretty crazy personal stuff at the time too. Between the business and family I didn't have much extra time or attention, and I wasn't there for my partner in a way that I should have been. His habits were having an increasingly negative effect on our business to the point where it was questionable if we could keep going. Despite all of the issues I was able to work out a deal with a new client that, if it went smoothly, would take our little business to the next level and open up many new doors.

I desperately needed his help to close this deal. It materialized really quickly and we had to pull everything together for the client on a very tight deadline. I tried to get in touch with him for hours with no response. He had just dropped off the face of the planet at the most inopportune time and would not respond to any calls or text. I was scrambling. 

Finally, I decided that I would go to his house and see if he was there. If I had to I would confront him. Even in his current mindset, if I could just talk to him, he would understand the importance of this deal and work with me. I just needed to find him. I drove to his house, and thankfully his car was in the driveway. I knocked and rang the bell several times with no answer. I pounded on the door and yelled his name. Nothing. I walked around the house to see if there was an open window that I could look in. I went to the back and onto his patio. I could hear music playing in the adjacent room. His bedroom. I thought he might just be passed out in there. The door on the patio went directly into his bedroom. I started knocking. I knock repeatedly. Very hard, very loud knocks. I yelled for him, but I heard nothing except the music playing. At this point I was desperate. I would do anything to close this deal. I needed the money for my family. We had some stacked up medical bills and this deal would help me get out of that debt and hopefully move forward.

In a moment of panic, as I felt the deal slipping through my fingers, I decided to break into his house. I broke through the back door and gained entry. There he was. Passed out in a drug induced haze with his junkie girlfriend that was responsible for his recent relapse and decent back into his addiction. Drugs and paraphernalia were scattered everywhere. Empty booze bottles lined the nightstands and dresser. I tried to wake him with no success; shaking him and yelling his name repeatedly. He was passed out cold, and there was no way he was going to be able to help close this deal. 

There I stood. Completely screwed. I saw everything that I had worked for evaporating in front of me. His girlfriend started to stir. She was passed out wasted too, and began to make a gagging sound. I realized that she was vomiting and because of her position it was running back into her esophagus and she was asphyxiating. I reached down to help her but I paused. This girl had come into my parter's life, screwed him up, and as a result the business that I risked so much to start was collapsing in front of my eyes. I'm not sure what took over me standing in that bedroom that afternoon, but I just watched. I watched her choke and gag. At the time I felt no guilt. She was to blame for what was happening, so I was eliminating a major threat to my livelihood. She put herself into the situation and knew the risks of her actions and decisions. I stood and watched until she stopped breathing. 

I ended up closing that deal, but just barely. That deal is what made our business take off, but it was ultimately not to be. We made it big and then we imploded. Through it all I lost my family, many friends, and came very close to dying. But that is another story..."

Feroc,MMORPG,1390298610.0,"I would go with a classic scenario, so it would be some 3D fantasy MMORPG.

I love to barter and trade, so I would start with the trading system of **Eve-Online**. No big auction house, but many small ones. If you need ""Icy North Wood"" in the south, then you either have to travel to the north and buy it or hope for someone else to carry some of them down to the south.

This of course would need a big big world, doesn't make sense if you could carry everything from north to south within half an hour. So we would have a great world generator like in **Minecraft** or (hopefully) **Everquest Next Landmark**. A big big world, with oceans, deserts, big forests and so on. Smaller areas will be generated by hand to have special buildings, villages and events.

Events is a good point, we will take those from **Guild Wars 2** and make them BIG! I like the events circular, so event A -&gt; event B -&gt; event C if success, event D if not and at the end event A again. But not like 10 minutes per event, more like a week with different quests depending on the stage of the event.

Jumping puzzles are the next thing I will take from **Guild Wars 2**. They are just fun.

The quests should be a mixture of **World of Warcraft**, which has by now a nice variety of different quest mechanics and **The Secret World**, which has some very hard quests for your brain. 

The PvP should be like **Eve-Online**. You can't turn it off and you will lose a lot of stuff if you die. But there will be more or less secure zones where you can stay. 

Crafting should be like **Eve-Online**, too. I don't think you need some mini games for the crafting, but you need meaningful things to craft! Good stuff won't drop, you will have to craft it and you may need a lot of resources to craft something.

I prefer a classic fighting system, so I guess that will be a mixture of **World of Warcraft** (a lot of skills with as many quickbar slots as you want to) and maybe **Path of Exile**, so there will be a lot of ways to skill your character, even really stupid skillings. 

No raids, no instances, no special pvp battlegrounds. We're playing an MMO, so there is no need for 5 man content."

I never bother learning that much about a woman. And any woman who would willfully share that kind of information with me gets nexted very quickly, because it usually means she's looking for a free therapist.

&gt;When was the last time you met a woman and she didn't challenge you or say something rude the first time you met her?

It doesn't matter. If a little girl start misbehaving, you spank her and make her take her nap. She can come back and talk to the adults when she's less cranky.

&gt;When was the last time you met a woman who knew how to actually flirt and didn't just throw her vagina at you or, even worse, use kindergarten ""be mean to him"" tactics?

As above.

&gt;When was the last time you met a woman emotionally vulnerable?

I've got some news for you: **they're *all* emotionally vulnerable.** It's why they shift blame, rationalize, flee from their problems instead of confronting them, and feel the need to write stories in their heads to explain away every last thing in the world that makes them feel insecure or inadequate.

&gt;When was the last time you met a woman genuinely worth courting?

Women don't want to be courted. They want to be fucked and then cared for, in that order.

Don't listen to what they tell you. Just watch what they respond positively to.

&gt;When was the last time you actually had fun with a woman?

i_lick_telephones,AskWomen,1390299237.0,"I was just taking their word for it when it comes to if they're natural or not. It's very likely they are wearing makeup.

I don't think there's anything wrong with wearing makeup or going natural either. I just think when we swing too far in one direction, we leave the other side a bit alienated. So that's why my point was to have some models going natural, and some with a full face of makeup, as either one is often chastised, depending on the context of each.

What I meant by achievable is that it is literally possible and not totally outside the realms of reality. You see a picture of a model with a photoshopped body to the point where very VERY few of the population looks like that. It is literally impossible to achieve that standard of flawlessness in every day life. When you see makeup on a model, sure, you might not get it to that level of perfection, but you're looking at something that is technically achievable. You aren't looking at a lie. You're looking right at something unfiltered, and unedited. Anyone could achieve the look with the right skill set in the real world. Sure, not everyone has that talent right off the bat, but it's still not an impossibility to have similar makeup, in the way that it is when someone is photoshopped."

Some people completely forget to separate their mind when they're working. You can't be creatively inspired and technically solid at the same time, you'll just end up completely losing sight of that cool drum rhythm you had in mind because you've spent 20 minutes picking out a kick drum and 2 hours mixing a snare, or that melody you thought would be fucking insane but you wasted an hour in massive playing around with an infinite choice of waveforms. When you have an idea, get it down fast with the first synth/kick/snare/sample you find, regardless (you'll hear about people writing their entire tunes on a piano sampler first then doing the sound design later). Then, when you're happy, do the technical stuff; the sound design, finding the perfect samples etc etc. Practice this and make it a habit and a natural function, you're going to find that you make a lot less 8 bar loops and start finishing songs. 

You asked about Ableton, so: Learn to use the fades on drums samples (in audio). Want a tighter kick? 'Show Fades' then reduce the tail manually, same goes for just about any other drum hit. Also good for reducing clicks if you've poorly looped a sample."

""You go in and raid,"", Mr Bharti is seen ordering the policeman.

Mr Bharti said on receiving people's complaints about ""Nigerian nationals involved in sex trade and drugs"" at the building in Khirki Extension, which is in his constituency in south Delhi, he had decided to ""catch them red-handed"", along with the police.

This is detention? There's video evidence to this, so don't even deny that NDTV is cooking it up here.

Definitely check out JB-weld, I highly highly highly recommend, wear rubber gloves, use a toothpick as an applicator with some newspapers down for a base. Be gentle, but be firm.

codayus,NeutralPolitics,1390299722.0,"Pro 1:  No.  It helps *SOME* individuals and families meet their basic needs (the ones who have their pay increased by the provision).  It hurts others (the ones who lose are unable to obtain jobs due to the provision).

Pro 2:  Kinda, but not really.  The magnitudes are so small as the trivial.  In the US, very few people are in the bang any likely minimum wage increase would apply to, thus any increase in aggregate demand is going to be small, even in aggregate.

Con 1:  Yes.

Con 2:  Probably not, but inflation is complicated.  The simple answer is that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, and the minimum wage increase won't impact it.  The longer answer is that the short answer is entirely wrong, but the outcome is the same.  :)

What it boils down to is this:  If we're talking about a raise in the minimum wage from, say, $7.25 to $7.30 or so, then it'll benefit *some* of the tiny, tiny fraction of non-tipped workers making between $7.25 and $7.30 an hour (who will see a pay rise of up to 5 whole cents an hour, while hurting others of that same tiny group (who will be fired).  Estimates are that the benefits will heavily outweigh the costs, but that both will be so small we literally cannot measure them.

A big enough rise to be noticeable is possible, but at that level the costs are starting to seriously outweigh the benefits.  Is there some sweet spot where an increase would do a noticeable amount of good, *and* do more good than harm?  Maybe.  Research is inconclusive, and good luck trying to find it.  :)

But here's a counter-argument:  If we, as a society, decide that working for less than $10/hour (or whatever) is inconsistent with human dignity, even for people who's labour is not worth $10/hour, why is a minimum wage the best policy?  Is restricting the ability of the poorest in society (which is who we're talking about, by definition) to sell their most valuable asset at a market clearing price a good idea?  Is it even moral?  Whose should be responsible for topping up their pay?  Should it not be society?  We as a society recognize that being murdered is incompatible with human dignity, and we spend a not inconsiderable sum to ensure that our fellow humans are not murdered; we don't, eg, heavily fine the estates of victims to encourage them not to be murdered.  Conceptually minimum wage laws fall on the poorest by telling them ""you cannot sell your labour for less than this sum""; in some cases that translates to telling them they cannot sell their labour at all.  It's a penalty closely tailored to only fall on the poorest and unluckiest of society; a big ""well fuck you, you should have been born rich so you would have had health insurance when your BPD flared up, but you weren't and you didn't, so now you're screwed, and we're going to compound that by making sure you can't even get a job, because fuck you poor person!"".  How is that just?  People with Downs syndrome are often employed at menial jobs like collecting and returning supermarket trolleys.  How is a law making it uneconomical to hire them just?  I could go on; the people hurt by these policies (and even the staunchest supporters of these policies will agree that they exist) are literally the poorest and most vulnerable in society.

In short, i personally find these policies unjust as a matter of principle, and feel like minimum wage laws in general are the wrong tool here.  If we as a society think everyone should be able to make at least $10/hour, enact a fallback unemployment benefit with no duration cap that will pay the equivalent of $10/hour.  If we don't think that's worth it, then we, as a society, clearly do *NOT* believe that everyone is worth at least $10/hour; we're just looking for some deep pockets that aren't ours to raid.  And as a not-inconsiderable benefit, it would be vastly more effective and targeted.  (Rather than, as minimum wage laws actually do, benefitting college students working retail jobs to help pay for beer.)

TL;DR:  The biggest problem with the minimum wage is that it is immoral and ineffectual.  If you want to do what it claims to do, there are **MUCH** better policies, to whit:  Write the people you want to help a freakin' cheque.  There's no argument about whether *that* helps the recipients, and the cost, in aggregate, isn't going to be higher.  That paycheque has to come from someone, and trying to combine your social policies with class welfare tends to be work very, very poorly."

A lot of the people you group with are going to be very experienced. I personally love having players new to dungeons (especially the last two story dungeons) and helping them through it. Hell, I walked 7 new players through Praetorium not even a month ago, and had a blast. However, that's not always the case. Some people are going to find out you're new and be extremely rude to you. Ignore them, and don't take it personally. The only way you're going to learn how to do these fights is by doing them. Don't let a few assholes scare you off.


Also, if someone kicks you because you are new, or don't have top of the line gear, report them.
However, To kind of build on this... there ARE certain fights where you need to be decently geared (I'm thinking titan hardmode, and to a lesser extent garuda). If someone takes you aside or politely says ""Hey , your gear's not quite up to snuff for this, sorry"" they might have a point. Being undergeared in Titan makes life REALLY hard on everyone. Your Job armor from level 45 just isn't going to cut it. Consider going back and grabbing another piece of Darklight. But, as I said above, if someone's just being an outright ass, ignore them."

EU är därför bra på flera sätt, och även om det finns gott om nackdelar med att styras för mycket från Bryssel (byråkratiseringen, lobbyverksamheten etc) så skulle mer makt från Bryssel innebära att vi skulle kunna tvinga på vissa östländer att avbryta den systematiska diskrimineringen av vissa människor (läs romer). 

Nu tror inte jag det är lösningen på denna fråga. Lösningen på denna fråga tror jag är regionalpolitisk. Vi i Sverige och resten av västeuropa borde se till att dessa människor som kommer hit behandlas med de privilegier som anstår en unionsmedborgare. I en utopi skulle de som diskrimineras i östeuropa inte sitta på västeuropas gator, utan bidra till våra starka välfärdssamhällen genom riktiga jobb."

But look what Ozil has done to that team this year. Most said they wouldn't make the top 4 before he made the move and now they are top of the table and won't stop winning.

A player like Mata could inject that much needed morale into our team and give everyone a lift. He was arguably the best midfielder in the league last year.

Until your man realizes the issue and takes it upon himself to actively work on being a better communicator, shit like that email is going to continue. I know. I did it for seven years. 

You deserve someone who is willing to communicate with you. Your partner should feel comfortable enough to share their feelings and talk to you when something goes wrong. You don't have that. It sounds like you haven't had that for months. Add to that his ""I want a break"" comment, and your relationship isn't going anywhere.

I guess what, you think you're superior to me because you have a smaller vocabulary and I use words you're unfamiliar with?  I mean, what is the point of making fun of grok, except to demonstrate your paucity of imagination and small-mindedness?  Oooh, you hate a word!  You must be my superior!  Go fuck yourself, you assclown.  Jesus.

Also, you do understand I'm not from theredpill, don't subscribe to redpill theories, and am actually banned from the trp, right?  Because I'm re-reading that bullshit you posted in which you demonstrated how close-minded and stupid you are, and I notice you talk a lot about trp as if I was enamored of them or part of that group.

This is why I call you a braindead ideologue.  You're a feminist and you've declared TRP your enemy, so that's all you can see.  Just blind, stupid, and pointless to argue with it.  I could make a brilliant argument that was unassailable, and you'd just go off on a tangent about TRP and demand I defend some bullshit I never even suggested, because fuckwits like you are incapable of anything else."

Sir_Fancy_Pants,todayilearned,1390301884.0,"you genuinely have to be one of the most stupid people i have ever met who actually thinks they are intelligent (lol)

Im sure you re just too dumb to see how your ""Hair example"" is not only irrelevant nonsense, but actually massively exposes your really flawed and weak mind.

You literally know nothing at all about the scientific method . and here is why.

you claim because 20 years ago or so a ""claim"" by group X was ""disproved"" (and i use that term lightly becuase it wasn't) by group Y invalidated the entire concept of group X, and then infer it must all be false.

and then you have the nerve to write:
&gt;even if it had held true, it would have been the opposite of science, because it's taking two things, drawing a correlation, and going ""hey I think I figured out the cause!"" It's literally the ""science"" of drawing causation from correlations. It's junk science.


How can you be so stupid that you dont realise that you are doing exactly what you claim is the ""opposite of science"".

You clearly have no real exposure or understanding of how the scientific process is supposed to work. you argue like a religious extremist.

I find it hilarious (genuinely hilarious) the you can be so stupid to think a concept such as evolutionary psychology remains in the realm of ""untestable and unexaminable"" yet think we can conduct experiments that completely remove ""societal conditioning"" in addition to any genetic influence,

its like you dont even understand the basic concept of evidence, anyone who knows, and anyone who actually has a scientific background (a genuine science), knows things like computational modelling etc all support and help understand the evolutionary psychology model. 

You have nothing, and as you show such appalling understanding of the scientific method or even evidence based reasoning, your nonsense rants have no value at all. its literally like talking to an extremist religious whackjob who in their complete stupidity thinks the bible is proven by science , and despite having absolutely no understanding of the scientific method or principles thinks they are an authority.

Genuinely hilarious stuff, and made all the more funnier  because i genuinely believe you are too dumb to understand why. and the fact you think the scientific consensus is in support of your claims is also pretty funny.

littlestray,AskWomen,1390301887.0,"Not the person you're asking, but I think there's a big difference between activities that occupy the body and activities that occupy the mind. Ideally on a first date you want the former, so that your mind is free to chat and make a connection while your body has something to do besides fidget.

For example, a movie is an activity that occupies the mind. You either ignore your date or ignore the movie, you can't fully commit your attention to both. Conversely, a trip to a zoo/aquarium is a good body activity, in that you're made to walk and see things you can commentate upon and also just chat in between or at an exhibit."

* Match leather colors across your outfit. Brown shoes = brown belt, watch, wallet etc. Black = black.

* Keep your style pure. As few extra details and visible brands as possible.

* Leather + contrast stitching is fucking class

* Shoe maintenance. Shoe maintenance. Shoe maintenance.

* Untucked dress shirts usually just looks sloppy. Tuck that fucker in and keep it in place with a good belt (don't be cheap)

* Wherever possible and affordable, have your garments fit by a professional. It isn't as expensive and exclusive as you might think.

Some pointers about your wardrobe;

* Overcoat, trench or not doesn't matter

* Leather jacket, collar style doesn't matter but I always find [this style](http://efastfacts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/leather-jacket-ds386.jpg) to be the coolest

* Blazer/suit jacket

* Chinos

Combine these few basics with some more trendy stuff and you have a cool wardrobe. A good example is tight black jeans, a low-cut t-shirt and a blazer/jacket. This outfit always turns heads."

Kalfira,OneY,1390302310.0,"Sounds like maybe you weren't listening to what I said. First off, I suffer from chemical depression. So does my mom, who is also bipolar. So I am aware of how that works. I have been under the care of a psychiatrist off and on for years. So don't pretend to tell me what I do and do not know.

But I would give this exact same advice to my kids. I would give this advice to my mother, my brother, or my best friend. I told him we don't care, because we don't! Let's be real. If he killed himself TODAY and we found out. You wouldn't be racked with guilt. You wouldn't have your life disturbed. The limit of effect it would have on any of us is we might share the story with a friend or partner, then we would forget and he would be gone from our mind for good.

This doesn't mean we WANT him to die. Indifference is not the same as malice. If he is coming to us for reassuring platitudes that he's great he's never going to really feel better. The only way to overcome depression is to grab that bitch by the horns and recognize exactly who and what you are, and not how you ""feel"". When you take your personal feelings out of it and stop relying on externalities that you are using the judge the standards of your life you are finally free of the prison that you build for yourself. 

I'm fully aware that when you are clinically depressed, doing anything feels like a chore. But the only way to have any satisfaction in your life is for you to be personally satisfied with your life independent of anyone elses opinions or beliefs. I would also like to point out that no where in the original post does he say he suffers from clinical depression. In fact the only reasons he ever gives as to why he doesn't want to live anymore are all externalities rather than ""Oh i'm just so depressed"".

The intent of my original post is not to further pile on or depress OP, but to tell him the truth. Nothing I said isn't objectively true. It's the way of the world, it only cares what it can get from you. If you can't deal with that realization, that's your problem. But it's 100% the truth. This doesn't mean all people in the world are evil, or self motivated. But that is how the aggregate ""world"" treats people.

Girls don't go out with you because you are a ""nice guy"". They go out with you because they are attracted to you.

Friends don't become friends just because you happen to be in their vicinity. It's because the person they choose to be friends with they find interesting, or makes them feel valuable in some way.

Jobs don't hire you because you are personable and really motivated. They hire you because they think you will make them money.

My point here is that until he puts the bullshit that weighs on him aside, he will never feel like he wants to ""live"" because at the moment, he doesn't want to live! Nothing worth having in this world just ""comes to be"" magically. It requires effort, and hard work, often for years and years at a time. Happiness is the exact, same, thing."

Culture shock has always been a strange concept to me, the idea of being shocked by a cultural difference implies the assumption that someone else's culture *should* be the same as yours and you are surprised, or shocked, that it isn't.

Whenever you travel make an effort to learn about the culture you will be visiting, learn a few phrases, carry a pocket dictionary with you.  Have an open mind and assume that people will do things differently, be pleasantly surprised by similarities, not shocked by differences.  

When I lived in Italy I saw it all the time.  Tourists would walk into a store and immediately ask ""Do you speak English?""  The answer was almost always a curt ""no"" and no effort was made to assist the tourist.  If, on the other hand, the tourist came in with a pocket dictionary and made an effort (even if their accent and pronunciation was horrendous) they were greeted with warm smiles and shopkeepers who spoke English, German, French, Spanish, whatever they needed.  They were helpful, friendly, polite and would make a real effort to help them *because the tourist had made an effort*.

Making that effort shows an appreciation for the culture, country, and people that you are visiting.  It shows respect and understanding and it will be greeted with respect and understanding.  Always remember that when you visit another country you are a *guest* and should behave as you would if you were a guest in someone's home."

I can hardly bang your head on the quotes that say that other research is going to be cut to fund ITER, can I?

&gt;There are national science budgets continuing to fund other projects. It might just not be the EU.

The same goes for ITER then.

&gt;In the meantime, renewable energy sources were already subsidised by more than that every year in 2009. 

You mix up research subsidies and production subsidies.

Also: the support compares with $312 billion for fossil fuels in the same year.

&gt;Finally, the performance of fusion research

I can pick arbitrary targets to produce cheerful graphs for grant requests too. Really, putting ""progress"" on a graph.. sure that this isn't a parody? :)

&gt;Below expectations is out of the question, unless you want to measure up to unfounded dreams of the 1950s, which originated in the media, not science.

ox_,books,1390303459.0,"I recently finished the Song of Ice and Fire series and went straight onto reading Shogun by James Clavell. It's about an English sailor in the 1600s who is trying to circumnavigate the globe. He's ship wrecked in Japan where the only westerners they've come into contact with are Portuguese missionaries who decry him as a heathen (because Portugal are at war with Britain). The book is about how he adapts and survives.


 It's similar to Game of Thrones in that there are a lot of characters but nobody is specifically ""good"" or ""evil"". There's also a lot of political manoeuvring as well as assassinations and samurai fighting.

After I finished it, I felt like I'd learned a shitload about feudal Japan but I really enjoyed the epic story."

I could just be lucky. But I get the impression that the new generation of men (those who are in their 20s now) are very sex-positive, love cunnilingus, have good control over their orgasms, abide by enthusiastic consent, and take it as a given that the girl must cum first.

Dying isn't going to make you happy, its going to make you dead. Real dead. Forever. No opportunity to fix your problems, or see that everything isn't so bad. No way to live a life filled with the utter joy of being alive, and look back at this dark time, filled with love for yourself, and gratitude that you made the hard, but right decision to keep on living. Stop doing everything you can to make others happy, honestly, fuck them. The only way to make your situation worse is by hurting yourself. Just take it a minute at a time, and really try to stop focusing on others. One day you might be well enough to see that these people in your life didn't seem to care because they were going through their own pain, and couldn't see yours. I promise you people in your life love you, you dont need to hurt yourself to prove it.

Other than the fact that they do this in roughly the one plane (which would likely be the naive assumption anyway), what complex observations are required? *Given* that very basic knowledge, I truly don't see this as any more complex than reckoning the movement of a child on an amusement park ride.

MBorkBorkBork,Parenting,1390304246.0,"You &amp; the caregiver have separate goals. You probably want your child to feel secure, cared for, accepted for who she is, listened to, etc. The daycare provider's goal is to care for the kids in her charge as efficiently as possible, with minimum fuss. This means if there's a kid who's used to getting her needs met individually, with love &amp; attention, she won't likely fit in the provider's paradigm.

It IS harder on a caregiver to have a child who needs to be held, who won't nap on her own for very long, who is securely attached to her mom so she cries when she misses her.

If you want to ""train"" your baby to do well at this childcare, then yes, you wouldn't hold her when she asks, nurse when she wants, or respond to her needs quickly, with love. Your baby would quickly learn that her needs are unimportant and unlikely to be met, and would therefore make an ideal, compliant, and easier daycare child.

That text, imo, clearly shows the provider's priority is wanting her work day to be easy &amp; no fuss, rather than it being paramount to meet the individual needs of kids in her care.

Funny how that always seems to happen. Repeatedly. 

Needless to say, I've got about a gig of books that fell off the back of a truck. And I use Calibre to keep them all roughly organized. It'll be a large task, but it'll go somewhat smoothly if you just take a few titles at a time. 

Protip: Don't batch update your tags. Do them one at a time. It may take longer, but it is more accurate in the long run. This is doubly true when the autotagger can't recognize what book a file is supposed to be and moves on to the next file without telling you. Or worse, the autotagger bugs out completely and starts assigning every questionable file a completely different identity. So you wind up spending more time manually tabbing through all of the entries anyways just to be certain that nothing else got screwed up."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390305090.0,"I believe I am an averagely gifted-in-math person. But I love it, and this is why:

(1) Every single time I get *anything* right I feel like a fucking genius!! Literally, every single problem, step in a problem, or just anytime I truly understand a topic, symbol, anything. The best is when I know the next step in class before the instructor works it out. *(Sometimes, at home, I dance around and/or brag to friends/family.)* 
I suggest trying this out. Congratulate yourself each time you get something right! If nothing else, you'll feel a teeny bit of a mood boost.

(2) Every single thing (number, symbol, etc) is used the way it is used for a reason, usually because, (again, literally) no one has thought of a better way to do it. *(Or there are multiple ways to do it, each useful at different times in different situations.)*

I have one starting place that I suggest for everyone struggling with algebra:

Make sure you understand each and every symbol you see. These are not usually taught well, if at all, and it is impossible to do anything if you don't understand them.
(have to run off to work, no time to explain this now, can/will elaborate later)

I agree, with some of the others, that people like and enjoy what we like and enjoy.

But I have been able to cultivate genuine appreciation for and passion in subjects I hated, or just plain sucked at,  as a child. Not all of them, but things like physical fitness, art, music, projects with my hands, etc.  

It is not impossible to do so.

That being said, that doesn't mean it is certain either, so if it doesn't work out for you, by all means, don't beat yourself up over it.

The MBTI is based on your preferred/strongest orders of how you receive and interact with the world...so for example I, as an ENFP, tend to be more extroverted, intuitive, feeling and perceiving and am more happily/comfortable when I can give those functions more value. If I had to value thinking over feeling in a situation I would be less adept/comfortable than if I could have used feeling.

When Mohammed successfully formulated the divine decree to marry Zaynab, he celebrated for a week; hundreds of goats were slaughtered to provide lavish meals for the residents of Medina. Throwing a party for a week, for the entire city, can hardly be called a simplistic life style; only the super rich can afford such extravagance.

* Clang of the Hill: if it ever shows up, it's pretty fun. But it gets old incredibly fast. It's kill-oriented so you might as well call it Energy Sword Slayer

* Paintball: Classic, loved it when I played it on Reach, love it now. I see it much more than CotH but it's still a little more rare than I would like. It's a slayer gametype but it's energy pistols and one-shot kills. There's so little skill involved that I accept it. A true ""Action Sack"" gametype in which it is hilarious with friends

* Husky whatever: I don't particularly care for this one, and it's the most occurring gametype I see. What would help it (and tiny slayer) are more maps. One map is kinda...lame. I don't hate the gametype, but it's just Fiesta with a flag. If I were to change it (***Feel free to skip this***) I'd make it even crazier by making it 2v2v2v2 and having four paths and four flags. If your flag is captured and scored at the holder of the flag's base, your team is killed on the spot and you're effectively eliminated, respawning in a little spectator box.

It's something, and AS is more fun, but CotH is getting stale already, as is Husky Path or whatever. But I'll accept that it's an effort, and I can't hate 343, I can only yearn for more."

Metal storm is, from what I remember, part of a weapons system, designed for asset protection.

It's simply a feature of the technology that allows it to fire all of the bullets at the same time.

KotH variants need killing or else the other team will just contest/drain the hill. And then I just hate Rock n' Rail and Binary Slayer, and I wish Fiesta was less ""Oh I got the Incin. Cannon, allow me to win for a bit"" and more ""Haha look at these crazy stupid guns I got."" If I had a say in it, the common crap-weapons would be very common, and Incin. Cannons and stuff would be rare, so if someone gets them they're the leader until they run out of ammo, then it's back to dog eat dog.

However, If they're fun to you, then I'm glad someone enjoys them.

And I brought mongoosing up because I have no place to go to just jack around. I want to play something fun like RACE where the object isn't to kill but 343 stripped race and made AS only kill-oriented. It just feels wrong after how strong of an AS Reach had.

lynxz,deaf,1390306682.0,"No. There's no stigma involved in hearing with deaf what so ever. Why would their friends or community do anything but support them? Deaf people have already been through enough, so the last thing they need is to be ridiculed by their own community. How were you dumbfounded by her being attractive? Have you heard of Marlee Matlin? She's pretty good looking for her age, and not to mention she was VERY good looking when she was younger. Deaf people come in all shapes and sizes.

Oh and uh also, just because someone is cute/good looking doesn't necessarily mean they are going to be interested in you. Just because she's deaf doesn't mean she doesn't have guys hitting on her or anything =P On another note, it's usually deaf guys that pull hearing women, not the other way around.

Why you might ask? Because.. Often times hearing men don't really put out the effort to REALLY learn sign language. This may not be ALL hearing men, but it is definitely the majority. Hearing men will resort to basic sign, or some other sort of communication in order to not fully learn ASL. It's not unheard of to see deaf women communicating with their hearing boyfriends with cell phones or even pen/paper. Also, women make up the majority of ASL and Deaf Culture classes, that is how deaf men tend to pull hearing women.

An interesting fact: 90% of deaf people end up marrying other deaf people. This doesn't mean you don't have a chance, or she won't be interested at all. It just means the statistics are against you, and that if you were realllllly interested in hypothetically proceeding, you would put the effort forth and see it through rather than half assing it.

Source: Deaf Culture Class and [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Into-Deaf-World-Harlan-Lane/dp/0915035634).

tattedspyder,AskReddit,1390306701.0,"When I was in 9th grade I took a drafting class (it was one of the ""wood shop"" type classes) and we tortured the teacher without mercy.  

He was a skinny, geeky looking guy with a haircut that bordered on being a mullet and a set of birth control glasses.  He had zero control over the class and never managed to earn our respect (yes, as an adult and teacher he should have gotten respect anyway).  We'd throw pens and pencils (and later triangles of sheet metal and tools) into the acoustic spray-on foam on the ceiling, we'd demand to see pictures of his wife and then tell him she wasn't real when he wouldn't show us, we'd completely ignore him during class, tell him to shut up when he interrupted us, just all kinds of mean, disrespectful stuff.

One day my friend pulled out his bowl and a baggie and started packing a bowl in the middle of class.  The teacher walked up and said, ""Is that what I think it is?""  My friend looked at him, said ""Yep"" and lit the bowl.  The teacher just had no idea what to do, he walked back to the front of the room and continued the lesson like there wasn't a kid getting high in his class.

About 3/4ths of the way through the year he tried to crack down.  He'd start getting angrier and angrier, but we'd just laugh at him.  One day he snapped, screamed at all of us and broke into tears.  We sat there, stunned for a few minutes until he just walked out of the classroom.

We never saw him again.  According to what I heard he actually quit teaching and went to be a bus driver for elementary and kindergarten kids.  Supposedly he was fired from that when he crashed an empty bus into a dump truck."

screenmagnet,sex,1390306757.0,"Ask her when she is sober how she feels about having sex when she is drunk. In a relationship, your partner can give you consent in advance for situations where she will be technically unable to consent. This is some times called 'consensual non-consent'.

As a general rule, do not push her boundaries or try new things when she is drunk. For example, if you guys have not done anal before, don't surprise her with a finger back there when she is drunk. If she doesn't like it when you cum on her face, don't wait until she is drunk to do it. If you guys usually use condoms, then don't bareback when she is drunk. Stick to stuff that you know she is down for and stuff that you guys normally do in bed. If you feel like you are taking advantage of her inebriation, you probably are.

Pay close attention to her level of intoxication. If she is passing out, unaware of her surroundings, unable to feel pain, or unable to walk, talk, or actively participate in the sex, stop things immediately (and consider getting her some medical attention). The biggest danger here is that you could do physical damage to her body and she either doesn't realize it (because she may be so drunk that she doesn't feel the pain), or is unable to tell you to stop or to push you off. This is the main reason why people say to avoid anal when you are drunk.

Play close attention to nonverbal cues (facial expressions, body language, tone of voice). Is she enthusiastic and clearly enjoying herself? Great! Keep going! Is she wincing like she is in pain? Back off, slow down, stop. Is she just lying there with a blank expression on her face? Back off, ask her how she is doing, and reevaluate her level of intoxication. When your partner is drunk, it is on you to read subtle changes in her body language and tone of voice and determine whether she is enjoying herself or is becoming uncomfortable. She may have difficulty communicating her discomfort to you, or may even have trouble recognizing it.

Good on you for thinking through this carefully. I encourage you to discuss your concerns with your partner. It is definitely possible to have enthusiastically consensual sex under the influence, in the context of a pre-defined relationship. It just requires good communication skills, knowledge of your partner's sexual boundaries, and careful observation during the act. Since these skills can be difficult for some people to master (especially if both people are drunk at the same time), young people are often advised to just forgo drunk sex altogether. It's easier to make a blanket 'drunk sex = rape' rule than to explain the nuances of consensual non-consent to people and to trust that those people are acting in good faith.

Good luck, OP. My favourite sex happens when I am under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. You just have to be proactive about ensuring that nobody feels that they were taken advantage of."
dagmx,Games,1390306760.0,"I agree whole heartedly.  
Looking at all the Nintendo first party titles, nothing really excites me. And I'm a huge fan of all the classic Nintendo games, but there's a point where I'm not excited by the thought of a new Mario platformer.   
I know the game will be fun, but it's not really something where I'm like,  ""Shit, I really want to play this game"". Because I've played so many variations of Mario games etc..  
  
the games that really excited me when I was a Nintendo gamer primarily were DK64 and Super Mario galaxy. Because they looked super fun but they were also different enough that I WANTED to buy them.  Nintendo currently are just playing things too stupidly safe to be interesting.
  
I know the counter argument is that both other consoles also have the yearly rehash of their big franchises, but they also have their fair share of really enticing new games.  
  
for example (i'm a sony guy currently), The Last of Us and Little Big Planet. Both games aren't entirely new genres, but both are different enough that I genuinely wanted to buy them. "

Feroc,changemyview,1390306773.0,"&gt; So how is this actually contributing anything? CMV.

Assumption: MMORPGs need a permanent flow of incoming money to pay for servers, support and developers. If no new money would come in they would not be able to pay those people and tech.

So either the game has to be B2P/F2P with a cash shop or there has to be a subscription. 

The big problem with cash shops is, that the developers have to add a reason to the game to use the shop, so they either have to add annoyances to the game which you can annihilate by buying something or they have to remove features which you would have to buy.

If you want to play the game as the developers have designed it, you would have to pay a lot more than $15 per month. You could need to buy XP boosts to get the original state of XP, could need to buy additional character slots, could need to buy items from the store to reset your skills, could need to buy mounts and so on...

Personally I don't want that. I want to play the game in its original state, with the same features as everyone else, without getting annoyed by the ""buy 100 diamonds for just $9.99"" messages when I click on the wrong button."
wwwwolf,explainlikeimfive,1390306784.0,"In addition to the previous answers:

DLL ""corruption"" is a bit tricky thing to deal with unless you know the exact causes of the error. Most of the time in Win9x, all of this stuff was caused when an application installed a different version of a DLL to the system, overwriting a version that some other application had installed, which in turn made the other application go bonkers. I haven't researched it fully, but I think Win2k (and other versions since, that all were based on WinNT) has some kind of DLL versioning system in place that allows all applications to use the exact version of the DLL they want.

(Edit: Ah yes, I remembered the term too: [DLL hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell). =)

Also, I seem to remember that Win95 had some kind of an expert utility (could have been an add-on from Microsoft?) that let you ""open"" DLLs. It just showed the technical information about DLL (name, version, developer, names of functions/data contained in it), but of course wouldn't let you do anything else with it."

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1390307506.0,"The last thing a Brony would like is a set of male Ponies trying to appeal to them.

I get Bronies. It's the third in line of good quality shows with a set of diverse feminine protagonists. The first, of course, was Sailor Moon, followed by Power Puff Girls. Boys that thought these were good shows were eager for a follow-up and Faust provided it. That's why most Bronies are just old enough to have had these shows when growing up.

They are so vocal about their fandom because they have not had a platform to talk about this stuff before. Boy society is remarkably oppressive, and any expression of interest in anything feminine would be remarked with judgement or anger. When parents get anxious because their kid is more interested in sewing than sports, that anxiety gets passed down to the child. What happens when you tell a child their interest in things is wrong? They shut down, they don't make risks, they cling to whatever they are allowed to have, like Yu-Gi-Oh. They don't respect themselves and they retreat from society. Afraid to develop, they stay as children and retreat to the Internet.

The Internet is a great place for the equality of ideas. No matter what you think is right or good, there is a safe space for you to find others that think like you do. It frees the tongue from the stigma of criticism. ((Although, I would say that my involvement in TiA would suggest that I also believe that sometimes, the criticism is due. This is more to do with a difference of ""sharing"" ideas and forcibly applying them.)) Those stunted individuals really liked the new show with complex female characters in a fun-loving animation now had a means of talking with each other. So as to avoid any accusation of ""queerness"" these individuals adopted the term, ""Brony"" to seem more like fraternity members.

I hate to see the backlash against this community. It cements a society that hates people for expressing aspects because of their gender. But the community is seen as so vulgar and sexualized that no one wants to acknowledge them as people. Even those that trace most personal problems on shifts in society lay the ostracization on these individuals themselves. Why is that? Oh, because it complicates the narrative and is seen as associating with the lepers.

Worse yet, by not examining the causes of this phenomenon, we set our selves up into a society that will push this down on our children as well. When we publicly shame grown adult males for being interested in toys made for girls, we also shame young boys for being interested in toys for girls."

As for a tapering schedule, I've always decreased by 10mg at a time until I got to 30mg, and then decreased by 5mg at a time. I stay at each dosage level for a *minimum* of one week, and never go to the next level unless my symptoms are stable (i.e., no blood or urgency). The last time I used prednisone, my symptoms would flare up again every time I decreased the dosage, but would usually settle down within a few days. If not, I'd have to increase the dosage and then taper more slowly.

7thDRXN,asktransgender,1390308072.0,"That's a lot to process.  I have insomnia and know what it's like to not be able to sleep, especially with confusing and conflicting thoughts running through my head.  I know it sounds hokey but meditation really helped me, specifically one method I found here on reddit where you as you breathe in and out you imagine an eraser undoing the line between your body and the air, the pillow, the blanket, etc.  I end up in this really relaxing space that at least helps me think at a slower pace, and much easier to get to sleep.

I can't feel what you feel so even though my progression was similar I was definitely not thinking the same about it.  Female me was a safe space, and when maleness hit, social anxiety ramped up.  And yeah, looking at old me, I was pretty damn good looking, but the self-esteem wasn't there and the social anxiety was, which transitioning mostly fixed.  So for me there's no real toss up there... I feel like if you're imagining being the opposite gender a lot, you're likely trans, but who really knows?  And only you can decide.

As far as orgasms go, have you tried toys?  Mine has barely functioned for about a year and a half now but I got a hitachi magic wand, which worked magic, and some prostate-oriented toys, which are magical too.  Also I've heard that adding progesterone to the hormone cocktail can help with that quite a bit.

I don't know if that really helps at all but I just wanted to make sure you know your post reached some eyes and ears.  Hopefully your parents come around and you find some friends you can share your past with.

digitalpencil,mildlyinteresting,1390308268.0,"No-one knows the origins of sexuality. Best guess are that it's a result of a combination of factors including hormonal balances we are subjected to in utero, sociological factors and perhaps, a genetic element.

Given dizygotic twins can be of both genders, it would make sense that they could also be of disparate sexuality as well however whether same sex, monozygotic twins can be.. I would say yes, given there is likely an environmental factor that cannot be discarded but i'm not well-read on the subject.

&gt; A number of twin studies have attempted to compare the relative importance of genetics and environment in the determination of sexual orientation. In a 1991 study, Bailey and Pillard found that 52% of monozygotic (MZ) brothers and 22% of the dizygotic (DZ) twins were concordant for homosexuality.[4] 'MZ' indicates identical twins with the same sets of genes and 'DZ' indicates fraternal twins where genes are mixed to a similar extent as non-twin siblings. In 2000, Bailey, Dunne and Martin found similar results from a larger sample of 4,901 Australian twins.[5] Self reported zygosity, sexual attraction, fantasy and behaviours were assessed by questionnaire and zygosity was serologically checked when in doubt. They found 20% concordance in the male identical or MZ twins and 24% concordance for the female identical or MZ twins. A meta-study by Hershberger (2001)[6] compares the results of eight different twin studies: among those, all but two showed MZ twins having much higher concordance of sexual orientation than DZ twins, suggesting a non-negligible genetic component.

&gt; Bearman and Brückner (2002) criticized early studies of concentrating on small, select samples[7] and non-representative selection of their subjects.[8] They studied 289 pairs of identical twins (monozygotic or from one fertilized egg) and 495 pairs of fraternal twins (dizygotic or from two fertilized eggs) and found concordance rates for same-sex attraction of only 7.7% for male identical twins and 5.3% for females, a pattern which they say ""does not suggest genetic influence independent of social context.""[7]

&gt; A 2010 study of all adult twins in Sweden (more than 7,600 twins)[9] found that same-sex behavior was explained by both heritable factors and individual-specific environmental sources (such as prenatal environment, experience with illness and trauma, as well as peer groups, and sexual experiences), while influences of shared-environment variables such as familial environment and societal attitudes had a weaker, but significant effect. Women showed a statistically non-significant trend to weaker influence of hereditary effects, while men showed no effect of shared environmental effects. The use of all adult twins in Sweden was designed to address the criticism of volunteer studies, in which a potential bias towards participation by gay twins may influence the results;

&gt; Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained .34–.39 of the variance [of sexual orientation], the shared environment .00, and the individual-specific environment .61–.66 of the variance. Corresponding estimates among women were .18–.19 for genetic factors, .16–.17 for shared environmental, and .64–.66 for unique environmental factors. Although wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation, the results are consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior.[9]

ScaredycatMatt,soccer,1390308371.0,"**Dean Marney** for Spurs against Everton.

2 goals and 2 assists. Video of best goal here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IeHH9ksUyU

Match report:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2353119/Marney-destroys-Everton.html

I remember watching this match and I'll honestly never ever forget how well he played. I had seen Marney a few times before and I've seen him after, nothing he's done since has quite lived up to what he did in that match.

Without doubt one of the best performances I've ever seen. Just absolutely bizarre that it came from Dean Marney.

__

Another one that pops up in my mind:

**Jeremie Aliadiere** against Liverpool in the 6-3 win. I hate to call Aliadiere average, but I'm more going on how his career went from here instead of what I consider his 'natural ability' level to be.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HysfKb7MCo

Baptista got all the headlines as he got 4 goals, but Aliadiere absolutely tore Liverpool apart in that match. Paletta didn't have a clue how to stop him.

I believe Aliadiere did quite well in France last season though, so maybe he's starting to deliver consistently in his older years.

__

This goal from **Neil Mellor** comes to mind too:

Maybe not a 10/10 performance, but he never really lived up to that moment and had an average career in the Championship. What a hit though!"

goocy,BitcoinMarkets,1390308386.0,"OP of [the bear post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1smows/is_anyone_a_longterm_bear_id_like_to_hear_their/) here: it wasn't a rhetorical question.

On regular trading posts, a ton of people were offended by the naïve ""to the moon"" optimism, and some brought up valid negative arguments to the longevity of Bitcoin. They were always met with hard resistance and often blind enthusiasm. When the suicide thread hit the frontpage and people were complaining about professionalism, I had the impression that pessimism was still being suppressed.

Promoting optimism and suppressing negative arguments is the result from **groupthink**. That's a very good way to run a project into the ground (the Challenger catastrophe was caused by groupthink too) with everybody agreeing with each other until the very end. I didn't want this subreddit to overlook important issues with Bitcoin (or its adoption rate) just because we like to see it succeed. The only way out of groupthink is to give voice to people who are against the majority opinion.

So I posted a thread with counterarguments and hoped that others would chime in. I knew that it was counterintuitive, because long-term bears (per definition) didn't believe that Bitcoin would succeed - so why were they even here? But it seems I hit a nerve, and the thread got tons of valuable input. I'm very grateful for all its contributors."
jarwes,raisedbynarcissists,1390308394.0,"I agree with the others (singloud and PlebianJay): wait a few days before responding (if you choose to respond).  Overall this is a surprisingly good letter from your father but there are a few things that still concern me.

&gt; however , I want you to know that I never did anything consciously to harm you,

I'm sorry, I have a hard time believing this.   

&gt; In no way I think the three of you are wrong . Now I know I'm a very sick person . I think I require professional help and I promise that I will look for it as soon as my current job allows me

This sounds very promising, it will be interesting to see if he actually does this.  

&gt; It depresses me to realize I wasted the best years of my life, always working for the family and all the efforts and sacrifices i have made in the past, today make no sense whatsoever

This sentence concerns me as there's a bit of a Narc-like whining here about how HIS life is ruined.  Although in other parts he does acknowledge the fact his family's lives are in trouble as well. 

Here's what I would do if I was you:

1) Wait a few days to think it over and then at least reply acknowledging the letter and that overall it was a good letter.  

2) Remain NC until such time as he actually starts seeing professional help.  IF he does this then maybe you can consider moving up to LC or whatever feels comfortable to you.

3) At no time let him push any of his problems off on you or another part of your family.  If he does this then go immediately back to NC.

N's are the masters of manipulation so this could be a very good example of that or it could be he finally realizes his problems.  The problem here is the family relationships will never be completely healed even if he is 100% sincere in his quest to get help.  He's got to realize, and accept, this and be able to accept he's not going to be the 'if not to be a hero, as mentioned by X, at least to be a loved and respected person'.  

Good luck and stay strong.  Remember this: if at any time you are not comfortable with his redemption (for lack of a better word) attempts then you can go back to NC (if you decide to resume contact at all) at any time.  You're in control now, not him.  

I hope this was helpful and sorry for the wall of text.

If you don't, there could be conflict between you two eventually. Decide who does what chores, how bills will be paid, etc. I've seen friendships go sour because the lack of rules.

* Make sure your bills are paid on time. Also, don't let your roommate off by saying they can't pay their part of the bills this month. For me personally it's ok for you to cover him/her for a month or 2 because people go through hard times, but don't let it become a habit.

* If you're low on cash, work extra shifts if you have to or cut down on spending on unneeded things.

TL; DR: set up rules between your roommate and yourself, don't get behind on bill's, and don't spend too much money on things you don't need."

GeoffreyArnold,short,1390309625.0,"&gt;Truth is subjective.

Truth is actually objective, but we often cannot discern it when we encounter it.  But, there is a difference between those assertions with are evidence based and those who are not, but are said to make us ""feel good"".

&gt; So what? I don't care about these things....That's how I want to feel about being short. 

Have you ever examined why you feel that way about being gay and being an immigrant, but not about being short?  Don't you find that a little bit odd?  Surely you would agree that being gay and being an immigrant can produce at least as many social hardships as being short, right?  So why the focus on height?

May I propose to you that the difference is because these other things are at least somewhat being addressed in the mainstream?  But, not only is heightism not being addressed; it is actively encouraged by most of society.  That's why you feel uneasy about ""being short"" (read: heightism) but not about ""being gay"" (read: homophobia).  

&gt;Do you want to wallow in misery and call it the truth?

This doesn't seem like ""misery"" to me.  

&gt; I don't think it's fair to try to bring others down. 

Me either.  But in most cases, we are all already ""down here"".  It's just that some of us have on blindfolds and other of us have our eyes wide open.  Is it rude of me to loosen a man's blindfold so that he may see that which is in front of him?

Gonji89,DnD,1390309639.0,"My greatest moment was with my first D&amp;D character ever. I had a Changeling rogue and a few sessions earlier I found a pair of supple leather boots. When our Wizard did an Arcana check on them we found out that they were ""imbued with some sort of magic"" but we had no idea what they did. All the DM told me was that they had the activation phrase ""It's time for plan B"". I learned later in an encounter that when I said ""It's time for plan B"" I teleported. All the part knew was ""You see a flash of light and he is gone. All that remains are the smoking boots"" they thought that I had exploded until I showed up a few minutes later barefooted. Apparently, they teleport you one level up inside a structure. So a few hours later we're in this huge fight with some skeletons and a necromancer and in the center of the room was a portal to the Shadowfell. If anyone got within a square of the portal they got grabbed by a tentacle and had to make a saving throw. If they succeeded, they got away. If they failed, they died. Instantly. Of course I get knocked into one of the tentacles. Then, as you do, I failed my saving throw. The DM said, ""Your character gets pulled into the Shadowfell. You are dead."" We all just sat there for a second with somber expressions before I glanced at his hand as he was removing my mini from the board and said, ""It's time for plan B"". Everything stops. You could hear the clock ticking on the wall for a second before laughter erupts from everyone at the table, including the DM. He put my mini back on the table and said, ""You see a flash of light and he is gone. All that remains are the smoking boots, which are pulled into the portal by the tentacles."" So, bare feet slapping the floor, I run back to the party and promptly get knocked back into the portal and killed.  

Edit: TL;DR I got some awesome boots that saved my character's life at the perfect moment."

Kalfira,trees,1390309968.0,"Some backstory. I come from an upper middleclass family. I went to college for a few years and dropped out for a girl (stupid I know but not the subject of my comment). Some years later after hard work and learning outside of work I found a job, and worked my way up the ranks to where I make a decent income now.

I don't mean to say your situation isn't bad. Nor do I mean to say you are ""lazy"" or ""not looking for a job"" because that's just patently untrue. But that's the way the world has been, forever. The ""middle class"" is an invention of the baby boomers. There was no middle class pre-1920's. There was the have's, and the have nots. Landowners, and landworkers.

I don't mean to say that you are screwed, or that there isn't such at thing as a middle class. But that compaired to the entirety of human history the window in which the majority of the population lived ""comfortably"" is less than 100 years old. 

You shouldn't expect and easy life. You shouldn't expect things to go well for you. You should expect resistance, back stabbing, and companies trying to abuse you every chance they get. Because that is the way of the world. 

To put it in perspective, during the Great Depression, people were literally starving to death by the truckload. But today only something like 1 in 6 struggle with ""hunger"" and that isn't even dying of starvation! 

I don't say any of this to invalidate your opinions or feelings, but to highlight how far we have come in so short a time. If you told someone in the 1920's that you and I could be talking, on a forum, viewed by hundreds of millions of people, all over the world they would think you were a loon. 

Life for humanity now, is better than it ever has before. Individual circumstance not withstanding. I know how it is to live on nothing but ramen. I KNOW what it's like to put ketchup on ramen noodles because you had ""chicken"" flavored 10 times this week and you are sick of it. So I fully understand how hard and how hopeless it can feel when you are in a tight spot. 

But understand, it can get better. And while this is a personal ""belief"" if you put for the effort, it WILL get better. Keep strong man, keep a positive attitude, work hard, and it'll be ok. Trust me, i'm from the internet!"

squeechme,AskReddit,1390310119.0,"When I was 10 or 11 years old, I remember going to school on a particular Friday. Of course, when I left the house in my school uniform that morning, I didn't yet know that it was to be a particular Friday.

My mum drops me off a few feet along from the end of the school drive, which was then a one minute walk through the gate to the actual school. I get out of the car, merrily plodding towards the gate. However, something doesn't feel right. I'm used to seeing more of a red colour in my peripheral vision. There's lots of kids walking from all directions but headed for the gate, but with one difference…

It's a non-uniform day.

Fuck.

I looked wildly around at the road, but my mum's car had already disappeared. My face fell, and on I walked towards school. Upon reaching the playground, I found my group of friends. I was a bit embarrassed but my friends were all like ""oh well!"" so I didn't mind too much. Until I noticed a group of parents standing not 4 feet away from me. ""Oh thank god, it's usually my kid that forgets."" ""Haha yeah feels good doesn't it?""

In my years of growth I have since realised that these ""grown ups"" were chavs, but back then it still hurt to have adults talk like that so obviously about me.

I didn't tell anyone what I heard. I cried in class, telling my teacher I was ill and had a really bad headache. Obviously she knew that I just didn't want to be there in uniform so she sent me to the receptionist, who called my mum and asked her to bring me a change of clothes.

20 minutes of me crying later, my mum arrives with my FAVOURITE clothes and gives me a big hug, a kiss on the forehead and the receptionist smiles, telling me to get changed then get back to class. So I felt ok after that. :)

I told my mum later about the grown-ups and she told me that I should have told them that I could hear them, and told me to make sure to do that if it happens again. I wish now that I had said something - maybe it would have taught them a small, but important lesson. Or, most likely, maybe they would have learned nothing at all and taken their meanness further to naive little me. But still, I know that one day I have to warn whatever sons or daughters I may have that people can be mean like that, and not to always trust grown-ups like that."

JaminSousaphone,unitedkingdom,1390310413.0,"Anelka made a salute which is heavily known as being the Quinelle salute which is an anti-Jewish type salute, something to do with the opposite of the nazi salute. (Which ironically was taken from the Americans, they just don't do that anymore) 

The controversy was the fact that clearly someone somewhere did see it and got pissed off, BUT the majority of West Bromwich as far as I am aware is not heavily Jewish, therefore they won't know/care what he did. 

This is the point... No one in the UK knew what it was, it's a French thing by some ""comedian"" who's apparently just racist. BUT he needs to be punished as given the fact we don't all know in the UK what that gesture meant, you don't want kids running around doing that as they celebrate (because we all know kids want to grow up to be Anelka)

THEN Zoopla, their sponsorship are saying they're pulling out as the co-owner is Jewish so obviously he's upset by the gesture. The funny thing about that is Zoopla wanted them to not play Anelka or sell him. (I am anti-racist as the next guy, but come on they have no right to tell a football club who to play and who not to play, even over something like this)

So yeah, Anelka is getting a slap on the wrist. WBA are losing their 3million pound sponsorship and this story is going to be in the papers for another 3-4 days until something happens in next weekends games and we all forget this ever happened. "

In the original post it even says 2.1% of men reported vaginal rape last year. That number appears to be for total men rather than total men who have been harmed by women. I don't know if that number includes child sexual abuse or statutory rape but, if so, those would likely increase the number.

Brightt,DebateReligion,1390310449.0,"&gt; There's nothing you love in life that can be insulted to the point that you are driven to violence, so there's no way to compare it for you.

No, because I choose not to let anything insulting drive me to violence.

Let me make a comparison for you. It is virtually impossible for anyone to insult me or hurt my feelings, because I simply don't give a shit. Go at it all you want, your opinion doesn't concern me.

The only person in the world that could say something that would truly hurt me is my SO, because she is the most important thing to me in the world. If she says something hurtful, it's actually something I care about. If she would humiliate me in front of my friends, I would be devastated, not because my friends think differently of me, but because *she* was the one that humiliated me.

*But*, that doesn't mean that if someone insults my SO, I will suddenly be driven to violence. There have been plenty of occasions where my friends made fun of her for something she did/said or just for laughs. There have even been occasions that random people I didn't know insulted her. I don't get mad, because who gives a shit what other people think? I'm not going to get all up in their face over it. I might insult them back, jokingly, but I'll never get violent over something as petty as an insult. And the fact that some people actually can shows how weak they are on a mental level."

duckface08,AskWomen,1390310738.0,"I'm only 25, so I'm not done my 20's yet, but here are a few thoughts.

Is there really some sort of list out there that says ""You should accomplish these by the time you're 30""? If there is, I'm unaware of it. All my friends who are in their 20's are at different points in their lives. Some already have children, while others (like me) are single. Some friends are still in school, trying to figure out what they want to do, while others are working full-time and finding ways to advance their careers. Hell, I'm working but I *still* question what I want to do. I certainly don't want to stay where I am right now for the rest of my life.

I once read a Huffington Post article that talks about the current generation growing up right now. While I take Huffington Post articles with a grain of salt, it had a few interesting points. One of them was that we live in an era where much of our lives gets posted on social media for our friends to see, such as Facebook, but we get to *choose* what we put there. Most people choose to put only their accomplishments and the good things, while not posting anything negative in their lives.

For example, yeah, my friend had an awesome time working with impoverished kids in Africa for a year, but what she didn't talk about on Facebook was the bad infection she got in her leg that caused it to balloon in size or how she missed out on certain things back home with her family. Or my friend who got married last year? Her wedding was freaking gorgeous and a lot of fun and the pictures definitely show it, but the stress she went through to get that wedding was heavy and it nearly broke a friendship or two.

Me? I have a good job but I love to travel and plan on doing much more of it. This means that, financially, I have to cut corners elsewhere in my life. I live in a small apartment with cheap furniture. I wear the same clothes until there are holes in them (at which point, they become lounge wear at home). Some of my friends tell me, ""You're so lucky you get to travel! I could never do that."" But at the same time, they're far ahead of me in other things in life - like, they have bought their own houses or have gotten married and started families or are working on their Master's degrees - and I point that out to them.

Still, I am happy and that's all that matters to me. I think you have to look at your life and ask yourself what you want from it. For me, as I said before, I like to travel and see the world. I like being independent. I like having a cat as a companion. I don't care about getting married or having kids. I don't really care much for material possessions, to an extent, and I'm not concerned about buying a house in the near future.

Don't look at what society expects you to want or have. What do *you* want out of life?"

crankypants15,AskMen,1390310789.0,"&gt;  She (wife) is not upset at our lack of sex. But to me its causing me to become depressed, and angry.

Some possibilities: 

1. Your wife does not care about your needs. This does not look good. After 13 weeks her hormones should be getting back into shape. This does not sound typical. 
2. She's very upset about how her body changed and hates her own body. Couple that with a low sex drive to begin with (which is what it sounds like) and you have trouble. 

&gt; I always heard that the older women had higher sex drives, in my case this is the furthest from the truth.

Their sex drives starts around age 40 on average. Don't assume this will get better. You should evaluate your wife's problem-solving skills. If she doesn't care about you, she will not care about solving the problem. 
This is why we have divorce.

Dad's meeting with the surgeon yesterday went well. He needs to get it done soon, but not urgently. So that's good. They are also very confident they can repair the existing valve instead of replacing it, which eliminates a whole slew of post-surgery complication potential (rejection, clotting, etc). It's still a full-on chest-cracking open-heart procedure, however, so he's going to be down for quite a while after.

You're the one putting personal details on this. If you have a couple of habits that you prefer to remain confidential, you can go ahead and tell your partner that. But the original point of the discussion was ""how is talking different from pictures"", and then you started the side path of ""how is it not considered a complete breach of privacy to reveal *any* details""--not ""how is it not a breach of privacy if my partner reveals a specific few things that I prefer to keep in confidence"". There are a lot of people out there who just *don't care*. There is genuinely nothing that I care about people knowing about, sexually. And I really don't know why you have stuff you want to be confidential, but that's your personal stuff, not society's burden for everyone to keep a full gag on all the time. It's not the default expectation just because you want it to be. If you care, then just frigging tell your partner not to talk about that stuff, it's not that big of a deal.

The whole time, you keep spinning it to weird stuff and personally accusing me--like, would I dare say these to my partner's face (yeah, I'm sure he's real upset if I tell him again about how I lose track of orgasms last night because I had so many), how can I pretend I wouldn't care about dudes talking about me, etc. Of course I'm going to take it a little personally when you are personally calling me a liar or a hypocrite, heh.

It took me a while to reconcile what is and isn't appropriate with close female friends, especially when one or both are in relationships.  Here is the simple litmus test:  Would you be cool with your (hypothetical) g/f doing these things with someone else while you were dating?  If the answer is no, then it's probably a little innaproppriate.  

That being said it's obviously not black and white.  The simple fact of the matter is though that what can be cool with a best friend of the same sex, might be considered innpropriate with a best friend of the opposite sex.  Handjobs are a good example.  

Just kidding.  But on a serious note, it seems like you are using each other as a pseudo relationship.  Maybe spending a bit more time apart will be good for both of you.  That doesn't mean you won't be there for each other when it's needed. But maybe reeling it in a bit will help clear things up"

fnredditacct,sex,1390311295.0,"I understand your worries about not approaching her directly about this. They aren't exactly unfounded, but I really see no other way.

In fact, it very well could be that all of your attention paid to her reinforces to her that everything is fine.

You laid things out very well here: how you are currently feeling, why this is important, why you haven't said anything so far, exactly what the consequences have been/are.  You know the words to use to express yourself, which is *really* good.

As far as 'how to' have a delicate conversation like this, here are my suggestions:

* Pick a time of day where you know there is space enough to at least start this conversation and it won't be cut short by something else you know needs to happen

* Feel out the moods at that chosen time of day before you begin.  Make sure neither of you are feeling abnormally emotional/sick etc.

* Tell her you really need to talk to her about something important.

* Tell her you love her and some of the things you really appreciate about her and your relationship.

* Tell her what it is about sex with her you like.

* Then tell her what you've said here. 

* If either of you become really upset, back off for a few minutes, and come back to it.

* If she has a hard time understanding why you need what you need, tell her you don't control your needs. You would if you could. (It really helps if you actually mean this.)

* Work together to come up with a plan that you think will meet your needs. *(Do not give into the temptation to plan to make due with the bare minimum* **unless** *there is no other choice. Small, unavoidable conflicts with the plan will continue to leave your needs unmet from time to time and being just barely sated, you'll have less control over yourself and your emotions.)*

*  **DO NOT** consider the conversation over until you have also discussed how to best talk about your sex life in the future. You want to make sure her needs, as well as your own are being met, and perhaps explore new avenues. Ask her how she wants to be approached to talk about sex. Tell her how you want to be approached

* It is *completely* okay if this is all too much for one sitting. If possible, try to get up and move around, (like go for  a walk). I find this makes me think better through conflict and it's easier to talk without sitting right there looking each other in the face watching every tiny micro expression. Gives time to process, and reply carefully.

* If things become too much, and you guys have to stop talking before getting to any kind of resolution point, **don't** push it. But **do** plan to come back to the conversation, and soon. Later that day, or next day. Don't let it fester.

Feminists didn't use some kind of pervasive powers to block those courses. The people who planned to teach these courses are unqualified bigots. I'm surprised the university managed to get as far as it did without vetting them. 

If the people here truly want to get the MRM off the ground, they need to get honest with themselves about the level of discourse. Maybe it feels better to think that feminists are out to destroy the cause, but feminists needn't bother. Any movement whose primary publication is AVfM isn't going anywhere.

revolut1onname,TheRedLion,1390311697.0,"Can't blame you, yours sounds excellent!

I'm going to make this again this week, though - 

**Butternut squash and chilli soup.**

Take a large squash, top and tail it, slice it in half lengthways, and scoop out the seeds. Put peppercorns, salt, garlic, cumin, a chopped chilli, and some oil into your mortar and pestle, give it a bit of a grind, then dollop that over the flesh of the squash. Roast at about 180C until the flesh is soft enough to be scooped out with a spoon. This can take up to an hour, and some parts will soften slower than others, so patience is key.

As the squash approaches the time you'll remove it from the oven, soften onions and a red pepper in a pan, before adding the softened squash, and add some stock (vegetable or chicken, your choice). Add another chilli (if you so desire), season to taste, then blend it in the pan. I add a little chilli powder at the end, just to give it a little more strength, but this isn't essential.

I use standard red chillis for this, but you can use stronger ones if you like. I attempted a scotch bonnet one time, and hugely regretted it.

It keeps well, and makes several portions."
ScubaSteeeve,dynastywarriors,1390311699.0,"8 is great, and I have few complaints about it. I'm going to open with those for the sake of contrast.

* The maps, particularly of Chibi, feel less epic and open than they did in 7 and certainly much less than in 6.
* There are a few maps that get reused in cases where two completely different areas are supposed to be represented, which has been an issue in every DW game except 3 (and hidden well in 5). For instance, Guangling (an area in the far eastern border between Wu and Wei) is the same exact map as a battle that takes place between Jin and Shu in the far west. This doesn't happen a lot, though; most places have their own unique map.
* Certain characters get a disproportionate amount of screen time, then suddenly stop showing up with no explanation, while others barely show up at all. (Unlike 7, though, everyone shows up in Story Mode, though some characters are only playable in one branch or the other.)
* Ambition mode starts to feel really stale after a while, particularly since there aren't any event stages or character interaction moments like there were in Conquest Mode in 7.
* There are no voices for the narration or camp dialogue in English. Apparently, they had to save money on English VAs.

Now, all that being said, 8 is the most enjoyable game in the series since 5 for me and even surpasses it in just about every way. If you limit yourself to only using EX weapons for your character's main weapon (which gives you their EX attacks anyway), then each character plays differently. Every character in the game has their own unique weapon; Sima Zhao, Cao Cao, Sun Quan, and Sun Jian all have a different type of sword now, each with its own moveset.

The hypothetical story paths are great. I never want to go back to vanilla ""let's just follow history 100% and lose out on Sun Ce, Dian Wei, Pang Tong, and other awesome characters before we get a chance to use them"" story modes anymore. I wish they were a little more varied (to get Wu's, you have to save both X and Y, but what if you only saved one?), but I'd definitely rather have them than not.

Having also played Xtreme Legends (in Japanese), I highly recommend it. In addition to new, one-shot hypothetical battles for every faction, Lu bu gets his own awesome story mode, there are some serious immersion upgrades (archers will switch to swords at close range, your horse turns realistically, etc.), and the new cast additions are great."

I wrote about that some months ago.

Kofi grew up in Boston, like Cena. Just wait for a show in Boston, then have Kofi turn on Cena. Like, backstab him in a tag match. Beat him up with a chair or something, leave him laying in the ring. Then have Kofi pick up a mike and cut a an angry-bitter promo about how he's tired of having to pretend he's from somewhere else because Cena wants to hog the spotlight and Boston fans don't want to recognize Kofi as a Bostonian. Basically, have Kofi rip on Cena &amp; Boston. ""Cena and you people make me ashamed to have grown up here. You all make me sick. This is who you want representing you? Here's what I think about that"" Then have Kofi keep on beating Cena after the promo.

will you regret this later in life? hard to tell. most people do end up with regrets about things they did or did not do. i've talked to some men who regret having gone through a ""slut phase"" as well as men who regret not having done so. the main point is this, there will always be things you will regret having done or having not done. accept it and try to be the best person you can be."

They manipulate the companies they run for personal enrichment, frequently to the detriment of their own companies. This leads to outcomes like the financial crisis. The difficulty is proving that their motivations were not aligned with the best interest of the companies- because if they made a mistake, that isn't fraud; however if they intentionally damaged their own companies, that is fraud, as they have legal obligations (fiduciary duty) to genuinely attempt to make their companies money.

&gt;""well, I wont be making as much money as these guys, so I might as well pretend like money doesn't matter so much to me.""

Who's pretending money doesn't matter to them? Money matters. I don't earn a lot of money, and its very apparent money matters! That being said I don't really want to be rich, I just want to earn enough to live comfortably and also be able to save.

To put this maybe more bluntly: look at Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs. Which of those things can you buy? Only the basic few needs can be bought.

According to [this](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/07-08/money.aspx), after surveying 165 households earning $25M or more, people very often responded that their highest aspiration was *to be a good parent*. In my opinion, consumerism and materialism is just a detour from my actual goals in life, and these people aren't disagreeing with me.

I'm fine with competitions and competitiveness, even if they're really pointless, but I believe the consumerist competition you're talking about is actively harmful to society and the environment, and often to the participants! I think you should accept that you've lost(because everyone has except Bill Gates and Saudi Princes and Russian Oil Oligarchs...) and just reject the competition altogether.

Again in my opinion, *stuff* has really diminishing returns. I have a 5 year old maybe 22in LCD TV, but honestly it fits all my needs. If I went out and got a new one it'd be really cool for a week probably, but I imagine after that it'd just become the new normal and it would no longer bring me any joy. So why go out and spend money on something which will bring me only a relatively small increase in happiness in the long term?

As a side note:

&gt;but I can tell that it frustrates him when I don't give him the attention he wants.

That should tell you how satisfying winning this competition really is! They only win if you think they won."

I just would have done it differently, I didn't think they portrayed the older sister in a sympathetic light at all growing up, and their parents dying was *so forced*, what a cheap way to force emotion on us.. I mean, they could have added a minute or two to the whole ""growing up"" sequence and made it as good as the beginning of UP, instead they rushed through it and I had no emotional connection other than ""wow that's shitty, Anna has an awful life.. cool"". And all of the ""twists"" later on could be seen from a mile away (IMO Hans probably should have been a good guy and Anna have to choose between a good guy that fits her and a good guy that doesn't instead of him basically being the villain of the story). 

A lot of the music, while good, seemed forced.. like they had a script then tried to shoehorn it into a musical format. The animation was splendid, they did some really good things with just about everything in the film. 

I'll give it another chance on Blu Ray but I just.. wasn't blown away by it in theaters. My kid absolutely adores it, she sings the songs nonstop. My wife and I aren't fans.

Sub class does not limit the PAs or Techniques you can use in any way as compared to main class. BR/FO would be able to use all Techniques.

The boots in OPs photo are just classic uggs in mini, short, and tall styles, nothing fancy. Those are the ones that are so wildly popular.

As far as brand name vs offbrand -- idk. I've had off brand ugg-style slippers and haven't been impressed because of the synthetic sheepskin issue. The insoles and inner lining wears out super quickly and you're left with no cushion, and the fur gets all clumped up. I might just be picky, but the soft cushion of Uggs is a big draw for me. 

There are a few companies (Emu, Minnetonka) that make plain, genuine sheepskin ugg-style boots, but they're similar in cost to classic Uggs, like Emu's [Paterson Lo](http://www.emuaustralia.com/store/women/footwear/paterson-lo.html), their version of Ugg Classic Short for $169. 

You won't find genuine sheepskin for $19.

* Commonwealth and restoration (Charles I, Oliver Cromwell, Charles II)

* Industrial Revolution (in Britain)

If you actually believe gender roles are about people ""telling"" women they should do certain things, you don't really have any idea what you're talking about. Obviously the disproportionate number of women in nursing is an indication that societal pressures put them there. Or do you think women have magnets in our bellybuttons that draw us to hospitals"

They use a much heavier paper stock than your typical drugstore notebook and better inks. The curved corners are surprisingly good at deflecting fraying &amp; splitting like you'd get with even light pocket usage of square-cornered notebooks. There's no spiral binding to get crushed, and no glued binding to break. You can open it completely flat. They're thin enough to be flexible in your back pocket (and are the perfect size to fit in that pocket), yet they can take a beating.

Last year, one of their premium editions was made with waterproof paper &amp; cover. They subjected it to a [barrage of tests](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/expedition/) and it held up pretty well.

It's not for everyone, and it's definitely a ""premium"" experience, but if you pick one up and get your hands on it, there is a very tangible difference in the quality of design &amp; materials. They're 100% designed &amp; produced in the USA, if that matters to you.

nevertruly,AskWomen,1390312391.0,"It depends a lot on when/where I am, but when out in public alone or at a bar/nightclub alone, maybe 60-70% creepy not counting cat callers. If we include cat calls as just really, really bad approaches, it would be a lot higher. By creepy, I mean touching me inappropriately, being sexual towards me inappropriately, pulling out their penis/trying to rub their genitals on me/making crude motions with their hips, hands, or lips to simulate sex acts, being extremely personal/getting into my personal space, purposefully blocking my ability to walk away, disrespecting my stated preferences (""I'll walk with you."" ""I'd rather that you didn't."" ""Free sidewalk. I'll walk with you anyway."" then creeping on my space trying to talk to me until he gets angry that I am not responding), getting rude/aggressive when I indicate that I am not interested or don't want to give my phone number, and things like that. I do not mean that someone was simply unattractive or even truly ugly. I have had old, fragrant, homeless guys hit on me in non-creepy ways and hot guys approach me in creepy ways.

For me:

* Creepy =  prioritizing their own desires over respecting my boundaries and me as a person. Being socially inappropriate towards me be crossing accepted social boundaries of normal privacy and bodily autonomy.

* Non-creepy = isn't pushing an agenda on me or being inappropriately personal or sexual with me, talks to me like a normal person and doesn't try to push my boundaries or force me into anything, treats me like a person with her own thoughts, feelings, choices, and autonomy, and is mature enough to handle it when I let them know that I am not interested."

In any collision there are multiple impacts.  In an aircraft crash there is the impact of the plane hitting the ground, you hitting the inside of the plane (seat, floor, controls, whatever the object is), and your internal organs (biggest concern being the brain) hitting the inside of your body.

The brace position is an attempt to remove, or at least lessen, the second of those impacts: you hitting the inside of the plane.  By placing your body against the seat in front of you, or against your legs (depending on the position used) you are already against the object you are likely to hit and will therefore push against it instead of impacting it."

nohupdotout,Diablo,1390312573.0,"This is actually counter productive. People who complain there aren't enough patches are usually just being somewhat impatient that a change they want isn't done yet. How quickly do you want them to patch? Once a week? They need to time to gather data from testers and find a suitable solution. If they patched every time someone complained on the forums or reddit, they wouldn't be able to do anything else. I agree that the current state of the game needs improvement but over compensating and patching too frequently just to appease the OP type of people is not the answer.

What they really need is to be a little more forthcoming with their design intentions. The official forums are basically in hysterics because of those MVP posts, but not a blue response to calm or inform to be found."

Monday the most loathed day of the week .. heh generalized I know. 

Feminism is a problem for men everyday of the week. I think we need to get rid of it or it needs changed drastically. Top of the list problems for men on monday. Feminist don't solve problems for men.. at all particularly in western cultures. 

One thing good that the MRM has done for men is to give them a place to go and talk about their problems. Which is clearly something feminist have failed at badly. 

Feminism needs to change their static view on socialization theory. Human nature needs be injected into the equation somehow and they should abandon gender sameness group think.

Sure, being drawn and quartered or having your intestines pulled out while you're alive is horrifyingly torturous, but not many countries do that any more.

What this shows (it was a youtube video of a Brit MP looking for the most humane execution method BTW) is that some of the proponents of the death penalty aren't seeking it as a deterrent but as a form of vengeance.

I think wording like ""no Asians"" does the same thing to people's self esteem that ""no one over 35"", ""no one under 40"", ""no short people"" or ""no bears"", ""no twinks"", ""no women"" or not receiving a response to a message does.

Sure, it can be disparaging seeing a bunch of profiles that exclude you off the bat, but is it not just as disparaging sending out a bunch of messages and receiving no responses or negative responses? I don't see how removing exclusionary language would change anything other than the point when you know you're rejected, and I personally would like to know up front.

Rejection happens to everyone for various reasons, but you have to ask yourself: Are we entitled to feel included in any particular person's sex life? The only people who get hurt by being excluded are people who think the answer is yes."

You need to communicate, make plays and take objectives. Since snowballing a game has become quite the joke, your best bet is to farm up and only ever gank when a kill is guaranteed - afterwards, always try to clean push a lane to the tower and apply pressure. If the enemy botlane lacks reliable escapes, she becomes my main target, in order to get your ADC rolling. Since you play in a very low elo, taking kills and farm is very okay, yet try not to make your mates agressive. Team morale is more important than 5-6 cs.

We had a lot of time to kill, so we went to a restaurant to eat and start getting to know one another. From there, we went to a divey bar for a drink, where an extremely trashed teenager kept us company and told us all about her ex-boyfriend. Eventually we left and went to a nearby park, where we made out until a policeman shooed us out of the park.

All of this was leading up to the midnight showing of  an indie slasher movie I'd originally invited her down to see. We stole kisses through the whole movie and laughed our asses off (it was intentionally funny).

We either place boots on the ground in Pyonyang and reset the switch, causing massive political fallout in both Seoul and Beijing, and a humanitarian problem the likes of which the modern world has never seen or, we attempt a subtler, significantly slower approach that manifests change internally, within NK.

GetOffMyLawn_,cfs,1390313201.0,"Ambien will not fuck up your sleep hygiene, if anything it's going to help you fix your cycle by getting you on a regular sleep schedule. I took it for many years, I still take a quarter dose to fall asleep.

With CFS getting a good night's sleep is one of the best things you can do for yourself. Being dependent on a drug might be a reasonable trade-off for getting your rest.  Since you have depression and migraines an SSRI or SNRI or even a tricyclic may help you in more ways than one since antidepressants prevent migraines and help you sleep (because depression fucks up sleep). I lived on antidepressants for decades, they helped enormously. I've gotten to the point that I don't need them anymore. Getting off them was pretty easy.

I've had insomnia since I was a kid, I have delayed sleep phase which means I can stay up 24 hours without a lot of effort, and falling asleep and staying asleep is major work. I've read umpteen books on sleep and tried just about everything. Ambien is one of the few things that works for me. I used to take lorazepam and that stopped working. Tricyclic antidepressants also worked but the side effects were awful. I also took an SSRI for many years. That helped with the chronic pain of CFS quite a bit, as well as prevented many migraines.

Melatonin doesn't do shit for me either, except make me fuzzy headed for hours. I need real drugs! Having said that other OTC things you can try are valerian or 5-HTP, but don't try the latter if you are taking any sort of antidepressant or you could have a fatal reaction. 

My boyfriend has dual-phase sleep. He sleeps for a few hours, gets up for a couple hours, then goes back to sleep for a few hours. Before the invention of electricity this is how most people slept. The moral of the story is find what's normal for you. Maybe you only need 5 hours, maybe you need 10. With CFS you may need even more, I did. I think I was getting at least 12 early on, now I sleep about 8.

So, basic things I would recommend:

- No caffeine, no stimulants. NONE. If you drink tea or coffee taper off and quit. Even decaf has caffeine it it. While you're tapering off don't have anything past noon (assuming you're getting up at 6 ot 7). Watch out for meds with caffeine, especially migraine meds. Bonus: If you get a migraine and you don't normally have caffeine, then a med with caffeine can help the headache. EDIT: No sodas with caffeine either! They even put caffeine in cream soda nowadays, and root beer. Read labels.

- Get up at the same time every day whether you want to or not. Pick your wake up time and stick with it. Don't nap. You want your body's desire for sleep (sleep pressure) to build up so that hopefully by bedtime you feel sleepy. 

- If you don't sleep don't obsess over it. Get up and go read for a while, or meditate or find some quiet activity to do for an hour then lie down again. Missing one night is usually not a big deal. I used to sleep 1 night out of 5 and worked full time and still functioned somehow. That was before I got CFS but if I miss a night I am okay. It's 2 nights in a row that gets me now. I got a lot of reading done before I found Ambien.

- I've had some luck with some self-hypnosis tapes to help me fall asleep. I was able to dial my ambien dose down from 12.5 to 2.5 and I am planning to get it down to 0 sometime this year. I have also used soothing music. You can find Internet radio stations with sleep music or youtube vids to help you sleep. There's white noise, you can find that on youtube or get apps for it.  I've tried binaural beats and that didn't help. I don't like isochronic tones. But maybe they help you. We're all different. I think the big thing is let yourself relax so you get a little rest.

- Read this book: ""Sleep Right in 5 Nights"" by Perl. Lots of good information on insomnia. The drug section is 20 years old and very dated but all the other info is spot on and very helpful. If you're not sleeping then you have plenty of time to read it. 

- I am guessing you already do most of the sleep hygiene things like dark, quiet room, cool room, no tv in bed, etc... Yeah, those don't work for me either but I still do them. At least I feel calmer and I can at least rest better while lying there not sleeping.

- Check out the book ""Insomniac"" by Greene in particular the chapter on drugs. It's a huge book and I read all of it. The drugs chapter was very informative.

- Jon Kabat-Zinn's book ""Full Catastrophe Living"" has meditation and guided relaxation. I am not sure if it was this book or another book of his where he talks about getting very little sleep because of having very young children, but he spent years with little sleep and managed because of his meditation practice. I find 10 minutes of meditation can be better than a nap.

- I tried light therapy (light box in the morning) to reset my cycle but it didn't really work, and I hate bright light because of my migraines, but your mileage may vary. You can go to cet.org and read up on it and take a quiz to see if it will help you. Light therapy can also help with depression for some people.

Good luck. Insomnia sucks. "

I think that the design itself was severely limiting, it's badly drawn and extremely simplistic to begin with.  A good tattoo artist could have taken that idea and expanded on it, redrawn it, improved it, or at least executed the outline and shading in a way that improved the idea.

But this artist didn't.  The lines are shaky, uneven, and unevenly spaced.  The shading is also extremely simplistic, does nothing to accentuate the shape of the spiral, and doesn't actually seem to have any logic to its placement.

Fortunately the simplicity of the design does mean that it shouldn't be too hard for another artist to improve.  

I recommend not going to this artist again, spending more time on the design of your tattoos, putting more effort into finding a talented artist, and be willing to spend more money on your tattoos.  They are with you forever, don't skimp."

* first, you don't mention how old you are. depending on your age, the guys you are with may only be interested in hooking up and not in going any further.

* you don't mention how soon after meeting that you have sex, but you might try not getting naked until you know your partner better. go on a couple of dates before you take it to the next level.

* you don't say where you are meeting your guys. if it is on Grindr, Jackd, or at the bar, there is an expectation of it being a hook-up instead of a possible relationship.

* final thought, it's possible that you are giving off a vibe that makes you seem needy or desperate, and most men don't want that. 

do you have any close gay friends that you can talk to about this? or a close female friend? you don't want to include a pic (which is not a requirement lol) so we have to take your word for how you look - though if you are getting guys, you are certainly not hideous lol. so ask a friend to give you an honest evaluation. it's very possible that its just the type of guy that you are attracted to."

Combine that with the massive slashing of projects in order to make his pre-campaign promise of having a balanced budget for the 2015 election, it makes people really uneasy.

And given that Herper's been in power since 2006 there's a lot of people who feel like they would like a change.

Then you have the charismatic young Liberal leader Twodeau, who talks to the center and promises a new vision - this is where people may tend to jump ship. Currently he's also taking back voters from the more socialist NDP led by Moocair. The NDP had a great surge in the last election due to poor leadership from the Liberal party and the highly charismatic and respected NDP leader Jack Layton, who has since passed. They even got an anglophone elected in Quebec. (Really? How do you do that?)

As far as getting reamed the next election? Honestly I wouldn't bother projecting a poll forward by a year. Doing so will just lead to partisan bickering and astroturfing. You can't really tell what's going to happen until the month of the election, and even then it's a bit of a crapshoot.

I have seen HSV-1 outbreaks of genital herpes, and it can be brutal. In fact, HSV-1 on the genitals is typically worse than HSV-2 on the genitals. And cold sores are no walk in the park, either.

Please respect your sex partners enough to let *them* decide *for themselves* if they want to risk kissing or sexual contact with someone who has had cold sores. After all  if they turn you down, according to your own words, you don't want to touch their genitals anyway. But keeping the info to yourself is deceptive and unethical.

The fact that most presidents, CEOs are men, does not mean there is social pressure against women. You might say the competition for these executive positions is fierce, and men are just more competitive. One requirement for these positions is a fierce competitiveness. There are some women in these positions, because they get results.

Also recognize that it can make you appear manipulative. You invite her home for some other reason than sex, then start making sexual advances, she could very well feel deceived. 

Now if you're confident that she's interested, by all means, use a socially polite excuse to head to your place. That's pretty standard.

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1390314241.0,"""Dismantling the Patriarchy"" is closely linked to extremist feminists and that phrase just has a bad history. How about if we say instead ""Let's look at people as individuals with skills, not based on their gender, appearance, etc.""?

But what is your final goal? Do you want 50% of all business executives and congress people to be women? 
Is that realistic? 

&gt; Is this line of reasoning valid (as it is implied that dismantling The Patriarchy will eliminate these issues)? If so/not, how?

I think the line of reasoning, as a high-level concept, is a good one. It's the details *with unrealistic goals* that can cause problems. If women just plain don't want to work in executive positions, there will always be a dearth of women there. 
Heck, I like kids, but I don't want my full-time job to be a daycare provider. 
I know it's just not for me. 

I hear the concept of ""equal results"" from some feminists. It's also been mentioned under racial equality. Example: black people get extra points, just for their skin color, when applying for college in an effort to get more black people into college. Do I want unqualified women forced into executive positions under the idea of ""equal results""? No. Do I want unqualified men forced into daycare positions taking care of my kid? No. That's not realistic. 

Would I hire a woman who is qualified for a certain position? Yes! And if that women is  a sales person, and happens to earn 12 monthly ""top sales person"" awards in a row, she will get them *because she earned them.*
Would it really be fair to stop giving her awards after 6 months for the concept of ""equal results""? Should I give the next 6 awards to a man who wasn't the top sales person?

I read I think a grand total of two stories for fun in the whole two years I did that course, and both of them were short enough to get through in a day (Catcher in the Rye, and Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption) and I haven't read anything since.
