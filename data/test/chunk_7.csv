brikachuu,AskWomen,1388796952.0,"Women as a group are no more or less capable of love than men.

Also, it's from /r/theredpill. Enough said.

&gt; For instance, men are disposable. When we commit to a woman, we are basically saying you and I are now a team. I am willing to take bullets for you. I will be the last off a sinking ship. I will fight wars for you. I will pay for you. I will do everything in my life dedicated to you and our child.

Maybe the individual poster (and other men) share that sentiment. Not all men do.

&gt;Women, generally do not have that kind of love for their man. She may care for him a lot, and genuinely feel connected, but she will never have the same type of love we are capable of. She may think she has it, when she's knee deep in lust and infatuation, but she has no problem swinging branches when something better willing to commit comes around. 

Where does this statement come from? What grounds does this poster have to make these sweeping generalizations? Maybe the women this poster has encountered are as fickle as he supposes. But it's foolish to generalize a whole gender based on those experiences. 

&gt;Men tend to stick by their women through thick and thin, just as long as he can trust her and she fulfills her duties as the wife of the man willing to die for her. But for women, she's willing to leave just as long as the relationship hits the rocks and a guy who is objectively better in every way comes offering her more. For instance, say some stud Hollywood actor came around that you felt a genuinely lustfully infatuated with. You think he also cares for you a lot, and now have the potential to have a wealthy life, with a fun guy connect with, and travel the world! Many women, regardless of what they admit, will be willing to do this. It happens on a daily basis it's almost sickening. Men on the other hand, presented with a similar opportunity are a lot less likely to go branch swinging. 

Honestly sounds like a guy who's bitter about one or more women in his life leaving him. I know men who would ""trade up"" for Jennifer Lawrence/Kate Upton/whoever in a heartbeat. And women who wouldn't bat an eye at Benedict Cumberwhatsit or any other guy while they are in a committed relationship. It's a matter of individual character, not gender.

&gt;They don't want to ruin the relationship with the girl whom they've dedicated their mortality to. There is a reason 75% of divorces are initiated by women. When men divorce, it's generally not because he thinks he can branch swing over something better, but because she's failed to fulfill her role as the wife. She stops caring about him, get's selfish, gains weight, and just generally is no longer his wife.

Pure (and sexist) speculation. Plenty of men and women initiate divorce for other reasons. Also, lol @ gaining weight falling under ""failing to fulfill her role as the wife.""

Honestly, this whole comment is just a misogynistic rant that makes broad claims about the essential nature of men and women just based on the poster's own speculation. I'm going to have to see evidence when someone throws out such strong statements like ""women are incapable of love."" Bullshit."

karlmoebius,bestof,1388797225.0,"But, honestly, that's an issue of self-confidence and codependent behavior, with a possible side of white knight behavior (it can slide that way, you have to admit). That's something that should be worked through with the help of a councilor, since the behavior is self-perpetuating. 

Worse still, it's hard to have a diagnosis on the behavior. Often failed relationships polarize friends that would otherwise point things out, and polarize personal viewpoints, which taint objective self diagnosis.

So why use TheRedPill? Adulthood is entirely about self confidence and personal responsibility, and the understanding where personal limits have to be. The described behavior is indicative of the inability to state and keep boundaries, which, again, is a function of poor self esteem and codependent behavior. It would be better served taking it to another subreddit and plainly stating the data points of observed self behavior, and the expressed reasons why, as well as feelings stemming from other actions and behaviors in the relationship, and how they correlated with previous relationships.

See why I don't think TheRedPill is of any use to anyone for relationship help? It would be better served with honest self examination before seeking frank and objective third party diagnosis. TheRedPill struck me as an very poor gaslighting/echo chamber, and people that need mental help need to see a professional, because it is a mental problem that cannot be solved overnight."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388797368.0,"&gt;However, I think a big part of it is that women experience this discrimination on a personal level, in a wide spread way. It's hard to really highlight patriarchy in specific definitive way, because many people experience the personal discrimination and then trace to the patterns in our society and how that influences people to act this way. I think another important aspect is that patriarchy isn't this intentional organized thing, but rather is a tendency of our society that favors men that perpetuates itself unless you very specifically recognize it.

Humans are pattern making animals.  If I tell you that any individual experience is part of a larger interconnected pattern, and that this pattern is significant, and you buy into what I'm saying enough you will begin to see the pattern, and will begin to have experiences that confirm the existence of the pattern.  It's equal parts conspiracy theory, self-fulfilling prophecy, and confirmation bias.

The reason why you have to teach people how to see patriarchy is because it only comes into existence when you start looking for it.  Faith makes it real, and the stronger your faith, the more real it becomes.

&gt;And many guys subscribe to this philosophy.

And many guys don't.  And many girls believe stupid shit. And many people are dumb and mean and insensitive.

&gt;There are several characters in media that are like this, like quagmire in family guy or Barney is how I met your mother. You don't think this encourages people to act like this?

...no, I think those characters are mocking people who act like that, because we live in a society that condemns that kind of behavior.

&gt;Through feminism we're slowly doing away the patriarchal idea that men get to handle the money and women exist to take care of the babies that's remained from the previous centuries. 

Wow, see, there is so much *spin* on these sort of statements.  It reduces history to the Victorian upper and middle class, it presumes motive, it ignores that household finances have always been women's domain and typically account for the majority of a family's spending.  I mean 80% of all spending is done by women, but women don't control the money?  It's such a gross oversimplification of the real roles that women played in history, the real way economies work, and how wealth is actually created and enjoyed.

&gt;Why do you think there would even be a need for feminism to empower women to do these jobs if there wasn't a social patriarchy that discourages women from a young age to do these jobs in the first place?

Because the natural state of people is lethargy and inaction.  Women were once hobbled, now they are not. But removing chains doesn't make you run.  You have to want to run.

We motivate boys to run by making it clear that if they don't run they will be treated like worthless sacks of crap and will never have money, a family, or the respect of their society.  We motivate girls by telling them they are great no matter what, even if they fail.  Women don't run because they aren't terrified of standing still.

&gt;Patriarchy didn't just go away when women received equal legal rights

---

To the second part of your question, it's a FANTASTIC question. The standard pay for a legionary under Caesar was 900 *sesterces* (Standard unit of pay in Rome) per year. A *primus pilus* would recieve a pay of a staggering 100,000 *sesterces* per year - which was the average value of a small farm (According to Pliny). However, even that number is pretty insignificant if you look at the price of nice houses in Rome - the price of a large estate in Italy (Not in the city of Rome) was ~3 million *sesterces* - which would have been completely out of the price range of a *primus pilus*. However, an intelligent and thrifty *primus pilus* could have made it into the equestrian class (Under Augustus, the property requirement was 400,000 *sesterces*). So! From these numbers, we can assume one of these things:

1. Lucius was REALLY bad with money and squandered it all on pointless things. Honestly, this doesn't exactly seem like something he would do. Maybe his wife ;)

2. The show took into account that he may have just been saving his money or investing it somewhere mysterious. ~~Needless to say, we never learn what this mysterious investment is.~~ As /u/lee1026 noted, the show claims that he channeled all of his money into slaves, who promptly died of a plague. Pretty poor idea to throw all the money you have at that one chance of money, but...plausible. 

3. He was staying in a nicer *insula*. I *personally* haven't found any sources that discuss nicer *insulae* or exactly what a person would have in those homes (Though I could see more than just one room), but that certainly doesn't mean that they didn't exist :) We DO know that there were several higher-class Romans who were forced to live in *insulae* due to comparative poverty. Not only that, but the vast, VAST majority of the Roman population lived in these tenements (90-95%+) - including artisans of all kinds (Doctors, sculptors, painters, freed slaves, bakers...you get the idea).  

4. The creators of *Rome* had no bloody clue how much a *primus pilus* would make. Considering that he's forced to scrape around for work after he gets home...I think this one is most likely the case. 

In conclusion, it's quite possible that Lucius would live in an *insula*, as the prices on the nice houses would just be absolutely insane. However, his poverty is a bit silly. "

In Al Anon, we talk about how you didn't cause the addiction, you can't control it, and you can't cure it.  What you can do is learn how to look after and protect yourself, which tends to be the first thing that disappears when you're in a relationship with an addict or alcoholic.  They are focused on drinking, you get focused on them because of the constant chaos, and that means that there's no one left to focus on you and make sure that your needs get met.

Please join us on the subreddit, and maybe even consider cross-posting this.  We have a number of members with solid advice and experience, and it's a really supportive community.

Finally, I am a smart woman with multiple graduate degrees and an amazing academic record.  I felt so dumb and ashamed when I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with a mentally ill and probably alcoholic husband.  I felt like I should be able to handle the situation, and I was angry with myself for letting myself be treated like crap.

You just went off on a totally other topic that wasn't even being discussed with this. 

Regardless of what Steve Munisteri says their platform literally says:

""Knowledge-Based Education – We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.""

You can call it what you want but when the term ""critical thinking skills"" is specifically used it is being targeted. If it wasn't it wouldn't be named in their platform. Specifically writing that you are against a certain topic or object and then turning around and saying ""well that isn't what I meant"" is absurd and laughable. 

You keep trying to say that these groups aren't anti-science because they just go after a few groups of the study including evolution and AGW. That is absurd. First of all they don't just target evolution and AGW but also vaccines, various medical applications. They cherry pick scientific practices that directly challenge their personal beliefs and keep the ones that make their lives convenient. The science world is interconnected and isn't something that can be taken or taught piecemeal. If we are going to teach children about DNA, genetic mutations, natural selection, etc. etc. etc. the teachings of evolution are going to be part of that. So unless we are ok with not teaching children basic biology because some people find it offensive then we have a problem. This is anti-science thinking. When you want the world to stop telling your children about evolution, climate change, vaccines, and the medical world you are anti-science. 

Furthermore, to down play the role that the TBOE plays in national textbook standards is really surprising to hear. Anyone with a fraction of understanding about the topic knows that the size of Texas and the number of books that it orders from publishers is what tends to allow the TBOE to set the standards. Can Rhode Island buy their own books? Yes, but if the publishers have already agreed to publish certain curriculum that the TBOE wants then the smaller states are going to have to find another publisher who will rewrite an entire text for them. The money of large scale purchases is what allows Texas to dominate the curriculum. 

[This is Don McLeroy](http://tfninsider.org/2013/09/18/don-mcleroys-strange-testimony-on-texas-science-textbooks-support-the-bible-and-adopt-these-books/). He is just a gimps of what you'll see on the TBOE. He openly admits that he was attempting to ""strike a blow"" against evolution. He also went after climate change and comes from the same religious community in Texas that [fostered such backlashes against vaccines that it caused an epidemic this last year.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/23/texas-measles-outbreak/2693945/)

To keep arguing that these groups who have clear impacts on our society aren't anti-science because they cherry pick what to attack is really disingenuous. Many of them don't even understand that what they use is linked to what they reject. I know people who avidly reject evolution in every sense of the manner but still get a flu shot every year. "

It's not so much a sense of urgency, but the realisation that although I thought I'd probably have a kid or at least be pregnant by this age (mid 20s), the boyfriend and I aren't even close. I'm not ready, he's not ready, we're not financially stable enough. I'd like to be married before having kids. I want to go back to school, which is going to last a couple of years. Boyfriend wants to spend some time living in the US or Canada. But I know by the time we do all the things we want to do, I'm going to be near enough 30, which seems old. 

But we're enjoying the freedom. No point in rushing things."
Poison1990,unitedkingdom,1388797595.0,"Expensive perhaps, but you can't fight the war on drugs by halves. Either we do it right, or waste so much money on a half arsed attempt. Spend the money now and have a chance of 'winning', or simply spend more in the long run and maximise your chance of failure.

Going to the moon was impractical - but when you have ambitious goals like ridding the world of drug abuse you can't let things like a budget get in the way of success. Otherwise you may aswell not even try.

So the fact that our system at the moment is ""practical"" and ""cheap"" doesn't mean anything because it fails so badly. I'm pointing out the flaw in logic which has made it fail from the very beginning. If you understand how people respond to incentives you can see how a system which makes dealers richer makes no sense at all.

There are established teams that compete in e-sports events, and Counter Logic Gaming (CLG) is one of the oldest. They've fallen on hard times though, and were hoping to revitalize their success with a new player, ""Dexter"" from Europe (CLG is based in North America and until now had only NA players on their squad). 

However, with the start of the season only 2 weeks away, Dexter has run into problems with his Visa. Everyone is quite shocked at this, because it's not unprecedented for a player to compete in a different region, and the USA was believed to be very good about treating esports professionals well in terms of athele visas.

dirfarg,Fitness,1388797670.0,"I appreciate the post but there is a lot missing. Firstly you need to distinguish what kind of alcohol. There's a big difference between drinking 10 shots of vodka everyday to drinking a glass of wine before bed (which might even help hypertrophy and performance through resveratrol). 

&gt;If your hydration input does not match your output when you go to the bathroom, symptoms like muscular fatigue, cramping and decreased performance begin to arise because your body is trying to buffer and hydrate tissues with water that it does not have access to

Great drink some water. And this is acute. The majority of people care about long term hypertrophy and strength. No one is going to be drinking before a meet. And I actually recall reading a study where people who drank before lifting actually saw increases in reps performed (probably because they felt less discomfort close to failure).

&gt;""Alcohol has been shown to be disruptive to the melatonin cycle which in turns negatively impacts the release of HGH. This means your body loses its ability to regenerate healthy tissues efficiently, which includes muscle and connective tissue.""

Not really. HGH secretion has little to do with muscle growth. The whole ""increasing hgh improves hypertrophy"" has no good evidence (and even studies showing no improvement). And if serum test mattered watching porn would help a lot with muscle growth.

Also look at that study, it's looking at **alcoholic** men. 

&gt;Can drinking make you fat? The short answer is yes. The long answer is also yes

More like drinking a lot + eating fatty foods will make you fat. Alcoholics who tend to not eat anything when they're drunk tend to be pretty damn skinny. There are loads of studies that show this.



&gt;though in a limited capacity compared to those who reduce or remove alcohol from their diets

don't agree. You should qualify that statement with if you're an alcoholic or drink copious amounts in a session. A beer or glass of wine every couple of days will not hurt.

The difference in between particles is due the different rates of vibration of these strings. This helps explain the seemingly massive differences in charges, masses and groupings that we see in the smallest particles we can currently identify, bosons, leptons and quarks. It's a simple theory that helps explain the world around us, but there is little to no proof and it is still just a theory.

Bassically,CFB,1388797746.0,"It's a fantastic job because of the money, support, location, winning tradition, and talent level, like everyone's been saying, but there's also a pretty big elephant in the room that might frighten off a certain type of coach: The Longhorn Network.

The Longhorns' head coach will be expected to provide their time for programs on the network. Football is the tentpole that holds the whole thing up; it would be weird if the head coach wasn't on there.

I'm sure that it wasn't intentional when they set it up, but they could have boxed themselves out of a certain coaching personality, specifically the Bill Belichick/Nick Saban/Process and Preparation/Total Focus guys. Coaches that prefer to stick to the X's and O's side of their job might balk at having to do the Longhorn Network obligations *on top of* the other non-football stuff you have to do as a head coach (alumni functions, etc.). As weird as this sounds (and it might actually be a chicken-and-egg debate), Mack Brown may have been the perfect coach for Texas. He's the CEO/politician type who can excel at all that off-field stuff, while still maintaining a decent (if not always overpowering) on-field product. Many college football head coaches simply aren't that comfortable in front of the camera, and they might see the 3-4 hours Mack Brown was spending as cutting too much into their game-prep time (working 76 hours instead of 80 might not sound like too much of a difference to you and me, but it could to a certain type of coach).

All that to say that, yes, the Texas job is tops in the country for a certain type of coach that just happens to be just like the one they just ran out. Other, less outgoing coaching personalities may not see it that way.

Edit: added winning tradition to the list of reasons for it being so highly touted. Being a traditional ""big name"" school is huge, the difference between being a destination job and a stepping stone. Coming from a stepping-stone school that thinks it's a destination job, it does make a huge difference in job prestige and allure."

radeky,RealEstate,1388797913.0,"There are some really important comments being downvoted in here.

$1mil is not a lot of money.  It's really not.  If you were to draw into it for 50 years, you're looking at only $20k a year.

And while Real Estate is a good investment, it should not be your ONLY investment.  Put a large portion of that into the market.  Especially if you are young.

That being said, the ways I would invest it in Real Estate:

You could potentially make some good money buying rental properties and hiring a property management company.  You can go one of two routes.  Either leverage yourself, buy a number of properties with mortgages, use the rents to pay off the mortgages and hope you don't have multiple vacancies.  As a general rule I'd try to ensure that 2 vacancies or 10% vacant (whichever is higher) still nets a positive/neutral cash flow.  You can move those numbers for safer/riskier options.

Or you could buy 2-3 properties outright (depending on your area, I speak for Seattle).  With mortgage rates where they are, you're probably going to experience a higher gain if you utilize them, but you also take on additional risk.

My strategy would be to take $500k and put it in the market, in fairly aggressive mutual funds.  The other $500k I'd put into a house for myself.  The reason my stock portfolio is aggressive is because the real estate is the conservative part of the portfolio."

To hold the item in place some sites advise holding the item in place with a plastic container box filled with sand, to orientate the main piece such that it is held and the part you're glueing onto that main piece is attaching to it horizontally (so gravity does most of the work of holding the broken piece in place) and repeating until complete.

Then using a sharp knife or razor to scrape away excess epoxy.

An epoxy that may be suitable is Araldite. ie. there's one for 'glass and ceramic' (http://www.amazon.co.uk/ARALDITE-RAPID-CERAMIC-GLASSS-ADHESIVE/dp/B000WA7RMM). If you try to glue it with super glue it may just soak into the ceramic and not actually bind the parts together, though you may want to consider going for a costly epoxy that won't go yellow with time (http://www.lakesidepottery.com/Pages/Pottery-tips/PVA-Polyvinyl-Acetate-or-resin-epoxy.htm)

And a hind will sometimes be missed again as well. Don't get me wrong it will usually shoot stuff down but it is by no means even close to 100%.

So in the context of our society, saying you wear makeup to feel pretty doesn't feel like a satisfying answer to me. It'd be like me saying ""I wear clothes because I like them."" Well, yeah, and also because I'm pressured to and would be ostracized if I didn't.

Who do you hang out with? I'm a 23 year old female and I can remember maybe 2 times in my life where I've worn makeup. I've never been called a freak, I can't remember even one time when someone asked me why I didn't wear makeup, and *gasp!* I'm on my second engagement. "
Poison1990,unitedkingdom,1388798295.0,"&gt; the only example we were both able to find where they have a policy roughly akin to the one you are describing

Except it wasn't because Singapore gives out harsher sentences for dealers. In my model, the dealers wouldn't even necessarily get arrested (like users are treated now), but users would take a huge risk. If you say to a user that getting caught with that joint will get you 5 years minimum, but the guy your buying off will will get a year maximum - then it doesn't make much sense to risk it, especially if the guy you're paying will get off scot free. Dealing pays only because they take the risk.

I'm not arguing for super harsh punishments all round (like Singapore), but swapping the balance. Crush the demand, and make dealing less and less profitable until its not worth doing. So long as there is the demand, dealing will always be an easy way to make a lot of money."

If he were wearing a seatbelt, the momentum his body and internal organs have while traveling doesn't change. He's still traveling at the same speed. When he hits the car, the impact is the same, so the stop is just as abrupt. Seat belts give a little before they actually cinch in the belt mechanism and stop, so it's really no different than hitting an airbag. The stop is still abrupt, the forward force is the same, your organs still move forward with the same force and hit your ribs. I think it would be worse, actually, because there's a lot more cushion and flex in an airbag than there is in a belt. You would stop more slowly hitting a bag than you would a belt, which is what would need to happen to prevent this kind of injury."

About thirty seconds from the overload, and forty from the base cap, the bloody VS start swarming out of the rabbit holes and spamming the gen room with smoke grenades, while the TR hurled Galaxies at our armour.  In the last few seconds, as the goddamned cultists swarmed the generator, I lobbed a concussion grenade, fired through the smoke, and took a few heads as they charged inside, straight into the generator's blast.  The base rolled over shortly afterward; between the pinned down squads, the ankle-biting TR, and the last few VS, everyone died but me, so I made out like a bandit.

Kerithlan,pokemontrades,1388798598.0,"I understand and admire the good intentions behind this rule, but honestly it is totally arbitrary because of how easy it is to get around.

All you would need is a small group of two or more people with unscrupulous intentions to totally bypass this. It'd be even easier if they had an already established trade history with others, as it'd shy suspicion away. One or two friends faking to trade via Gen 4/5 makes it very easy to slip a few bugs through the walls.

The problem is that there is no legitimate way to confirm trades beyond word of mouth and reputation/honor, so there's essentially no way to enforce this.

It's not like other rules where it's very easy to go, ""yep nope you can't post that material here,"" but rather its own category where you can bold-face lie in public and have no repercussions.

Why would someone with a good trading reputation do that? The answer is simply, ""because they can."" If someone wants to sweeten a deal then a one or two time pollution of the economy that literally can't be detected or traced is something that might be too alluring to some.

Until that is somehow addressed, it's arbitrary and doesn't actually do much of anything."

citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1388798614.0,"&gt;&gt;Also, an orthodox view of heaven necessitates a belief in Hell

&gt;Orthodox does not mean true. And no, a heaven would not require a hell.

Where did I say orthodox means ""true""? Please point it out. 

Can you point me to an orthodox Christian religion that doesn't have a hell? If not, you're being disingenuous - seems to be a popular tactic for atheists.

&gt;&gt;God is not easy to please

&gt;Assumption

Well, do you disagree that he has tons of rules and requirements, that a lot of them contradict each other, that he is jealous? Do you think he is easy to please? How can anyone's perspective on this *not* be an assumption? I await your answer.

&gt;&gt;so there's a good chance that one would be spending that eternal existence enduring the worst possible tortures.

&gt;Assumption

Correct. So what?

&gt;&gt; no respite from existence

&gt;assuming existence in heaven would be like existence on earth with fatigues.

As I said, these were my thoughts as a youth. I made assumptions. So what? I'm explaining my perspective as a kid, not advancing anything as truth. 

&gt;&gt; I would lie awake every night in immortal terror

&gt;Your terror is immortal? You are in terror to this very day? wow. Your terror will continue after you die. That's potent shit

I meant ""terror of immortality"" not ""forever in terror"". Sorry for the confusion.

&gt;&gt;Thankfully, my perspective on what happens after death is not so fear based anymore.

&gt;That's good man. I'm happy for you. Living in fear is a bad way to live.

Firstly work on yourself, stop working to try and get a relationship. (I know its hard to think that, but its really the better thing to do, coming from experience).

Get better, I recommend therapy and a guy will come to you eventually, you don't seem to have trouble with finding guys, just finding the ""right"" guy.

Your past sounds like it sucked, but you seem to be moving forward which is what you need to do. You'll find someone eventually OP. 

Tell your future boyfriend WHEN the time is right, when you can see they will accept your past and realize you've improved yourself, only then! Otherwise you could startle them and scare them off and even if that happens, well fuck em' you're a strong independent woman now who doesn't need a man.

When my baby was 6 months along and still breastfeeding, I decided to get back to keto cause I loved it so much.  I didn't see much of a decrease in my supply, but I did end up with an absurdly bad case of dry mouth that would not quit!  It would keep me up all night, it was so awful.  And I was drinking tons of water and getting plenty of electrolytes.  

I also randomly got my period for the first time and then promptly had it 2 more times in a month and a half (16 day cycles - wtf!).  When the final period started and the dry mouth was going on a few weeks, I decided that it had to be related to diet, so I started increasing my carb intake. The dry mouth went away almost immediately and the periods haven't come back yet (24 days into cycle).

Or are you literally inventing arguments for me based on things you've heard before?

&gt;  When the US intervenes in gets called an imperialist

No, not always. It didn't in Serbia.

&gt; when we don't, we get called out for sitting on the sidelines.

Like when? Rwanda?

But you've already said you only get involved when it directty affects your commercial interests - then you just ignored the bit where I said you should have the decent to admit that and stop claiming you are doing the rest of the world a favour.

I guess the propaganda just kicked in again huh?

&gt; Again, we underwrite the security of the world and are not always thanked for it.

moonfall,AskFeminists,1388799032.0,"Hey, you're welcome to correct me and tell me I'm wrong! I freely acknowledge that I can't possibly know you at all based on a single line of text. There wasn't much detail added to your question, so I made inferences based upon the type of question it was and the fact that you posted it here asking if what you're doing is ""wrong"" or not. (Which suggested to me that at least part of you was worried that your behavior *could* be problematic in some way and also that you might have already considered the possibility yourself–– otherwise, why would you have posted asking if it was ""wrong"" or not? If you 100% believed it was a peachy or insignificant thing, you wouldn't have sought validation for your choice.)

But anyway, to give an example that contradicts your thoughts on ""many women"": Speaking as a Random Woman myself, when men or anyone else out of the blue speaks to me in public, my usual assumption is that they're bored or just being friendly. The idea of being hit on doesn't even enter the equation in public settings or when I'm out with an S/O or a friend/group of friends because most people typically aren't bold enough to attempt something like that. (I also acknowledge this also might just be a regional thing–– I live in New England, and people approaching others that boldly even within the context of seeking a friendly conversation is very rare and generally discouraged.)

You're free to approach people however you want, obviously, but if it were me I'd wait for more information before assuming that someone I'm approaching to ask for directions is going to think I'm hitting on them, or that their partner is going to get upset because my request for directions was just that saucy. Under different circumstances ––like, say, approaching someone in the dead of night in a sketchy back alley–– it's common sense to make assumptions about what another person may or may not think is a safe or appropriate way to approach someone. But in the context of making a polite request from someone in front of people who are obviously coupled? It doesn't make sense to go out of your way to *not* look like you're hitting on someone; It's odd that the possibility would even enter into the equation at all."

Neither has Laich, but he's been injured for so long it is hard to remember 

&gt;If Laich continues to be injured, he'll be on LTIR, and his cap hit is not an issue.

We'd still be paying his salary (right?) and he has a lot more left than Green 

&gt;All signs point to the cap continuing to increase quickly.  In 2 years, Laich's cap likely won't be much of a burden.

This I can somewhat agree with, but we may need that 4.5 million to re-sign Grabo next year.

sfall,Entrepreneur,1388799296.0,One of the reasons this is done if their are multiple owners from the start one person could walk away from helping with the company early on but can benefit if it makes money or is sold later. This way if you leave early on you walk away without any holdings for the company and you basically set up a pay out schedule of when you outright own your portion. So like as another example showed at less that a year you don't own of the company at 2 years you own x% and at 5 you own y% of your share till it reaches 100% of your share.

If they're extra stubborn bring them in, let them warm up but only just inside the door. Then turn around and drag them back out. It takes consistency of your part but it's better than cleaning up pee all the time. Use lots of treats and/or pats to reward the puppy :) "

MattieShoes,learndota2,1388799402.0,"Learn all of them.  This ain't LoL -- you've got access to all the heroes, and roles and laning are far more flexible.  Many heroes can be run in a farming or support role depending on need (Windrunner, Mirana, Sven, Vengeful Spirit, Dazzle, Shadow Shaman, Sand King, Alchemist, Pugna, Nyx, Tusk, Lina, Invoker, Naga Siren, Batrider...)  Besides, it helps you understand the game. :-)

Heroes, not champions.

Edit: 

Ogre magi is lane support, but not very strong at it if he's paired with another melee hero.  Try to only use him with a ranged lane-mate. Multicasts can be huge later on, and his bloodlust skill is fantastic to cast on everyone.  Seriously, once you have the mana for it, cast that shit on cooldown.  His stun is hero-targeted (rather than ground targeted) which makes him a great setup-guy for heroes with followup stuns like Lina, Leshrac, Mirana, etc.  Picking up activatable items like Urn, Medallion, Eul's scepter, Scythe of Vyse helps keep him relevant in fights.  He's probably the strongest pubber of the three you mentioned, and the weakest at the pro level.  Any time you hit a 4x multicast, you're obligated to be a jackass about it in all-chat.

Chen is support that typically starts in jungle.  He's generally fairly defensive and teamfight oriented with his global heal.  He usually gets mek so he can drop two big heals in a teamfight.  Getting the right creeps from the jungle allows him to be pretty aggressive early though, since a troll net or centaur stomp can net an easy kill.  His send-back ability has the potential to be hugely good or hugely bad.  It's probably the most overlooked in pubs -- it allows a carry to blow through their mana farming, then get sent back, then teleport back out to the action for very little downtime.  Creeps don't scale as the game progresses, so he falls off in the lategame.  He has one of the highest skill caps in the game, with pros doing fantastic, but he generally struggles in pubs with the relative lack of coordination.

Enchantress is a support that starts in the jungle like Chen, but she's more gank-oriented.  Again, rough in pubs, very common pickup in pro games.  Her slow along with a creep stun can make for easy early kills.  She kind of falls off midgame because she's pretty squishy, but if she gets enough farm, she can be pretty damn scary lategame, doing huge damage with big ticket items.

My advice would be to pick Chen/Enchantress when you're playing with friends, but not in random queuing solo games."

mehraaza,changemyview,1388799595.0,"I agree with one of the earlier comments about your original post being a pretty tough wall of text to tackle, but I will try my best to comment and I apologize in advance if I have misinterpreted any of the arguments you have presented.

I work for a non-profit sex ed organisation in Sweden, which means I do not have the full insight in how the different states in the US is handling the matter. To make the differences between Sweden and other countries clear, we here are allowing abortions until the 18th week without being forced to present a reason. The procedure is free all but a patient fee of $30. All women who has an abortion is offered session a with a therapist both in forehand and afterwards.

You are using a lot of old data. The history of the abortion is both one stretching many hundred years back, but the important details has just been worked out the last 50 years. Before it was possible to interrupt a pregnancy by taking a pill, women (and some men) travelled the villages to visit the women who was carrying children they didn't want or couldn't raise, performing abortions using anything from herbs inserted into the vagina or more hands-on operating methods. In bigger cities you could often find rooms where these women and men operated behind curtains at dentists, drug stores or similar places. The development of medicine has saved a lot of lives, not only those of the mothers who dies of illegal abortions or in labour. It's natural that you find a decrease of death in the statistics.

I want to present a more updated resource of statistics for you to use. WHO's report from 2008 can be found here:
http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501118_eng.pdf

First of all, you state that legal abortions aren't safe. As far as ""safe"" is concerned as a word used in medicine, the legalization of abortion has been the reason for the abortions being as safe as they are today. Without being able to develop the procedure in ""the daylight"", we would probably still be using painful methods and not being able to tend to the mental stress in such an effective way as we are today. Since medicine is an ever developing science, forcing the abortions into a dark corner will only hinder any other developments in the field, both for the physical and the mental state.

I find it very interesting that you talk about unsafe abortions rather than illegal abortions - to do so you need to decide what an unsafe abortion is. A restricted abortion law will not only lead to what you refer to as ""back-alley abortions"", but also the legal abortions to be performed in a less safe way. The fact that abortions does not decrease in countries where the law is restricted has a great statistic foundation, so when clinics has to close, when there's less people working with abortions, but most importantly the women, the safety for the same amount of women seeking abortions in a decreasing number of clinics results in a decreased patient safety. There's your unsafe abortions, affecting the women in your immediate surrounding.

But my main argument for you being in need of a change of view: By alienating the women who does have an abortion, you are not only in the worst case scenario forcing her to undergo an illegal procedure, you also neglect her right to get professional counseling. I do not know if you are a woman, or if you have ever been to an abortion clinic or even talked to a woman who has had an abortion, but you do not just swing by, get your fetus removed and then go for a shopping spree. You are getting a lot of information on how to prevent unwanted pregnancies, how to use protection and also information about STDs and other SRHR-related information. With the sexual education system in school being as poor as it is today, this is a very important opportunity to reach out to individuals already experiencing the backside of being sexually active and not taking responsibility.

He did an armdrag on few people, no big deal that I saw. He did it on me, and it felt like he was going to rip my arm out of my socket. It was amazing and shocking. I asked the others he demonstrated on (that I thought was no big deal) and they all agreed.  The moral of the story is that good technique and timing (and/or in your case, knowing where to place your knee) can be such that the other person doesn't know how much pressure or force they are generating. 

As a coach, sometimes we have to play harder with athletes -- and no two athletes are alike. Sometimes, it takes a gnarly knee-to-belly to get them to understand that being in a knee-to-belly is not a Happy Fun Time.

Now, what I'm absolutely *NOT* saying is ""you should toughen up, buttercup"" because that's bullshit. 

And yes, in line with others, you should absolutely talk to him before making any decisions on his personal character. "

thekoreankid,AskMen,1388799703.0,"I think the weight is a symptom of the problem. There are some people throwing around the term ""shallow"", but I disagree with that assessment on all counts. You've been doing this whole relationship thing for about 4 years, if you were truly shallow he would not have gotten a first date. The issue is that he does not want to take care of himself and because of this lack of desire to maintain basic nutrition and exercise you are beginning to find him less and less attractive. I would liken this situation to someone who relies on alcohol to have a good time. At first it was a weird little quirk that you ignored because the rest of the package outweighed the problem. But now the rampant abuse of alcohol limits the functions you are invited to and can attend without embarrassment. It's not that he's fat, it's that he refuses to take care of himself and THAT is generally seen as an undesirable trait (much like poor hygiene). 

It isn't as though you haven't given him opportunities to remedy the situation. You've tried suggesting activities and been more than willing to participate for motivation and support. However, you can only lead a horse to water. At the end of the day you have to look at your relationship and assess what you want from it. Passion, desire, and physical intimacy seem like valid inclusions on said list. If you aren't getting what you need and the bad outweighs the good, then it is time to move on. Obviously, in a mature manner, not cheating or being a bitch to get him to break up with you. 

Sometimes, to truly understand what we have, we have to lose it. Perhaps, he will realize what he's lost and make progress towards becoming the man you fell for 4 years ago (I wouldn't hold my breath, however) or maybe this is a chance for you to meet someone new who can fulfill your relationship needs. All I know, is if you shy away from this very difficult and somewhat damning conversation, you will grow to resent him and eventually say something you might regret. It's tough to have ""that"" talk, but from time to time it becomes a necessity. 

Best of luck you both!"

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388799787.0,"&gt;The point I made regarding feminism is just about the standards of impartiality. We never even discussed that, but that's where I started. I, and the feminist epistemology I quoted, would infer that if your position is that feminism is done, when feminism is about getting the word out from the perspective of the marginalized, that you aren't speaking from the perspective of the marginalized. At this point we wouldn't be saying you're wrong, but that the standards of impartiality you're using to make your judgments don't contain the perspective of the marginalized, so that it's likely you may be wrong.

That is so much clearer than the text block you quoted earlier.

My response to this is that it presumes that women are in fact marginalized. As I attempted to demonstrate with my example of evangelical Christians, the perception of marginalization is not proof of marginalization.

So I disagree with the claim that feminism is about getting the word out from the perspective of the marginalized, because agreeing with that would imply that the claim that women are marginalized has been proven.

&gt;Then, after and if we had discussed whether your perspective was garnered with a defensible standard of impartiality...

I like how I have to prove I'm impartial, and the only way to do that is to agree with a perspective I think is cock-eyed.

&gt; The war on Christmas thing has more to do with whether the protections of govt buildings extend to any religion or only one, and the stuff people reference about ""happy holidays"" extends off of that main ""is inclusion exclusion"" type of point. 

No, the War on Christmas is a manifestation of the ongoing persecution of evangelical Christians by the secular, feminist, homosexual, atheist majority.  The mass media manipulate the public in an ongoing attempt to strip Christians of a central holiday of their faith, as part of an ongoing campaign to cripple and destroy Christianity.  Because Christians are a persecuted and marginalized minority only subject to mockery by the intolerant and hateful mainstream.

Talk about not understanding the perspectives of the marginalized!

I am, of course, being facile.  I don't believe any of that.  But that is what the evangelicals believe, and it is what they are talking about when they talk about the War on Christmas.  They are talking about what they perceive to be a wide-spread, dominant ideology that marginalizes Christianity.  I mean, they're crazy, obviously...but how different are feminists, really?

&gt;I said that your view might rest on a misunderstanding of feminism or feminists.

Well that's a lot easier to understand than the word salad you posted earlier.

Sure, my view *might* rest on a misunderstanding of feminism or feminists.  But I don't really think so.

&gt;Actually you said it was nonsensical, but any adjective works right?

It's an antonym of reasonable.  I stand by it.

&gt;I see nowhere where you've shown that it is nonsense to say that feminism is the goal of alleviating inequality where one of the aims in doing so is to question the standard of impartiality used by other epistemic claims than feminism when demonstrating the marginalization of women.

Good lord.  That's a long sentence.  

I'm still trying to work out what your argument even means, so it's hard to say what's wrong with it.  Maybe what I should say is that I find your argument confounding and impossible to comprehend, and that is *seems* nonsensical to me.

&gt;I see nowhere where you've sufficiently shown that the examples of feminist activism you've given don't do those things above.

Wait, I have to prove that banning Robin Thicke's song from college radios doesn't alleviate inequality?  Isn't that self-evident?  Or, at least, isn't the extraordinary claim that it *does* alleviate inequality?  Why do I have to prove that getting a song censored because a single lyric taken out of context (and often misquoted entirely) can be interpretted as offensive to a very small group of ideologues doesn't alleviate inequality?

By what mechanism would such an action even alleviate inequality?"

As far as I'm concerned Cersei has massive plot armor too. She will undergo a big downfall, but she's the kind of character that must stay alive to witness her downfall. Her suffering is not in death like many other characters, but in seeing her loved ones go down one by one. She must see the ruin of her family, the death of her children, her friends abandoning her, her plans all turning out to have vurnerable holes in them without any way out or anyone to rescue her. And then she will grow old and bitter, and life for her will never be like it used to be. Her life might turn into a big string of hallucinations where she dreams of power and the safety of her children, only to be waken up time and again to a harsh reality. That is suffering for Cersei.

It's like Dolorous Edd, he is made to suffer while still surviving everything he gets thrown in. Death would not fit him, he requires shitty situations so he can complain about it. The wall might fall and wights might invade Westeros up to Dorne and everyone might die, but Edd will crawl up a big tree and live there for years chewing on bark and survive it all and become older than Walder Frey.

Women seek highly in-demand mates, and then freak out trying to defend them from competitors. The idealized male mate for the average woman is almost, by definition, too much for her to handle."

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1388800240.0,"Ooh, an opportunity to talk about Romans sacking things! What fun! :D 

This description is from Adrian Goldsworthy's *In the Name of Rome* - it's describing Scipio Africanus' conquest of New Carthage. 

&gt; [...] Most of his army poured into the narrow streets and alleys, with orders to kill everyone they met, but not to begin looting until instructed by signal. Polybius tells us that this was the normal Roman practice, and suspected that it was intended to terrify, 'so that when towns are taken by the Romans one may often see not only the corpses of human beings, but dogs cut in half, and the dismembered limbs of animals, and on this occasion such scenes were very many owing to the numbers of those in the place.'

&gt; The Roman sack of a city was extremely brutal, and the roots of these customs probably date back to the early predatory warfare of the archaic period. Massacre was intended to give the defenders no chance to rally and return to the fight. Plundering was restricted and regulated so that all of the Roman army would benefit equally, and this assurance helped to keep the varous sections of the attacking force at their appointed task.

&gt; [...] Once the citadel was secure, and all formal resistance over, the trumpet was sounded to turn the men from slaughter to pillage. Each maniple was supposed systematically to plunder an area, all of the spoils being taken back to the marketplace, the whole process being supervised by the tribunes. Scipio and his 1,000 men occupied the citadel throughout the night, whilst other troops were on guard in the camp. When the booty was auctioned off - largely to the Roman traders and businessmen who accompanied any Roman field army, but possibly also to some locals - the profits were distributed to the entire army, each man receiving a share in proportion to his rank. 

So....in truth, the soldiers wouldn't have so much received *slaves*, so much as they would have received a share from the *sale* of the slaves, if that makes sense :) Also, in regards to the barriage ban, that was instututed by Augustus in *his* reform of the army - which was post Julius Caesar :)"

CC_EF_JTF,Anarcho_Capitalism,1388800512.0,"&gt;Well now I know how illiterate I truly am. I... I can't understand this. You know, I thought I was smart.

Don't feel too bad, this is far from simple to understand. I'll give my best shot at translating.

&gt; From a letter to Christopher Tolkien [from his father J.R.R. Tolkien] 29 November 1943
&gt; 
&gt; [In the summer of 1943, Christopher, then aged eighteen, was called up into the Royal Air Force. When this letter was written, he was at a training camp in Manchester.]

It's important to understand this context. The letter is written to his son, who is training to fight in WWII for the British. Read the letter with the knowledge that the largest conflict in human history was in full swing as he wrote this, and his son was about to enter the fray.

&gt;My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) – or to ‘unconstitutional’ Monarchy. 

Simple enough - he wants anarchy, not the bomb throwing kind, but an ""abolition of control."" He also leaves open to door for a Monarchy, which seems quite opposed to anarchy at first glance, but later he clarifies.

&gt;I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate realm of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! If we could get back to personal names, it would do a lot of good. Government is an abstract noun meaning the an and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so as to refer to people. If people were in the habit of referring to ‘King George’s council, Winston and his gang’, it would go a long way to clearing thought, and reducing the frightful landslide into Theyocracy.

Tolkien is all about language, and he is lamenting how people are using the term State imprecisely. He rightly points out that people should view government as a collection of individuals, such as King George and Winston Churchill, not as an abstract and unaccountable concept. ""Theyocracy"" isn't a term I've seen elsewhere, but considering the context I would argue he means the public's acceptance of the growing impersonalization of government over time. In other words, he doesn't like how people are beginning to view government as an impersonal entity separate from the population itself.

&gt;Anyway the proper study of Man is anything but Man; and the most improper job of any man, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity. 

If you seek political power, you're almost certainly the type of person who would abuse it.

&gt;And at least it is done only to a small group of men who know who their master is. The mediævals were only too right in taking nolo efiscopari as the best reason a man could give to others for making him a bishop. 

Had to look this term up, but apparently it means ""I don't want to be a bishop."" What Tolkein is saying is that the best bishop would be someone who refuses to be bishop. It's the corollary to his previous statement.

&gt;Give me a king whose chief interest in life is stamps, railways, or race-horses; and who has the power to sack his Vizier (or whatever you care to call him) if he does not like the cut of his trousers. And so on down the line. 

This is what he meant by 'unconstitutional' Monarchy earlier. He wants a king who doesn't want to be king, and doesn't interfere in the lives of his subjects, but instead just plays around. As to the idea of firing his second in command, I believe what he is getting to is the idea that the king shouldn't be too bound by the law. This again seems antithetical to anarchy (a king with no limits!), but remember that he wants a king that has no interest in ruling in the first place. However, he doesn't want the ruling to take place by the second in command, he wants no ruling at all, so the king must have the ability to prevent any ruling structure from developing at all.

&gt;But, of course, the fatal weakness of all that – after all only the fatal weakness of all good natural things in a bad corrupt unnatural world – is that it works and has worked only when all the world is messing along in the same good old inefficient human way. 

One important thing to remember about Tolkien was that he hated technology and industrialization. He thought that the system of aloof and disinterested monarchs wouldn't work in an industrialized world, that the drive for efficiency forced a ruling system to exist. As you'll see later, he openly advocates for the destruction of industry.

&gt;The quarrelsome, conceited Greeks managed to pull it off against Xerxes; but the abominable chemists and engineers have put such a power into Xerxes’ hands, and all ant-communities, that decent folk don’t seem to have a chance. We are all trying to do the Alexander-touch – and, as history teaches, that orientalized Alexander and all his generals. The poor boob fancied (or liked people to fancy) he was the son of Dionysus, and died of drink. The Greece that was worth saving from Persia perished anyway; and became a kind of Vichy-Hellas, or Fighting-Hellas (which did not fight), talking about Hellenic honour and culture and thriving on the sale of the early equivalent of dirty postcards. 

Interesting historical diatribe that I'm not going to take the time to dive into, because I have no idea what he's talking about here.

&gt;But the special horror of the present world is that the whole damned thing is in one bag. There is nowhere to fly to. Even the unlucky little Samoyedes, I suspect, have tinned food and the village loudspeaker telling Stalin’s bed-time stories about Democracy and the wicked Fascists who eat babies and steal sledge-dogs. 

""Tinned food and the village loudspeaker"" are his way of highlighting the harm technology has done to even the most remote places.

&gt;There is only one bright spot and that is the growing habit of disgruntled men of dynamiting factories and power-stations; I hope that, encouraged now as ‘patriotism’, may remain a habit! But it won’t do any good, if it is not universal.

He's not kidding here, he genuinely hates technology and believes that a return to a simpler time would be beneficial to society. His sense of anarchy isn't possible in a technologically advanced world, which is why he hopes it will be universal.

&gt;Well, cheers and all that to you dearest son. We were born in a dark age out of due time (for us). But there is this comfort: otherwise we should not know, or so much love, what we do love. I imagine the fish out of water is the only fish to have an inkling of water. 

You don't know what you've got until you've lost it, etc.

&gt;Also we have still small swords to use. ‘I will not bow before the Iron Crown, nor cast my own small golden sceptre down.’ Have at the Ores, with winged words, hildenǣddran (war-adders), biting darts – but make sure of the mark, before shooting.

Advice to his son - going into the Royal Air Force - to shoot down the Germans, but make sure not to engage in friendly fire.

In India, the locals always took care of letting me know the rules.  I've never had to pay anyone or anything like that.  Although in Poland I was going to take some pictures of a street performer so I tipped him.  As soon as I took out my camera a FLOCK of tourists (none of which offered him money) all started taking pictures.  He got frustrated and wouldn't face anyone. I only got one good shot of him.

I've got enough reasons to dislike feminism, I don't need more.  And it's not really something I have any investment in defending.  I'd give you a delta, but I don't think you've really changed my mind on the central premise (feminism is slave morality).  You have made me laugh though.  

I still disagree with you on this point:
&gt;The victim narrative is merely hoodwinking while in reality...

I don't think there is any ""in reality.""  I think they've successfully pulled the wool over their own eyes.  I think they, for the most part, really believe what they are saying is true.

&gt;The victim narrative is merely useful 

I think you really underestimate how intoxicating and addictive a victim narrative can be to the supposed victim.  There's a reason why all of the major ideologies of the late 20th century -- feminism, libertarianism, and conservatism -- feature a victim narrative at their heart.  It's a drug.  You get to tell yourself you're a good person by doing nothing, by merely persevering and keeping the faith.  All criticism becomes validation. 

People retreat from master morality into these victim-narrative based slave moralities because the first thing most people notice when they become aware of the divide between the two is that they are very, very fucking lazy and that in reality most of lack of joy in their life is a result of not doing anything to change that.

&gt;Feminists have had more issues to fry than mere voting right. 

And some of those issues are real.  My mom couldn't get her own credit card until she was in her mid-twenties and the laws changed. That's clearly bullshit.

The problem is there really aren't any of those kinds of issues left."

As a retort to arps, I made plenty of friends in my Freshman class of 60 or so kids, and making friends in NYC is really up to yourself (although I'd agree that it's easier during Freshman year as everyone is in the same boat), so use your best judgment there.

I'm not saying all women always do, but some do - and your previous comment sort of implied that the sheer horror of child-birth would render no woman ever wanting a baby ever, but that is not the case is it?

There are plenty of women out there who do, in fact, want babies.

I'm not saying women out there are out to trap men - in fact I argued the opposite of that the other day; most intelligent working women don't want babies to ruin their life - especially if they aren't in a committed relationship.

But those aren't the ones we're talking about are we - because most likely those are the ones who will use birth control or have an abortion."

That doesn't mean things don't upset me, I just try to enjoy myself more than dwell over things that make me unhappy. My pity parties are grand but I don't usually invite anyone nor keep them going for too long. I'd rather not hurt myself so that I can have more fun than pain.

With the ACA and with the marketplace I'm paying just above $100 with subsidies for a just above $200 plan.

JohnStamosAsABear,IWantToLearn,1388801293.0,"Well first you should set aside some time everyday to read/learn something. This isn't an overnight process, you must dedicate your time to studying (and the more you do it, the better and easier it will become. Just ask an old graduate about studying when they haven't had to for years). Learning something helps when you're passionate, so become passionate about gaining knowledge especially in areas of interest. 

Prioritize your thoughts. Are there any areas you are interested in or feel your knowledge is inadequate? Write these down in a list, then start broad and slowly work your way into more details. 

Look into audiobooks, podcasts or downloadable online lectures from apps like ITunes U. Might be difficult at first if you are a very visual learner like myself. Having an audio copy of something is great when you wish you had more time in a day. You can multi-task by listening and learning while you sit in a waiting room, drive somewhere, while you jog/exercise etc. 

I would recommend these books: [Incomplete Education](http://books.google.ca/books?id=SxpRMP7L_KcC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=incomplete+education+jones+williams&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GvmGDOHO3_&amp;sig=BD8Tsk3x2H1RVpbFcCXTzGS2bgM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OWfHUp3DE4L7oATnx4HQBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=incomplete%20education%20jones%20williams&amp;f=false)

moonfall,AskFeminists,1388801381.0,"That's... quite the logical jump to make, though. It's complex and multi-leveled, whereas the assumption ""this person currently asking for directions is probably lost"" is much simpler and stems much more naturally from the context of a person asking for directions.

Humor me–– how are you imagining yourself asking for directions? Where is this hypothetical direction-asking happening? What are you wearing? How do you enter the couples' personal space bubble? What body language are you using as you ask for directions? Are you doing anything or acting in a way that makes it clear that your intentions are to hit on the woman? (An example I can imagine is deliberately standing between the couple, and giving the man your back while trying to carry a question about directions into an actual conversation with the woman despite the (potential) discomfort of those around you.)

All of those questions probably sound ridiculous, but if they do it's only because it's very difficult to imagine a scenario where the act of approaching to ask for directions in and of itself automatically triggers the assumption that the person's intentions are to hit on someone. Anyone who assumed that could safely be considered a little paranoid, or perhaps sensitive to being approached in general–– regardless of what someone's asking them about."

Have every sympathy and compassion for the victim .......for the first time that is ( i assume it was the first time).

I genuinely despite having had first hand experience, have little to no sympathy if they continue the relationship (unless they are literally scared for their life as is the case in some extreme examples)

the woman in my case told me it was genuinely the first and only time it has happened, and she was leaving, so all ended well, but if it happened again (same people) I wouldn't  intervene again.

starside,beer,1388801405.0,"For bottles- The biggest and cheapest is Total wine on Virginia. Behind that are all the Ben's liquor stores, the best one being the Lakeside location. They have the biggest selection and usually have some of the more limited stuff stashed in the back, so be sure to ask around. The third place I hit every week is Craft Wine and beer on Martin St. They have a large indoor cooler and will open bottles to drink in the store. They're the most expensive, but it's a very small company and I really appreciate what they do. If you're downtown Sparks the 7-11 on Victorian is ran by a beer geek and has an impressive stock for a gas station



For taps- Total Wine has a growler station with ten different beers and sell growlers for a decent price. I picked up a 32 oz of Black Butte XXV for $8.50 this afternoon! Craft Wine and Beer also has three taps and also do growler fills in addition to having a bar. The craft bar scene is pretty much concentrated to downtown- St. James Infirmary has decent selection, as does Public House, and I believe Waterfall has 20 taps. Ole Bridge Pub also has a few taps and a bottle list There's also Sierra taphouse which has all Sierra Nevada beers on tap and a decent bottle selection. The other bar I'd recommend is Chapel which is uptown a few miles, but they have good selection and Wookie Jack as of Wednesday. The last place here off the top of my head that's good for beer is the 775 Gastropub in the Meadowwood Mall. Good tap selection, but ridiculous mark up on the bottles. I don't think any of the bars will do growler fills


The local breweries here aren't too bad. There's Great Basin in Sparks with a Reno location, Brazier St. James which is near downtown, Silverpeak which is downtown, and BrewBrothers which is downtown in one of the casinos. Of all these Great Basin is probably your best bet, all their darker beers are pretty good and do growler fills of all but their really limited stuff.

It's good that the military has a standard for each gender, and I think it should be separate but equal. What could be done is have a special requirement for jobs that require extra strength/speed/fitness. 

If your best is a 7 minute mile, and the job requires a 6 minute mile, you're out of luck regardless of gender. 

If your best is dead lifting 90lbs, and the job requires you carry that AND a big mannequin - you're out of luck regardless of gender. 

They already waive some physical requirement standards for Doctors in the military, because they're not going to be exposed to danger (for the most part) 

However a medic needs to be able to do whatever it is a medic has to do, and if that involves carrying someone they better have the ability to do so.

Omega037,changemyview,1388801798.0,"The focus on whether the woman was raped or was married and on birth control seems to stem from the idea that some women who get pregnant shouldn't be allowed to abort because they *deserve to be punished*, while other women just made honest mistakes and therefore do not need to be punished.

Unfortunately, this mentality of banning abortions being about punishment causes many on the pro-life side to also ignore the *huge* amount of middle ground that is available.

Simply put, there are ways to *drastically* reduce the number of abortions in this country if we tried to help these women instead of punishing them.

If both sides were to support comprehensive sex education, access to birth control, and financial support for pregnant and single mothers (especially targeted support for infant/children's goods and day care), the number of abortions would likely drop very significantly.

In other words, if their goals are truly to eliminate abortions, they should support the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and helping women who want to keep their child have the financial support to do so.

Insurance companies already have payment plans worked out with medical personnel. So, now that this person has an insurance plan they also received the reduced medical costs.

An example: you go in for an X-ray. The insurance company has a deal worked out that they will only pay $30 per x-ray. But, if you are uninsured you have to pay $100 for the same x-ray. So even if all the costs are passed along to the consumer, they're still saving $70 for the x-ray.

Sanitize something, and use it to draw up enough liquid to fill a tube your can fit your hydrometer in. I use a Stainless Steel turkey baster. Fill the hydrometer tube so it overflows. Put your hydrometer in, spin it, let it settle. [it'll look something like this](http://www.grapestompers.com/images/hydrometer-closeup.gif) you want to read from the bottom of the meniscus to be exact, but within a point or two doesnt matter.

so say you take a reading of 1.010 for three days in a row, and it;s been 7 days since you starter ferment. safe to say your ferment is done. Don't pour the sample back in. Drink it. make notes, and review after it's carbonated. this will help you see how carbonation changes a beer.

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1388802156.0,"&gt; What is something that women can bring to coding and programming that men can't? 

Programming is mostly a creative exercise. Just like a lot of women have outstanding art that is different from men, women who code approach problems in a different creative way then men. Not better, not worse, just different. 

&gt; Why is it so important to 'close the gender gap'? 

Computers and computer technology are only going to expand. As that expansion occurs, programing and understanding computers is going to expand with it. Right now, it's male dominated and is perceived as mostly a male career path. It may not be important for *you*, but it'll be important for your *daughter* to change this perception **now**.

&gt; The only thing I can come up with is that all people like to socialize, so perhaps women get lonely in the world of programming. Are there any other reasons I'm not thinking of?

I've been doing this for over 18 years, and it is slowly starting to become less an old boys club. Because there are fewer women, there is more of a chance for sexism to flourish. I experienced one example in my early career. A woman was a Sr Network Administrator. She was assigned grunt work while her less experienced but male Jr Network Administrator was assigned the fun work. I can 100% vouch that she was more adept at the work. Unfortunately, I was a consultant and couldn't say anything at the time.

Yes it does.

&gt; Any designer could have...

But any designer DIDNT. Better products were made by women from what I read.

&gt;... make a better product that pays closer attention to the needs of my customer base

The customer base being female. Hire females to design products FOR FEMALES. Make money. Its called business. Its not that hard to understand.

&gt; Sexism is wrong. Stop trying to justify it.

Sexism is wrong. This isn't sexism. Would you research a medicine without ever understanding the disease? Would you hire a man who has never seen a TV to build and design TVs? Why would a guy design and create a toy to pleasure the special bits of a woman when he has a penis?

You are grasping at straws and you are being *huge meanie* about it. Its an industry that is for a specific gender. It is unique in that way and the customers (i.e, women) who are using the products are better equipped (i.e., a vagina) to test, design and create business strategies for their customers (i.e., women). 

Understand that this is a very specific industry for a specific type of products for a group of people defined by their biology. This isn't making car tires or soft drinks. There are exceptions to the rule."

arktic_P,appstate,1388802312.0,"Not sure if you only looking into the standard clubs, or if you're wanting to branch out into the Club Sports as well. Club Sports are sports that do not host ""try-outs"" like the varsity sports, so you are guaranteed a spot as long as you want to be a part of the team. It's more serious and involved than intramurals, but less time-consuming and dedicated than varsity sports.

I am on the App State Mens Ultimate (Frisbee) team, and I have had an amazing time playing with the team and traveling to tournaments in different cities (Charleston, Raleigh, Charlotte, Washington D.C., and many other cities in the surrounding states). They are an amazing group of people that I am proud to call my friends. When we aren't practicing or going to tournaments, we often do team social events, which often involves the Women's Ultimate team as well. 

There is a fee to be on any Club Sports teams, and the amount varies by team. As far as I can tell, Ultimate is the cheapest at $50 a semester, whereas the Ski club team's fee is more than $1000 a semester. Most of the other club sports fees are around a few hundred, (like $200 - $400).

Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but Ultimate is the only club I have any experience with, so I thought I'd share."

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1388802380.0,"It's all about respect.  I've known a lot of couples with differing religions between them - most of them Jewish/Christian, some of them Atheist/Christian.  As long as your partner does not look down on you for your beliefs, that's a good sign.  When it comes to raising kids, you definitely have to come to a compromise - can they get baptized?  Go to CCD/Sunday School?  Church on holidays and Sundays?  Does your SO have to participate as well?  These are things to work out.  The couples I know have had many varied personal solutions to these things.  Some will raise their kids Jewish, some will include both religions and let the child eventually choose which one to stick with.  I've even seen one split the kids - the older daughter was raised Catholic, even attended Catholic high school, while the younger daughter was raised Jewish.  However both daughters, when you talk to them, identify personally with both religions.  They aren't confused at all, if that is ever a concern...just explain things to kids and they do pick up on stuff very well.

What's interesting to me is how I have been in 2 long term relationships with atheists, but they both treated me very differently because of my religion.

The first boyfriend is kind of like your typical Reddit Atheist, who is young and vocal and hates intensely on any religion.  He did not respect me for being Catholic and really thought I was stupid for having spiritual beliefs, despite admitting that he does think I'm a good person and I'm not ""like those TV Christians"".  He hated that I identified as Catholic and his bitterness would come out in many ways, unrelated directly to discussions of religion.

Contrasting with that is my current LTR; my boyfriend is again an atheist, but respects me.  He was raised Catholic and hated it.  While we aren't married, we have had serious marriage and how-to-raise-kids discussions, and these involved religion for sure.  I never felt belittled as we talked, and I am the daughter of an Atheist/Catholic pairing myself.  There is no confusion, and I do think if he had an honest talk with our future kids about his reasons for being Atheist...well I think he has good reasons and our kids will understand that.  I think he will be a good, tempering force.  What works out well for my situation is also that his secular humanistic morals are pretty much the same as mine, although mine are rooted in my religion.  

I'm sure if you asked him why we get along, when religion is involved, it's because I'm ""not a real Catholic"".  I resent that he says that, but it is true that NY Catholics are quite different from the stereotype."

As a native you can tell what is and is not a good area, and I'd rather OP stay out of Dorchester entirely.  Even JP can be a bit sketchy if you don't know what you're doing.  

Quincy is fine, but if you're considering that I'd also look at Braintree.  Neither one is a fun commute, and I think that's ultimately what you are going to see:

$1800/mo for a 20 minute commute and live in the city
$1200/mo for a 50 minute commute and live outside the city

tinydot,AskReddit,1388802444.0,"Alcohol is my drug of choice.  How does it feel? Bubbly, as long as I don't overdo it.  When I do overdo it, I'm slightly sick, and then puking.  I find myself wanting to talk to everyone, and I tend to be braver than I normally would be.  I've never done something I wouldn't do sober, I just feel less nervous about trying something new, like doing stand up comedy or singing karaoke.  My mindset is basically, ""Let's do all the  things! Ok, now let's have sex with the boyfriend and go to bed!""

Drinking hasn't really had any major impact on my life, save for helping me find two really fun hobbies.  It would have taken me so much longer to find the cahones  to get on a stage and tell jokes to strangers, and I'm really glad I gave it a shot.  I'm also inclined to have a beer or two after a stressful day at work.  I don't drink often at home, though, and usually save the heavier drinking for nights downtown.

Obviously, any drug isn't necessarily right for anyone, but I don't recommend total abstinence.  If you're not someone with a very addictive personality, I'd suggest drinking at least once, if only to better understand why the people you know do it.

Ships belonging to other countries that are not at war against you are simply ignored because the sea zone is still ""friendly"".  Therefore, as long as the two are not at war with each other, they can pass each other freely.

1. Adopt. There are too many kids in foster care who need a good home.

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1388802929.0,"&gt; For example, I pay $500 every month for health insurance with a decided upon $10,000 deductible. If I break my leg, and the bill is $50,000, I pay $10,000 and the insurance takes care of the rest. Is this not how it works?

Nope. There is a game our hospitals and our insurance companies play. Hospitals want to charge more, and health insurance companies want to pay less. 

So, here is what happens: a hospital charges $5000 to fix a broken leg. The health insurance company says: ""Nope, that's too high. We think a broken leg is only worth $4000""

Care to guess who has to pay the difference?

Finally, the other game that health insurance likes to play is ""lets not pay on a technicality!"" 

It works like this:

Your doctor runs through a series of tests before deciding you need surgery. He charges $50,000 for surgery. Your health insurance company then notices that one of those series of tests he ran didn't include snzzulders test (or whatever). In the health insurance opinion, that test is required before that surgery. Therefor, the surgery was elective surgery and they aren't required to pay for it. 

That is an example, but there is quite literally no financial motive for health insurance companies to pay hospitals *IF* they can find another way to get out of it. "

Let's talk about recipe syntax. In OP's recipe it is stated ""amount ingredient, method."" Directing you to weigh the ingredient, and then apply the method. 

If the syntax were ""amount method ingredient"" (60g bloomed gelatin), you would first bloom the gelatin, then weigh it.

Another example is whipped cream. 2 cups cream, whipped VS. 2 cups whipped cream. In the former (amount ingredient, method) you would measure 2 cups of cream and whip it. In the latter example (amount method ingredient) you would whip cream, and measure 2 cups of it. This would obviously result in different amounts of cream due to the air incorporated.

This would also apply for any volume measurement involving chopping, mincing, melting, etc. It basically saves the recipe writer the time and space of adding an extra procedure line for the method applied to the ingredient. In this case it saved the time of making step 1: Bloom geletin."

Whatever your choose get good grades, that way the school gives YOU money :D"

Eminem has done some very impressive songs or appearances in the past few years (No Love and Forever come to mind), but the filler on his albums might as well be cashing in on nostalgia.

""It is a deal.""  
  
OOC: Here are the details on all of Orville's rounds (*Lies in italics,* **truths in bold**):  
  
Round 1:  
*Orville did know his mother.  
Orville has been tortured in many ways, but attempting to drown him is not one of them.*  
**Orville doesn't actually enjoy the taste of stone, except for salt, which is one of two things which could be found in the mines he worked in. When he says he enjoys the taste of rocks, he means salt rocks.**  
  
Round 2:  
*Orville likes his beard.*  
**Orville wants to eat better, having grown up on basically bread and gruel. And, you know, licking salt for flavor when the slave-drivers weren't looking.**  
*Orville does not like being seen as a monster, but he likes his height. He sees it as part of his strength, which he takes pride in.*  
  
Round 3:  
*In addition to salt, the other thing mined where Orville grew up was gold. He is familiar with handling it, although not in the same way most people think from a monetary standpoint.*  
*Orville has not seen the moon yet. He has been in a world with a sky for two days, and has been indoors during both nights.*  
**There were no guns in the mines, for fear one of the slaves could riot and get their hands on them. While there were guns on the Marine ship Orville was detained on, nobody ever got a chance to fire on him when he broke free and went on a rampage.**  
  
Round 4:  
**Orville has indeed survived a 100 foot drop in the mines. He was heavily injured, but he pulled through, and when he healed he was much stronger than before.**  
*Orville doesn't use contractions in normal speech. But he did use them in his first meeting with Giradin, when he tried to act like a different person.*  
*Orville has never laughed so loud a mineshaft caved in. He has, however, yelled so loud that a mineshaft caved in.*  
  
Round 5:  
**Orville wants to learn to dance. He thinks it would go well with hearing music.**  
*Orville doesn't dislike fine clothing, but he isn't particularly interested in it either.*  
*Orville admires Fishman Karate, but he already has his own fighting style he is comfortable with.*"

The other girl has been a serial monogamist, and she'll have sex with her boyfriends, but she's most definitely not in to it.

Who can have that evidence thrown out? Who can sue the government civilly? Neither of us.  My rights were violated, but I don't have any damages.  He will be convicted based on a search that violated the Constitution, but he cannot challenge the evidence because his rights weren't violated, mine were.

That's *standing.*  Now, what, exactly, are your ""damages"" from the NSA programs?  And if you say ""my rights were violated,"" you're still not getting it.

&gt;Judges probably won't agree, because they are under the employ of the federal government.  

Oh, get out of here with your tinfoil hat nonsense.  Judges, even federal ones, rule against the government on a regular basis.  The fact that they are employed by the government means jack shit.  

&gt;But Americans definitely have standing in this case.

No, I don't think they do.  I think this is a political issue, not one for the courts (at least until someone is arrested based on these programs), which makes it all the more nonsensical that a Senator with a huge amount of power to stop these programs is doing this.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1388803568.0,"&gt; *People* are very selfish and they will just take advantage and walk all over you

Are you happy now? We are specifically talking about women here, so I didn't realize I needed to be gender neutral.

But seriously though, women tend to be more selfish than men. It starts from a very young age where they are constantly given things to them by other boys, parents, are protected, and treated like princesses in general. This does create a sense of entitlement and selfishness. Especially in higher SMV woman who have the capacity to be selfish. Your run of the mill average chick isn't going to act selfish as often as a much hotter chick, because she doesn't have as many opportunities to reveal that side. She doesn't have men throwing things at her every time she goes out. 

This isn't bitterness, this is real advice. We don't tip-toe around sensitive issues that make you feel uncomfortable because ""not all women are like that."" It's important to understand these concepts. It's important guys know this so they don't act surprised that when they start offering her all sorts of gifts and time, she has no problem taking them, but wont offer you anything back in return. Don't be surprised when your ex-wife takes your house and still collects 20 percent of your paycheck for the next 20 years while she sleeps with her new BF. 

I know you can rationalize that not everyone is like that, and so on... But again, we speak with generalities. These generalities tend to become more and more likely the higher the person's SMV is. "

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1388803587.0,"-1) You will never retire if all you can set aside is $1k/month.  To get to a 17 year retirement timeline you need to save/invest 50% of your income, or be able to beat the market by a significant margin and still invest damn near 50%.  So you need to be putting away roughly $5k/month and comfortable living on the same before taxes.  Daycare is expensive, but that's like $1k/month.  Fix your expenses.  Your current ~10% savings rate puts you at &gt;50 years to retirement.  See http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/

0) Keep 6 months of expenses for emergency fund, use rest for the following where it makes sense

1) 401(k) to match (assuming 50% match or better)

2) ESPP if you have one and the terms are good (i.e. much better than 6.5% return)

3) Pay off 6.5% loans.

4) Accelerate paydown of 5% loan (don't need to stop investment for this, but maybe pay $500/month)

jackiebird,AdviceAnimals,1388803629.0,"&gt; There are some parents who genuinely don't want their kid, but after 18 years the kid can kiss their asses goodbye and make a name for themselves and live their lives.

It's really not as simple as that.  Growing up in a family that doesn't want you has lasting effects on your psyche.  I grew up in an abusive family, being told all the time I was a mistake and that I wasn't wanted.  I moved out at 14, I'm 28 now and it's still effects me.  Both of my best friends are the same.  My stepsister is like that with her kids and I'm seeing them grow up to be extremely dysfunctional.  Just because you walk out the door doesn't mean the problems don't come with you.  You're moulded by them, they make up who you are and it's really hard to escape that.

If I were to get pregnant now, I would abort.  I'm not financially secure enough, I have genetic problems that I wouldn't want to pass on to them, and frankly I don't want them.  I'm taking every precaution I can now.  I would never purposely treat any child I had badly, but I know I wouldn't be equipped to raise them well, and I have no promise that the already over-saturated adoption system could do any better.  I'd rather abort than subject my child to a life that's anything less than what it deserved.

Just my two cents."

For dogs that know each other, this is all totally normal play. Some dogs even prefer to be the ""submissive"" one all the time and let the other dog be ""dominant"" all the time, so even that is not necessarily a perfect rule. 

My rule is as long as there's not excessive yelping (more than just ""woops too much!"" and then readjusting play), one dog isn't getting rolled a lot, and they aren't getting over aroused, anything goes. When they are first learning to play with a new dog there's bound to be some barriers being crossed on accident, but well adjusted dogs will correct each other and listen to corrections and be just fine without humans getting too involved in my experience.

While fellow redditors can certainly give you emotional support and our perspective on a specific issue, I highly doubt any of us can help you address the core issues with which you struggle. I suggest looking into [cognitive behavioral therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy). It is not a magic pill that will make all your problems disappear, but if you're willing to invest the time and effort, it will equip you with the tools that are necessary to have healthy romantic relationships with men, as well as healthy relationships in general whether they are intimate or otherwise. And I realize not everybody has the time/resources or even the desire to see a therapist. If you're at all curious, start with David D. Burns' book ""Feeling Good Together,"" which specifically addresses relationships. I purposely didn't link it to Amazon so you know that I'm not going to benefit in anyway whether you buy the book or not. In fact, get it from the library (that's where I read my first copy). I know you're on the subreddit to get advice from men -- I'm a lady who has had difficulty in romantic relationships with men due to my upbringing and CBT brought me a lot of clarity + provided me with clear direction as to how to ""be normal."" :) I hope things work out for you and even if you're not feeling ready to take on my advice at the moment, I hope you might file it away and maybe revisit it one day.

jhalton3,ModernMagic,1388803814.0,"The issue isn't consistency, it's speed.

Against a deck like Affinity, you have to not die to their threats by the time you get your combo into play.  They play more threats than you can respond to realisticly and you probably lose most of the time here.

Jund plays discard and removal, particularly Thoughtseize and Abrupt Decay.  Your counter magic doesn't do anything to stop them from stopping you and your combo can be stripped from your hand before you have the chance to do anything about it.  With how slow your combo is, this is very bad for you.

Twin is faster than you.  You can try to disrupt them with countermagic, but if they are running an all in list they probably won't go in on the combo against a blue deck until they think they can win a counter war.  Against tempo twin you probably die to their other threats before your combo really works.  If you stop their tempo threats, you spend mana that you now can't spend to stop the combo.

Against control all they have to do is counter your combo.  You may beat them once because they have no idea what you are doing, but once they know you will either get burned out while you wait for enough mana to win a counter war over Jhoira or straight up lose a counter war.

Your combo is just too slow.  Consistency is not the issue.

She was a great girl, had some really tough times in high school, got made fun of here and there (she wasn't the most attractive person and she was very... unique, shall we say. Had her own strange way of thinking.) She ended up dropping out of high school and starting Cyber School, followed by online college courses. After a while, she started to just give up. She lost most of her friends because of her cutting..

One night she called me crying, saying she was done and life was too rough anymore. I tried to talk to her but she didn't seem to want to step back from her decision. She claimed no one cared about her and she was sick of trying to make people happy, and she hung up the phone. So I rushed out, grabbed flowers at the store beside my house and hauled ass to her apartment. I knocked on the door before letting myself in. I walked right up to her, sitting on her couch with a container of pills in her hand and a bottle of vodka sitting on the coffee table. I grabbed her, pulled her up, and gave her the white roses (which were her favorite flower,) and looked her straight in the eyes.

""Jess. I love you.""

Those 4 words were all I needed to say. She threw her arms around me and didn't let go. The pills fell from her hand and scattered across the floor and that was it. I would like to say things worked out between us, but we had to go our separate ways for college a year later. But we're still extremely close. She's very successful now, and she still tells me every so often that she's thankful I stepped into that room. (I remember it like it was truly just a few days ago.)"

TheLittleGoodWolf,AskMen,1388804062.0,"I have read trough your post and some of the comments here and thought I'd put in my two cents, for better or worse.

To begin with I'm incredibly attracted to women with your characteristics. Someone who can take care of themselves, support themselves, know what they want and like in life and have the strength to get it, they are secure in themselves and emotionally stable.

However, when you look at it like that, why am I even there? What purpose do I serve in her life? If I was gone nothing would be really different so why stay?

Plenty of people want a purpose in their lives, something to live for, some reason for them to exist. Being in a relationship where you might as well not be there at all can be incredibly intimidating, and rightly so. You are basically told that you are insignificant and replaceable.

I was in a recent relationship with a woman a few years older than me. She had a good job that paid plenty, relatively wealthy parents, she traveled a lot with her friends and owned her own apartment that she was decorating herself. She pretty much had her life sorted out so where did I fit in? I didn't have a good job, I supported my mother financially so not much money to do other things.

She was strong and independent but she did not let that control her. She had no problems having me help her with things. We did things together, we cooked together there were things that I could offer and there were things that she could offer both physically and emotionally. I'm not dependent on a girl having to ask for help, but we all need it sometimes. Even when we don't need it it's still nice to be offered, most things work better and easier with two people doing the job. And a person who is too stuck in independence to ask for help or needing someone is to me someone who pushes people away.

&gt;   I choose to give up my time to spend it with someone else because they are fun and enjoyable, not because of what they can do for me or give me.

Read that sentence again and tell me how they are not **giving** you enjoyment and fun by being with you. If we didn't get something out of being around people then why the hell should we be? Also the statement itself comes across as a wee bit high and mighty. You **choose** to **give up** your time to **spend** it on another person.

Look there is nothing wrong with needing someone, it doesn't make you weaker or less independent. Wouldn't you say that the reason you are so frustrated about so many guys leaving because you are so ""independent"", is because you actually need someone to love and be with. Couldn't you say you actually need to need someone? You want something, there is a hole to fill, and you need something to fill that hole with. It's basically semantics but there is a little more to it than that.

I think this is something that has been missed by a lot of ""strong independent women"" recently. Needing someone doesn't make you weak, it doesn't make you less dependent. There is a difference between needing someone and being dependent upon them. What I wrote in the beginning was true. Strong women attract me, women who are strong enough to allow themselves to be weak at times. Because we are not always strong, we are not always right, we can't do everything ourselves. And sometimes we actually **need** other people in our lives.

Just my thoughts though."

*""imagine your thoughts are a radio in your head, that only plays your favorite songs.  now imagine that it abruptly changes stations halfway through every song, and never, ever stops.  When the meds work, the radio stays on the same station.""*  

remember, ADHD happens when the part of your brain that controls traffic is *slower* than it should be.  explaining that helps, too.  ADHD is often co-morbid with other things, like depression (which is a terrible bitch in its own right).

exercise helps (though motivation is a bitch sometimes).  I find that eating healthy, avoiding sugar and caffeine (esp soda), and drinking a lot of water helps.  Timers and reminders help, too (google calendar is good, as are written notes).  try to be patient with yourself.

when talking to your parents, ask that they do little things to help, like buying healthy food, like fruit.  just ask them to be patient with you, and trust that you're doing the best you can.  try to be succinct when you talk to them, which is hard.  you may have to write things out first before you can distill your thoughts into concise answers.

Edit to your edit - I think things like that should be case by case, not black and white.  If Person A dated Person B and they had a mutual breakup with no hard feelings, then I would really see no issue with Friend C dating the ex.  If Person A and Person B had a messy breakup and the person was still nursing pain and/or feelings for the other, then Person C should stay away out of decency.  In that same situation, if 10 years down the line people have changed and the hurt person has well moved on, then again I would say it's probably okay to date the ex.

The ""right"" thing to do is rarely as easy as assessing things by a code.  Codes can work as guidelines, yes, but generally hard and fast rules aren't my thing.  I have exceptions to that, but dating an ex is not one of them."

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1388804398.0,"&gt; We as men decide that we are disposable. We are willing to die for the woman that we love and it is hard wired into us. Women and children first is just a small part of it. We go to great lengths to ensure that our woman is happy and it is just in recent history where that is no longer appreciated or rewarded.

I believe this very aspect is what has created the economic imbalance between the genders. The difference in how men love is what create us to be disposable. Our drive to protect our family is so strong, it's what forces us to take risks. It's what forces us to build empires, invent, collect tons of wealth, and so on... The drive to provide for our family forces us to become successful. We feel inadequate when we can't, so it drives us harder and harder to take more and more risk to gather as many resources and honor as possible... So naturally, we dominate the economic and political spheres of society. Women want to join in this circle today, to gain all the advantages of being a member within these spheres, but refuse to allow any of the disadvantages the come with the territory of competing within that space."

No one would want to go in the industry ""because there needs to be more females"". There is a legitimate value that women could bring that is absolutely missing and in return an industry that could be very fulfilling to lots of women. "

flyingcatpotato,childfree,1388804447.0,"I live also in a country where women are protected from firing and given other legal considerations while on maternity leave. While individual women may wind up gaming the system, it still doesn't change the fact that across the board, mothers have less hours, lower pay and do not progress as fast despite legal protections for promotions and mat leave. Even taking two years out of the workforce has an impact on a woman's income curve over a lifetime. 

Generous maternity leave policies usually only benefit those at the lower ends of income and management hierarchies. It is very hard for a woman without a track record for putting in long hours to get into higher management roles even with legal protections, because they can always be judged on other indicators. The more likely scenarios are ones who game the system at the entry- and lower levels. I worked with one mother who stepped on everyone in our secretary pool to get a department manager position. She got it pulling the mommy card, but five years and another kid later she is still at the same latitude professionally, and because i have kept working and learning, i currently work in jobs above her hierarchically. So let them take time off for their kids- when they come back to whatever it is they were doing, i will be that much higher up on the ladder.

I would consider grav guns for the bikes, as they're fantastic on bikes. Not in love with the lightning claw, but it makes sense alongside the Master. Although expensive, an option would be to replace the bike squad with a Bike command squad for some added durability (FNP) and a slightly nastier group of marines.

So, I kind of thought it would be really cool if occasionally, while you were sending a squad out on a Skyranger to an abduction or terror mission, UFOs shot down the Skyranger, starting a survival mission.

The basic idea of the mission would be that as soon as it happens, you have to pick another 6 members for a rescue mission and once you've done that, you control the squad that was shot down. Of course, since this is XCOM and I don't want this to be easy, you start at a disadvantage.
* Your squad starts at a random number between 50% - 100% health.

* Your squad doesn't have their main weapon. Their weapons and utility item are scattered near the crash site but it's up to you to decide if it is worth finding all the items.

*  The Aliens spawn until the mission ends. 

* Once the rescue squad arrives, that squad has to link up with the first squad and extract them.

* Then you have to do the mission you were originally supposed to do but with the injured squad members. Luckily, you can switch around with those 12 soldiers you have.

you honestly think strippers do well for themselves over the long term? you really think that the ""Movers and shakers"" of the industrial world are ex strippers.

strippers end up on societies fringes, once you have been a stripper it sends alarm bells to everyone professional that this person is ""Not the right stuff""

We love our partners but we can be quiet and unique about displaying this love. We will show this love in what we do and feel more than what we say or express. If you need to be told ""I love you"" or ""you're beautiful/handsome/funny/amazing/perfect"" on a daily or weekly basis, make that clear. Because, while we're probably thinking it, we may not say it aloud or in the way you expect. But, if we know that our partner has expectations, we will do our best to live up to them."

Neopopulas,dayz,1388804949.0,"Personally my order of fixes are

* Desync issues: Thats the broken chains, the long lag spikes where you can't do anything, the random teleporting and the responsiveness of shots and kills (which also applies to zombies) but general lag and desync is a huge issue

* Data Usage: I've posted this before but when i'm around 4 of my friends i'm using up about 200kb/s. In a few hours of gameplay i can use up to a couple gig at 720mb an hour. That VERY quickly adds up, and anyone on a cap can find themselves using up a couple of gig in a long play session. There is no need for that much data transfer, games like Planetside (which is a massive MMO which has to update hundreds of things like player position, constant gunshots, aircraft, debris) only uses around 40kb/s most of the time.

* Combat Logging: This is more of a 'fucking annoying' thing than something that is gamebreaking. Sometimes i feel like its the most annoying thing in the world. Yesterday i was looting a barracks, and a guy tries to jump me, he misses and i hide in one of the bunk rooms, i lean out to fire back on him and he hides in the showers. So i'm sneaking up to get a shot on him because he has me trapped in the barracks, i can see him in there so i fire at him. He fires back, i inch away and fire blindly into the showers. Then nothing for like a minute and a half, i sneak up and he's just gone. He could NOT have walked out of the barracks past me. So HE attacked ME, and because i got the upper hand he logged out. Its infuriating. Not only that i had to bail because i didn't want him to server hop around behind me.

* Zombies: People keep saying they want more zombies but before that happens they really need to be fixed, and i hope we DON'T end up with the amount from the mod, and even if we get more, the idea that we have to deal with zombies that lag and don't get killed (you shoot them, they hit you, then they die) or phase through doors (or open them) or walls, or glitch sideways as you shoot at them..

Until zombies and the combat mechanics/lag are totally solid and responsive, upping the number is going to cause huge issues."

Fruit-Salad,edmproduction,1388805014.0,"How do I make an OVERWERK bass sound?

An example would be in this song at about 1:00 https://soundcloud.com/overwerk/force and you hear it throughout the song. Essentially the bass feels like a heavy plough being dragged through the fabric of the song but it doesn't rip it to shreds. It is gritty but not abrasive. I've tried experimenting in Massive to try and create something that gives a similar feel in my song but I'm not having any luck. Edward Huszar is an amazing producer but the only material I could find about him was an interview that wasn't any help.
So how do you make a bass synth that is gritty yet not abrasive. Sounds like it keeps the song dragged down without actually dragging the song down. So far I'm guessing that the effect is achieved in the low mid section 200-500Hz but I'm not getting any luck.

Mako ignoring Bolin in the beginning was pretty much him telling his brother to grow the fuck up. In season one Bolin was the one who got in trouble because he was so naive and didn't think things through. I'm a little disappointed that they didn't give him a better development on that part. Mako always had a reason for being the way he was, he was protecting his little brother since their parents died. Bolin was just being petty and has never really been shown to understand this. He does grow up in the final episodes but you know, I would have liked to see more of it, some introspection on his part, I would have loved to see him reject Ginger when she came around to him. I love him as a character but that is because of his **potential** not so much because of what he is now.

they are saying ""Korra is your avatar now, deal with it"", you shouldn't forget the past but you shouldn't live in it either. Everything changes and you gotta deal with it. Aang will still have been and his legacy will remain but you have to move on.

The reason I didn't like the whole Boleska is that it was basically an abusive relationship. I have been in one and it's not funny, and that kinda takes the humor out of that entire segment. I can understand how it can be seen as funny, I just don't laugh at it. The ending surprised me in that they showed honest emotions between them, Bolin stood his ground and Eska showed some compassion. They grew up and I loved it!

I think there is some definite superman going on with Bolin yes, but that fits in with the fact that he's playing a hero too. I kinda think it may have been deliberate."

This sounds dickish, but he sounds like a rapper for people who don't really like rap. He says funny things very clearly, and I think that appeals to a lot of people who wouldn't otherwise like rap (the people who enjoy novelty/comedy/parody rap videos and think it's okay to like them because it's not like they really like rap, heaven forbid; they just like the lyrics).

tweebles,movies,1388805139.0,"So I looked up the original paper, which states that the study was based on the films that were available on VHS at the time: 

&gt;The study reviewed the content of all G-rated animated feature films available on videocassette in the United States. The study covered only movies first released in the theater, recorded in English, at least 60 minutes in length, and available for purchase or rental before October 31, 2000. Eighty-three films that fit our criteria were identified through searching the IMDb Internet Movie Database,( n14) and referencing Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide for accuracy.( n13) Two of these films (Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night and Race for Your Life Charlie Brown) were not available for sale or rental at the time of the study. We believe that the 81 films reviewed constitute the universe of G-rated animated feature film videos that are currently available for sale or rental.

Someone more familiar with film history might know if this is indeed an accurate representation of how many G-rated animated films were made in the period or if most never made in onto VHS.

sockalicious,changemyview,1388805172.0,"Your view is easily summed up in one word: nihilism.  Nihilism can be looked at a lot of ways.  One way is as a psychological defense against vulnerability, against the built-in idea that the world and what it contains can cause us pain by defeating us.  If nothing matters - if we stand up for nothing, fight for nothing, and win only (and always) when it is guaranteed - then we can never be defeated, never know that pain; in the narrow confines of the world we have chosen, we are omnipotent.

Joy is difficult and not guaranteed.  A better tomorrow, for you and your brethren, is difficult; and certainly not guaranteed.  Love is always difficult and never guaranteed.  Justice is always hard-fought, and rarely won.

Many people think these are some of the highest values in life and that therefore they are worth fighting for, even if the efforts seem doomed to failure.  We live; we desire; we need; these needs are either met or not. The excellence of the reward seems to justify the fight, for people interested in getting their own needs met at the highest level; for we learn that if we decide to shun the fight, not only can we never lose, but we can never win.

Two great works that have taken this topic on, front and center, are *Don Quixote* by Cervantes and *The Brothers Karamazov* by Dostoevsky.  You'd enjoy both, I think."

abeyante,relationships,1388805195.0,"&gt;We define our relationship as emotionally monogamous.

Are you allowed to date other people? Have FWBs? Or are you just looking for casual NSA hookups?

Because I'm going to warn you right now that if you guys see any individuals continually, even a ""fuck buddy,"" or whatever, there's a very strong possibility of emotional attachment.

What would you do if your partner developed feelings for another person? How would that make you feel? It's ok to say ""jealous,"" or ""lonely,"" or ""awful,"" as long as you can work through (*together*) what the roots of those feelings are, talk them through if/when you experience them, and work towards dealing with them in healthy ways.

&gt;will not pursue anyone who may affect how we feel emotionally towards each other.

This is interestingly phrased to me. So, do you mean you wouldn't mind if she developed feelings for another partner, as long as the other partner(s) didn't *replace* or *negate* her feelings for you? Or do you mean that you feel any other emotional attachments would be a threat?

I have a secondary partner (""FWB""?) whom I would say that I ""love."" But the kind of love I have for him is nothing like the love I feel for my primary partner, and definitely in no way negates or threatens my feelings for my primary. I use the analogy of platonic friendship: it's not only possible, but normal, to have 5 or 10 close friends, and to value and love them all; having more than one ""best friend"" doesn't mean you don't love your other best friends.

EDIT: Also, I wanted to add that it sounds like you're putting a lot of emphasis and worry into your first, gut reaction of jealousy. Know that this is a totally normal reaction, and doesn't mean there's something wrong with you, or your relationship. The important, make-it-or-break it element of polyamory/non-monogamy is the way in which you deal with those feelings, and it sounds to me like you're going about this perfectly. Open communication, trust, lengthy heart-to-hearts, and talking problems to death is the best recipe for success. Don't beat yourself up about that visceral jealous reaction. Just stay mindful of yourself and your feelings and keep talking things through with your partner :)"

&gt;The condemnation of Galileo was only reversed in the 20th Century.

Twentieth century? How fucking ignorant can you be? Yes, a public apology was made in 1992, but do you seriously think that the Church taught geocentrism until 1992? How little research have you done? Please, never defend me in court.

No, it was reversed very shortly after Galileo's death, and how dare the Church defend scientific orthodoxy by hushing up rabble by making Galileo live in a palace and take walks with bodyguards. It was a cranky old men acting like cranky old men, and Galileo was always a devout Catholic, his daughter was a nun.

&gt;Copernicus 

Didn't publish his writings because he didn't want other scientists to give him a hard time about his positions. He was also a devout Catholic who dedicated his work to Pope Paul III.

&gt;Kepler 

Was condemned by *Protestants* and beloved by *Jesuit scientists.*

&gt;The Church only stopped condemning those positions when the evidence for them became so overwhelming as to make any other course of action laughable

Because concrete evidence appeared, which Galileo did not have. He was permitted to teach heliocentrism as a hypothesis, not as a theory, which he insisted on doing, which annoyed a few cranky hierarchs. The only theological controversy was that he was insisting on reinterpreting scripture without any scientific proof. It was all about the ""science"" you fellate. 

Do you know what Galileo's ""prison"" conditions were like? Here's some quotes from letters by the Tuscan ambassador:

&gt;The pope told me that he had shown Galileo a favor never accorded to another

&gt;he has a servant and every convenience

&gt;[i]n regard to the person of Galileo, he ought to be imprisoned for some time because he disobeyed the orders of 1616, but the pope says that after the publication of the sentence he will consider with me as to what can be done to afflict him as little as possible

Was it imprudent? Yes. Was it this mindless assault on science that you people imagine it is? No, and there is absolutely no excuse for being so pathetically ignorant when all the knowledge in the world is readily available on the internet for anybody to use. Galileo was being a dickhead and publicly insulting his friend after much very careful and diplomatic discussion, so he was ordered to chill out in a palace. Dreadful.

&gt;Also it was on the orders of Pope Theophilus that the Great Library of Alexandria was destroyed in 391. The greatest trove of learning in human history - wiped out by papal decree. 

First off, the legendary library could not have possibly existed as described. There is no evidence of any buildings the size described in legend.

Furthermore, it was Julius Caesar who burned it down, not the Coptic Orthodox Church.

&gt;[W]hen the enemy endeavored to cut off his communication by sea, he was forced to divert that danger by setting fire to his own ships, which, after burning the docks, thence spread on and destroyed the great library.

Ammianus Mercellinus also writes:

&gt;Besides this there are many lofty temples, and especially one to Serapis, which, although no words can adequately describe it, we may yet say, from its splendid halls supported by pillars, and its beautiful statues and other embellishments, is so superbly decorated, that next to the Capitol, of which the ever-venerable Rome boasts, the whole world has nothing worthier of admiration. In it were libraries of inestimable value; and the concurrent testimony of ancient records affirm that 70,000 volumes, which had been collected by the anxious care of the Ptolemies, were burnt in the Alexandrian war when the city was sacked in the time of Caesar the Dictator 

It never happened. It is a myth straight out Enlightenment propaganda machines. If the Library of Alexandria even existed, it was destroyed centuries prior to Christian civilization.

Yes, the Serapeum, which had long empty libraries that contemporary historians noted were empty, was destroyed, on the Emperor's orders after Christian hostages had been murdered by Pagan Alexandrians. Why doesn't Eunapius of Sardis write about the horrors of the Christians he hated destroying a precious library? Because it never happened. Edward Gibbon pulled it from thin air out of his ass.

&gt;Show me where I'm getting any of that history wrong.

Merry Christmas.

SublethalDose,socialskills,1388805937.0,"Hey, it's me from ten years ago!  Hi, me from the past!  I actually had a girl ask me why I wasn't touching her more the third or fourth time we went out.  Now, that was a lesson I took to heart with great success with *her*, but that was pretty easy because we were dating, we were getting along great, and I knew (obviously) that she was cool with me being a little more affectionate.  When I got back to random people and women I was, say, flirting with or on a first date with or just old friends with, I was back to having no fucking clue and being paralyzed by fear of doing something horribly offensive.  But do believe me when I say it's a LOT easier to touch a woman when you're dating her and you know she likes you; that's how most people who are terrified of physical contact get started.

But dating is something that you might not be able to just snap your fingers and do just because you now have this very specific motivation for doing it.  Also, you'll never learn from making out with someone how to touch someone who doesn't want to make out with you yet, or ever.  Thankfully, there's something you *can* do that doesn't require any social savvy and very minimal social risk-taking.  You just have to sign up for a class and pay a very reasonable fee, and for a few hours a week, you'll be touching a rotating array of willing female partners under the guidance of an instructor who will tell you exactly where to put your hands.

That's right, I'm talking about a dance class.  A swing dance class, to be specific, though I'm sure there are other forms that would do just as well.  In a dance class, you'll spend a good portion of the class in physical contact with a woman, and the contact is dictated by the form of the dance and by the need to communicate and coordinate between partners.  You will have the experience of building a mental connection with different partners through a physical connection based on touch and pressure.  It's a highly social experience, yet the touching is dictated by the logic of the dance, so you don't have to worry that you'll do something wrong because you misread the social dynamics.  It's all a technical performance, and yet at the same time it isn't *just* that, which is why people dance in the first place.

I guarantee that after a few months of dancing, you'll not only be much more comfortable with touching people, which will help clear your anxiety-produced mental haze and paralysis, but you'll also start to understand the social significance of different ways of touching people.  It isn't always simple — while writing this post I realized I [had a question for /r/AskWomen](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1ud4lq/how_do_you_feel_about_a_casual_hand_on_the_back/) — but with the anxiety out of the way, or at least greatly reduced, it's much easier to think, try, and learn."

omnihotdog,pagan,1388806043.0,"The blue one looks to be sodalite. 

The more rectangular shaped green one is likely Aventurine, it should feel a little heavy for it's size and look almost grainy really up close. If it's a little too light for it's size, it might be Jade. 

The bigger green one close to those two looks like it could be amazonite. 

The heart shaped green one is a toughie. I want to say serpentine based on the luster but the color's a little off, unless it was 'enhanced' to be greener. It could be a jasper, those can look like anything. It could also be Epidote but that one's harder to come by whereas the other two are pretty much your typical gift-shop fare, and jasper isn't unusal to find in tumbled stone mixes for crafts and gardens. 

The brown one looks like some kind of agate.

The first two are right off Glenwood and the third is a little further but it's maybe 1/10 mile from Trophy Brewing and next door to Charlie Goodnights. There are also some older apartments right there that are significantly cheaper. I looked at the Hudson a few years back and I don't know that they had 1BRs. I had an apartment in Founder's Row (corner of Blount and Davie) a few years ago that was really reasonably priced and very big. It was 2 floors, 2BR 2.5BA and ~$1400.

Try padmapper.com and rentingraleigh.com (Glenwood Agency). I'm sure you're aware but all the places you listed, if they even have 1BRs, are going to be in the neighborhood of $1500 or more with nothing included. I know the apartment in the Hudson my roomate and I almost rented was ~$2000 for a 2BR. And this was probably 4 years ago. There are apartments in some of the old houses in Oakwood and off Glenwood that are much cheaper if you're just looking for something with a little character."

Reading this article pointed out something that I had never thought about. We are triggered about weight comments because we naturally assume being fat is considered an unattractive quality. For many cultures, that isn't necessarily so. If we can step back and see it from the eyes of other people, rather than our own self-critical perspective, we might find that what they say isn't that offensive.

You have to sit down in the shower to catch your breath. You have random bruises. Your hair is dry, brittle, and falling out. You have memory issues. You get sore easily. You're constantly exhausted.

There is no sugar coating it. Fighting will be hell. You may even relapse a few times, because the safety of anorexia is much more comforting than food could ever be. There will be days you scream at food. Your problem isn't as simple as ""eat."" It will suck. Majorly. You'll hate life. But you don't realize you're living in a fog of misery and hatred. 

It's your choice. Nobody can force you to get help. I'm sure, however, you don't want help. I'm sure if this was me last year, is read this comment and scoff, and promptly seek assurance in ""pro-ana"" websites and read all about new ""diet"" trends in the community (aka starving, drinking water, and starving).

mike5f4,short,1388806342.0,"Trim down about 10 lbs  to thin out your face a little.

 Hair should be raiser cut, and ask them to trim your eye brows.

 I recommend contact lenses, people in general just look better without glasses, they take a little getting use to, but it is well worth it.

 If you want to have facial hair, (I don't think you need it) keep it very short and sharp edged. never let it grow on your neck.

Get some tanning. You can get a good self tanner if you are worried about sun damage. Make sure you use a well known brand name. For your face I recommend (Neutrogena self tanner face) and make sure you put some around your eyes, under eyebrows. Also under eyes. This will make your eyes look more deep set. 

Body: work on shoulders and arms to give you a V shape. I suggest pull ups. Start slow and increase as you get stronger and able to do more.

You have enough good facial structure to look handsome if you do the things I recommend.

To answer your question: 2142 was the last BF game that was PC only. It was also the last BF game to focus on the core game play that made Battlefield games good. Large maps, good vehicles and balanced player classes, a good balance of unlocks and achievements, teamwork and commander options.  Sure BF4 is a good game and I am impressed by it but its still not the same as the good old days. BF4 is a big improvement from Bf3 thats for sure. "

Yes, this industry was an old boys club. I can tell you that this is decreasing as the old guard moves out. What is not increasing to help keep the problem from resurfacing is the new guard being female. 

Unfortunately, our industry *is* a proving ground -- but there is a unique opportunity in our industry. You can volunteer your time and contribute to open source projects under a gender-neutral handle. Of course, you'll take some hard knocks as your skill increases but it won't be because you're a girl.

sockalicious,changemyview,1388806552.0,"What fixed this for me was a graphic representation in, of all places, Stephen Covey's *7 Habits of Highly Effective People*.  He drew 2 circles, one named the Circle of Concern, the other called the Circle of Influence.  The two circles have the same center - you - and one always contains the other.  The idea is that people have things they are concerned about, and they also have some power to influence and change things.

When the Circle of Concern contains the Circle of Influence and is much larger than the Circle of Influence, you have relatively powerless people, worrying, debating and endlessly arguing over things that they have no ability to have any influence over.  

When the Circle of Influence is much larger than the Circle of Concern, here you have a powerful person who doesn't care about the effects of his decisions.  This kind of person doesn't spend much time talking but can cause great harm.

When the two circles match in size, the pointless conversations that you are talking about tend to stop happening.  People work to change the things they care about instead of just endlessly talking about it all the time.

Here's something else to know: people can widen their Circle of Influence over time.  It's a good idea for those people to have at least some of the things they're concerned about all worked out by then; because people with a lot of influence are *always* busy and pressed for time.  Young people often spend a lot of time talking things out; some of them grow up to become empowered to change the world for the better."

handshape,Calligraphy,1388806693.0,"Top pen is a fountain pen, perfect for the cursive handwriting you're doing. Note the bead at the tip -- this is a good first ""everyday"" pen.

Bottom pen is what I'd call a medium-nib pen, suitable for a beginning calligrapher. Given the style of your cursive handwriting, I'd suggest starting with an [Italic/Chancery](https://picasaweb.google.com/tipstricks1/ItalicHandwritingTomGourdie1955) hand. Get yourself some ordinary lined paper, place it under a sheet of white photocopier paper, get some good light, a glass of whatever tickles your fancy, and *take your time*.

Your first few pieces will be rough. Don't give up -- like music, writing, or any other art, a big part of the magic is to relax and let things flow."

There's more representation of them in the media, they seem to get more focus in many pride events, etc. This isn't to say that it's easy to be a gay man or anything, because there certainly still is rampant homophobia, but I do think that they usually get a bit more acceptance and/or visibility.

another30yovirgin,ForeverAlone,1388807030.0,"Well, look, I can diagnose the problem. I tend to treat women like they're my friends, even if I think they're attractive. For the most part, I don't expect that it's going to go anywhere, and unless a woman starts flirting with me first, I don't feel comfortable flirting back. As time goes on and I'm more comfortable with them, I sort of test the waters, but still *very* cautiously, because I don't want to lose her friendship. Then I usually pull back because I worry she'll react negatively. Usually I'll end up sort of vaguely pushing for a couple weeks or months, but never really committing to a ""move"". Usually this is emotionally exhausting for me, because I'm overthinking everything she does and every time I have a setback, it feels like she's rejecting me. Then, if there's some sort of pressure (like, for instance, she's getting laid off, so I won't see her again at work; or she's quitting the class where I met her), I'll be a bit bolder, possibly even asking her out. 

I know that's the wrong approach. You don't have to tell me what's wrong with that or how I should be doing it differently. The problem is, I keep doing it that way. For me, it's always a high stakes game, because it's really hard to build up the courage to ask someone out. So right now, I don't even know this girl that well. She's nice and cute and friendy, but I don't really know if we have much in common. At the end of the day, she might not be my type at all. I'm upset because it felt like there was a chance it might go somewhere--it felt like maybe I'd get the courage to ask her out properly--and now that it doesn't look like she's interested, that *hope* is gone.

Now, I should point out, earlier in the summer, I was doing some volunteer work and ended up chatting with this woman who was there. She was nice enough and we had a good time. At the end, I wanted to go to the store and she said she'd like to go to, so we went. Then we had lunch together. When all of that was finished, I walked her to her bus stop. I decided, fuck it, I'll just ask for her number. So I did, and she gave it to me. After that, though, I wasn't really interested in her any more. It's not that she gave me her number. It's that we didn't have much shared experience. I didn't have any real feeling for her. There was no attachment. And for me, unless I feel that attachment, it's infinitely easier to just let her go than to ask her out. I *did* ask her if she wanted to do something, but it was short notice, and she already had plans, and I didn't feel like asking after that.

So, that was a very long way of saying ""I know I'm doing it wrong, but when I try to do it right, it just doesn't feel worth the stress""."

I dealt with it for about 1.5 years of the nearly 3 years we were together. I was patient, very very patient, with him during that time, even though at the bottom of it I was pretty insecure about the possibility that I didn't turn him on anymore.
He initially said it might have something to do with his ex, who cheated on him with his roommate/best friend after 7 years of dating, and all the verbal abuse she put him through during their relationship. 

I asked him to see a therapist about it after it became clear that simply listening and empathizing wasn't going to solve the problem. He agreed... then never did it.

I broke up with him after a year and a half without sex, not because I'm some hornball (I'm the opposite, actually), but because he wasn't willing to confront his problems (there were many more of them outside of this) in any adult manner whatsoever. Not long after that, he broke down and told me he had been raped shortly before we started dating, and that his problems in bed were almost certainly related to this... I felt like shit after that, but I was already out of love with him because he hadn't been affectionate towards me in almost 2 years. I had already given up.

We're still great friends somehow, and he doesn't seem to have a problem with his sex life nowadays... I think he eventually found a confidence boost after we broke up -- he finished school finally and accomplished some other things, dated a few girls, etc. I don't know if he ever saw a therapist about it, but he is clearly over the problem."

I did however get her a leapfrog but she is almost a little TOO young for that still.  For an example, she loves Mickey Mouse, so I got her this Minnie's Bowtique game where you take orders and make bows.  But there are some pretty complex tactile moves you have to make based off what the instructions are.  And she just doesn't have the vocab to understand what needs to be done and gets frustrated; plus, she is very independent and won't let me show her so she can imitate, she want's to do it herself or not at all.

This is a solid suggestion, and I sincerely appreciate it.  It just seemed to backfire in my case =(  Thank you nonetheless =)"

Step 2:  Extract all the mp3 files (except the Silent Tracks) to the “Music” folder. Copy MW/TR/BM original explore tracks into the Music folder as well, leaving filenames unaltered. Don’t worry if you don’t have them anymore, you can totally disable  Original Music option in game (refer to the Music Menu section).  


Step 3:  Either rename the Explore and Battle folders to “Explore disabled” and “Battle disabled” or overwrite the default tracks with the Silent Tracks available in a separate archive (you should if you are using WM Installer for other mods). Without this step, MW original tracks might conflict with the mod. However you can leave Explore Music Folder name unchanged if you want to listen tracks you put in this folder inside cells added by other mods, but they might start playing even in the cells covered by this mod.

iwannalynch,WritingPrompts,1388807397.0,"I finally got a date. It was hard for me to go up to her, wiping my sweaty hands on my jeans, stammer out niceties, and get to the main point. I had mulled it over for days, worrying, twisting the variable scenarios left and right, until my insecurities grew fantastic and ugly. But on that day, I swallowed a boulder-sized knot in my throat and asked her out, my dignity be damned. She said yes. I was so excited I nearly forgot to set a time and place.



The date went. I wouldn't say much more than that. It wasn't love at first date, gazing into each other's eyes over a plate of spaghetti. We had small talk. I talked about the new book I was reading, my childhood as a shy child, my current classes. She talked about her piano lessons and her biology labs. I told her she was beautiful. She smiled and peered down into her plate. We later ordered wine, and she graciously poured a glass for me. I don't drink much, and I didn't on this date, but she gulped hers down like it was water. 


At the end of the date, I took her hand and led her to the cash, where she insisted on paying her share. At first, I resisted, but inside, I was quite pleased. Here was a girl who didn't depend on men to pay for things. A few swipes at the machine later, the buck dropped back to me. ""I can't get my card PIN right,"" she mumbled, rubbing her eye. Her mascara smeared. It made her look like a cute one-eyed panda. With a longing sigh, I paid for the meal, under the sharp eye of the frowning waitress. 


""Would you like us to call you a taxi?"" She asked. I said ""yes"" at the same time that my date said ""no"". The dour waitress frowned again. 


""I... I can just call my room-mate... She- she owes me one. Yeah."" 


""No, I insist,"" I replied. I had to be firm, I remembered, smile and be firm,  and show her that I was be a gentleman and could take care of her. ""Besides, you look like you've had a bit too much wine. We should just get you home so you can get some rest."" She looked down at the counter and agreed shyly. The waitress stared at us a bit longer unsmilingly, until she bent down to dial for a taxi.


The taxi ride was quiet. I held her hand in mine, and she didn't pull it away. After a while, she rested her head on my shoulder and fell asleep, her hair resting just inches from my nose. She smelled like wine and soap.


When we arrived at her place, I roused her from her sleep and helped her to her door. She struggled with her keys, finally resting her forehead on the door in frustration. ""Here, let me help you,"" I said, gently taking her keys, ""look, you've been trying to stick your car key into your keyhole."" She gave a high-pitched giggle as the door opened. I put my hand on the small curve of her back and gently guided her in. It took me a lot of daring to do that, and I felt the texture of her dress and the hear of her body linger on my fingertips even after she moved away. 


We stopped in the narrow corridor, next to the table where I put her keys. We stared at each other, or perhaps I stared at her, and she looked at a point on the wall behind me above my shoulder. I supposed she was just as shy as I was, as she hadn't looked me in the eye since the second half of the date. Well, it was now or never. I leaned in for the kiss. She gave a gasp, and teetered to the left, hitting the hallway table. ""I'm sorry! I- I'm feeling a bit out of it. Maybe some other day."" I was puzzled, and grabbed her shoulder to keep her from falling again. 


""It's alright,"" I said, ""maybe you just drank too much."" I brushed her hair out of her face. It had fallen out of its ponytail, and now framed her face messily. I rubbed her bare arm gently with my other hand to calm her; I could feel the goosebumps of her soft skin and the taut muscles underneath. ""You really shouldn't drink so much."" Her lips were parted in a pant, and her eyes were unfocussed. She was beautiful, so very beautiful. I leaned in, again, for another kiss, but this time, she pushed me pack. 


""No, I'm sorry, don't.""


I felt the hurt vividly like a punch to the kidneys. ""Please,"" I implored, ""I paid for dinner, I paid for the wine, I didn't even drink from it, and I took you home! Please, just a kiss!""


At that, her eyes widened, and she pressed herself against the wall. ""No! Please, no, just go. Please.""


""I-""


""Just go."" 


I looked at her a moment longer, taking in her flushed face, her long shapely neck, and the neckline that seemed to plunge a little bit too far, and I left without a word, closing the door with more force than I would have liked. I sat down on the porch and buried my face in my hands. A second later, there was the sound of scrambling behind the door, and the loud clacks of the door being bolted. That was my first date, and it ended in disaster. I didn't even even get to kiss her.  I soon heard gentle sobbing from inside the house, muffled by the door.


I shouldn't have let her drink the entire bottle.

Here is the conclusion:  

&gt; To summarize my main points: A few lucky men are at the top of society and enjoy the culture’s best rewards. Others, less fortunate, have their lives chewed up by it. Culture uses both men and women, but most cultures use them in somewhat different ways. Most cultures see individual men as more expendable than individual women, and this difference is probably based on nature, in whose reproductive competition some men are the big losers and other men are the biggest winners. Hence it uses men for the many risky jobs it has.

&gt;Men go to extremes more than women, and this fits in well with culture using them to try out lots of different things, rewarding the winners and crushing the losers.

&gt;Culture is not about men against women. By and large, cultural progress emerged from groups of men working with and against other men. While women concentrated on the close relationships that enabled the species to survive, men created the bigger networks of shallow relationships, less necessary for survival but eventually enabling culture to flourish. The gradual creation of wealth, knowledge, and power in the men’s sphere was the source of gender inequality. Men created the big social structures that comprise society, and men still are mainly responsible for this, even though we now see that women can perform perfectly well in these large systems.

&gt;What seems to have worked best for cultures is to play off the men against each other, competing for respect and other rewards that end up distributed very unequally. Men have to prove themselves by producing things the society values. They have to prevail over rivals and enemies in cultural competitions, which is probably why they aren’t as lovable as women.

&gt;The essence of how culture uses men depends on a basic social insecurity. This insecurity is in fact social, existential, and biological. Built into the male role is the danger of not being good enough to be accepted and respected and even the danger of not being able to do well enough to create offspring.

&gt;The basic social insecurity of manhood is stressful for the men, and it is hardly surprising that so many men crack up or do evil or heroic things or die younger than women. But that insecurity is useful and productive for the culture, the system.

&gt;Again, I’m not saying it’s right, or fair, or proper. But it has worked. The cultures that have succeeded have used this formula, and that is one reason that they have succeeded instead of their rivals."

When I first started at school my Mum told this teacher that there were concerns I also had endo. This teacher soon became my favourite, The only teacher to allow me to run to the bathroom mid-lesson to avoid leaking, To let me take my Ponstan in class despite the ""no drugs"" rule, To let me bring a heatpack to class and to wear earplugs and sunglasses in class (Menstreal migraines) She was always willing to understand.

My other teachers weren't even mildly accommodating, Like your cheerleading coach they just saw no reason that periods should effect ones day-to-day life. I stained many chairs, threw up on many desks and spent many lessons crying and blacking out.

At my highschool reunion last year I was talking to my favourite teacher, she's had a total hysterectomy and is on HRT and feels great, we were talking very openly about our cycles, in particular I was talking about the lymphatic bruising and rectal bleeding I experienced as a teen when menstrating, when another female teacher who used to be awful to me overheard and screamed ""What? that seriously happened to you in grade 7? oh my gosh, why didn't you say so? Oh dear, I was so fucking rude to you"" then she hugged me.

The thing is, If I had of told her back when I was 12 that I was having these symptoms she would of told me to stop exaggerating and get back to work. I doubt what she heard at the reunion will change how she treats her current menstruating students."

Because this is *her* decision, she may interpret any pain you show as being the result of her hurting you. ""By having an abortion, I hurt the man I love,"" is *not* something that should be allowed to flit across her mind for even a moment. I'm not saying you should be an emotionless automaton, but remember to express your emotions in a way that are unlikely to be misinterpreted as resentment against her.

Be there for her. Mourn with her. Treat the abortion like you would a natural disaster - unavoidable and nobody's fault.

This is something you are *both* going through. She's almost certainly going to go through much more emotional trauma than you, but remember that strong relationships are mutually supportive. You're probably going to break down in front of her, *and that's okay*. But, as I said, don't ever make her feel like *she* hurt you. *The abortion* hurt you, and that's not her fault.

I had an abortion that I haven't regretted for even a moment. It was about as emotionally harrowing as having a tooth pulled. Unfortunately, my husband's didn't handle it quite so well. He's never second-guessed my decision, but he's quite often ended up fairly melancholy after looking at our daughter and wondering what her younger sibling would have been like. I had to be there for him, and it was easy to mistakenly think he was upset with me because, after all, I was the one who put my feet in the stirrups!

I think it is good that things are over. When she (or anyone else) gives an attitude about *why* it ended, simply tell them that your (ex)fiance  has trust issues and carried her emotional baggage out on you.

On a side note, there are women out there that would happily entertain your kinks. My husband doesn't like to wear my underwear or anything of that nature, but I would be super turned on if he did.

We've already planned quite a lot of stuff. We're building a house together - thing is, it's just behind his parents'. But we're not really planning on living there for a lot of time - we're planning to rent the place so we can live somewhere else with the rent money.

It's difficult for him to get another job since he hasn't finished high school yet(had to drop out to work when I got pregnant). He's starting again next year, but he still has some years left since he's not going to go to school full-time. It's kind of difficult to explain. His dad loves to fire him. He literally does it once or twice a month. But the next day he's like ""hey are you coming to work or not?"". My boyfriend gets incredibly sad when he's fired... Makes me really sad too but I'm getting used to saying ""it's not true. You're going to work tomorrow, mark my words"". He was actually fired yesterday... guess who took him to work like nothing happened, today?

I work from home and earn well. It's difficult to work here though(meaning, at my mom's house, where I live) because my mom's always asking for something or the other, I have to help around the house a lot(it's quite big). I can only work at night so that restricts the money I make too, since there's only so many hours I can work. And if I stay up too late, then I don't get a good night's sleep and it makes my anxiety and other stuff worse, and am very fatigued all day.

I already know how to do a resume, he does too. I might get hired somewhere but I prefer to work from home because I want to continue studying(plus I earn waaay better), but I don't think he has many chances to get hired since, again, he hasn't completed high school. Everywhere we look, it's a requirement.

We've already checked lots of housing options. It's really complicated for us but we can do it for sure. I will be going to an university about 1 1/2 hour away... they don't have housing options and it's *extremely* expensive to live there(since it's the capital). We've been looking at houses/apartments near the train station(which is also near my mom's) since it would be better for his work, and my studies. It's a lot cheaper too!

Leaving the area is not an option, since the university I'll be going to in near here. This place is not cheap but not crazy expensive either, like some other places even closer to the capital. We can't leave for another province(we're not from the US) because the university options get more limited, though we'd sure love to."

And I never said, not once, that I was older than him. I'm sixteen. I honestly don't care about who is older; I was referencing the fact that the way he presented himself made him seem to have the maturity of a preteen. "

Irate_Rater,running,1388807710.0,"I write running parodies to songs. Last sunday I came up with:

**I'll Get a Run Out of You**

Sung to [""I'll Make a Man Out of You"" from Mulan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbp52Z9jRg0)

Lets get down to business, and go for a run!

You must start your training before the gun!

Your the slowest lot I've ever met, But you can bet before we're through,

Somehow I'll get a run out of you!

Surge until your legs are on fire, within!

Once you find your stride, you are sure to win!

You're a lazy slow pathetic lot, wearing basketball shoes,

But somehow I'll get a run out of you!

(To run distance!)

We must be fast as racing Kenyan,

(To run distance)

With all the stride of a tall sprinter

(To run distance)

With all the strength of a discus thrower,

Training for track through the *whole* winter!

Time is racing toward us, till leagues arrive!

Run some extra miles, and you might survive!

You're unsuited for the distance core, So pack, go home, your through.

How was I to get a run out of you?

(To run distance!)

We must be fast as racing Kenyan,

(To run distance)

With all the stride of a tall sprinter

(To run distance)

With all the strength of a discus thrower,

Training for track through the *whole* winter!

(To run distance!)

We must be fast as racing Kenyan,

(To run distance)

With all the stride of a tall sprinter

(To run distance)

With all the strength of a discus thrower,

Training for track through the *whole* winter!

Dookiet,AdviceAnimals,1388807725.0,"I don't think it's about semantics. I think it's about clarity. Saying your a small business owner implies (wether right or wrong) a person who employs others. OP on the other hand is an individual who is self employed (the more common term for a owner/sole employee situation) who has never had health coverage before. Wether OP meant to or not his title and meme are misleading. I think more than likely he just thinks of himself as a small business owner, and meant to point out his own situation as he sees it. The problem arrises with our implicit understanding of words like small business. Most people probably assume that means he has several employees whom he already had covered previously."

You are shitting me right? He was replaced by a **rookie** who costed the team **one third** of the cost of Kluwe, and who put up better rookie stats than Kluwe did in his rookie year. Kluwe is old, expensive, and has had a previous leg injury. Locke is young, fresh, has had a better rookie performance than Kluwe did when he was signed, and is looking like a more promising NFL punter. No special teams coordinator in the entire NFL is interested in Kluwe. He was signed by the Raiders shortly after being cut by the Vikings, but was then cut by the Raiders before the regular season started because Kluwe performed more shitty at camp than the Raiders' backup punter.

another30yovirgin,self,1388808092.0,"Let's face it: if God were a person, we'd think He was terrible. He is apparently omnipotent and omniscient, and yet He lets all sorts of shitty things happen. Then apparently He wants us to worship him. That's like the equivalent of me having an ant colony and demanding that the ants worship me, right? If God is so amazing, why does He need a bunch of people to worship Him? And then He just lets all sorts of shitty things happen to good people. He could help them! There's no question! Is it really part of His great plan that you had to get raped? What the fuck is wrong with Him? There's nothing good that came out of that. Nothing! The memory will haunt you for the rest of your life. Hopefully your rapist will be caught and will go to prison, but that may not happen too. In either case, your rapist ought to feel awful about what he did for the rest of his life. Women everywhere will feel less safe. Nothing good came of this. Nothing. Fuck God. I could go on and on about all of the terrible things that God lets happen or fails to do, but you all get the point.

Seriously, if I see God in the afterlife, I will spit on Him.

That said, I miss believing. I liked the ritual of it and the comfort. I just can't keep doing it. It's too awful to worship someone who apparently could solve all of the world's problems but fails to do so."

Also keep in mind that there may be some changes to his personality, and try not to take things personally if he is more easily frustrated or has mood swings. It's the nature of the beast, and the more support and love he has from you and his family, the better. If you ever catch yourself thinking or saying ""Why won't he just ______!!"" the answer is probably ""Because he had a brain injury"" and not just a lack of understanding or compassion or love on his part.

Every women in my family now has a confirmed diagnoses of endo. I don't because most doctors say my pelvic pain, heavy long and frequent periods, passing out, menstrual migraines and vomiting, rectal and renal bleeding is all just IBS and IC, Its tough, I haven't had sex in several years, I haven't been unable to walk unaided in over 6 months, Ever since I came off the pill my symptoms went from being only while on my period to being every single day. I think that's why I was vomiting (too much pain, pressure on my gut etc) I'm on Implanon now which is why I think the vomiting is less frequent.

Australia is a little behind the 8 ball on endometriosis, and weird conditions in general, there is a speciality endo clinic but you have to have a diagnoses before you can attend. Its tought because I obviously have some other issues and it might not be endo causing the pelvic pain, doctors either look at the big picture and say ""nothing fits"" or they look at each individual symptom and get lost on the small details.

BullsLawDan,Libertarian,1388808425.0,"&gt;Touched a nerve?

No, I'm just dismissive of ridiculous nonsense like suggesting that judges will always rule in favor of the government because they are employed by the government.  I'm dismissive of it because I have (1) gone up against ""the government"" and won, and (2) worked for a federal judge who held ""the government"" and their cases in no high esteem, and ruled against them more often than not.

&gt;I believe in the legal field this is sometimes referred to as ""conflict of interest"".

No, actually, it's not.  A conflict of interest occurs when a judge has a pecuniary interest in the outcome of a particular case.  Judges don't have pecuniary interest in the outcome of any particular case involving ""the government,"" because, as a (nominally) functioning republic, we have an *independent judiciary.*  This means they get paid and promoted the same no matter how the case works out.  

&gt;Heh. It would be impossible to prove.

How would it be impossible to prove?  It would be easy to prove, and in fact the government would have to admit it.  There's this little concept in our justice system where the government is not allowed to hide how they got the evidence they are using to prosecute a crime.

&gt;Spare me your law school textbook missives.

Such ""missives"" become necessary when dealing with someone like you who is completely ignorant of basic legal concepts, yet tries to argue about them (standing, conflict of interest, discovery of evidence, independent judiciary, etc).

It wouldn't be so bad if you could clear out towns, or a second of town or something and search it, but if you made a single sound, and if even a single zombie saw you, you'd either have to run, or get trapped and die and that wasn't fun at all.

I hope we see maybe 4 times the amount of zombies we have no, and have they be relative to the area.

Perhaps if you spent more effort learning and Improving your skills and education you wouldn't be the sort of absolutely pathetic tragic loser that begs for support on the internet for handouts because he is so incompetent and irresponsible that he cant even provide basics for himself or his wife.

You see luckily having a good education and a professional work history allows me to formulate a skill set and intellect that actually rewards me in the real world, I have never begged for financial help or handouts such as a loan or faced homelessness because i am well educated professional adult who has no trouble getting employment because of my track record and professional successes.

I think your time could be spent better elsewhere taking care of the car crash that is your life, instead of trying to think you are somebody intelligent and worth listening to on matters you clearly lack the mental capacity to understand.

A word of advice for the future, before you go engaging with someone who clearly is more intelligent than you, i would ensure my life situation and history isn't so absolutely pathetic that upon its discovery not only do i lose all credibility that i didn't really have anyway, but that seeing the truth exposed on my screen doesnt sink my heart in the horrible realisation that it is actually true and i know it.

This is not true. That's why each broader movement has so many different subgroups. People are individuals, not hive-minds. No label is perfect, nor does any one person truly fit perfectly with that label.

Also, your description of what feminists ""generally"" do is merely a generalization. I've had many, many discussions with people where they were willing to debate or answer questions, and I always make an effort to do so unless someone is deliberately being offensive. Although, it is true that further discussion is often easier whenever someone is at least somewhat familiar with theory, thus feminists (or any other person with extensive knowledge in a topic) will often recommend reading to people who are interested in finding out more.

I can't speak for all feminists or the entire movement, but the way I try to approach things is to try to work with people to create awareness of problems, find solutions, and work toward a common goal. It's not about who is superior, because no one is truly superior, at least not in the sense that you're using the word. What's more important is that people learn from one another; sometimes I am teaching other people, but just as often I learn new things as well. No one knows anything, so anyone who thinks that they're superior to everyone else has a flawed personality or worldview.

That's my two cents, anyhow."

I've been told things like ""oh, I thought you were into sex, but I guess not"" for not being interested in threesomes.  I didn't know liberation meant I couldn't have limits.  That's not very liberating.

I would **love** if ""sexual liberation"" and ""sex-positive"" went back to what it was supposed to mean - people being able to make the sexual choices that are best for them.  

I'm just happy these movements weren't as large when my sex related PTSD was at it's height.   I truly don't know how I would have navigated relationships being asked for sexual things I don't have interest in and feeling like all resources were telling me I was a prude for not just doing it at whatever personal expense.

I remember not so long ago making a post on a site in tears saying I had tried everything I could, anal still hurt.  I had done all the guides, all the books, all the videos.  I just couldn't.  All but maybe two responses told me the same things to try, that I wasn't doing it right, etc.  How did we get to ""liberation"" meaning to tell someone in pain to ignore their body and suck it up so she's not a prude?

I will stand behind those who love threesomes, those that love anal, those with kinks, those into things I may never be.  I will say that they should have every right to do those things so long as their partner is also into them.  I will stand behind those that want casual sex, non-monogamy, or any other setup that works for all involved.  Why do I feel so few stand behind me for not wanting them?"

Do I actually give a fuck that some PO was completed and engineering shit got done? No. I care that he is happy talking about it and happy sharing with me. Similarly, I am sure he feels the same way when I talk about baking or some shit like that.

If it's possible to postpone it just for *one* more day it could make a big difference. Opiates stay in your system for anywhere between 2-5 days, when I first suggested it's impossible I hadn't actually taken the time to study it a bit. Monday would be risky, but plausible. Again if it's possible to postpone do it, but seeing as you've already set it off once I'm sure there would be some speculation.

I've heard of people having to retake the test due to dilution in results, meaning that you would have to come back and take it again and it would most likely be gone by then (If the results are not instant). Other wise just exercise a fuckton and eat things like fruits, veggies and fiber. I don't know much else on the topic but theres [this](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/opiates/opiates_testing.shtml). I'm sure there are also various different resources and sites out there.

If you where planning on buying ""special drinks"" or powders to make the opiates not show up in a urine test, almost all of them are now actually tested for and can get you a more serious penalty than the opiates themselves. Hope I helped in the slightest, I wish you luck. Oh and have you ever seen or read ""Requiem for a dream""? It's really good."

Upgrading your ship should be a priority, before you buy upgrades for your hideout or yourself. Don't forget your mortars! They make taking forts much easier, and they can get you out of a jam if you find yourself surrounded by bigger ships. 

Send seized ships to Kenway's Fleet if the Jackdaw doesn't need repairing. You can reduce your wanted level by bribing people on shore, and most of the time you don't even want to reduce it--if it's up, Pirate Hunters come after you and they're a really good source of metal for ship upgrades.

mundabit,AdviceAnimals,1388809197.0,"It depends where you are in the cycle when you start taking antibiotics and how long the course of antibiotics is. waiting one full cycle is always safest, But in many cases the pill becomes effective again in 7 days.

This is because you can only really be fertile for 7 days a month max, so if those 7 days follow your antibiotic use, and you continue to take the pill during those seven days, you wont be fertile once they are over, and the pill will resume being effective. However if you are near your placebo week then you wont be taking the pill during the risk-period so you may need to wait a full cycle.

Of course if you take a mini-pill then its different again, and if you are on a multi-phasic again, the numbers change. Simple answer; if you are taking any form of birth control, understand is mechanism of action and how it effects your body to be concious of when it is and isn't effective.

Because of our work schedules, we never needed to figure out outside childcare. It was very easy to schedule medical appointments for the baby (and she had many).

If you don't think you'll get any good out of it, though, there's not much of a point in joining. If I were you I'd at least try it out for a little while just to see if I'd like it or not, but I wouldn't say it's unreasonable to not want to."

Some were retired from their first jobs and working on the project for a change.  I saw that experience as an asset, not as a threat.

I also got very upset a while back on there after there were two semi-large posts about a partner with pretty severe germophobia which extended to semen or vaginal juices.  Every comment minus mine and one other person with germaphobia said ""Ugh, so immature!  Tell him/her to grow up and get over it.""  About people who were taking steaming baths and having borderline anxiety attacks.  

Apparently if your mental issues seep into sex you're just an immature idiot who should get over it or be dumped.  Not even a mention of maybe seeing a professional as it was obviously a severe phobia.  Just that the people with the phobia were clearly ""sex negative.""

No room in sexual liberation for emotional or mental issues, I guess.  No room for physical pain either if it's in regard to anal or even PiV."

Usually I either death-stare at them until they start to feel uncomfortable or if that doesn't work, tell them that my psychiatrist agrees that it would be in society's best interest if people who actually didn't want kids didn't keep feeling pressured into having kids because while it gives him more business, he feels it's unfair to children to have to have parents who resent them. That tends to shut them up. Or if I want to shut them up and make them feel bad at the same time, I break into tears and sob something about never being able to have kids and whimpering something about never being able to replace my ""baby"" (implying either an infant mortality or a miscarriage) and putting my head down and looking really hurt and upset, but that's only if they're coming down on it really strong and I feel like being mean. haha.

theBergmeister,AskMen,1388809758.0,"I'm not here to judge you, your girlfriend, or your actions. I'm  just giving you my opinion on how to be ""supportive."" You made an error in judgement and now there are consequences to deal with. Scheduling an abortion is the most rash and potentially harmful decision you could make for your girlfriend and your relationship. Regardless of differing opinions on whether the fetus is alive or not in the earliest stages of pregnancy, you state that it is definitive that you know she is pregnant which means that your girlfriend has a living human being within her. Genetically unique and alive. If nature were to be allowed to take its course, a human child would be born into this world, with infinite potential as to how he or she could change this world for the better. I know you know this and that this is what you are trying to avoid, but there are other courses of actions that could be taken to avoid the financial impact that child would have on your young lives. I urge you to at the very least seek out a pro-life crisis pregnancy center and weigh the possibility of carrying the child to term, receiving financial and material support, and in your case probably adopting the child to a loving family who can provide for this child. This would be the most loving and supportive option for a man in your position."

mundabit,Health,1388810094.0,"I had pneumonia as a child and as a teen. I was hospitalised both times for it and treated accordingly. As a young adult I felt a familiar sickness and went to a GP to make sure it wasn't pneumonia again. He told me I had a ""stress cough"", it was a week or so before I went back, much sicker than before, to the same doctor who told me it was the common cold, then a second doctor at the same clinic who agreed with that diagnoses.

2 weeks later, probably the sickest I have been in my whole life, I went to the ER, where they gave me an X-ray and confirmed pneumonia, and sent me back to my GP with the letter of diagnoses for treatment. My GP did not read the letter, and instead wrote a refferal to a therapist to help me relax and get rid of my ""stress cough""

I ended up just going straight to the pharmacy, I was sick of doctors, The pharmacist loaded me up with  expectorants, gave me a  Cystic fibrosis therapeutic massage, and eventually after many, many phone calls the pharmacist found me a doctor willing to fax through a script if I faxed through my ER Letter. 

(I live in a country where the ER can not give you any medicine if your condition can be treated by a GP)"

Religion is simply one of the best things to ever happen to humanity. Humanity can only exist in a complex manner because of the existence of religion and religious ideas have been the catalyst for society interactions and base level of morality. Moralist and justice are both ideas that are deeply rooted into each as an individual and has to be derived from some great principle in order to truly dictate the actions of the individual. Morality and justice cannot be something that cannot be directly taught such as ""don't steal"" or ""don't murder"" because we live in a complex world where morality is often a shade of gray. It needs to be taught in a manner that is loosely up for interpretations because gray needs to exist within a set of morality. The teaching of most, I cannot think of a religion that doesn't, are done in highly interpretable methods that weave together to create a solid base morality with more complex ones left to interpretation of different evidence. An attempt to craft such a complex series of ideas about morality is basically a state crafted religion with is a terrible idea. Let's get to a rather black and white issue then a lesser gray one.
  
People do not kill each other because their is the fear of the state enforcing its laws, however, even in an instance where people know they can get away with murder most still do not because their base morality or principles prevent them from doing such an action which is what religion has given them. They will feel in their hearts that they have done something wrong. This feeling, this connection to another individual and the collective group has to be based in some construct and this construct is religious in base, we are all below God or Allah. The reason that atheists do not kill each other is because they are raised in a religious culture and ideas like general morality have been taught to them through ideological diffusion. If someones murder can benefit you tremendously then a logical reason that it should be done can be craft, however, even atheists will not murder that person because they cannot logically explain away a base morality that exists within them. Religious propagates these ideas and allow society to function. 
  
Even in gray issues like being kind to strangers we still get better results with religion. A religious person is taught to always be polite to strangers and everyone because their is some final judgement of them as a person, even with the harm of created guilt it is still better that people fear a final judgement because it keeps people in accord with their morals. One should be kind to strangers because God has said so and that alone is enough for me to be a decent human beings. Sure, many people have perverted this argument to allow things like slavery and homophobia, however, many gain great empowerment from this idea. God loves and created everyone so I should love and make peace with everyone. This idea allows great social acceptance for all disenfranchised people.  
  
Then their is the most important idea of religion which is answering the impossible questions of the world. Few widowers are fundamentally better if they are told they will never heard, see, smell or touch their loved one again. Few father's of dead children, or siblings, or grandparents, or friends. Tragedy is a fact of life and learning to accept this is how we learn to handle grief. The idea that there is a heaven allows many people to find solace in death and solace in life. Religion allows people the ability to stretch the limitations of the world a little further then physically possible and create a theoretical gap where terrible sadness and tragedy can be stored until they are emotionally ready to deal with them. Religion is a needed construct for the human existence and social longevity. "

tangerinelion,Physics,1388810170.0,"If you're comparing the ""size of infinity"" you're comparing the cardinality of a set.  In most cases you have two infinities: aleph naught and aleph one (I don't feel like finding the correct Hebrew character).

The first means countable, the second means uncountable.  You can ask how many integers there are and begin to name them: 1, 2, 3 ...  The cardinality is then aleph naught.  

When you ask about reals, if you start at 0 and then say you can count either forwards and backwards and there will be two of each number such that you only need to count forward, that's all fine and well until you ask what the next number is.  So the reals are uncountable - aleph one.

Note that things you think are possibly uncountable are countable.  All you need to do is find a map between the integers and your other set.  For example: the cardinality of the set of integers is aleph naught.  The cardinality of the set of primes in also aleph naught.  But we intuitively ""know"" there are more numbers than prime numbers - yet the math says that's not the case.  The cardinality is the same. Similarly, the set of rational numbers is countable and therefore has cardinality aleph naught.  But we intuitively ""know"" that you can construct more numbers of the form ""a/b"" where a and b are both integers than you can numbers of the form ""a"".  I think (not 100% about this, but it makes sense at first glance) that the reals take away transcendental numbers would be a countable set - cardinality aleph naught.  I'm not sure how to form a Cantor pairing for that, though.

Until we can probe things on the Planck scale - which we're way far away from being to do - we won't be able to tell whether this has anything to do with the Universe or not."

Told him to back off, that I didn't want to talk to him any more, that his invasions of my personal space had made me feel sick with discomfort etc.  He finally got the message after that and we didn't talk for a year.

It's why so many people can't stand the neo-feminists who try to say that men have life so much easier and better, like it's sort of lala land. Men have it tough. There is a great series, which I can't recall it's name, that started with a super feminist who thought men where selfishly trying to maintain the patriarchy. So she decided to very convincingly dress like a man and enter their inner circles for 6 or more months. 

She ended up having to get committed to a mental institution because he world view was so severally shattered. Everything she fought for was a huge misunderstanding. She came out basically saying she's happy to be a woman, because at the end of the day, women really are the ones in a position of privilege, and men are the ones that have it the hardest. It's just that most women don't understand this. All they see is them as business owners, but fail to care about the other things involving being a man.

I threw up in my mouth several times from the smell, I was very sensative to it, and now, back home and safe with clean air, I have a rising pressure in my headband which is warning me of a migraine.

I've come to the conclusion that the *sensitivity* to the smell is like an aura, but the smells themselves are triggers.  Aura is still kind of the wrong word though, because it isn't a warning of a migraine or something that is pre-migraine, But its definitely a symptom of my migraine syndrome that is not a pain-type symptom.

I would be careful with using air fresheners in your dad's car, sometimes perfumes can be just as much of a trigger. A good clean-out is what you really need. If you can find a fragrance that isn't a trigger, stock up on it, for me, that's peppermint oil, not only can I huff that without consequence, it also opens my airways and takes away sinus pressure. I rub a bit of peppermint oil on the inside of a surgical mask before I leave for some-place smelly, That allows me to avoid triggers without imposing on other people too much."

Edit: while I'm at it, what about religious parents who have suffered a  tragedy like the death of a child? There are plenty who stop believing in God for reasons like that, as an emotional response.

frsp,DebateReligion,1388810596.0,"&gt; Given that I've never rejected God (I merely reject human claims that he exists and can be known), it sounds like in your flavor of the afterlife I'm in very good shape. Arrive before God, say ""gosh, it's nice here, mind if I stick around?"" and I'm good to go.

Does your actions in daily life live up to the Ten Commandments, the Beatitudes, and the Sheep and the Goats discourse? That's all you have to ask yourself if you are not a believer.

&gt;But if that's the case, why did his son need to be tortured to death on my behalf?

Certainly, Jesus dying a natural death would have been sufficient, but the excruciating method of execution has a profound psychological effect of displaying both the evil of sin and infinity of God's love.

You seem to think that God ""tortured His son to death"" for the lulz, as if the Incarnation was an afterthought and the universe was not created for the Incarnation to begin with and an infinite expression of love was not always the idea.

&gt;And don't say it's because Christ had to pay the ""price"" of my state of ""original sin."" 

Then I won't, it's not like you just pwned me for putting that restriction on my argument.

The Incarnation sanctified human life, the Crucifixion sanctified human death, and the Resurrection sanctified and made possible human transfiguration.

St. Athanasius said that ""God became man that man might become God."" Sanctifying grace changes human nature to become like God, and the body is an integral part of the human person, thus Jesus perfect the human person its entirety and offers grace to the faithful (and the unfaithful, anyone *can* be saved) to make man God. 

&gt;Why does my human free will earn me death in this god's view

Because you have sinned, and to sin is refuse to be human and to refuse to be human is to refuse to be what God created man to be and to do that is to exclude oneself from ever fulfilling the natural human destiny: to be perfected and returned to God.

&gt;why does the blood-magic of a demigod man solve the problem

[Bigot](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot)

&gt;a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially :  one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance. 


Your characterization seems to have put them well within the realm of being vocally against non hetero orientations. I'm not really sure how that isn't bigotry. I see no reason to excuse it just because someone grew up during a time when a political movement with fucked up social politics held power. 

Now I obvious know nothing of your parents. It's fantastic that you feel so confident that they won't have an extreme reaction to such news. They're very likely to be shocked at first because they obviously haven't thought of you as anything but hetero. One has to hope that (after the initial shock wears off) they would give up their disapproval when they've realized that they have loved a bisexual girl for 16 years. That could happen very quickly or it could take years. I've heard of both happening. Your guess would be best so you'll need to weight the discomfort of hiding this against the risk of being emotionally isolated/alienated from your family. It seems like a really difficult choice to wrestle with and I have a lot of sympathy for your struggle with this.

Well, since my name came up, might as well weigh in.

That shorter Men face all manner of real discrimination is a matter of easily and thoroughly documented fact. That Women do this most of all, is a painful and bitter pill for the Feministas to swallow. The reason why they reacted so strongly to this guy’s article, was because he exposed their blatant hypocrisy for what it is.

Both Chuck and I recently were over at Abagond’s blog, where a discussion about the beauty of White Women being an objective truth or a socially manufactured thing was taking place; many of the Black Women there were hopping mad that they had to face what they considered to be discrimination by White society for not fitting White beauty norms.

But when I pointed out the fact that shorter Men face as much if not more discrimination, especially at the hands of Women like themselves, they really lost it. I found the whole exercise fascinating, because I am sure these same Sistas would have no problem seeing the similarities between other groups that face forms of discrimination, like say, Blacks and Gays. But suggest that shorter Men face discrimination, first and foremost by Women themselves? Oh, no!

Over at Ferd’s blog, a discussion is taking place about Women and longer vs. shorter hair, and how Women once again try to shame Men into catergorically liking the latter, and when that doesn’t work, grumble and bowdown to the dictates of Men and grow their hair long. I found it an interesting counterpoint to this discussion, which centers around a Man and a dating liability that he has virtually no control over – his height. As much as the Sisterhood may not like it, the fact remains that they have options here – from wigs to extensions to simply growing their hair out. Shorter guys on the other hand, simply can’t go down to the cornerstore and buy some leg extensions. The only real options he has is elevator shoes. That’s about it. Whether that would have helped our young hero in the article above, is a moot point.

Another thing that struck me about all this is the fact that despite all the asides and odes to equality in our time, the truth remains, that Women are still given space to grouse about their real and perceived lots in life; Men on the other hand, are still expected – especially by Women – to simply suck it up and keep it moving. A greater example of rank hypocrisy, is harder to find, and hence further explains the Feminista’s Id Monster-like response to the guy’s article above. How dare he actually give voice to his limitations, his pain and suffering, his ill treatment by putatively progressive Women in the year 2010? All the while websites like Jezebel and Feministing and the like, make it their business to have daily, if not hourly, grousing sessions. Again, the sheer hypocrisy of it all, is astounding and boggles the mind.

I had to make 15 cards of notable people from the 16th-17th century with each needing 10 facts, their name, picture, etc. The problem was that I had to cite everything and I am very scared and paranoid about plagiarism, and since my emotions were ""amplified,"" I had one of my first memorable anxiety attacks.

miked4o7,politics,1388810821.0,"There are two different issues here.  Those articles are referring to how much more administratively efficient Medicare is compared to private insurers, which is true.  This is largely because private insurers were spending huge portions of their revenue on making sure they didn't insure people that needed lots of care.

What I'm referring to is the fact that Medicare reimburses doctors and hospitals by paying them set amounts per procedure and/or test.  This creates an enormous incentive for waste, as its in providers financial interest to perform as many procedures as they reasonably can.  This especially becomes the case after a practice or hospital buys expensive equipment like an MRI, so they'll need to perform MRIs to make the investment worth it.  Medicare right now only pays the doctors for each time the tests are actually performed.  This is why researchers estimate than an entire 33% of all procedures and tests performed in this country do not improve outcomes whatsoever.  An entire 33% of our entire healthcare system is waste."

WinterCharm,apple,1388810939.0,"Okay, here are a few quick tips: 

1. go through every setting in system preferences. All your system settings are here

2. If you click the name of an app in the top menu bar (it'll appear when that's the app which is active) there is a preferences menu. This is true for most apps, and all apps which follow apple's UI guidelines. 

3. Use the native mac apps - they are integrated into the OS, and you'll benefit from it - for example, contacts will not be marked ""wrong"" in word documents, etc etc. 

4. don't google things to figure them out. USE THE HELP MENU! Apple's help menu's search the other menus to find common commands. [Here's what I mean](http://www.acrobatfaq.com/atbref5/images/TBX_v5_0_0_Menu_Apple_Help.png) 

5. It will take you about 2 weeks to get used to things on the OS X side. Stick with it. :) 

6. Use Cheatsheet, which is an app that shows every single hotkey command in Any application, if you hold down the Cmd key. 

7. Cmd + [key] = ctrl + [key] in windows. So, Cmd + V = paste, Cmd + C = copy, etc etc. No need to re-learn common hotkeys. 

8. OS X handles RAM very differently -  do not worry about large amounts of ram consumption. It uses free ram as a cache for app data that can immediately be cleared if more ram is needed. It also compresses your ram if it needs more RAM, instead of using the page file. Paging is only a last resort in OS X. 

9. Do not bother with antivirus. Do not bother with defragmenting utilities (moot point if you have an SSD in your mac). DO NOT DOWNLOAD MACKEEPER (It's the worst kind of crapware - you have to pay for it, and it's aimed towards recent switchers). 

10. Once again, use apple's native apps for most things. When they can no longer meet your needs, consider moving to something else. For example, if iMovie isn't good enough for your video editing needs, consider Final Cut Pro X. But don't buy it unless you find yourself needing it. The native applications are VERY VERY good. Your mac comes with everything you need out of the box.

11. To handle weird zipped files (.7z) just get ""The Unarchiver"" which is a free app on the Mac App Store. 

12. USE TIME MACHINE - it is one of the best backup utilities out there - just use it with an external hard drive. Plug in the drive, format it for the mac, and then time machine will ask you if you want to use it as a backup drive. Every time you plug the drive in, the mac will create a backup of itself, cataloguing the recent changes. You can then restore any file from any backup (i.e., you can go back 34 days, and pull an image you deleted, and then go back 120 days and grab that same image before you edited it in photoshop, etc etc). You don't have to restore your mac entirely to a certain backup. You can just pick individual files or folders.

miked4o7,politics,1388811197.0,"&gt;But this would be just as, if not more, true for private insurance.

It is right now, but it probably wouldn't be if the system was started over or if Medicare was reformed.  Private insurance doesn't benefit from the pay-per-service structure, because then they have to pay out more often.  Private insurance wants you to pay your premium, and then never use care.  That's the ideal for them.  They use it though because providers aren't going to set up a whole other administrative system for each private insurer, and with Medicare/Medicaid/VA making up half of *all* medical expenditures in this country, their administrative requirements become standard.

He was the first FAAB person I had had any sexual relations with. I have had sexual tension with cis women, but never any desire to explore the female form. I really like men.

In regards to his family jewels, I was definitely curious. I did a lot of looking online, particularly at ftm porn. We'll just say I was pretty familiar by the time I got my hands on his junk. 

There isn't really anything you can say to guarantee a smooth sexual experience, but as I would recommend in every relationship, we always talk through expectations. That definitely helped the weirdness of first time sex (which is experienced with any new partner, trans or not).

I would say that our sexual relationship started slowly. He had no fear putting his hands, mouth, genitals anywhere on me. It did involve exploring and getting used to from my end. The first time we were together, he didn't get completely naked. The second time, I used my hands. A few times after that I got down and dirty with my mouth. It just took time, learning what someone with parts I've never seen likes. Side note, the parts my boyfriend have react just like those of my previous partners. I would offer the encouragement that sex with any person just involves finding out what feels good. Penis, vagina, octopus. It's all about everybody having a grand time.

My family does not know that he's trans. A few of my friends know, and of course his family knows, but generally everyone in our life only knows him as a male.

xenonscreams,running,1388811246.0,"""Running-specific core strength"" is core (hip/ab/back) strength (or stability, fine) that is actually activated to help you run with better form when you're tired rather than just getting stronger for funzies without helping you run any better. If getting stronger always helped you run faster, the world's top marathoners sure as hell wouldn't look like they do. 

Running Times put it well: ""This is known as core stability; think of core stability as the ability to resist movement. If you watch inexperienced runners, especially when they're tired, you'll notice a lack of control in the hips and shoulders. This excess movement can be thought of as energy leaks resulting in a reduction in propulsive forces. This lack of running economy will make you slower. The goal with core stability training is to coordinate breathing with trunk stiffness to eliminate potential energy leaks when running."""

Thebazilly,AskWomen,1388811360.0,"I'm in the same boat!  I've always been too lazy to put on makeup, and was generally unconcerned with it as a teen, except for special occasions (I'm 21 now, and managed to seduce a boyfriend and get a job without using makeup, by the way...).

I got a huge makeup kit for Christmas, and after using the eyeliner to give myself a unibrow and being scolded by my sisters for being silly, I decided to use it.

There's tons of tips out there for beginners.  (Seriously, just try Googling ""makeup for beginners"").  I found a lot of it a little too advanced for me.  I had to take several detours to find out what the heck BB cream is supposed to do, and wait, what's CC cream, are they different, and etc.

Here's what works for me.  First is don't overthink it!  You don't need to know how to do a smoky eye or which shade of lipstick works best with your outfit or anything.  Just experiment, and use colors you like.  Keep it simple.  I stole some of my younger sister's BB cream, and I like it infinitely more than foundation.  It doesn't leave you with a cakey feeling on your face.  Add a little eye shadow and mascara, and maybe some eyeliner if you think you won't stab yourself in the eye, and you'll already see a dramatic change.  Then you can work up to the fancy tips in magazines."

Manateecups,AskWomen,1388811411.0,"I was with a guy for four years, we were even engaged. He broke up with me because his family didn't like my lupus. I was heartbroken for about a month, but I slowly started to realize that it was a terrible relationship. 

Not only did he not help me with household chores, but he actually made them harder. He allowed his family to outright insult me and he never stood up for me. He didn't physically hurt me, but he liked standing in my way and blocking doors with his body so I couldn't go anywhere. He constantly made me feel less than because of my lupus, like I was lucky he would date me. 

I think the worst thing he ever did was right before we broke up. I wasn't feeling well, and things had been rocky between us because of his family saying disgusting things about me. He asked for sex and when I mentioned that I wasn't really up for it because of those reasons, he said he'd leave if I didn't. And I did. I still hate myself for that. 

It's been two years since the breakup and it honestly is the best thing he's ever done for me. I don't think I would have been smart enough to leave, but now that I'm out I realize how bad it was.

Now I think it's really important to take a step back, and often, and ask yourself if this is truly making you happy and if this is all for the best. "

I would watch the Disney movies growing up and instead of thinking about a princess to save, I thought about a prince charming to save me. I know, it's cliche but still.... 

As I grew older and started to hit puberty my twin brother and I discovered our father's Playboy magazines and he would abscond with them and I would just look at them and think, ""How boring."" To me, girls I could not imagine sexually in anyway. 

When you're younger, you have no real clue as to what sexuality is. Everything is normal is to you. I thought it was normal to like other boys, but I knew (because of my brother), that other boys liked girls.  

I think I hit my real sexual renaissance when I discovered internet pornography. So many questions were finally answered for me, because for a short while I was very confused, and here is why: the internet was one of the only places I could confirm and acknowledge my sexuality. I grew up really in the early 2000's, but even as early as 2004 I was seeing shit on TV about how gay men were the scourge of the Earth, how in some places I wouldn't be allowed to be a teacher or even a nurse. How I couldn't serve in the armed services... it was damaging. It also didn't help because I was effeminate and obviously gay, and that was what would send me home with black eyes and split lips. 

I thought for the longest time what I was was a horrid thing and tried my damnedest to pretend to be straight. Yeah, didn't help. 

IT wasn't until my family moved to New Hampshire I saw it as a clean slate and gained my famed, ""I DON' GIVA SHIT!"" Attitude that I really acknowledged who I was openly. Hell, it even gave me a lot of respect from others. 

I don't know about others, but I can say that I have ALWAYS known I was gay. But society did shove me back into the closet for a bit. Until there wasn't enough room for me, the unicorn, rainbows, and all the fucking glitter. 

SIDE NOT: I feel a need to say I have one of the most accepting and loving families in the world, and I am blessed to have them. Having them has most certainly made this an enjoyable ride :) "

frsp,Anarcho_Capitalism,1388811608.0,"&gt;Imagine a world government, democratically elected according to the principle of one-man-one-vote on a worldwide scale. What would the probable outcome of an election be? Most likely, we would get a Chinese-Indian coalition government. 

I don't think anybody is proposing to have a global direct democracy. Not that he's wrong in his thought experiment, but any large scale government is general at least republican if not even less democratic.

&gt;the ‘legitimate concerns’ of children to have ‘adequate’ and ‘equal’ access to ‘free’ hamburgers, lemonade, and videos.

Free hamburgers, lemonade, and videos? This is a bad thing? Fuck that, where can I sign up?

&gt;One-man-one-vote combined with ‘free entry’ into government — democracy — implies that every person and his personal property comes within reach of — and is up for grabs by — everyone else. 

True dat tho.

&gt;The rich are characteristically bright and industrious, and the poor typically dull, lazy, or both. 

OK Ayn Rand.

&gt;Supporting single mothers out of tax funds will lead to an increase in single motherhood, ‘illegitimacy’, and divorce.

This is the root of a major social problem. Take notes, people.

&gt;Ultimately, the course of history is determined by ideas, be they true or false, and by men acting upon and being inspired by true or false ideas. 

Correct.

Overall, not bad an article. I still retain a hope in local direct democracy with the right of secession, but mass democracy is a plague."

stefaniey,MakeupAddiction,1388811736.0,"I saw this a while back and I feel like I need to clarify a few things because the show is a bit sensationalist about how long she wears makeup for and it doesn't put things in perspective. 

* That is some seriously cheap looking makeup. There is nothing wrong with that but when you consider that most of the stuff comes from Walmart or drug stores, $4000 goes a long way. And that seems like a waste; how many dupes does she have? How often is she replacing products she has used up, like that green eyeliner? It looks like she applies that stuff several times a day (not even going to touch on why that's so unnecessary), she would need to buy it in bulk. So that's why $4K is a bit outrageous; consider the number of products you can get when everything is less than $10. 

* She says she loves makeup, needs it, still does it like a 70s/80s diva; that's unfortunate because she has never decided to change it up, just for fun, let alone try something different because she got bored. 

* Three hours?! When you do the same look every day, you get quicker at it. I can kill three hours messing around, I can kill three hours doing a perfect face. But if I did it every day for thirty years, especially while I had three daughters, I'd get quicker at it. 

* Pay your bills before you pay for makeup. That's a bad sign for her impulse control/mental state. That's a true addiction; psychologically speaking. When you put it before necessities. 

* 40 products for every day? If that was a yard stick for addiction, some of us would be institutionalised. 

* She doesn't follow hygiene protocols. Sleeps in it. Cakes extra stuff over the top when it doesn't need touching up. Her eyes get glued together, *and she's not wearing false lashes*. The dermatologist points out that leaving it on etc is damaging her skin and her eyes. 

* Therapist; she says she feels like she would have an anxiety attack without the makeup. 

So long story short; for her, makeup is a coping mechanism that she is entirely dependent on.

I tried to bubble between 15-20 from the slow-cats but lost a bit of focus when navigating and guestimating final positions of myself and you guys.

3rd pass was the worse, absolutely.  not only did I bump myself to a standstill, but I deviated from plan due to spotting a crow in line with my normal path.. I should have bounced and re-set, not spend so much time in range of your anti-tackle.

I had them out in the back country when it was -25C, -32 with windchill in Kananaskis a month or so ago and my hands didn't get cold.

Since you don't want the leather, there are these [Atlas Mitts](http://www.mec.ca/product/5027-998/mec-atlas-mitts-unisex/?h=10+50006+50020+50093&amp;f=10+50006+50093+50111) with synthetic palms. Pair those with a merino glove liner and you should be good.

The other option would be the [Overlord Mitts](http://www.mec.ca/product/5024-105/mec-overlord-mitts-unisex/?h=10+50006+50020+50093&amp;f=10+50006+50093+50111) which are actually shells, paired with something like their [puffy mitt](http://www.mec.ca/product/5024-115/mec-puffy-mitts-unisex/) though they look pretty bulky for gripping a ski pole with.

I will say that if your hands are prone to getting cold, definitely stick with mitts, keeping your fingers together will allow them to help keep each other warm, and you can ball your whole hand into a fist if necessary."

I honestly feel like I am moving faster license to license even with my technique of 100% stars before license than the leveling system. The only thing that's bothered me so far is how it starts you. No matter what, your first 30 grand is for a Honda Fit that costs some 17 grand. Which is really silly that I can't just choose my first car out the gate.

Otherwise, a well rounded improvement to GT5 (feels like a mega-patch) with an excellent UI and looks a little improved but not a whole lot on that graphics front. Money isn't as easy to get but it still isn't an issue for those who get gold medals.

They still have the premium/standard car style. It bugs me occasionally but the premium cars look fantastic. The standard... Well, standard looking.

Online play feels much improved, I haven't seen the issues I got from GT5 including that dreaded black screen issue. I enjoy the soundtrack of the game as there are nods to GT2. (But I can leave that to others to find)

Overall, it didn't really need to be it's own game but as a life-long GT fan, I love it, even with it's nuances and star system which, sounds ugly in concept, still works well."

I just can't take it seriously anymore, every time I see or hear someone use it I roll my eyes, go into TiA mode and look for the crazy surrounding that word, even if there is no crazy.

As an example: 

I was talking with a friend some time ago about sexism in the workplace, it was pretty interesting and didn't get hostile. Until he said ""misogyny"" and I stopped taking anything he said seriously. I didn't even realise at the time but I didn't buy anything he said, it all became a joke and I ended up really pissing him off. Took me a while to apologize and explain it to him, but once I showed him around on Tumblr he got it.

The influence of being pressured by your peers? Thats commonly known as peer pressure. And Ive never met a kid that had another kid as a 'role model'. Maybe someone they thought was cool, but not a 'role model'.

Thats a pretty big assumption to just think that lots of kids have other kids as their role model. Do you realize what that implies? That would mean that some kids, all they ever want to be is a different kid. And while everyone has moments like that as a kid, do assume that 'lots' of kids only want to grow up to be another kid is not only ridiculous but actually pretty frightening.

I think youre just confusing having a role model with idolizing the 'cool kids' or 'popular' crowd.

*12 Years A Slave*

*The Wolf Of Wall Street*

*American Hustle*

*Her*

*Captain Phillips*

*Inside Llewyn Davis*

*Nebraska*

*Fruitvale Station*

For Best Picture. I think *12 Years a Slave* will win.

Alfonso Cuaron

Steve McQueen

Martin Scorsese

David O. Russell

Ryan Coogler

Cuaron will most likely win for Best Director. Ang Lee did last year. Coogler will be the first-timer like Benh Zeitlin was last year. 

Chiwetel Ejiofor

Leonardo DiCaprio

Matthew McConuaghey 

Oscar Isaac 

Bruce Dern

Maybe Tom Hanks

Ejiofor will win for Best Actor. Pretty much a sure shot

Sandra Bullock

Cate Blanchett

Judi Dench

Amy Adams

Brie Larson (long shot, but I want her to get it)

It's either Blanchett or Bullock for Best Actress

Jared Leto

Jonah Hill

Michael Fassbender

Barkhad Abdi

Bradley Cooper

Toss up between Leto and Fassbender for Best Supporting Actor.

Jennifer Lawrence

Lupita Nyong'o

June Squibb

Oprah Winfrey

Julia Roberts

I think this one is for Nyong'o

*Gravity* will win Best Original Screenplay, Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score, *12 Years A Slave* will win Best Adapted Screenplay, *Frozen* will win Best Animated Film and Best Original Song. 

Those are my predictions, although Brie Larson probably won't get nominated. She should, though.

I've got the perk where I can draw a bow much faster, so I can pick off at least three lightly-armored enemies before they reach me.

I'm wondering, though, how can I get where I can sneak right up behind someone and slit their throat? Like a stealth assassin? That's what I've been wanting to do for a while now...

cbearski,depression,1388812284.0,"God I can relate to what you're going through. 

I'm playing and replaying and argument I got into with a friend of mine earlier tonight. I keep hearing all the reasons she thinks I'm an asshole, over and over again. It's been squashed now, we're over it (supposedly), but I can't help but sit here in my own shit, wallowing over guilt and shame and self-pity. My stomach has that empty feeling going on. My heart hurts. I feel like I have nothing good going for me, like I'm worthless or something. 

Like I said, the conversation is done and the issues have been addressed and discussed at length. My friend seems to be over it, but I'm still feeling so full of shame. But that's my problem. I'm living in the past. I can't let go of what happened just now, or anything shameful I've done over the years, no matter how insignificant. I have to accept what's done is done. I can't change what's happened, but I have the power to control what I will do next. 

It all seems well and good to write about this right now. Feeling all this shame, writing about it, helps me to process it myself. But it still doesn't seem to be going away. This sort of thing is easier said than done, at least in the moment. At this point, I'm simply sitting in my room, Redditing, hanging out by myself. There's nothing to feel shameful about at this point. I can't keep living in the past, even the past of like, 25 minutes ago. Shit. Just have to move on.

Crippling shame is HUGE for me. I love to reflect on how terrible of a human being I am, based on a few specific incidents I feel badly about. I need to let them go. I've done a lot of good in my life too, I can't forget about that. "

Rarely, do soldiers have to lift themselves; most of the time they are lifting other things (or climbing, which involves footholds).

another30yovirgin,AskMen,1388812395.0,"There are three different levels of ""love"": lust, attraction and attachment. When you look at another person and admire his/her physique, that's lust. Attraction is when you meet that person and find out that you have complimentary personalities. Attachment is when you've been with a person for some time and she/he becomes an important part of your life. While we often call the combination of the three ""love"", we're actually talking about three different brain processes. 

If your SO is walking down the street and sees someone he finds attractive, that's just lust. That's not attraction. That's not attachment. It doesn't actually mean anything for your relationship, because all he feels is a primal feeling. That doesn't mean he actually wants to have sex with her, as you say. It means his brain is attuned to finding a healthy female to have sex with, and it has just spotted one. But he's not looking for someone to have sex with--he's already got a partner and the attraction and attachment he feels to her are much stronger than the superficial lust he feels for the woman on the street.

I don't really know how you get over this, but I think you need to at least understand it."

I was privileged to have her in my life until she died of cancer after 16 months.  I was destroyed.

poryphria,kpop,1388812626.0,"I already stated that Taecyeon seems to be having problems with people- in management.  Seeing as he's a business major, his issues with the company are probably business related.

JYP had g.o.d, The Wonder Girls, 2PM, and Rain, three big sellers and one incredibly popular girl group.  While the company never made as much as SM/YG, their profits have been going down in the past few years, part of that due to the money they lost on the American advancement.  Now in their musical department, they have 2PM, who are still doing well in Japan, and Suzy.  

Suzy has had more CFs and advertisements than any other female idol in 2013 (and maybe 2012, I need to check up on that).  She's starred in numerous TV shows, as well as two promotions for missA in the past 2 years.  She has stated that she never sees her family and she gets almost no sleep on an episode of Healing Camp.  Trying to discredit my claim by saying that 99% of idols have her schedule doesn't take away the fact that a barely 20 year old girl is working this hard.  I doubt few idols save for SNSD and a few top others are as stressed as she is.

ursei,Frugal,1388812780.0,"Thanks so much. That credit card advice seems like something we should definitely do right away.

To clarify about our situation though, my job is very stable but my husband is on unemployment right now again. We were making pretty good money with our combined income but still not enough to easily afford our condo because it's in a pretty nice neighborhood. So even when he was working we never had much extra to pay those credit card bills off which is why they've been sitting at 7k for years. But now that he's unemployed we've cut out everything to just afford mortgage, bills and groceries.

So the reason for my interest in frequent flier points is more for when he finds work which will probably be pretty soon, and now that we're more experienced with budgeting we could save a bit for travel (well, after the cards are paid off, which now seems possible with your advice). So our situation isn't really all that bad. I was reading [this article](http://travelpaintrepeat.com/post/59743516609/how-i-afford-travel) about flying internationally for free and was like damn, why am I not taking advantage of that kind of thing. Travel is one of those things where if I don't do it, I just start considering quitting my job, selling everything, and taking off, and my husband isn't down with that lifestyle so much, so we're trying to get to where we can travel regularly.

edit: but I agree you're right in that we just have to get out of debt before we worry about travel."

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1388812783.0,"Uh yeah, I'm in New Hampshire. My house was built in 1890. 

Look at the electrical - that is a huge issue. The last time the electrical in my house was updated was 1970-*something*. I can only run one appliance at a time. Which is a pain in the ass if I want toast AND coffee... God forbid. 

If you are in a colder area, take a look at the heating. My house is extremely drafty and in my parents room, the floor was never updated, it is the original floor and if their room is dark and the basement light is on, light comes up from in between the floor boards and their room is always cold because of it. 

My family after 7 years have thick blankets covering certain doorways to keep the ""important"" parts of the house somewhat warm. 

Chances are, it will be pretty expensive to keep an older house warm unless important updates were made, like double pane windows. My house thankfully has those, but because of the floors it doesn't help much. 

Make sure the plumbing is well insulated too if you're in a colder area too. Frozen pipes are always fun. My family without fail cordons off the down stairs bathroom for a month (typically January into Fabruary) because the toilet won't flush and sink will not produce any water, just make the Devil's own noise. 

Make sure the house has also been checked for lead paint, and if so, confirm that lead paint was removed professionally. Do the same thing with lead pipes. 

Older homes will tend to need a lot of up keep. They can be like an older Chevrolet. Yeah, it's reliable as shit, but if you want any repairs on it to last, don't be skimpy and don't do any repairs that are half-assed.

Allternator,videos,1388812861.0,"What I think happens is that because water has a high heat of vaporization, when you throw it in a really cold environment you are, increasing the surface area dramatically which 

1) causes some water to transform into steam at a much higher rate. This causes a lot of heat to go into breaking the bonds between water molecules, and thus cooling it down. (Due to water's high heat of vaporization)

2) increases the rate at which the heat is transferred out of the water and into the environment. This is obviously exacerbated the colder the environment is.

Couple these two together, and under some instances you can get boiling water to freeze faster than cold."

frsp,DebateReligion,1388812959.0,"&gt; I thought Christian dogma was that nobody's do.

Nobody can be saved by their own efforts but we are judged on our actions.

&gt;No, I think it's a fairy story and that Jesus was probably just one of many rabble-rousers the Romans, who happened to have the advantage of a more successful fan club.

Cool.

&gt;That all sounds very compelling if you consider ""sanctification"" to be an actual thing, let alone can offer a coherent explanation of why it matters.

Sanctification, Latin for ""to make holy"", it is a restoration of human nature to its unfallen state.

&gt;I've seen no evidence of that happening anywhere. The human nature of believers who think they have received ""sanctifying grace"" looks identical to me to the human nature of those who do not.

You only need to read one book on the lives of the saints to show utterly wrong you are. Saints exemplify the most heroic of virtues, the perfection of human nature. Can you say the same about the average bum on the street.

&gt;A lot to unpack there. For starters, if sin is a real thing (which I dispute, but that's an argument for another time) to sin is to be human. Otherwise you would not be so certain that I have sinned.

Does everything in nature exist for a certain purpose? Yes. Basic natural law theory. To contravene the natural purpose of human life is to violate natural law, to sin. Every single act that can be described as sinful in someway contravenes the purpose of either human life, natural human institutions, or nature itself.

I'm as certain you have sinned as much as I am certain that I have sinned.

In this entirely thead, you seem to be operating from an incredibly confused and ignorant understanding of the Christian religion. Damn, if I went into a science class and started arguing about [le] STEM this way, I would be laughed out of the room. Know what you're arguing about before you try to refute it.

Are you just going to ignore the fact that you are an absolute proven waste of space that cant even provide for himself?

And you think you have anything to add to my life?

If for some random reason I become an actor or undercover agent and needed to portray myself as some kind of incompetent loser incapable of looking after himself, ill certainly be in touch, as that's the only field you have any knowledge or insight where your input has any value.

It really comes as no surprise whatsoever that being you, and having real trouble with basics that even children seem to understand, you would not understand that someone putting minimal effort in their grammar/spelling or checking on an internet message board, is merely a reflection of the ""respect"" i have for you.

Genuinely find it amazing someone as low on the rung as you, has the audacity and balls to try and project himself as someone who knows anything.

You can laugh all you like and be as defensive all you like, the fact that my life is a testament to my view (and seem to be doing pretty well for myself) and your life is a testament to your view (and by anyone's standards you are pretty much on the bottom, with a long humiliating history of failing to even look after yourself let alone your wife) speaks volumes.

I hope your Chuckles and giggles are much comfort to you when you are eeking away an existence in poverty and squalor, Perhaps when you have a free moment from posting to internet strangers begging
for money, you could ponder why do some people actually seem to earn so much more money than you, and seem to have validation from accredited institutions that actually confirm they are able to understand and comprehend advanced subject matter and write to a high standard.

No doubt you will come up with some piss poor observation to try and provide comfort to yourself such as ""at least i use a better font etc""  because you cant deal with the reality of what a loser you are.

Seriously it beggars belief someone like you can have the cognitive dissonance to ignore your situation and still think you somehow are somebody or have value in a context like this.

you are like a very morbidly obese man in extreme poor health moments from death directly as a result of his fatness arguing and giving dieting and exercise advice to a bunch of athletes and models

You might also acknowledge that the world isn't going to change for you. Since you've probably spent a lot of time *not* acknowledging this, if not actively arguing against it, you'll have to repeat over and over again that you know the world isn't going to accommodate you. And each time you do, point out that *you ARE changing yourself for the world.*

But the thing is, you're unlikely to get them to help you. For one thing, it's not really their responsibility anymore -- and I want to emphasize that it's not their *right* either, now that you're an adult. It's your right and responsibility to find your own way. For another thing, patterns of behavior generally change less the older a person gets.

It sounds like you live with them? If so, this will be harder, but not impossible: when they start saying things like all of this, tell them that hearing this sort of thing makes it more difficult for you so you are not going to listen to it. If they keep on, tell them that you're going to go do something else now, and then end the conversation (by hanging up, ignoring texts, leaving the room, etc). If they press the issue, just keep repeating that their behavior is not helping you and, in order to help yourself, you are no longer going to remain in situations that are unhelpful, especially if they (the situations, not your parents) are actually making things harder on you. You are changing your behavior to make it easier on yourself to do what you need to do -- you are controlling your own environment.

I have to stress that this is not about them at all, and you must make it clear (in your own mind; don't bother trying to get it through to them, because it's counterproductive and exactly the opposite of what I'm suggesting) that you are focusing on yourself, controlling your own behavior, controlling your own environment. In the same way that I refuse to keep junk food in my home because I'll eat it if it's there, you will refuse to allow their negativity into your head. The only real way you can do that is not to listen, and since old habits are hard to change, in order to keep it out of your head you'll most likely need to simply not be where you can hear it. But the good news is that after some time (probably a lot of time, like months or possibly years if they're really emotionally invested in treating you this way), they'll stop with the negativity and you can have a normal relationship with them.

Also, stop letting them know anything about school or any other area of your life where they respond this way. You're an adult; you don't have to tell them anything. For stupid shit like reminders to brush your teeth or wear a coat, just give them a blank stare for a moment, or just make a noncommittal noise like ""mm,"" and then go about your business. Don't fight about it, don't argue, don't complain...don't give it attention. They'll stop, or you'll start ignoring it in your head like you do outwardly, and either way it won't be your problem any more."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388813123.0,"Maybe it's not extremism, it just appears that way because you have a right wing bias?

Seriously, I notice right wingers accuse anyone of being a communist. How many times is Obama called a communist by the right? Let alone my own views. 

Seriously, the vast majority of the left wing posters on reddit are not communists, they're not fascists, and I really, really resent being accused of such things (I often am by libertarians who have no clue how left wing thought even works, they just think left wing = stalinism). Here's a quick run down on different forms of left wing political views:

Liberalism- Yesterday's conservatism (ie, Richard Nixon). Barack Obama is in this category. Rather moderate on economic issues. Often prefer free market solutions but are not afraid of regulation and mild to moderate government programs when necessary.

Social democrats- People who promote European style safety nets. Want higher taxes, while still maintaining an existing structure of private property rights / capitalism where it is useful. Generally prefer higher levels of socialized industry than liberals (ie, healthcare), but still promote a largely capitalist structure. 

Socialists/communists-  I know socialists and communists have differences, but these guys promote the abolition of capitalism and state control of industry.

I'd really only consider the last category ""left wing extremism.""

Seriously. Liberals are not extremists. I'd consider them centrists or moderate left. Social democrats SOUND extreme to we Americans, but that's because Reagan's views and related conservatism have pulled us so far to the right it's ridiculous. Still, we toyed with such ideas back before reagan, in the 1960s and stuff. Ultimately these lost favor to more right wing policies.

Socialists and communists are extremists. People who try to destroy capitalism in its entirety and have planned economies that stifle growth and personal freedom...they're the extremists. But honestly, most people on /r/politics are NOT this extreme, and I think it's unfair to characterize them as such."

Deep within a forest a little turtle began to climb a tree. After hours of effort he reached the top, jumped into the air waving his front legs and crashed to the ground. After recovering, he slowly climbed the tree again, jumped, and fell to the ground.
The turtle tried again and again while a couple of birds sitting on a branch watched his sad efforts. Finally, the female bird turned to her mate.
""Dear,"" she chirped, ""I think it's time to tell him he's adopted.""

The brother says, ""The cat's dead.""

The man is distraught. He says, ""You can't just tell me like that. You have to ease me into it.""

The brother says, ""What do you mean?""

The man says, ""Well, the first day I call, you could tell me the cat's stuck on the roof and you can't get her down. The second day, you tell me the cat fell and she's in a coma. Then on the third day you can tell me the cat passed away in its sleep peacefully.""

Good to see you doing well, man.

Sounds like you're half way there. After education and black belt, all that's left is social life and stable career, all of which come in due time. It might be hard, but think of the lack of structured env as a challenge. You can lead on this. Many of my own social circles had lack of positive models, but I eventually saw this as an opportunity. Hell, it's a bonus, because taking the lead on this matter makes you more unique among the social circles that lack this guidance. 

I too had a pretty late start on the social game, but it's never too late. I guarantee you that you started earlier than I did. I'm so glad I had the right attitude change. Just from that, I have better friends, better job, more respect from my family, and healthier relationships in general."

lucasroonie123,changemyview,1388813222.0,"There are conversations that never end and doubts that never disappear. About the best way to start a relationship, for example. Many people believe that what is gained easily get lost in the same way. They think that relationships that require effort to maintain have more value. Women difficult to conquer, men difficult to keep, troublesome relationships - these tend to be more important and enduring. But is it true ?


I think we are taught to underestimate those who like us. If the girl at the next table smiled in our direction, we begin to notice her flaws. ""If she was really nice, she would not be this easy on me"". If she does not stand up to my meager charms, she is an easy woman - and easy women are worthless, right? The name of this, ladies and gentlemen, is low self -esteem : do not joint the club who wants me as a partner. It's funny , but it hurts. 


We are also taught to sacrifice. What we get is worthless without sweat. We are a society of fighters, are we not? We must strive for rewards. All the worthy things are obtained the hard way. And so on. From hearing this conversation - in school, in sports, in the office - we take its assumptions into the affective life. We also end up believing that in the field of affect we should be able to fight, suffer and triumph. We need to tell our epic achievements at Sunday family dinner. If it's too easy, it is not worthy. Love like this is not funny, says a friend. Really?


None of the girls i had was seduced, conquered or persuaded to like me. They took the initiative or reciprocated the attention I gave them . Every time I insisted with whom was not into me, it went wrong. Every time I tried to climb the wall of indifference, it was useless or I found out that there was nothing on the other side. In my experience, love is a territory in which courage and initiative are rewarded, but commitment, persistence and determination never brought results.


I am reporting this experience to discuss an issue that seems to me the most serious: how much should we insist on getting the attention of a person who does not seem to reciprocate our feelings? Who is emotionally available deals with this kind of dilemma all the time. You met this person, you think he/she is cool, call him/her a few days later and he/she does not answer nor call back. What to do? You go out with the person, liked him/her a lot, try a second date and he/she is reluctant to set a date. How to proceed from there? You started a relationship, is falling in love, but the other part, one day, no longer return your phone calls. What do you do? You are in love, took a kick in the ass and can barely breathe. This is the case of trying to reconquer or would be best to protect yourself and heal your hurt feelings?


All these situations lead to the same choice: to insist or give up ? Who thinks that love is a battlefield usually opts for insistence . Who thinks it is a spontaneous occurrence tends to choose the withdrawal (though it looks ugly ). In practice, as we are not 100 % sure about things, and we do not control ourselves 100 %, we oscillate between one and another position according to the circumstances and the strenght of the engagement. But most of us, even unconsciously, draws a limit to how much to commit ( or crawl ) in such a case . Who is boundless, sufferS beyond measure - and often makes a fool of himself, with poor results.


One of my favorite theories is that even if a person give in to a long and costly siege, the relationship will be poisoned. For the simple reason that no one is snubbed for too long or too ostensibly without developing resentment. And no hard feelings dissipate. They stand and charge a price. Sooner or later the bill arrives. And the kind of personality that insists too much into conquest may be moved for the wrong reasons: your interest is in the person or the game? It's a case of love or self esteem? 


Being loved for free, on the other hand, is priceless . It is the coolest tribute that one can make us. You are there in life (at work , in the club , on vacation, at the BBQ , the friend's house ) and the person just like you. Or you approach with small talk and she gets this gesture with open arms. What can be better than that ? What can be better than to be liked for what it is - no tricks, no games of seduction? At the moment I can not remember anything.

Imagine how every AQ member around the world must have felt upon hearing the news- if the US was able to kill HIM like that, whats to stop them from coming after you in a similar manner?

And for a lot of those guys, that did happen in a similar manner pretty soon.  So I don't think we have much to learn from Russia, we're doing a damn good job as it is."

Neopopulas,dayz,1388813334.0,"I'm torn over this. On one hand people scream about realism (I got yelled at twice, once for wanting an in-game map that updates as i travel and shows me where i am because.. my guy would know, and once because i wanted a group system that showed my friends on the HUD so i didn't shoot them by accident) and realism would seem to demand that military gear ONLY appear in military bases (mosin is weird)

But on the other hand, this means people just run around from one base to the next gearing up over and over and over again and not doing anything else, it makes the military bases killing fields where naked people run to get weapons and people with weapons run to to get ammo and shoot people who don't have weapons.

Maybe when base building/crafting comes in and i would LOVE to see a minecrafty system. I want to take a break from fighting zombies and other kitted up assholes like myself to take my axe into the woods and chop down some trees and build my cabin or chairs or whatever.

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,DesignMyRoom,1388813685.0,"I think you should update your artwork.

Going with cleaner, black and white prints will pop the red of the walls and give the room a more designed look instead of hodgepodge chaos.

For instance, instead of the blackbird poster, maybe [this blackbird blueprint](http://www.etsy.com/listing/152024183/sr-71-blackbird-airplane-blueprint-art-8?ref=sr_gallery_1&amp;ga_search_query=blackbird+airplane&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=US&amp;ga_search_type=all). If airplanes are your thing, [a large black and white close up](http://www.etsy.com/listing/171238156/pilot-gift-aviation-art-airplane?ref=sr_gallery_19&amp;ga_search_query=airplane+photograph&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=US&amp;ga_search_type=all) would be beautiful. [This black and white space print](http://www.etsy.com/listing/156859378/sale-black-and-white-large-wall-art-two?ref=sr_gallery_43&amp;ga_search_query=space+art+black+and+white&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=US&amp;ga_page=3&amp;ga_search_type=all) would bring in the planet/surrealism you seem to like, but in a cleaner more dramatic way. Or [a large motorcycle art peice](http://www.etsy.com/listing/128894938/harley-davidson-motorcycle-screenprint?ref=shop_home_active). Etsy is a wonderful site to find decent priced art. Scale down the amount of art and pick pieces that work with each other so that the wall looks like a installation.

However, there is also plenty of research to the contrary, which states that not only will they not cancel each other out, but also that each will enhance the efficacy of the other. This is a really great article that explains how this works: The Truth About Using Retinol with AHA, BHA, &amp; Vitamin C

&gt;The biggest risk associated with mixing BHA and retinol is that it can cause irritation. I’ve definitely experienced some irritation as a result of mixing the two in the past. However, the formula for this toner is so gentle, there hasn’t been a single instance of irritation for me.

&gt;cheap 1080p 120hz LCD

These monitors do exist but they have higher input lag than the expensive 120hz, the Samsung S23A950D is a good example of this, it has a price of ~$550  but 22ms input lag which means that the display will always be ~2 frames behind, when playing a high paced game like Quake 3 moving your mouse and having an **incredibly slight** delay on your actions and movements can be annoying. A CRT monitor does not have to do any processing of a signal thus has an input lag of 14 nano seconds (0.00014ms).

&gt;even plain LCD

See the pic of my setup, if I wanted to play games on an LCD I already can.

&gt;forward in quality

1024x768 looks fine on a CRT, due to how the display works anti aliasing isn't much of and issue, images are still sharp unless you use alot of bitmap fonts.

&gt;Unrelated to your post  but also a thing good about CRTs (if you imply all CRT monitors are 4:3)

Many pro players Counterstrike and Quake 3 players play in 4:3 even though their monitors are 16:9 (I have seen many players do it at an e-sports event I am part of, [check out the intro of this video if you want proof](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8gTD7hDV_c)) This is due to the fact you can set the field of view in these games as high as you would on a widescreen monitor, thus can see the same amount of stuff but compressed into a smaller horizontal area, many players prefeur this due to the fact they don't have to move their eyes as much thus can see everything easier and faster.

And most importantly

Bassically,CFB,1388814054.0,"Ignore my flair for the moment; I was trying to remove all the rivalry stuff and speak rationally about why coaches might turn down the Texas job or say they're not interested.

I think that a camera-shy or control-freak coach might at least think twice about having such a spotlight and potential distraction for his program. I think that a coach who's good with the media might really like the stage it gives him to sell the Texas brand. I think that it will definitely factor into the next coach's decision, though it may or may not be as big a factor as I'm portraying it.

I was just trying to bring up a point I haven't seen discussed a lot. Everyone seems to take for granted that Texas is a just-add-coach and win environment, without taking account for all the extra factors that might make it less than 100% perfect (kinda like how people think it would be awesome to be famous, without stopping to realize that half the people will try to hyperanalyze and criticize everything they do, or that complete strangers will want things from them all the time).

The Texas job has probably the most upside of any college football coaching job in the country (including Alabama). But it also comes with the highest expectations, and a level of political gamesmanship (i.e. the Rick Perry/Bill Powers thing) that isn't found much anywhere else. All I'm trying to say is that I can see how coaches might not choose to deal with those extra burdens."

Because I figured she was an Asian stereotype and it's nice to shake things up a little. Also, black is beautiful.

It does fit with the others but that's the problem. It sounds silly when it should sound interesting. Something about it just screams cliche and a little switch would fix that.

Thus, very few allow pets and those that do require hefty deposits.

LadyLizardWizard,harrypotter,1388814604.0,"Well going through Hogwarts can easily be Guild Wars style of instanced areas depending on your level and part of the story. In this game it would allow you to travel through all the different Years of Hogwarts alongside other people.

It would have lots of random tasks that appear, and can be repeated, that get more complex as you go through the different Years. Luckily you would have the experience and knowledge of new spells to be able to do more things.

There should be a new overarching plot that everyone participates in with new evil threats that require the teamwork of everyone to defeat together. Real combat doesn't begin until near the very end of the Hogwarts section and after you graduate except for a few special situations.

Lot's of minigames would take place such as ranked House Cup Quidditch matches (professional matches when you are graduated) and competition to complete as many minor quests as you can to give your House extra points.

When you start the game you do have to choose your wand and all that and you actually have to go to all the shops on Diagon Alley to pick up what you need for the year. Some items can be traded or earned or purchased in Hogsmeade.

But definitely completing each Year of Hogwarts must feel like a big accomplishment and take some time. It would take like maybe 20 hours of play minimum for each Year."

The point /u/Ice_tail was trying to make is that it is rather obvious that the super vast majority of people in SA either think that this is morally permissible, aren't bothered enough by it to try and take any meaningful action to try and put a stop to it, are too worried and scared of potential personal and political blow-back if they do try and take any meaningful action to try and stop it, or feel utterly powerless to do anything to stop it and have resigned themselves to it.

All four of these *are massive fucking problems and are in no way localized to South Africa*.

While you might roll your eyes every time your 'token feminist' friend mentions the phrase 'rape culture', we seriously do, as a global society live inside of a rape culture.

Oh, sorry.  I thought it was clear that we were talking about women in the west.  US, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand.  Probably forgetting somewhere.  I mean, yeah, the Middle East.  Totally patriarchy.  All over the place.  Mad patriarchy.

Where I live?  In Seattle?  Every time I hear some white, college-educated, upper-middle-class woman working as a professional artist in Seattle talk about how she's oppressed and marginalized (and I hear this so much more often than is right), I die a little inside.

&gt;That isn't what is being said. Including the perspective is often enough to show whether your conclusion may be off. Impartiality in epistemic claims being what it is, if you want accuracy that's where the line is drawn.

So, what, you want my life story?

&gt;We both understand the difference it seems, yet you keep saying what's the difference? If you could do a better job illustrating why the foundation of the arguments are similar.

Some members of Group A believe they are marginalized and oppressed.  Everyone outside Group A thinks they are not marginalized. The evidence that Group A is being marginalized only makes sense from the perspective of Group A, and is in no way empirical.

When Group A is right-wing huckster Gretchen Carlson railing about the sacrilege of a festivus pole, I'm supposed to laugh at how silly she is and be smart enough to see how her ideology has blinded her, she lacks empathy for others, and is stubbornly and willfully resistant to being reasoned with.  

When Group A is feminist huckster Anita Sarkesian railing about the how 8-bit princess make girls fail at life, I'm supposed to shut up and nod in agreement because my privileged position as a man means I can't understand the trauma of being exposed to Princess Peach.

&gt;The question of how it helps is clear from the definition of feminism given.

BullsLawDan,Libertarian,1388815618.0,"&gt;It is obvious to any honest observer that the courts have played an expansionary role in the Federal Government's powers, rather than an inhibiting role.

Logical fallacy.  Correlation does not imply causation.  This does not prove that judges are ruling as they are due to the source of their paycheck.

&gt;Not every case will be ruled in the government's favor, but the vast, vast majority of the important cases are.

As my friends at Wikipedia say, &lt;citation needed&gt;.

&gt;And people who graduate from seminary don't have an interest in the promulgation of Christianity.

You're apparently too stupid or too lost into your anti-legal-establishment bias to realize this analogy isn't even close to what occurs.  Some judges go to law school.  All lawyers go to law school.  The vast majority of lawyers do not work for, or on behalf of, ""the government"", at any level.  Law schools are not run by the government and law schools are not about promoting government.  There are more lawyers working against the government than there are working for.

Lawyers and judges are interested in the promulgation of *justice,* which, from where I and many of my libertarian-minded colleagues sit, quite often runs counter to the promulgation of government.

Pithy statements about seminary and religion are not proof, and do not disprove what I said.  The fact is, you can't disprove what I've said, because I'm entirely correct.

&gt;Saying it does not make it so. ""We"" have a monopolist hybrid dispute resolution/security corporation.

&gt;Saying it does not make it so.

&gt;Saying it does not make it so.

Irony, thy name is you.   Anyway, ""independent judiciary"" is a legal and structural term, not that you'd recognize that in your fog of /r/conspiracy posts and Alex Jones rants.  I was talking about the structure of the judicial system, which is undeniable - Judges are not paid based upon reaching certain verdicts, and nor does their compensation, job security, or advancement, rest on those grounds.  That is what an independent judiciary means, structurally.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction

And?  I'm aware of this ""plan"". It's not exclusive to the NSA programs and it doesn't always hide what's really going on, nor does it always hide the real source of evidence.  Parallel construction only works until someone on the defense side actually does a bit of digging.

So the airline I was supposed to fly back home on declared bankruptcy, cancelled all flights, and all the other flights out got filled up with the other people in my situation.    
   
I had something important to do the next day and and couldn't wait for another flight so I had to rent a shitty little compact car and make the 12 hour drive back home.

When she consented to her *boyfriend's* one-time use of her uterus, she assumed (along with her boyfriend) responsibility for the consequences of those actions. The result of their actions is that she now has a living human being inside of her, biologically distinct and genetically unique, and not part of her body, merely encapsulated within her until he or she can live outside of the womb. An abortion would, at this point and by all scientific definition, end that life.

wotmate,australia,1388815949.0,"It's worth noting a couple of things.

Pharmacy Guild:  They've been trying to become pseudo doctors for years.  $6 fee at the GP means more business for them.  Sure, some of it's justified, because sometimes you just go to the GP just to get told to get some cold and flu tablets.  But sometimes flu-like symptoms can be signs of much, much worse things.

Private Health Insurers:  They can conveniently include the fee in their packages.  They can just call it GAP COVER.  When everyone is paying for this gap cover, they can whinge to the government that their costs have gone up, and they will be allowed to raise premiums.  Further to this, as the fee increases (and it will) medicare will cover less and less, and the health funds will cover more and more.  Eventually medicare won't be used, and you'll either have to have private health insurance or you'll have to pay cash up front to see a GP.

&gt;Again, ""holy"" is a word packed with about as much woo-woo as ""sanctify"".

So fucking brave, just dismissing anything you don't like as ""woo-woo.""

&gt; Both words imply a spiritual existence behind material existence, which I've not seen evidence of.

And yet when billions of people prior to you have experienced this existence, which is universally and naturally desired by human beings (even the Pirahã of euphoric legend believe in spirits), but considering they are hunter-gatherers in the year 2014, the word a few butthurt post-modern, philosophically, religiously, and historically retarded crybabies who cannot create an argument more sophisticated than ""muh science"" and assorted fallacious nonsense refuted centuries ago, *they're* right.

The only valid arguments against the existence of God were reiterated by St. Thomas Aquinas and subsequently dismantled.

&gt;Shall we start with ""The Missionary Position""? Or does that not count because Mother Theresa has not yet been declared a saint?

Yes, the brave ramblings of an ideologue. You realize that Mother Theresa ran hospices? Fucking *hospices.* It was to give people a dignified place to die, it wasn't Mayo Clinic Calcutta. And if you haven't noticed, the governments attempting to ""aid"" Calcutta did no good and Mother Theresa and the Missionaries of Charity were the only ones willing to be human to them.

&gt;Yes I can, and I would be just as verifiably factual as all the Catholic fairy tales of miraculous saints.

Except for the fact that they all existed and their lives are documented, miracles or no miracles. Look at the poverty of St. Francis who gave up military and aristocratic life to be a street bum, look at the loving forgiveness of St. Seraphim of Sarov who had his back broken by robbers and went to their trial to defend him, look at the love demonstrated by St. Maximilian Kolbe in the Nazi death camps, giving up his life to replace a husband and father sentenced to death, look at the hundreds upon hundreds of men and women with supernatural virtue and then say to me again that any bum on the street can do that. You are beyond ignorant.

&gt;You're assuming I'm asking questions out of ignorance, when in fact I'm asking them to challenge your dogma.

Except you have demonstrated nothing but complete ignorance of any and all things Catholic and Christian, and your idea of ""challenge your dogma"" is writing incoherent non-arguments or retorts to single lines out of context that stink of the cheeto dust encrust your copy of The God Delusion.

Blinkskij,Norway,1388816298.0,"You don't specify what you mean by medical care. The law doesn't treat all medical care equally, so the answer must necessarily go a little into detail.

Everyone, whether they are here legally or not, have a right to receive **emergency medical care**, from ANY medical personnel (including students), whether on duty or not (Lov om helsepersonell §7). In fact, everybody is required by law (straffeloven §387) to provide assistance to others in life-threatening danger, if able to provide such assistance without danger to themselves. Failure to do so may result in a fine and/or a prison term of up to 3 months.

The rights to professional medical care go a bit further than what is considered emergency care. It also includes ""other medical care that can not wait"", by which is meant that you have a right to any ""care which is necessary and without which there there is a clear and present danger of death, lasting disability, serious injury or serious pain.''
Exactly where the limits go is not specified, so it's more or less up to medical personnel to assess what is required and what is not. There might be court judgements that deal with this, but I don't have knowledge about any such things. We'd need a lawyer for that.

Furthermore, pregnant women, and children without legal residency has a right to pre-natal care and abortion on equal footing with citizens. Illegal children generally have the same rights as citizens, except they are excluded from the general practitioner's program (fastlegeordningen).

People infected with an communicable diseases has a right to medical assessment and diagnostics, treatment, care and other necessary steps required to protect the health of the general public.

People without legal residency *are* required to pay for the care they've received, but one can not demand payment up front for necessary medical care (as ""specified"" above), so that's a issue practitioners should consider only after care has been provided.

The Norwegian Medical Association (the professional association and trade union for Norwegian physicians) are of the opinion that these rights are inadequate, and should be expanded.

What I have not answered here is what happens after the homeless and/or illegal person has received medical care and can not pay. I don't know. But they will receive necessary care.
In general, medical care is heavily subsidized, so it wouldn't be a matter of massive debt like a visit to a US emergency room might result in. Unfortunately I do not know if there's a price difference between what a citizen and an illegal immigrant would be charged. My gut feeling says they should be charged the same, and I hope they are. Any input on this from others would be welcome.

Orelle,infj,1388816353.0,"I took issue with the cultural stereotyping in chapter eight, ""Soft Power: Asian-Americans and the Extrovert Ideal."" But I did have some takeaways from the book, that I noted elsewhere (I'm quoting myself below). 

* Factoids, e.g. lie detector tests aren't really fair for introverts because we'll sweat more. 

* Workplaces are increasingly designed for extroverts to the detriment of us all. 

* Dr. Elaine Aron's work on ""[highly sensitive people](http://www.hsperson.com/)"" (HSP).

* The Institute of Personality Assessment and Research at UC Berkeley's finding that creative people tend to be introverts (that and other parts of the book are in the [preview here](http://books.google.com/books?id=uyjf3uaQ4TwC&amp;pg=PT95&amp;lpg=PT95&amp;dq=Institute+of+Personality+Assessment+and+Research+at+the+University+of+California,+Berkeley+introverts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J56cXaak2n&amp;sig=zl_CvotaDyhhVvLnVa1bT7VY75o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hTJyUo-nC7OMigLkj4CwBw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Institute%20of%20Personality%20Assessment%20and%20Research%20at%20the%20University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley%20introverts&amp;f=false)). 

* Psychologist Jerome Kagan of Harvard's [longitudinal study](http://www.amazon.com/Galens-Prophecy-Temperament-Human-Nature/dp/0813333555) of introverts and extroverts from infancy to adolescence, which shows some biological basis for these tendencies (e.g. theories that introverts evolved to be cautious survivors as opposed to extroverted risk takers) — and that introverted children are more like ""orchids"" that need special care and conditions to thrive.

Also, I shared this graph from page 243 of ""Quiet"" with a few people (context was that introverts do better with less stimuli while extroverts need more to be attentive): 

""According to a recent study of military personnel conducted through the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, introverts function better than extroverts when sleep deprived, which is a cortically de-arousing condition (because losing sleep makes us less alert, active, and energetic).""

Hopefully this gives a taste of the book."

If these things are so long lived *and* see time so quickly, then they're pretty stagnant when it comes to tech - if they've been around and intelligent for a billion or more years and they're still searching planets *manually* as opposed to using planet-sized computers to predict where intelligence would be in the universe, they don't have much going for them.

We meatheads on the other hand have only known about *agriculture* for a few thousand years, but in the past century we've figured out radio, electricity, space travel, quantum physics, networked computing... them metalheads writing us off as ""Harmless"" should get ready to find out why we're listed as ""*Mostly* Harmless"" in the Hitchhiker's Guide once we catch up in a few decades and wonder why they tried to leave us behind."

In real life, the way people move, the constant talking, the little hand signals, they way they hold their gun, the way they stand are all things you instinctively use to recognize people.

None of that is in the game at all, on top of that, all clothing looks IDENTICAL, and there is only so much variation in the clothes, one friend maybe has glasses in his vest, another might have a bandana around his neck, maybe another has makes on the left side of his mask. None of these things exist in the game, and your situational awareness is massively limited in all games, but especially important in games like this.

SO, i would be willing to sacrifice a little realism to get that situational awareness back, all i need is a tiny marker above the head of my friend that i can see, maybe through walls - because i know where my friends are - maybe not, its not a dealbreaker.

Balancing a wife, kid, pharmacy school, and work (I still clock about 25-30 hours per week as a tech/intern) can be tough, but it's certainly manageable, and I haven't found myself getting too stressed yet. I just finished my third semester of the didactic portion of the curriculum, so I'm halfway done with that now. I've been getting mostly straight As except for a B in P&amp;T this last semester, but I also had a lot of family/personal stuff happen in the past couple of months so I didn't have much time to study.

If you're worried about whether it's doable, it absolutely is, you just need to make sure that most of your time is productive. Definitely relax when you need it (you will need it), but be prepared to go a few months at a time without having a single day off from either work or school.

So lower skilled people get better Constitutional protections?  Observe that, in 2014, we are apparently beyond the point where you would consider option 3, which is, you know, *get a fucking job.*

&gt;On the other hand, the compelling state interest in policing drug use amongst welfare recipients has been shown to be virtually nonexistent

So I guess there is no compelling state interest in the United States making personal ownership of tigers illegal, since no one is doing it.  I don't see how whether something is being done regulates whether the state has an interest in preventing it.

&gt; Any negative effects are at least ambiguous, and probably offset by resistance to STIs.

That's true, and there are studies endorsed and published by the American CDC that back that up, but Americans seem to have this knee-jerk reaction to it. Like people who think vaccinations cause autism. I don't understand it, before seeing it discussed on reddit I've never heard of someone being anti-circumcision because they thought it was mutilation. It's completely foreign to me.

I'm not Jewish, I was circumsized as an infant and I've had plenty of sex with no issues whatsoever. I don't see what the big deal is. I'm very curious to see why Americans have this strange view of circumcision, but it's almost impossible to have rational discussions about it. People flip their shit and compare it to FGM, and cirumcised people who express opposite points of view get downvote-nuked so the comments are always ""omg mutilation""."

Breaking it down into small chunks and having it constantly available will help keep your interest.

As another idea - make sure the book's subject is REALLY, REALLY INTRIGUING to you. When I was a kid/teen, I sped through (and still do) things like Harry Potter, essay collections, LotR, Jane Austen, historical war books, most fantasy, etcetera - but reading Frankenstein and Atlas Shrugged for school just about killed me. It's an exercise in extending your patience, tolerance, and drive.

Another friend's then-toddler would pitch a screaming fit, so he'd walk away, at least into another room if not a different floor of the house. She'd stop, pick herself up, go where she could see him, and resume the fit.

My daughter is now 3, and the weirdest things will send her slouched and pouting to her room, where she'll fake-cry until I give her suggestions on other ways she could handle her upset -- as long as one suggestion strikes her fancy and is given at the right time. The fake crying was funny for a while, but then the novelty wore off and now it just grates on my nerves. I'd rather it be funny. But the pouting is one of the most adorable things I've ever seen.

It's an ugly position, but the US lacks the will to follow a course of action that would produce lasting beneficial change in the region, and all of the other intervention packages would have had the US spending resources to install a regime that is actively hostile to the US."

BullsLawDan,Libertarian,1388817248.0,"No, do go on.  I have some fantastic war stories.

When they used to do SSD hearings on those appeals, the judge would handle a bunch at a time.    The hearings were complex things, the two sides would present evidence, and call a vocational expert, and all that.  Very drawn-out affairs.

So he calls the claimant's name, and this guy stands up... slowly... and wheels his oxygen tank up to the front, taking about 10 minutes to walk 30 paces from the rear of the courtroom.  I mean, this guy was near death.  And he's there appealing the decision where the SSA said he wasn't disabled enough, after working and paying into the system his whole life, to get a few months of SSD before he died of emphysema or whatever he had.

So the guy finally gets up to the swinging doors at the bar, and the judge holds up his hand and says, ""stop right there, sir.  State your name for the record.""

""John Smith."" &lt;wheeze, gasp&gt;

The judge looks at the Social Security Administration lawyers with one of those, *""don't fuck with me, I'm a federal judge and I will ruin your fucking day""* looks, and says, ""I find Mr. John Smith totally disabled as a matter of law.""

The SSA lawyers are like scrambling through papers, and saying, ""but judge!  We have this report, and ....""

Judge waves his hand like some Obi Wan shit... ""I. Find. Mr. John. Smith. Disabled. As. A. Matter. Of. Law.  Mr. Smith, you're excused.  You'll receive your first check in a few weeks.""

It was not a good day for the SSA lawyers, for sure.

He liked taking those cases, though.  He used to tell me he'd rather take a million of those than one stupid trial where two Fortune 10 companies are suing each other for a trillion dollars.  He would say, ""Those companies can wait.  Screw them.  What's this to them, a trifle?  Those people waiting for their SSD decisions are literally dying, and I'm supposed to put Google v. Apple in front of them in line? To hell with that.""

Great guy to work for.  Still cringe that my son climbed all over his leather couch in the judge's chambers, but the judge was cool with it."

llamallamalizard,childfree,1388817317.0,"Unfortunately I'm not in a situation where I can move out financially, but long-term I plan to move to texas within a few years where I have an acquaintance who is willing to help me get a job (her husband works placing people in IT jobs for large companies) once I finish with the certificates I'm working on. 

haha, don't worry, I have no money to give anyway. I have made it abundantly clear that I will not babysit under any circumstances, including emergency, because her definition of emergency is too broad. Luckily my brother's girlfriend (who I also detest, but for other reasons) LOVES babies and begs to babysit, and my parents are pushovers when it comes to that too. I tend to hide in my room with my laptop and do school work and browse the internet when I'm done with that. 

I have stopped eating out with them because it's really annoying to eat with a baby, and the baby is never not there, not so much because the BABY is annoying, but that my parents are INCREDIBLY annoying and thoughtless and even rude when they're around him and it makes me want to scream. I stopped going on weekend outings with them too, because my sister and nephew invariably come along and I'm subjected to a fussy baby on a car ride while having to listen to the one song on the one cd he likes (Kid songs, too, they make me want to punch someone). So on the surface I appear to have become a recluse but damn I am just so much happier staying away from all the drama and the noise that I'm at least subjectively a million times happier alone than when I'm around them and the baby.

Essentially I've cut off as much contact as possible while still being friendly toward them and living in the same house. Today I was in my room all day because there was a sleeping baby downstairs, so I watched netflix on my laptop in my room and talked to my boyfriend and enjoyed myself that way. *shrugs* I love 'em, but their drama is really stressful, so I find myself pulling more and more away from them and being happier and happier as I do so.

The Secretary of War also estimated 1,7-4 million casualties with 400-800 000 fatalities for the entire conquest of Japan. This estimate considered a lot of resistance from the civilian population as a key factor.

The estimates drew from previous experience from invading islands held by Japanese forces. For example in the battle of Okinawa US forces saw 72 000 casualties (12 500 killed) in 82 days.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall#Estimated_casualties

The reasons that these estimates vary greatly is partly because no one really knew how many well equipped fighting formations the Japanese could muster in the Home Islands and no one really knew how effective the armed civilian resistance would actually be. Another factor that *may* explain the big differences in estimates is that when the planning began no one knew about the atomic bomb so it wasn't until atumn 1945 that the planners could factor in tactical usage of nuclear weapons. I say ""may explain"" because I have no idea when these estimates where made."

What teams on the SEC schedule can you look at and say with 100% confidence you'll win? Kentucky, Arkansas, maybe Miss State. And any of those teams could show up and play out of their minds and beat you.

Yes, the top of the SEC usually beats the bottom half, but they're usually tough, hard-fought games that could have gone the other way. It's that week-to-week grind that makes it difficult to run the table in either league.

Also, in the Pac-12: there's Colorado and Cal. Any other team has the capability to beat any other."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388817803.0,"You seem to be struggling with the tension between idealism and realpolitik. Both are necessary for politics to work.

Realpolitik is a concept advanced most famously by Otto Von Bismarck, who said **""Politics is the art of the possible.""**  Politicians who embrace realpolitik tend to get shit done.  The problem is they also tend to be the politicians whom give politicians a bad name.

The other problem with realpolitiks is that without a clearly visualized, ideal end goal or state to focus on -- a vision of how government and society should be -- realpolitiks tends to break down into politicians doing whatever they can to take and hold power.  

Imagine a politician who exists only to get elected over and over; he has no goals other than to survive the next election.  Is this a good statesmen?  Does this inspire you?  Of course not.  But that's what a realpolitik player becomes when he doesn't have idealists shaping the vision of his political coalition.

Hence, you need the **Idealists**.  The people who have completely impractical and possibly unrealizable visions of possible futures.  People who can clearly articulate what the **point** of politics should be.

Combine these two elements, and you get a pretty effective political organization that is able to make meaningful political advancements.  Combine them in the same person, and you get most of the great political leaders of history."

I am unable to birth children due to a hip deformity, But I don't want kids anyway, I'm child free. My aunt was unable to conveive, she never met the right man and kids just never happened, she feels regret everyday, she is childless. But then she adopted a child, and she is now a mother, she is no longer childless because she has a child that she loves more than anything.

If I am going to generalise and be stereotypical, the childless make the best parents IMO, because they appreciate it, they work hard for it, and they aim to be the best. Its not something that just happened that they had to deal with, and its not a lifestyle they just felt they were expected to have, they really wanted it and they fought harder than any other type of parent to get it."

All of the wood in that image is just a single block type, regular dark oak planks. Through use of extensive CTM, all of the different patterns you see here are possible with that alone. It uses vertical, repeat, and face specific CTM, and a whole lot of .properties files.

[Savannah Biome](http://i.imgur.com/eYVWQD1.jpg) I made biome specific base grass and tall grass for this one. The trees are based on the [dragonblood](http://www.mnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/node-gallery-display/public/tree_1.jpg) tree. Through CTM i have added some branches along the bottom just like an actual dragonblood tree has. I'm still working out the bugs in that one.

[Roofed forest biome](http://i.imgur.com/Lgtb1TC.jpg) The dark oak trees are covered in fungi and moss. There are no leaves, just a thick tangle of branches. More biome specific ctm as well, with albino plants who have never seen sunlight.

Fizjig,childfree,1388818623.0,"The concept of living off of a single wage is completely foreign to me. I've  been with my wife for 9 years. We both have full time jobs. She is a manager and makes a better than average wage. I am a professional leather worker who has a normal salary on top of what I make selling hand made leather goods. We don't live lavishly by any means. We live in a modest 2 bedroom apartment, we share a car, and we don't have lots of expensive things. All that said it feels like we live paycheck to paycheck just to scrape by. We are not drowning in debt. We don't use credit cards. We just don't ever seem to be able to save, or have money left at the end of the month. 

Whenever I hear someone talking about going single income the only thing I can think is, ""How the hell do people do that?""

On a side note: I keep seeing people on this sub write things about how you have to stay independent, because your spouse will cheat on you the first chance they get. I think this is a very pessimistic, negative point of view. I personally have no interest in people outside of my marriage. This might partially be because I cannot stand most of society as a whole, but I can say my wife and I enjoy each others company over anyone else. Even after 9 years.

This idea that you can't trust your SO is nonsense. Trust and communication are the 2 things you absolutely have to have in a healthy relationship. "

This parable is talking about people exactly like you in it's second half!

You have mistaken my mocking of your ignorance for frustration.  Sorry that mood differences do not translate well in text.  My law practice is largely based on court appearances and I don't write as much as the junior associates at the firm, so I like to come here and keep my mind fresh.

&gt;The government has ruled that slavery was legal under the constitution.

Slavery was legal until the 13th Amendment.

&gt;They've ruled that the ""commerce clause"" gave them the right to regulate things that were clearly only happening within state lines.

Well, I happen to personally disagree with those rulings, but it doesn't make what I've said any less correct or true.  Which seems to be the theme of our conversation: Your inability to render anything I've said untrue or incorrect.

&gt;Intelligent people don't take the US Federal Government seriously anymore. We've moved on a long time ago.

Right, because you have your own nation.  You're sovereign, right?  Or are you one of the Moorish Americans?  Those ones are really funny.

&gt;No. Because for the first time in history there is now a money that can't be confiscated, taxed, traced, frozen, inflated, or destroyed by governments. 

Well, if you're not reporting your bitcoin ""gains"" to the IRS, you're a tax fraud.  It's only a matter of time.  

&gt;And the same protocol that this money flows over can be used to verify ownership of other property without trusted third parties (read: governments).

Which is all well and good until someone comes with guns to take the Thai boy prostitutes and Mary Jane you bought on the Silk Road.  ""You can't take this, I have a deed from the Clerk of Bitcoin County!""  Good luck with that.   You think the police will enforce that?  The trusted third party is NEVER needed as long as everyone plays nice.  Trouble is, not everyone plays nice.

&gt;With Bitcoin, we don't need to convince a majority of people. Their own rational self interest will do it for us.

I don't have much self-interest in a pyramid scheme at the moment.  ""Come use Bitcoin!  It's money!  Well, you don't actually buy things with it, for the most part.  You see, you buy the money, and then you go around on the internet annoying the fuck out of everyone bragging about how much of this money you have, and how awesome it is, and then people sign up, and you sell them a little bit of the money, and then they do the same.""

The fact that he knows about and supports me through everything I deal with, the fact that he loves me even including my many flaws, that's something of beauty. He doesn't want to ""fix"" me, he wants to help me heal myself, because he loves me no matter what but he just wants me to be happy.

The other guard is a pretty good scorer, but getting up and down the court just isn't what he does, and this season his 3-pt shooting is actually below league average. Sometimes he throws away posessions, usually when doing stupid isos and burning up the whole shot clock.

CheekyLittleCunt,yugioh,1388818977.0,"No. Patricks list wanted to hit the cards that say ""stop playing yugioh"". Those cards aren't interruption cards. Veiler is an interruption card, Warning is an interruption card, Maxx ""C"" is an interruption card. All *great* cards. 

Macro, D-Fissure, Soul Drain, Ophion? These are not interruption cards. These are ""flip and win"" cards. If you don't have an answer to it straight away, you've lost.  Think how much people hate these ""win button"" cards (*cough* Return *cough* Sixth Sense). Now imagine having 3 of them in a deck against you? 

Yugioh is not solitaire. Playing one card that allows your opponent to do nothing does not result in fun and sophisticated gameplay. It's not a game anymore, it's a ""who can draw macro/summon ophion first"" competition. 


Frankly, I find the people who gravitate to these kind of decks are the bad players who can't win in the classic (and fun) grind game and so need to play easy to pilot linear decks in order to stand a chance at sacking a win. Dragon rulers and Mermail had the best players of their formats, yet there were bad players piloting Evilswarm and Macro Rabbit in order to try and scrape a win with those degenerate ""yugioh hating"" decks. The reasons these decks never actually won anything significant in their formats was because of the bad players playing them, and the experienced players staying clear away from them. 

I won my first ever regional in mermail format playing a macro rabbit deck I saw on the internet. I was a horrible, horrible player. I made tonnes of stupid mistakes and barely knew the rules; yet I sacked so hard and opened laggia + macro + 4 backrow all tournament. 

Laggia/Ophion set 5 is not good yugioh. It's boring and no one wants to play it. 

So yes, I'm a supporter of Hobans list and the man in general, because he knows what he's talking about.  A lot of top tier players will agree with him too; because they're all experienced players who are very good with yugioh theory. It seems even Konami agree with him because they're getting rid of all these ""stop playing yugioh"" cards.  Bad players who rely on floodgate cards (like you) are the ones who rage over Hoban and his articles. But those kind of players will never top an event so they're irrelevant.

You can also see fish eating jellyfish alive because they lack stingers.

lamblikeawolf,introvert,1388819041.0,"&gt;So you get frustrated, annoyed, yelled at..you gotta suck it up and do your job.

Yelled at? YELLED AT?! That is acceptable behavior for anyone in a professional situation? That is acceptable behavior for a supervisor to an employee? That is acceptable behavior for a supervisor to THEIR INTERN, who is very obviously not going to be perfect because they are new and still learning the ropes? Instead of guiding them?

Sorry. This just struck a very raw nerve in me. **(Begin rant.)** The first job I got out of college was at a marketing research survey place in the mall, not in my field even remotely, and was supposed to be something to do in the mean time. Long story short, I ended up becoming the assistant manager after two weeks on the job and eventually had to quit because of the amount of stress and the literal yelling I received at being unable to control factors entirely outside of my control. I cannot make a Hispanic woman between 45 and 49 who has three children and most often uses Ajax cleaner appear in the mall. But I had to ""do whatever it takes to get it done"" which was code for ""use a relative's phone number and lie about the data"". Which also didn't sit well with me. And the consequence for not getting it done? Corporate calling, literally screaming over the phone, then hanging up, only to call back thirty minutes later. Repeat for an entire day. Every time. Even when the stupid survey wasn't due for another several days and that was literally the last person you needed to complete it because of the way they assign quotas. **(End rant.)**

your accusation (or, at the very least, publicized concern) is 4 months old, but because of the rank this post has on google, I'm replying to it.

RES does not and never will collect and sell user data. at least not the versions of RES maintained/managed by me.  If someone else decides to fork it and distribute their own version and you download it elsewhere: do so at your own risk.

The reason RES ""needs access to your history"" isn't to view your history. One of the biggest things I used to get angry email about was ""when I expand an image with the image viewer, the link isn't purple! THIS RUINS MY LIFE!""  (I'm not really exaggerating here)...

so RES needs access to your history in order to **add urls to it** when you expand an image but didn't actually click to visit the page.

you also claim RES looks at ""posting history"" -- that's just something you must've misremembered, because RES can't / doesn't do any such thing."

I think some people on this sub glamorize being tall, but it's just another genetic trait that someone has no control over. I think a woman who won't date a short guy is the same thing as not dating someone because they have a small penis. The small penis guy may be able to get the job done well for all she knows, but stupid social norms dictate that it's 'undesirable' even though the ancient Greeks preferred it and ugly people were often portrayed with huge genitals and the 'Adonises' have smaller ones. But the phrase 'work with what you've got' is very appropriate for these situations and nobody likes someone who does nothing but complain. 

So I think anyone who will make such a critical judgement about someone on something like that is more likely to be a shitty person.

On the other hand, people who are tall an treat it like a huge accomplishment and give people people a hard time for being short are complete dickbags. It's like the people who think that them being born in a specific country makes them better than other people. No, you should not treat it like an achievement.

In high school I was a twig, and I started working out in college. That's when I noticed that ""fat girls"" weren't as into me as I had previously experienced. I guess there is something about nerdy, scrawny, short guys that some ""short, fat girls"" like. Now the type of girl that comes on to me is predominantly skinny and between 5'3''-5'7'' (they also tend to be Hispanic, but I think that is because I look like I am too, even though I'm not)."

The idea being, if you have backrow, your backrow should be able to stop them. If they still manage to push through your backrow, Kuriboh is live, if they don't? Then your backrow did its job.

You've got to be kidding me.....

&gt;Now here are the couple problems I see.

Marriage isn't a problem.  The age gap is pretty large at 17 years, though I know some couples with a large age gap like that.  Her education is an issue because it's unlikely she will finish getting her degree after having a kid.  You will be the provider.  Fuck her parents, they're not going to be happy with their daughter being with a 36 year old no matter if she's pregnant or not.  

So really the issues are only:

- Are you okay with the age gap? She'll still be looking good in her early 30s when you're 50 and on the downward slope.  

- You will likely always be the provider as most women don't get their degrees after having a kid.  Can you deal with that?  If you guys marry and divorce, you will pay out the ass.

He was a kid that lied a lot, I remember that very clearly. We went to church together, and he was always making up stories to sound cool or to stay out of trouble if he did wrong. He'd also blame stuff on his little brother Michael (who isn't a bad kid). 

When he was older and started dating, he was a huge cheater. I have several friends who dated him and he without fail cheated on them. Sometimes he would have two girlfriends at once and they would both be convinced that he loved only them, and that the other girl didn't exist. Even if you tried to convince them he was lying, it would take a long time for them to see through his stuff. And it isn't like he was a good looking guy, he's just average, maybe even a little dumb looking. I don't know what these women saw in him.

I do know he was abused sexually as a child and that may have fucked him up pretty badly. He did talk about child abuse and how much he hated abusers. 

I don't really want to think about him anymore tonight, if you're curious tomorrow I might try and think of some more about him, I haven't really thought about him in years until I saw this story a couple days ago. "

Wonderman09,socialskills,1388820269.0,"So i've been in your position and i it actually isn't as bad to get over as it seems at first. SublethalDose is definitely on to something with the dance classes and i wholeheartedly agree on shaking hands even if you feel that is unnatural. Sure, it's a little formal, but honestly it's the best and most personal greeting you can give someone new. It gives you a chance to look them in  eye and actually properly catch their name. I actually can't imagine introducing myself without a handshake, haha! Just standing there and saying ""Hey, i'm X."", maybe even with a raised hand for greeting, just seems a little out of touch (see what i did there? Sorry).

Give the handshakes a shot. It's the most simple start to physical contact you can get and it honestly does make for a natural starting point to a conversation. Personally, even if i just sat down to a chick (or dude for that matter), i still shake their hand when introducing myself. Never has anyone looked at me weird for doing that.

Now, you've introduced yourself and you've actually started flirting, but you can seem to really grasp the natural points of touching her in conversation.

Arm touching and shoulder touching is fine, but those are very situational and if they're making you uncomfortable you shouldn't do them. I didn't start with those either and it think it made learning a lot easier. There are two points that are pretty easy to start on, because they are sort of natural responses to advances she makes; knees/thighs and hips. I'll be a little more specific on noth, because it's not the way you're thinking right now.

Knees and thighs are essentially the same. You don't need to touch them with your hands unless you're getting hot and heavy either now or later, BUT you can touch them with your own knees and your own thighs, as in you sit really close with them. As the both of you are getting into a conversation you will probably sort of naturally gravitate towards each other - you even touched on it in your post in the bit about pulling a blank when a chick touches you. I'll try and touch on that later as well (man, i am just throwing the unintentional puns left and right!).

In the beginning i used this as a sort of test to see if she was comfortable with my presence. Even though i had been able to hear her just fine for the last 30 minutes, i'd say ""Sorry, i can barely hear you"" and then move closer to her. If you're already sitting next to each other, then you don't really need to say anything, just do a sort of ""Lean and slide"". Lean in to listen to what she is saying, then slide in a little and when look back up and her. You can make it a sort of 2 step process as well, if that makes you more comfortable. If you're sitting next to her and turn your body slightly to face her and let your knees touch. If she pulls her knee away, then you shouldn't really push any further. Just go into friend mode and relax. Let her take the wheel a little and mirror what she feels comfortable with, then you can pick it back up, if it seems you were just out a little early.

If the knees touching seemed second nature to her (as in she seemed completely fine with it), then carry on the conversation and get comfortable there, because you might be getting scared of getting nervous and pull a blank and so on. Don't push it just because you feel you need to. Don't throw yourself in the deep end when you're trying to learn to swim (fun fact: i actually did that when i was younger and i almost drowned because our teacher was flirting with the swimming coach. I somehow managed to panic my way across the pool, so i guess it didn't seem as bad, haha.)

If you get a little more comfortable with the whole ordeal you can think about doing the ""Lean and slide"" from there.

Soooooo... Hips, huh? You probably didn't think that far into it, haha! Trust me when i say it isn't as hard as it seems. There is an alternative option, so don't skip this bit just because it seems a little daunting (i know i would have slightly dismissed it in the beginning).

What this part will essentially be about is putting your arm around her. That's the natural next step after sitting really close with her, if you want to turn up the heat a little more. It essentially puts you both in each others personal space (even more so than you already are by sitting close). This might be pushing it for you, but it is still the next step i feel like you should take.

If everything is going well, lean in to listen like before, but hold her a little closer too by putting your arm over her back and putting your hand on her hip, but when you pull back, don't take your hand off her hip. If she reacted well to everything before, then this shouldn't be a problem. If you've gotten to this point with a chick, i feel like you're already in for a phone number for sure. I would go for the kiss at this point (later in the evening of course).

The alternative i mentioned before would necessitate that there is some sort of back to whatever the both of you are sitting on. Instead of putting your hand on her hip you put your arm across the back of whatever you guys are sitting on. In this situation you probably won't be touching her, but you will still be more in each others space. It's a less intimate alternative, but it has the same sort of effect.

I haven't got more time to write, so i'll finish with the piece on nerves once i get home. In the meantime i'd love some feedback on this fucking wall of text, haha! 


**I'M BACK**

Sorry it took so long, but stuff suddenly happened and i ended up going out the door to meet a friend at 9.45AM and coming back in the door at 11PM. I pretty much just took a shower and passed out when my head hit the pillow, haha!

So ***NERVES***, huh? Aren't they some bitch? Just that constant sort of nagging in the back of your mind... ""Why aren't you doing this?"" ""Why haven't you done that?"" ""Should you do that?"" ""Should you say that?"" ""Does she seem like she is enjoying my company?"" ""Would i be a creep if i did this?"" ""Is this too early to do?"" ""Is this too late to do?"" ""Oh boy, you're pulling a blank now! HAHA YOU'RE FUCKED!""

This was what my nerves were in the beginning anyways. It was constantly questioning every action, when to do it, if it was appropriate and then at some point i would overthink it so much i would lose my trail of thought in the conversation, shit myself and not be able to think of something new to say - whether i actually heard what she said or not. Pulling a blank is like a brain freeze... You literally cannot think of anything else while it's going on.

So how do you remedy this? Telling you to relax is like telling a depressed person to cheer up. Doesn't help, despite the fact it would be the simplest solution, if it was actually possible. No, what i'll tell you is to not dwell on that stuff. Keep it simple and you'll be a lot happier when starting a journey such as this out. It's OK to be nervous. It's one of the most natural feelings in the world. Accept that you'll get nervous, don't fight it. As soon as you're fighting it, then you're taking yourself out of the conversation mentally, because you'll be fumbling to find a quick solution to it. One of the simplest things i'll do if it gets really bad is just tackle it head first and admit it. ""I can't think of anything to say right now. You're just awesome, so i'm getting all nervous. Could you just repeat what you said?""

If you're getting tongue-tied, then just slow down a little. Don't stutter your way through. If you feel it coming on, then just stop, think and then go. If it doesn't work, then you'll probably need to tackle it like above, so it gives you an opportunity to look in her eyes and sigh a little. Laugh it off. Nobody likes a debbie-downer.

If the nerves are stemming from getting touched, then i don't know how to really help with that. I can't tell you anything else than to go with it. You won't learn to deal with it any other way than to actually touch others. This is seemingly one of your issues. You have a hard time taking whatever they give and rolling with it. Try not to overthink it though. If you feel yourself getting in your head, look into their eyes and focus on them. Listen to what they're saying. Stay in the conversation.

So what have i covered then. I feel like i'm getting sidetracked. How to deal with nerves? Slow down, admit it and don't be too hard on yourself, as in keeping it light and laughing it off. I think that's sort of it.

Keeping eye contact can be hard, but it's one of the best things you can do. It makes it obvious to them that you're interested and it makes it easier for you to stay focused, because you're literally glaring into the mirror of their soul, haha. It'll get intense and there will be points where you will want to look away - fucking do that. Don't take this as the word of the bible. If you get overly uncomfortable, then do what makes you comfortable.

This will be hard at first, but i promise you it gets easier with time and practice. You'll see it isn't as bad the first couple times and then that'll give you the energy to make it second nature. 

***TL;DR***

If there is anything i want you to take away from this it is to make it a progressional thing. Don't need to make it random little thing like shoulder or arms. You can use it to test the waters and see how you're doing. Find comfort in this.

Don't overthink it. Stay in the conversation and go back into your comfort-zone if it gets too much. If you get tongue-tied and nervous, admit it. Give yourself some elbow-room (in a metaphorical sense, not literal, haha). Roll with the punches and try to have fun, because you won't like it otherwise.

To0n1,IAmA,1388820328.0,"Overall, know the fundamental laws. I know, ""Durr,"" but it has to be said.

To put this up here:

**TL;DR** : Practice each type of question you are going to face. A lot.

Essays:

First, learn to outline issues and issue spot: do so on scratch paper. Do not be afraid to spend 10-15 minutes doing this if you have an hour to write the essay. Put all legal arguments that you can think of, even the silly ones. 

When writing, remember KISS - Keep it simple, stupid. Clear concise sentences about the legal point you are making. Keep your paragraphs centered on the legal point you are addressing. Include pros and counter arguments. Don't waste time using unneeded verbage in your arguments, it may distract from your point, and take up space. No need to say in 10 words when 5 will do. You're not doing a persuasive brief here.

3rd, just practice a lot of writing in test like scenarios. You can ramp up to testing scenarios (California bar was 3 essays in 180 minutes OR 
1 legal simulation in 180 minutes). If your writing wasn't the best in law school (My first year legal writing class damn near killed me) this is 
probably going to be the biggest hurdle, but if I could over come it, anyone can.

If you can have someone grade them (or at the very least, read them and let you know if they made sense or not) this would be ideal.

Multiple Choice: Practice Practice Practice. Not sure what they use up in Canada, but in the US, most jurisdictions use the MBE, which is 200 questions covering the common law fundamentals (when I took the bar last February, they also started to add in Civil Proceedure, but YMMV) Not sure what is done up in Canada, but if there are released versions of prior years multiple choice (if applicable), practice them, under testing conditions. For the MBE, you had 200 questions in 6 hours (a three hour block of 100 questions, break, another three hour block of 100 questions). That gave an average of 108seconds (figure a little over a minute and a half) per question to read, apply the applicable law, and mark. That meant doing a lot of practice problems, under test conditions. I did my practice in 10 question blocks, then 20, then 30, then 50 - All timed. After I felt that I had a good pace to pass ratio (e.g. 80% right or higher, pref. 90%, ideally 100%), I then started to do 100 questions under test conditions.

Simulations:

For the California Bar exam, we had simulations - Draft a persuasive brief or a summary of facts, or a letter to a layperson client. Here, it depends on what you are doing. Again, if there are older, released versions, and you have access to them, use them.

My tactic that I was taught was to take the first hour to read the substantive law in the simulation, take notes, get familiar with what was key in the simulation. Then, I would read what ever the simulation was about. Ideally you're reading it critically the first time, but I read through it once, quickly, issue spotted, then went back again through it (quickly) to issue spot some more. All this usually took about an hour, to 1.5 hours.

Writing the simulation itself took the remaining time, with outlining first, then writing what it was, keeping in mind the tone needed.

Practice for this was not as much as the essays (since the skills overlapped a bit) but it's not something to lack in.

Hope this helps!

If you actually deserve to be chewed out, then fucking do your job or quit.  If you don't, then talk to your SP and say that you handle criticism differently and tell her how to talk to you.  She's people too and she's used to dealing with unsatisfactory work with that way - maybe she doesn't think it would be taken personally or whatever, but it doesn't help you do a better job and ultimately all she needs to do is get you to do your job.

Meanwhile, Breen is in the background secretly pulling the strings, which is why he's not scared, but also he can't see Grigori, riding on top of the car, because that represents the demons that lurk within all of them that will come out when the going gets rough and tensions start to grow within the party. Also they've kicked G-Man out of the car, so that means that he's just going to be trying to keep up and not be able to control things anymore. Finally, the perspective from the hood means that Gordon has lost control of the situation to Alyx and now all he can do is try and survive, and he will spend a good part of the game just trying not to die after being thrown off the hood.

Nope, just FTC and FLL. 

First, you've got to realize that you can't exactly expect to go to Harbor Freight and by a 100-ct pack of servos or encoders. Much of this equipment is just expensive by virtue of what they are. I can't speak to the pricing of FTC components, but everything used in FRC were pretty steeply discounted by the manufacturer for teams such as ours. 

Second, Every electrical and logic component utilized in my high school's FRC robot were either fabricated by the students or were off the shelf components issued by FRC. Additionally, every off the shelf component was issued with about twenty pages of technical documentation that detailed pretty much everything you'd want to know. 

Obviously, we weren't allowed to modify certain components, but hey, you've gotta have rules somewhere.

Accelerated C++ has the reputation of bringing novice programmers up to speed real fast, its not a very large book either, and from there you can go on to effective c++ along side working on projects of your own if you want.

There is a danger of taking the metaphor too far and becoming jaded. There is also potential for self-growth if you develop ""inner-game.""

I have said just about the same thing before. PUA and TRP don't ""work"", they just convince you that they work, put you in a comfort zone, and allow you to overcome anxiety; which is enough.

So Lenin never made gay marriage legal but he made gay sex legal.

""The Communist Party abolished all Czarist laws and its subsequent criminal code in the 1920s, did not criminalize non-commercial same-sex sexuality between consenting adults in private. It also provided for no-fault divorce and legalized abortion.[9] However, homosexuality remained a criminal offense in certain ""uncivilized"" Soviet Union states in the 1920s as part of an effort against ""uncivilized"" cultural practices.
In 1933, Joseph Stalin added Article 121 to the entire Soviet Union criminal code, which made male homosexuality a crime punishable by up to five years in prison with hard labor. The precise reason for Article 121 is in some dispute among historians. The few official government statements made about the law tended to confuse homosexuality with pedophilia and was tied up with a belief that homosexuality was only practiced among fascists or the aristocracy.
The law remained intact until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union; it was repealed in 1993.[10][11]""

Had just fixed a fairly nasty board advantage my opponent had using Mind Control Tech to pinch his taunt and proceeded to trade like it was Wall Street, leaving only a few totems and a couple of creatures with 3 or less attack. He then dropped Wind Speaker on an Argus, followed by BL, and knocked me down to 3hp faster than I could blink. Luckily I top decked Shadow Word: Pain and took his Windfury out, got another Taunt down and won on the next turn. I then proceeded to chain smoke until my nerves had recovered and my pulse was back to normal.

soleoblues,ABraThatFits,1388821220.0,"Yup -- went to a fairly good bra shop in my town. I'm a 30H/HH, and sometimes size down to a 28HH for additional support. I tend to get fitters who are maaaaybe in the 30D category, and don't understand what it's like to have very full, large, and heavy breasts. 

Yes, I wear my two-hook bras very snug, and yes, I know it'll wear out faster that way. However, I'd rather my bra wear out than my back wear out -- I can replace my bras (I would anyway, because OMG THE PRETTY), but I can't quite replace my back. The fitters tend to judge like crazy, which irks me and sends me back to online shopping. I've also had fitters do their best to push me into bras that don't give me the shape I like (I'm a fan of rounded shapes), and tell me I didn't need to do that when I swooped and scooped after putting on a bra (they swore doing the bent-over jiggle was enough). Ooosh, and then there was a fitter who was visibly uncomfortable with boobs. I don't think she lasted long, poor dear.

Nordy's tends to ignore me when I ask for UK sizes, and brings me US sizes instead. 

I'm not even going to get into the last time I went to VS (they have pretty panties! Don't judge!) and the fitter swore a 38DD/DDD would fit me perfectly -- after I told her my size, and before she'd even taken out a measuring tape. I did not leave with a 38DD/DDD.

Slukaj,electronics,1388821222.0,"Well, first, how old are you? If you're a mentor, then I'd like to respectively ask you to shove it. There's a very dangerous line between believing your students can do something, and doing something for them in a manor you are familiar with, and that includes doing so vicariously.

If you're a student, then keep up the good work, but recognize that the rule is in place to protect students from mentors like I listed above.

Second, don't discount the language used on the Mindstorm blocks. Back when I was first with the program (2001 Arctic Impact), we managed to excel with the Lego-designed IDE, which was so blunt of a tool that it's amazing in retrospect that we got anything done. Don't knock the contemporary implementation without knowing where we came from.

The biggest thing I can say is that the decision to restrict IDEs comes from FIRST's desire to keep the playing field as level as possible. One of the biggest problems in this program is mentors who wind up doing all of the work vicariously through the students. The objective is to teach the *students* how to do this stuff using parts they are familiar with. That means developing an IDE with a low entry point but has lots of room for experienced programmers (which Mindstorm hasn't perfected but is pretty close).

On the one hand, it nerfs teams with legitimately talented individuals. But on the other, it's designed as teaching tool first and competitive program second. FIRST is trying to TEACH, not to foster competition."

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-titSCAoxc I couldn't really find a great video but I hope it helps with my point. Just compare this to your experience with Skyrim. Character movement looks tight and focused, attacks have visual and auditory feedback, and the weapon looks like it's actually striking at an enemy, not just playing out an animation on the screen.

I'm not sure first person combat can ever be done that well again, because Red Steel 2 benefit massively from the Wii motion plus, but the idea of lock-on, tight movements that feel like they have purpose, and weapon strikes that look and feel like they're hitting the enemy. There's no reason it can't be done again."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388821405.0,"&gt;Romance would only be the largest genre of fiction of you are only talking about books.

True.  Men don't read as much anymore, but women still read tons.  Men turn to more visual mediums more often, women still seem to prefer books.  That's why Oprah's book club makes gazillions of dollars and Hollywood's attempts to capture female viewers have been notoriously unreliable.  

&gt;When we're discussing all media inclusively with movies, TV, and games, then the fact that only one genre out of all comes close is pretty sad.

Soap Operas feature many female protagonists and villains, and for most of the history of television were the largest genre of television.  Many reality TV shows (which are totally fictional) focus primarily on female protagonists (Kim Kardashian being the most notable).  Romantic Comedies, of which a zillion are made every year, almost exclusively have female protagonists.  Pretty much every game that Big Fish Games sells features a female protagonist.

Once it was confirmed to be chlamydia he 'fessed up' to a 10 second blow job.  Bull fucking shit. I had it in my throat as well as down there so I was pretty darn sick for a good week.

ScipiiRye,TumblrInAction,1388821540.0,"Thanks for the rational response! 

In my experience parents choose to circumcise their children not because of the benefits vis-a-vis STIs (I still wear condoms and don't think being circumsized precludes the use of them), but cleanliness/aesthetic reasons. Obviously that's somewhat ambiguous, but it goes a way to explain non-relgious and non-cultural motivations.

Also the reason they do it to infants is because of the complications it would entail once the man is older and the penis and foreskin are larger and already developed. When it's a baby you don't even need to apply analgesic or whatever, it's just snip and done. The risk of complications is significantly lower when the procedure is done as an infant.

Source: SO's mother is a delivery room nurse. I could find a source from the CDC if you so desire.

iIsMe95,ClopRP,1388821575.0,"The king smiled at her offer.  To him, it was naive.  The griffons were not blessed as the ponies of Equestria had been.  There were the before mentioned problems with agriculture, but the geography offered another problem.  Organization was often hard to keep between the scattered valleys of the griffon home land.  Before Tallonus came to power, the griffons were a number of scattered tribes and divided city-states.  The mighty empire they now where wasn't easy to build.  It took long years of war and strict discipline to bring them together.  The fortress castle he called his home was a testament to what could be achieved through strict order and merciless discipline.

However, what she offered was tempting.  Not only a child, but complete sexual submission to him.  To the king, that would be a major mark or pride.  He decided on a set of counter term.  ""I will give you from now to one year after our wedding.  During that time, you will advise and teach me to rule with love and compassion.  If it proves itself as a good way to rule, then I shall do it.  However, if I find it to be ineffective, we return to the old ways of order and discipline.  Does this sound fair?"""

llamallamalizard,childfree,1388821648.0,"I have no idea why this is getting downvoted so bad, I think it's a very logical response offering an alternate perspective and possible reasoning. Honestly, it answers the question asked... I don't see what's the matter. I don't like the term ""breeder"" either because it sounds judgmental and it immediately implies disrespect or makes the person using the term look like they are feeling superior.

 Being a parent is a choice, just like so many other things in life. Just because I've decided that I don't want to have kids doesn't mean that no one should have kids if they want to. My decisions aren't for everyone, we all have different circumstances in life and we all deserve to live life in a way that makes us happy provided it doesn't directly inflict harm (emotional, physical, or mental) on anyone. 

We all deal with different things in our lives- for some people it's a very rewarding experience to be a parent and is worth it, for others, it wouldn't be. All I ask is that I'm allowed to live my life without fear of repercussion or insult or injury from people due to this choice. It's not the end of the world if someone disagrees with me or fails to see my point of view- it's frustrating, certainly, but perhaps the person simply needs to have something to cling to. They won't change my mind, and if I can't make them see my side, I shrug and move on to something more productive. If they harass, I move away from the confrontation and notify whoever is in charge of them (boss, manager, police, etc) 

If I ask for respect then I give respect. It might not be the way OP meant it, but the term is rather inflammatory and should likely be avoided in serious debate. "
caffeinep0wered,snes,1388821649.0,"At first I suspected a corrupt ROM (it happens!) but on three separate cartridges that's unlikely. Also I should point out that if the contacts were gunked up you would get no loading at all since the cartridges use a parallel bus from ROM to the CPU. One track out means that games that do have that problem will fail to load at all and just sit on a blank screen. Of course, it IS possible that the ROM on all three is damaged, the way to check that is to get a known-good cart and try that (Cash {Converters|Concepts|Generator} is a good place to look, you can usually get a random SNES game for like 50p).

Do you get sound? I couldn't tell from your post, if not it could suggest a problem with the S-SMP.

The only other thing I can thing of (which /u/takebackplenty has already mentioned) is the PSU. Specifically the SNES board's voltage regulator (the good old LM7805), which can take anything from 7V up to ~35V DC without breaking a sweat, although its current supplying capacity diminishes over time and you may be triggering its overcurrent protection circuit. This would require opening it up and poking around with a multimeter, though.

Amunium,MensRights,1388822051.0,"No need to apologise, I didn't think it was preachy - I appreciate you taking the time to explain your opinion. That said, I can't fully agree with it.

The key, at least in the first part of your comment, is that ""familiar bond"". The difference between a non-family-member and a parent is purely that you're somehow ""supposed"" to feel connected to a parent through that bond.

Now, first of all, that raises a couple of problems. Who are you supposed to have that bond for? Is it only biological parents? If so, does an adopted child not follow this rule? If not, what defines a parent or family member without including anyone else? If it's merely the fact that they've been there most of your life, a life-long friend should be the same.

Secondly, if the bond is the only difference between a parent and a friend, then the part of how you treat people is removed from the argument, and the argument becomes ""if you don't have that familiar bond for your parents, it's a warning sign of an abusive relationship"", i.e. if you treat your parents *the same* as anyone else, you're probably an abusive romantic partner.

warriorscall,USMCboot,1388822107.0,"Google the Foreign Language Proficiency Pay program and see if Portuguese is on the list as an eligible language. My gut feeling is no but it can't hurt to try. If it is, you can take the DLPT test and if you score well enough you'll be eligible for a little extra pay.

When I did the recruiting process, we didn't get an MOS until we had already done all the paperwork and passed MEPS.

With a 76 I'd theorize that your line scores are high enough to qualify for most jobs but I'm unsure. However,  you normally will be offered a contract for an MOS field, rather than a specific MOS. For example, infantry contracts are ""03xx"" contracts. The 03 is the job field and the following numbers are the job, but they don't find out until mid ITB as I understand.  Most jobs find out their specific MOS near the end of boot camp.

In the UK (where I live) there is a law that says any claim made in advertising HAS to be backed by facts. On a washing up liquid  (dish soap) advert I saw ""Our product dish soap X is better than the leading brand"" and in the small print it said ""the leading brand is our dish soap"" they had changed the percentage of the active ingrediant and the name so they could make these claims. legally they told the truth so it was allowed. so if a product beats a competatos they will say ""we beat these guys"" but if their product is just an improvement on their own stuff it will probably say something like ""we beat the leaders"" HTH"

As you say,  there isn't a mechanic expressed in scripture for people being saved after the second judgement, why would something so crucial to your view not be mentioned?

The only thing I can see that supports your view is that heaven is left open for eternity. 

Also if your view is correct then what would be the point of the Book of the Lamb, or Judgement at all? 

What I know is that despite God's wants for us to be with him sin still separates us from him. The Book of the Lamb seems to be the cutoff that people will meet or fall short of. If your soul is not free of sin at judgement then you will perish and never see the kingdom of heaven.

So when he got laid off in October, we cut our expenses way down and now we only really pay for our mortgage, basic bills, and have a really strict grocery budget around $75/week. So when he does find work again, I feel more practiced in budgeting for the future and have a greater understanding our how important it is for us to pay off our cards.

But the major source of our problem is our insane mortgage. It's like $2500/month plus a $300 HOA fee, and with his unemployment and my income combined we make around $4000/mo. Our insurance, internet, gas, electricity, car payments, student loans and all cost us around $500/month. Basically we bought our condo based on a much earlier income of his. He took a pay cut 2 years ago and we bought the condo a little over 4 years ago. But we've been stuck with the mortgage because we'd have to repay an $8k tax credit if we move out before 5 years. In August our mortgage will go down $600/mo which will go far to help our credit cards but in the meantime they seem stuck where they're at with how little we've been able to pay. It just feels like they've been at the same amounts forever despite us paying well over the minimum each month and I wondered if we needed to change things up to get a start on it -- with the idea that he'll get a job soon and our mortgage will go down a bit soon as well. But you're right, I'm sure that our future additional income &amp; savings will go a lot further for us than finding a different card. I just feel like everything is so up in the air right now and I need a plan. Thanks so much for your help."

Guglio08,metalgearsolid,1388822868.0,"Big Boss and Kaz Miller run a mercenary outfit called MSF. One day a KGB agent (posing as a university professor) named Galvez shows up with a girl named Paz. Galvez has a cassette tape that was allegedly recorded by Paz and her friend while they were held captive by a mysterious military force in Costa Rica. The tape has a sound recording of what is apparently The Boss, despite Big Boss having killed her in MGS3. Galvez offers Big Boss an offshore platform for his base of operations; in exchange, Big Boss will look into the military force. 

Miller is very excited about this, mostly because he views MSF as a business venture that will revolutionize armed conflict. Big Boss is hesitant, but agrees, in order to discover the origin of the tape. He picks up allies along the way, such as Nicaraguan revolutionaries (Amanda and Chico) and scientists (Huey and Strangelove). 

The scientists were working on a project called ""Peace Walker"" which is an AI controlled nuclear platform. The project's director, Coldman, wants to demonstrate that Peace Walker will always retaliate with nuclear weapons, and in order to prove that, he intends on faking a nuclear launch signal and having Peace Walker retaliate automatically. 

Huey builds some parts, and Strangelove worked on the AI pod, wherein she attempted to program a replica of The Boss, believing her to be the only truly revolutionary person in the world. She doesn't understand why The Boss let Big Boss kill her, and desperately attempts to find out the answer through the AI Boss, but always fails. 

Fast forward: Galvez is actually a guy named Zadornov. Big Boss damages Peace Walker but it still attempts to launch a nuke. However, The Boss's programmed memory instead destroys Peace Walker, preventing the launch. Big Boss still feels that The Boss betrayed him and everything he stands for. Zadornov is captured but escapes repeatedly. Big Boss and Miller are growing suspicious and believe that someone in MSF is intentionally freeing him.

That person is revealed to be Paz (actually a sleeper agent named Pacific Ocean) sent by a group named ""Cipher"" (aka Major Zero). Huey and Strangelove together have built a Metal Gear for MSF. Paz grows to enjoy MSF, but feels incredible pressure not to betray Cipher. She tries to sabotage Metal Gear ZEKE, but Chico, who has a crush on Paz, catches her, and instead she hijacks ZEKE, intending to launch its nuke to frame MSF.

Big Boss blows up ZEKE, launching Paz into the ocean. Big Boss renames MSF to ""Outer Heaven."" In the stinger, an audio tape reveals that Miller was also collaborating with Cipher in a business partnership."
rm999,NoStupidQuestions,1388822872.0,"From https://web.archive.org/web/20060318011507/http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/threeletters

Are there any English words containing the same letter three times in a row?


The usual rules of English spelling outlaw triple letters. Hyphens are inserted into words such as bee-eater, bell-like, chaff-flower, cretaceo-oolitic, cross-section, egg-glass, joss-stick, off-flavour, hostess-ship, puff-fish, toll-lodge, and zoo-organic.

A person who flees is a fleer, and a person who sees is a seer (though to avoid confusion with seer meaning `foreteller', the forms see-er and seeër have been used).

Nevertheless, we have encountered curious forms such as crosssection, and the complete Oxford English Dictionary does contain instances of frillless, bossship, countessship, duchessship, governessship, and princessship, and the county name Rossshire.

Graphic representations of noises, such as brrr, shhh, and zzz, do not really count as proper words.

The only other word with a triple letter is the invented word Amerikkkan, which is intended to symbolize the racist aspect of American society by including the initials of the Ku Klux Klan."

My mother, on the other hand, urged me to take something simple and focus on maintaining my good GPA for getting into the business school.

I took my dad's advice, failed engineering calculus, dropped the class, and was rejected from the business school because of it. When I showed up to inform the counselor that I had to drop the engineering course, he welcomed me with ""It looks like you'll be making it into our school!"" before I could tell him the bad news.

As silly as it sounds now, that is the only time in my life where I seriously contemplated suicide. I made a few fairly large life decisions aimed entirely at getting into that school.

Now, I'm almost 3 years out of college, from a far less prestigious business school, but I played my cards smart and landed an excellent job.

And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men, who, above all else, desire power. But they were, all of them, deceived, for another Ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master Ring, to control all others. And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all.

nedos,AskReddit,1388823933.0,"This ""debate"" is always so amusing to me. In my psychology class last year, there were 5 black people (including myself) and all of us knew and agreed that race had a lot to do with intelligence. The rest of the class, including the teacher, got upset. They somehow felt racially attacked because we, blacks, were ""putting our own race down"". People seem to think that lower IQ = inferiority, and black is solely skin colour, with no history or genetics involved. It says a lot about them …

I have one thing to point out though. The tests that took place were not really IQ tests. They were knowledge tests, which is pretty different. However, I'm pretty sure a real IQ test would give out the same result. Just look at how races have evolved and you'll see a great difference. Every trait present in a group of individuals, either humans or not, including intelligence, is just to benefit said group. If among the first Europeans, the ones with higher IQ survived, it means the group will evolve to be majorly composed of people of higher IQs. Simple, and definitely not racist. "

WraithPDX,todayilearned,1388824317.0,"At the risk of upsetting the inevitable anti-EA circlejerk, let me remind people that Valve can get away with this because they are responsible developers. There are other developers that can't manage their funds for shit and NEED corporations like EA, Activision, Ubisoft, etc. to manage them.

The best example of a company going in the complete opposite direction of Valve would be Ion Storm Dallas. Dev house focused on making games their way by creating nothing but hype, blowing tons of money on lavish things, and releasing games that were, to be blunt, terrible. You did have Eidos in the mix with licensing deals, but then again, Valve was also under license with Sierra Entertainment originally.

Personally, I'm glad Valve has got to this position and I'd like to see more developers follow this pattern. But sadly, engineers and developers are not always some of the most financially responsible individuals. Sadly, I know this because of how many companies I deal with daily."

ptam,AskReddit,1388824359.0,"Ghengis Fucking Khan was really a man ahead of his time capable of immense accomplishments and benevolence on par with his ruthlessness. He specifically wanted people to think he was some evil monster capable of the worst things (which, if you fucked with his highly accepting and tolerant multicultural mongolian ""tribe"", he was) so those he fought would outright submit, allowing them to be accepted (not necessarily assimilated) into his family. 

He was such a good general barely any army he met could match him, even when he had to organize tens of thousands of different races of soldiers. His wife was once taken from him by another tribe and he vowed to get her back. Decades later he saved her. He was one of the originators of don't kill the messanger (you really did not want to be the guy in charge that ordered one of his messangers killed). He lived a humble life alongside his people, incorporating spoils of conquests only for the betterment of every single one of his subjects, sharing in victories with his empire as though they were each as close as his family. He was enthusiastic about incorporating other cultures and technologies, making him revolutionary as a war general in ancient times who not only appreciated others unlike himself but encouraged and fostered learning from others. And his system of ruling was, in many ways, extremely democratic, imcluding consulting his various tribes about decisions to wage war, with significant regard given to those who would be affected the most (bordering tribes with the opposition, those who held little quarel but must risk their life anyways, etc.).

TL;DR being called a Mongol is more a compliment, really.

He was also revered as a god by his people, less by request, more by being such a god damn understanding, strong, and tactful leader. He actually brought the decision to lead the entire Mongol empire to vote, with no tangible repercusions for voting no. He won, obviously."

goldaline,AskReddit,1388824371.0,"Was it debunked that it wasn't hers or does it just have to do with the recent Tumblr updates? Just curious, I'm just hearing about this case through this thread and I found it very interesting. Looking around, her Tumblr is the only thing still being updated. If you look at [this](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/autre) link and go to her other online profiles, none of them have been updated since her death, and her twitter is deleted. Another Reddit thread linked her [Instagram](http://instagram.com/moulesmariniere), which hasn't been updated either and has a few comments mentioning her death (of course, they could have been posted by random people thinking it was her profile too).

Since the Tumblr is linked to other online accounts that share the same/similar usernames haven't been updated, it does *seem* to be hers. It is weird that it's been updated, though. Since there's only been a handful of posts since February, Euron_Greyjoy's explanation about queuing posts sounds the most plausible. And if you consider that she was supposed to be traveling and probably not updating her blog much, it makes sense that February would have the most amount of queued posts. A couple of the newer posts are of a model named Elisa too, who she had blogged pictures of previously. It wouldn't be too strange for her to have some more in queue. The only other thing I can think of is that Tumblr users can re-use usernames of deleted blogs, however, I don't think that's the case here as her entire archive would be gone as well.

... As I typed this up I noticed a couple other things. Her [March 2011 archive](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/archive/2011/3) has some photographs that seem to be the owner of the Tumblr. [This](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/post/3618147883) one would probably be best for comparison as it shows her face, although if it was her, it's a couple years old, and is impossible to compare to the video at least. There is also a [blog post](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/post/41786151020/i-have-arrived-in-laland-and-there-is-a) about her being in LA. The more I look through the blog, the more I think you weren't wrong in saying that is was hers.

ETA - Okay, now I'm almost positive the most recent posts were queued. If you look at who she reblogged them from, they were posted before her death. For example, [this](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/post/46831796200/confusedtree-flightfoot-is-this-a-zelda) video was reblogged from ""lampfaced,"" who posted it on January 13, 2013. The most recent post with the lighbulb was reblogged from [here](http://berezy.tumblr.com/post/40385454895/skeletales-by-alessandro-gottardo), which says it was posted ""11 mois"" ago. Also, it makes sense that she would queue a snowy scene with a Christmas tree to post in December. I would try to go through more of the posts to see when they date back to but the blog is loading incredibly slow for me for some reason."

As for a more affordable living situation, we're in LA so it's all pretty high but obviously not all this crazy. But my parents are always telling me about our equity and how important it's going to be. Do you think we should really move and pay back the 8k even though our mortgage will drop $600 in 8 more months?

**NEW CHARACTERS**

* Yu Jin (Wei) - Uses a trident, has a serious and stoic personality.
* Zhu Ran (Wu) - Uses a bow and arrow, has an energetic and eager personality.
* Fa Zheng (Shu) - Uses linked cloth, has a dark and brooding personality.
* Chen Gong (Lu Bu) - Uses a tactic scroll that summons soldiers, has an ambitious and haughty personality.
* Lu Lingqi (Lu Bu) - Uses Lu Bu's DW6 weapon, has a dutiful but somewhat haughty personality.

**NEW/IMPROVED MODES**

* Lu Bu's forces have their own story mode with a historical ending and a hypothetical ending
* Story mode now includes a series of standalone fictional stages for each faction (including the Others but not including the new Lu Bu faction) representing various what-if scenarios; for instance, one of Shu's involves Lu Bu defeating Cao Cao, and thus, Liu Bei has to turn to Sun Ce for help fighting Lu Bu; others include Yuan Shao defeating Cao Cao at Guandu and invading Wu, Sun Jian fighting Cao Cao on behalf of Yuan Shu, and Cao Cao defending against a huge invasion by Ma Chao
* Ambition Mode is expanded to include a second city
* In Ambition Mode and Free Mode, you can recruit and train bodyguards, who are simply officers from the game
* In Free Mode, if you select an officer who is present in the battle you have selected, you will actually take that officer's place instead of simply being a copy of them
* In Free Mode, every stage has three optional objectives you can fulfill to increase your ranking
* Challenge Mode (haven't played these yet, since it's not really my cup of tea)

**OTHER IMPROVEMENTS**

* Every character has 2 EX attacks
* When you get close to enemy archers, they will put away their bows and pull out swords
* Improved animations for enemy troops
* More realistic horse handling; your horse now leans into sharp turns
* Several new maps"

The article says that the radiation from Fukushima is said to be ""only a fraction of the fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s and 1960s."" Also on the good news side, I found out recently that Canada is one of a few countries that tests food for radiation. That offers some comfort.

The bad news is that we will be dealing with this topic for a long, long time. There was a recent controversy about an organic Italian jam containing high levels of radiation because it used blueberries grown somewhere near (but still quite far from) Chernobyl. See http://chernobylfoundation.org/chernobyl-today/organic-italian-jam-found-to-contain-radiation-from-decades-old-chernobyl-accident-what-is-fukushima-doing-to-our-food-supply/

What Dr. Suzuki says about fish from the Pacific Ocean:
http://ecowatch.com/2013/10/09/fukushima-radiation-safe-to-eat-fish/
""That doesn’t mean it’s unsafe to eat all fish caught on the Pacific West Coast. I’m taking a precautionary approach: fish will stay part of my diet, as long as they’re caught locally and sustainably, and will remain so until new research gives me pause to reconsider."""

We both talked about how we wanted to see where it could go, so I did press because sex is an important part of a relationship.

Slowly, it turned from ""Yea, I like this girl"" to ""Wow, this isn't fun."" So eventually it got to the point where I wanted *something* from the relationship, and sex came into play.  After that, I felt I had gotten something out of it, and walked away.  

I knew if I tried to talk to her about it, she would freak out, over react, and cry.  The speed at which she could turn a smile into tears was amazing.  It just wasn't worth it, so I just walked away.

Later, my bf's mom, the new mom's mom, told me that she and bf's dad discussed my behavior and they thought it was strange that I didn't break down since the baby wasn't breathing and the mom was freaking out.

Several interesting ideas were presented in the meeting about time-based stuff on dying, but the current plugin we're using does not support anything related to time, only distance from the bed. If there is another plugin out there which does what you're suggesting then that'd be awesome, or someone who could write a plugin for us. To my understanding though the only configuration options we have are how close you are to your bed when you die, and where you respawn at under those conditions."

I don't necessarily agree but the logic isn't unsound. Historically most power structures have eventually mutated such that the only goal was maintaining power for the ruling elite, whoever they might be. And why not? I think most people want to maintain whatever privilege they have, and increase it if they can.

Reddit seems to tend to be very anti-glass, and I'm sure my following opinion will be unpopular for more than one reason, but...

Their fears of the camera are mostly unfounded or irrational, as far as I see it. A lot of the things they claim that people will use the camera for that they don't like are true, sure, but they don't understand that it's an issue that will be considerably less impactful, especially in a negative sense, on their lives than they make it out to be.

I see it as analogous to someone saying, ""He needs to delete that candid photo of me! What if he goes home and masturbates to it???"" Yeah, well, what if? Why do you care? What impact does it have on you outside of your own personal mental hangup that is nobody's problem but yours?

The only reason why I ask this is because I can get buzzed off two strongly concentrated drinks, like the other day I had two AMF's and was pretty gone. This isnt me bragging, by the way. After a recent surgery my tolerance has gone to shit, so maybe before I could have say 5 shots and get tipsy, I could have two shots and get tipsy.

So thats why Im wondering like.....if instead of ordering a LIIT or AMF (only two strong cocktails I know that arent like rum and coke, gin and tonic, etc.) that costs maybe 15-20$ altogether, maybe I could save 5-10$ by ordering two rum and cokes.

But what I hear you saying is that as far as you're concerned, two rum and cokes would be ROUGHLY the same price of two other cocktails, if they have nearly identical liquor amounts?

We can cut a few dollars on the motherboard - an ASUS M5A97 LE R2.0 is $77, windows 7 Home Premium is $12 less, and maybe the SSD can be a future upgrade - and then just increase the budget a bit.

The most recent post from December was reblogged from someone who posted it 11 months ago, before her death. It was probably queued so far into the future because it's a Christmas scene. As for the other random posts, the ones in February were likely queued because she was supposed to be traveling and figured she wouldn't be posting as much. From what I checked, the other couple of posts were also reblogged from people who posted them before her death. As to why those were queued, I don't have an explanation, but they are photos of people/things she had on her blog before... like that blonde model, also named Elisa. Maybe she just didn't want to spam a bunch of pictures at once?"

&gt; In his tetralogy called Word Studies in the New Testament, the 19th century theologian Marvin Vincent wrote:

&gt;    Aion, transliterated aeon, is a period of longer or shorter duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. Aristotle (peri ouravou, i. 9,15) says: ""The period which includes the whole time of one's life is called the aeon of each one."" Hence it often means the life of a man, as in Homer, where one's life (aion) is said to leave him or to consume away (Iliad v. 685; Odyssey v. 160). It is not, however, limited to human life; it signifies any period in the course of events, as the period or age before Christ; the period of the millennium; the mythological period before the beginnings of history....

&gt;   The adjective aionios in like manner carries the idea of time. Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of endless or everlasting. They may acquire that sense by their connotation, as, on the other hand, aidios, which means everlasting, has its meaning limited to a given point of time in Jude 6. Aionios means enduring through or pertaining to a period of time. Both the noun and the adjective are applied to limited periods....

&gt;    Words which are habitually applied to things temporal or material cannot carry in themselves the sense of endlessness. Even when applied to God, we are not forced to render aionios everlasting. Of course the life of God is endless; but the question is whether, in describing God as aionios, it was intended to describe the duration of his being, or whether some different and larger idea was not contemplated."
canti28,changemyview,1388827043.0,"Exactly. The requirements for theft have been met, but the ""victim"" of the crime doesn't feel victimized so they have no inclination to press charges or seek retribution and no crime has been committed.

I've kept my heavy armor with me for a while, doing side quests and helping the denizens of Skyrim with their troubles, just in case, but I haven't had to use it. The closest I've gotten to taking out Wuuthrad was when I was sent some Jarl to take our a horde of Bandit Marauders and their leader. I'm currently in full Nightingale Armor, with Mehrune's Razor or the Nightingale Blade, and the Nightingale bow. (I really like the Nightingales). I also have Stoneflesh in my left hand.

What could I do better? This has made Skyrim loads more fun, since it's more sneaking and strategy than just busting in and whacking everything that moves. I've already ranked up 3 more ranks. I'm currently at level 39, I think. Should I try smithing my armor, or improving my weapons? This is my first ever Skyrim game, and although I have 100+ game play hours, I've never actually crafted, improved, used the Arcane Enchanter, or used Alchemy. Those perks I've hardly ever touched.

**EDIT:** Obviously, someone disagrees? Yes, there will be a small performance detriment that comes with PCIe 1.X as compared to PCIe 2.0 8x+ (after which point the gain isn't really measurable outside of margin of error), but that's mostly latency induced. And it's not a hard-bottleneck. So if you save a good bit of money going that route, you're still going to get more FPS/dollar spent if you dump that money on a better video card. It'll only really start being worth the extra PCIe bandwidth when you're running multiple GPUs. And even then you will be more than fine with PCIe 2.0 8x until you are running 3+ high end GPUs. And you could arguably still get more performance by putting more money on your video cards instead..."

We generally use UK as shorthand because it's much more consistent, and the majority of full fit brands are British.  44GG would be the sizem size, then.  I'm also assuming you reversed your leaning and laying measurements, as leaning is pretty much universally the largest.

It has been found that in &gt;36 bandsizes, an alternative method is better, as the traditional way tends to overestimate the cup.  We add inches to the underbust, calculate a volume, and sister size down to a reasonable band size.

So, 46+4=50, 55-50=DD  50DD-&gt;48E-&gt;44F-&gt;42FF-&gt;40G

Are your current bras quite old?  I'd think that being pretty stretched out account for a 40 band being too big.  It's very possible worthwhile to measure it stretched, and see what it's true length is.   

I'd start by trying 44F/FF and 42FF/G, and see how those feel and look.  It's not impossible that you'll like a 40 band, especially in some stretchier brands, but it is unlikely you'll want it in most bras.  "

lydocia,AskReddit,1388828257.0,"TL;DR Never had an STD, but have been kept in the dark for four weeks, not knowing if it was or not.

I don't know how long ago it was, but safe to say it was over five years ago. I had my first bladder infection combined with a yeast infection (to those who think ""eww"", it's fairly common and normal for women to get it) *and* I just had had rough sex so I had a couple of ""wounds"" down there. My gynaecologist was also out of town and I was hurting quite a lot, so I just called up a medical centre in the area and asked for the first available doctor to see me. This guy, despite being a regular practicing gynaecologist, had an additional master's diploma in STD research. He gave lectures and wrote books about STDs and it kind of felt like he was obsessed over them. Now, long story short, he said he couldn't be sure without a test *but* he was 99.9% sure I had contracted herpes, the bad kind. I felt really, really bad. I didn't know how this was possible, I was careful and trusted my partner(s). ""Call me again next week, on Thursday, and I will have the results in."" Okay.

Next week, I call him. No answer. I call again. Still no answer. I had called him for about 8 times when I finally got hold of his secretary. ""Sorry, he's is out of town for a lecture and won't be back for two weeks, and I can't give you your test results without his permission. I'll tell him to call you back."" He never called, so I started calling him again, never got hold of him. 

Meanwhile, my ""problem"" wasn't being treated, so I had gone to another doctor, to whom I explained the story as told above. He shook his head and said: ""It may not be my place to speak ill of my colleagues but, this particular doctor is a bit, well, *obsessed* with his STD studies and often jumps to conclusions. You're not the first patient to have gone through that."" He assured me it was nothing, just a litlle wound caused by being rough, just an infection that could easily be treated with antibiotics. Two days later, I was better. 

I did eventually get hold of that doctor, who said ""this was the first time he was mistaken, it wasn't herpes and I should make an appointment to pick up an antibiotics prescription"", which I politely declined.

pepernoten,AskWomenOver30,1388828473.0,"I think this can be a very subjective question based on a woman's personality. It reminds me of a friend of mine who is a serial dater, desperate to find ""the one"" and often uses internet dating. Her relationships usually last a weeks to a few months and after they inevitably broke up, she would rant about how awful they were and how much of a douchebag they were. However, as I tried to be supportive and figure out why he was such a douchebag, the main reason always seemed to be because he broke up with her because he just wasn't into her that much. I don't know about you, but in my opinion that doesn't make him a douchebag, just honest. However, in that moment she was hurt and rejected and probably complaining much as these woman you hear and read about.

From a personal point of view, you made me think about my own relationships and I only came up with one who I didn't feel treated me right. I was in a casual relationship where I wanted more but he didn't. When he admitted he was going on a business trip and would most likely sleep with a colleague while he was there I was pretty pissed off. But now that I think about it, he didn't have to tell me. He could have slept with her and I would be none the wiser. But, he was nice enough to give me the truth and let me decide whether or not I was ok with that. However, that understanding came later with age and experience. At the time I thought he was a selfish prick. Now, I realize he was being honest and had always been honest with me during that relationship.

Anyhow, long stories short, I personally think there are lots of men who treat women right out there, but sometimes in our hurt of being rejected, we like to blame them rather than accept equal responsibility in the failed relationship. Just my two cents."

Also, pay attention to your masturbation habits. Do you use some sort of lotion? Is it always in a particular position? Do you grip your dick really hard? Always use the same hand?

We train our dicks, through years of jerking off, to respond to a particular stimulus. When we have sex, suddenly things feel very different. Mouths and asses cannot clench around a dick the way a hand can, and I'm guessing that's the problem. Train your dick to respond to a lighter touch. And if you really want to get off when having sex, don't masturbate in the days leading up to it. It'll make it much easier.

The thing that likely puts China and India ahead of the curve is that industry began to be moved into both of those countries at an astounding rate beginning in the 70's. The jobs that previously sustained the middle classes in 1st world nations began to get moved to China and India. This creates the reality of people having high birth rates but the things that usually sustain high infant mortality rates that level out growth i.e poor nutrition, lack of medicine, lack of prenatal care, etc. began to disappear.

thought processes: how would these words or actions make *me* feel?  How do they probably make *them* feel?   I'm hypersensitive to this, possibly to a fault. I'm terrified my server will hear the last half of my sentence talking about some *other* restaurant that had shitty service if s/he walks nearby - so I might get all weird in the middle of a conversation about that if I think they're coming.  You don't need to be that vigilant/sensitive - but you get the idea.

Kindness isn't about getting something in return other than the warm fuzzy feeling that you made someone's day a little better.

Maybe you'll get something in return once in a while, but most of the time you won't - and continuing to do those things **anyway** is what makes you a kind person.

Rarely if ever do I see the favor returned, but that's not why I'm doing it.  I'm doing it because I've seen so, so, SO fucking many dark days in my life and I know just how much value the smile or polite word of a stranger has on those days.

On the off chance that any of the people I run into throughout the course of a day is in a fog like the one I spent so much of my life in, and my smile, extra ""thank you"", oversized tip or other random tiny act of kindness can give them one good thing to go home and reflect on, that makes me feel good.

My guess is that you were drunker than you're admitting.

Only works on chrome for the moment, but the extension integration and community is great, and I believe someone got live Firefox editing through that route. 

In terms of behavior, Brackets does a lot of things differently from Sublime. Hard to pin them down since their subtle, but I'll just say it's about as subjective as vim vs emacs. Generally, you get a lot of seemingly gimmicky features, but you find yourself using them quite a bit like the inline color picker with Ctrl+E.

Take, for example LotR. In a letter, Tolkien specifically stated that he included no allegory or symbolism in his work. That it is simply a story, and nothing more.

But according to one of my SO's old English lecturers, not so! Never mind what the author says about their own work, there's this that and the other allegory and symbolism in there. Fuck the fact that the creator of a work is by definition the authority on that work. This is why I studied Chemistry.

It's like Dumbledore being gay. J.K. Rowling says he is gay, therefore he is gay. Whether or not you agree is irrelevant.

In any creative work, the creator is the absolute authority on the meaning, content, or lack thereof of that piece of work. More often than not, the creator is silent on the matter, as the study and interpretation of artistic works provides insights into the nature of humanity."

- The common theme in the wrestling porn was the idea that both guys were not gay, got mad at each other for some reason, wrestled while yelling ""I'm not gay!"" One would force the other into submission, and he was the top for that session. (Aka, he got to fuck the loser in the ass). Is this a common turn-on among gay men? I thought the owner of the company was a weirdo, (which he was since he abhorred anal sex, and had one of the largest collections of WWF/E matches on VHS tape), but I've always wondered if this was a common thing.  
- Does getting fucked in the ass with a large (10-12 inch) dick make you light headed? We were shooting a scene where this small guy with an 11 inch dick was fucking this guy bareback on a sun chair next to a pool. The set photographer, who was gay, said that he'd been fucked by a dick that big and he got dizzy and lightheaded. The director called cut and the first thing the guy getting fucked said was ""man, I feel light headed"". I looked back at the photographer who gave me the ""told you so"" look. Is this a common thing?  
- Non-porn related, but I've always wanted to write a gay character that was akin to the most obnoxious straight man, but gay. He would fart all over the place, love football (for the sport and the guys), and degrade men. ""Hey there, sweet nuts"", ""why don't you shut that pretty little dick holster of yours and go build me some cabinets"". Are there any gay men who if you met them you would think they were totally straight?  
- **This question is for gays and lesbians.** (I had to bold that since this has been one-sided up until now). Straight people tend to be attracted to people who are similar to their opposite sex parent. Men with their moms, women with their dads, etc. If you're gay, are you attracted to men like your father? And if you're lesbian are you attracted to women like your mother?"

However stealing the sandwich is still an immoral act and the wife has every reason to be angry about it and she could certainly ask her husband not to do that in the future and/or to make her another sandwich as retribution. It's not on nearly the same magnitude as stealing money or committing rape. 

And no, physical force or duress is one way that lack of consent can occur, there are other ways in the law. Let's look at [New York's statutes for example.](http://www.slc.edu/offices-services/security/assault/Penal_Law.html)

&gt;Lack of consent results from:

&gt;(a) Forcible compulsion; or

&gt;**(b)Incapacity to consent**; or

&gt;(c) Where the offense charged is sexual abuse of forcible touching, any circumstances, in addition to forcible compulsion or incapacity to consent, in which the victim does not expressly or impliedly acquiesce in the actor’s conduct; or (Eff.11/1/03,Ch.264.L.2003)

&gt;(d) Where the offense charged is rape in the third degree as defined in subdivision three of section 130.25, or criminal sexual act in the third degree as defined in subdivision three of section 130.40, in addition to forcible compulsion, circumstances under which, at the time of the act of intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse, the victim clearly expressed that he or she did not consent to engage in such act, and a reasonable person in the actor’s situation would have understood such person’s words and acts as an expression of lack of consent to such act under all the circumstances. (Eff.11/1/03,Ch.264.L.2003)

Emphasis mine. According to the law, this is how a lack of consent is defined. Now, how is *rape* defined?

Rape in the third degree:

&gt;A person is guilty of rape in the third degree when:
&gt;&gt;He or she engages in sexual intercourse with another person without such person’s consent where such lack of consent is by reason of some factor other than incapacity to consent.
Rape in the third degree is a class E felony.

Rape in the second degree:

&gt;A person is guilty of rape in the second degree when:
&gt;&gt;he or she engages in sexual intercourse with another person who is incapable of consent by reason of being mentally disabled or mentally incapacitated.

Rape in the first degree:

&gt;A person is guilty of rape in the first degree when he or she engages in sexual intercourse with another person:
&gt;&gt;Who is incapable of consent by reason of being physically helpless; or

So no, rape is not just someone forcing someone down at gunpoint or etc.

mukhabar,Israel,1388830410.0,"There's nothing ""mere"" about that, and you can't boil down the works of dozens of influential Zionist political philosophers to one simple hasbara catchphrase like that. Their work and Israel's subsequently inspired actions have defined modern Zionism, not you.  
  
The idea of a Jewish state was seriously considered in Palestine, Argentina, and Uganda, among other places. In all three cases the Zionists who founded Israel and now hold exalted positions in their nation's history knew that the formation of a demographically Jewish nation-state would require the disenfranchisement and ""transfer"" of a native population that threatened that character. The ""Land of Israel"" you refer to already had people living in it, and Zionism had to realistically take that into account in order to maintain any relevance and make the project work. Zionism, which came long before Israel and is the reason for Israel's existence, most certainly frames the modern and historical Israeli response to it.  
  
Even today, the great social struggle of Israeli society is a rapidly-growing 20% of Israel's population that consists of Muslim &amp; Christian Arabs. If they are citizens of Israel, and Israel is a ""Jewish"" state, then what does that mean for them? What is so mere to them about living under the rule of a state where they are not considered a part of the population it represents, to say nothing of those who have to live under its military rule?"

That story is apocryphal, but not hard to believe. Earendil, the central figure of his First Age myths, was the name of the ""morning-angel"" (that is, the morning star, or Venus) in an old Anglo-Saxon poem of which Tolkien was fond.

smootie,GradSchool,1388830636.0,"1) I'm a little unclear about what you mean about her blowing you off.  You never said what happened after you reminded her that you had an appointment.  In any case, as a grad student, your profs are more like colleagues than authoritarian figures.  Even as an undergrad, my profs were pretty friendly and informal with me.  It's not out of line to go up to your advisor at an event and say, ""Hey there!  Are we still on for 2pm?  I just wanted to discuss my schedule with you.""  

2) She was in the wrong for not contacting the head grad advisor, but you should have also taken *some* responsibility for getting extra help because by that point you knew that you had issues to address.  Most, if not all, college campuses have mental health services that are free to all students.

So, a good friend of mine had a similar dilemma, but didn't have anyone to ask for advice so I talked to one of my profs who is graduate faculty and a mentor to me.  Here is what he had to say (paraphrased):

It doesn't happen often but people do change advisors due to personality clashes or when the student and advisor have incompatible communication styles, and it's ok.  Generally the advisor won't care because they don't get anything extra/special for having grad students under them.  And as long as there wasn't any misconduct involved, you won't be blackballed by other faculty for switching.  However, it is unprofessional to bad-mouth your previous advisor.

Just from what you've written in your post, other than the embarrassment of crying in front of your advisor (and most of us have done cringe-y things in front of profs), there aren't any reasons to switch.  Especially since you won't be interacting with her that much, and a master's is only a couple of years, it doesn't seem worth the effort to make waves.

FWIW, it's totally normal for profs to be scatter-brained.  They don't mind gentle reminders, and my scatter-brained profs actually *encourage* me to email them to remind them about things.

I'm starting a MLISc in a couple of weeks, and if your department is as small as mine, there may not be anyone else to switch *to*.  Our advisors are assigned to us according to our desired track of specialization, and we only have one guy who advises archival studies students.

All of this aside, if you don't feel that you will be able to handle interacting with your current advisor, by all means switch.  It's better to make some waves than to not get your degree at all."

The cheapest and easiest possible fix:

With Windows Vista, the max amount of RAM you can have is 4GB. It's possible, but unlikely that your motherboard supports both DDR2 and DDR3; if so, you might be able to do a quick and cheap fix by getting 4GB of DDR3 and replacing your RAM sticks. If it only supports DDR2, you can still get 4GB of DDR2 and you should still notice some improvement.

That said, your video card is also a bit outdated, but once you exit any game, it shouldn't have any effect on performance. Your hard drive could be getting old and on the verge of failing as well; be sure you have a backup of all important data.

If you are considering getting a new computer any time soon, that may be the better option considering most of your hardware is outdated. Check out /r/buildapc for tips. But if you just want a cheap and easy fix, upgrading your RAM might do the trick for now.  

EDIT: Speccy should tell you what kind of motherboard you have as well. From there you can figure out how much you can upgrade without a complete overhaul. Also, keep an eye on the task manager (specifically memory resources) when you exit your game, and see what processes are hogging memory. Chrome probably takes a good chunk of that 2GB you have, but there could be something else taking up space."

On the way to the movie, he told me that I had left him and to not speak to him again. The man I thought I was going to marry and spent years with literally had just left me over seeing a movie. 

Soon after the break up, I started to realize that telling me I couldn't hang out with my friends, who to talk to, where I can go, what I can do, and forcing me to take pictures of myself so he knew my location throughout the day were all abusive, controlling behavior. But it took me four years and him leaving me to wake up and realize I didn't deserve such a poor relationship. "

pepernoten,AskWomen,1388831072.0,"While I respect that you dislike texting and only want to use it for practical purposes, be aware for some, texting is part of the dating ritual. I don't consider myself a big texter but in my last relationship, my SO would text me at least a few times a day which I liked because it let me know he was thinking of me or he would tell me random things that made me smile and brighten my day. My current SO is like you, only texts for meeting up purposes, and at first it made me really insecure because I felt like it meant he wasn't really into me. Logic prevailed because he shows me in lots of other ways that he's into me, but when you are in the getting to know each other stage, for some, it's an important relationship cue.

If you really dislike it, I think you can just straight up tell her you don't like texting and explain it just like you said here, because you are in a band and have negative experiences. Just not texting back with no explanation will come across as distant and uninterested which may cause her to close off and cut her losses. As much as it pains me to admit for my sex, when we text a new guy we like we are anxiously waiting for a response, no matter how cool we try to appear. A lot of people here are suggesting calling, which may work, but if she's using text to have a conversation, a phone call to make meet up plans will not stop her from continuing that conversation via text anyway. Plus, some people (ie. me) loathe phone calls. I rarely ever pick up my phone when it rings because my friends know not to call so it's usually telemarketers. I also prefer text for meeting up plans so I can refer back to the message in case I am lost.

Anyhow, as with all reddit answers, honesty is key. No one will fault you for the reasons you stated here. Best of luck!

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1388831087.0,"After much thought....I think my answer is, yes, I do like not being expected to approach guys.  I wish I could say the opposite for the sake of my gender and equality and such.  But the truth - for my personal case, yeah, I do appreciate not having to make the first move!  A lot!  I was a late bloomer, I also had social anxiety issues and even when I did try to start up a conversation with someone....even for platonic reasons...I'd just blank out, then mocked.  Guys didn't really approach me either back then.  I then started actively working on my issues and kept pushing myself to approach people.

Okay, I'm starting to change my mind, OP.  I do wish we were expected to approach more.  I do wish we had more of a push to break out of our fear and do what we wish we could do.  I made myself give compliments to strangers (usually other women, because I felt that was less threatening) on the street every day.  Rejection sucks for sure, and I have made the ""first move"" with a guy before.  Got shot down so badly, and it was horrible.  But the next time I made a clear move on a guy, it wasn't as bad.  And things just get easier and easier, and that's important for women to learn as well, as early as they can.  Some people will try to avoid overcoming challenges like that, using social expectations as a crutch...which may stunt their grownth as a person, I think."
carmensiandiego,AskWomen,1388831096.0,"After working in ski shops for 4 years I've heard this a lot about circulation and skiing. Like a lot of other people have suggested already mittens will definitely keep your hands warmer but if you're skiing with kids then the restrictions on dexterity can be a bit frustrating, in which case I'd suggest a crab claw/three finger model. Wearing a good glove liner (merino wool preferably but silk is quite popular too) helps increase the warmth dramatically and having a few pairs of hand warmers in your pockets for lift lines is good too. Buy them before you get there though because they can sell out/be expensive at resorts. I'm a huge fan of Hestra, they've been making gloves since 1936 so they know what they're doing but the price point is a little higher, Swany's toaster mitt might be worth considering too if you can find it. Also if you snowboard rather than ski make sure that the gloves are designed for snowboarding, not just skiing, and that you'll be able to adjust your bindings without any issues. Finally, make sure they fit properly, too small and the heat can't circulate, too big and you'll have too much air to keep warm. "

There's nothing really *wrong* about being proud to be white, it's just... you know... weird. And people will definitely read racism into that. I think his point about not being a white supremacist is a good one. Maybe he's just annoyed about tumblr's hateboner for white people and is choosing to go about it in a ""white pride"" way the same way some people do ""black pride"".

Then again, I haven't read the rest of his blog, so maybe he is a white supremacist. This post seems relatively tame in itself."

pepernoten,AskWomen,1388832282.0,"The only cleanse I'm willing to do the is Wild Rose D-Tox. As a medical biologist and healthy-ish vegetarian, I don't believe in starving ourselves or that certain herbs or supplements will magically pull out toxins from our body.

However, the Wild Rose D-Tox is an all you can eat cleanse that simply limits WHAT you are allowed to eat. It is 12 days (specially formulated for only one weekend of limitation) and long enough to feel the benefits. The first days of sugar withdrawal are always tough, but by day 10 you feel fantastic. Energy goes up, digestive system regular, cravings disappear. In fact, a lot of people I know keep going after the 12 days and integrate some of the eating habits into their every day lives long term. It is also wise enough to know that people can't go without coffee so 2 cups a day are permitted (but no sugar or milk allowed).

There are herbal supplements that accompany the cleanse, but I currently live in a place where I can't get the kit so I just follow the diet part of it. Also, the herbal supplements contain natural laxatives which is not recommended for some people. Be sure to do your research thoroughly if it's suitable for you. But like I said, even without the supplements, the diet aspect is effective, doable and even exciting because it forces you to cook and be creative in the kitchen.

Some may say that it is indeed just an ""eating healthy"" diet but I like the fact that it is structured and laid out clearly what is and isn't allowed. Plus, there is an end in sight so that we are less likely to fall off the wagon in the first few days.

Highly highly recommend."

Omega037,changemyview,1388832335.0,"I think the reason people ask for mutual respect is that I can parrot everything you have said here about atheists too.  For example:

1. ""I don't think we should ""respect"" the beliefs of atheist nut jobs. In fact, I think we should ridicule and reject them until their change their beliefs.""

2. ""I would simply laugh it off if it weren't for the fact that 1.6% of the U.S. population holds these extreme beliefs.""

3. ""All that said, I've heard it said that we should ""respect"" the beliefs of atheists. And, to that I say: No! We absolutely should not!""

4. ""And holding rational, reasonable debates with atheists is pointless. No matter how credible and thoroughly researched your debate argument is, they simply point to the unfalsifiable and untestable argument of no god.""

5. ""So, bottom line: we should NOT humor or respect the beliefs of atheists who refuse to believe in a higher power like the rest of us. And, in fact, because those views are so demonstratively dangerous, we should shun and ridicule them as much as possible until such views are eradicated from or rejected by all of humanity.""

Because beating up women is bad, and generally audiences require some pretty significant story explanation for why its okay to beat up this particular woman.  That's why if there is a female villain, either some effort will be made to establish that she's especially crazy and vicious, or she will do a [high heel-face turn](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn) and join the hero's side.

The only time you can really get away with female mooks is if you've got a setting that allows for the existence of amazons or an amazon analogs.  And even then, 9 times out of 10, the amazons will be presented not as mooks, but as a [redshirt army](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy) whose deaths are meaningful and tragic.

Because, while we're probably thinking it, we may not say it aloud or in the way you expect. But, if we know that our partner has expectations, we will do our best to live up to them.

This is spot on right here.  Assuming this person isn't a complete dirt bag, as an ISTJ, we'll do just about everything we can to try and make the relationship work.  Just be clear as day about any problems you have, and how you think it should be worked out.

Clear and Concise Communication (as with any relationship) is ***key***."

Ig79,AskReddit,1388832910.0,"It was a solid month before the ear itself felt ""right"" again.  But it's still a little weird and I'm told ""what it is now, is what it's going to be"".  Did you get any implants?  My incus and malleus are now replaced by a titanium implant.  It works pretty well.  According the tests, my hearing in the affected ear has actually improved over some frequencies, but lessened for others.  Day-to-day, I have a hard time telling the difference in the before and after.  I'm overall pretty pleased.  Surgery was successful, and I haven't had an infection since (chronic infections were my symptom that led me to see an ENT).  

About the rest of the healing, yeah it takes a bit.  My incision was all along the back of my ear.  Earlobe all the way to the top of the ear.  Nearly a year out, I still get some minor pain there if I move my ear in the wrong direction.  Was told that was due to some of the nerves being damaged there.  It's lessening with time, both in frequency and severity.  Nerves take a long time to heal.  

My new eardrum was taken from that little flap on the front of the ear.  I was told it would hurt and would take a while to heal.  I didn't think he meant 3-4 months.  It was just a tiny little 2 stitch too.  

Anyway.  Hope I answered everything.  IF there's anything else, feel free to ask!"

**Identification**

**My Birth Certificate**

The Simpsons is a popular show that everyone can associate with on many levels or has at least heard of in 1994. If I bring back around 20/19 more seasons that no one knows exists, many with commentary referencing popular culture regularly, it serves as a history of the last 20 years through a medium people can believe and be proven by The Simpsons creators themselves by saying, ""yeah, we've never done those."" I would even be able to have the latest episodes for 1994, before they have aired showing I couldn't have made my own episode.

My birth certificate, 21st Feburary 1994. If we go back today, I am not born. Later in the year I am just born, but I've got my I.D. to highlight I am who I say I am.

All of my lecturers pretty much stressed that wordpress is the best blog for us Journalists. It's got a huge community and there's all sorts you can do to customize your blog and such.

With additional fees, wordpress can then host a site for you which you can completely format using HTML and CSS if you know how.

It's a great place to start and already has a pretty diverse writing community. I personally always stick to wordpress because knowledge of wordpress is great for any websites you write for, which a huge chunk are hosted by Wordpress.

Tumblr if for Image led blogs I feel.

Blogspot can be great but much more difficult to customize etc.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388833903.0,"&gt;I never thought of peeing in a shower as a habit thing. Do you think it can really be habit forming?

Of course.  Have you ever had to pee, gone to the bathroom and started upzipping your pants and then suddenly had to pee really, really bad?  You know what I'm talking about, right?  And like how when you *really* have to pee the last few seconds, right when you get to the bowl, those are the absolute worst?

That's a [Pavlovian response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlovian).  You've been trained to associate standing in front of a toilet with peeing, and so when you get to the toilet your body starts reacting and readying to pee.  It's unconscious.

If you raise a kid to pee in the shower, the kid will develop a Pavlovian response to showers, and his body will associate being in the shower with pee time."
peanutismint,Christianity,1388833909.0,"Well firstly, it's not going to keep me up at night if I don't 'convince' someone to believe what I believe. I'm sorry if my post gave you that impression. I'm no theologian; I've been a Christian since I was 12; I'm now 29 and still don't have all the answers. Maybe as a Christian I should be more evangelistic but tbh I only really discuss my faith with non-believers when they flat out ask me about it. I'm of the opinion that it's not our job to make anyone believe, not that we even could. I'm not even 100% sure what I believe, at least as far as the 'secondary issues' go (I don't think anybody ever is), but I trust in the person of Jesus Christ, that is to say I believe he existed and was God and agreed to pay my debt of sin because I asked him to. That's what I tell people. The 'last line of defence' is simply 'at the very least' as I stated in my first post, that if somebody asks me to give a reason for what I believe, that explanation is easy enough to understand by somebody who has absolutely no frame of reference for any sort of religious belief.

So many Christians seem so obsessed with *being* right, rather than *doing* right. If I don't know the answer to something, I always say so, rather than trying to 'win' an argument, which really means nothing to me at the end of the day. "

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388835071.0,"I don't think its fair to include Buddhism in this list, as Buddhism recognizes a division between the core tenets of Buddhism -- the 4 Noble Truths -- and the complex cosmological systems used by different schools of Buddhism.  This allows for the existence of an entirely secular, non-metaphysical interpretation of Buddhism which strips away the cosmological elements that is still a valid form of Buddhism.  For example, the Dalai Lama does not encourage Westerners to convert to Tibetan Buddhism and embrace the cosmology of Tibetan Buddhism, because Westerners will never understand that cosmology from a Tibetan perspective.  Instead, he encourages Westerners to incorporate the 4 Noble Truths into their secular lives.

The Four Noble Truths are not metaphysical statements, but rather logical propositions.  They require no belief in the fantastic to accept.  The Four Noble Truths, if you don't know, are:

*  Suffering exists.  
*  Suffering arises from attachment to desires.  
*  Suffering ceases when attachment to desire ceases.  
*  Freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the Eightfold Path.

The Eightfold Path is basically one of many possible ways of expressing the essential characteristics of a virtuous life.  One of the primary practices of the Eightfold Path is Right Mindfulness, or meditation.

Buddhist meditative practice has numerous proven benefits, including increased positive emotion and enhancement of parts of the brain dealing with attention to detail and focus.

Simply put, it's entirely rational to believe in Buddhism.  Buddhism totally works.  It says ""Do this and you will be happier and enjoy life more.""  And sure enough, it works.  "

blazingup,auckland,1388835281.0,"I do enjoy a bit of fashion and used to work a bit in retail so hopefully I can help!

AS Colour is definitely amazing, as you've been told. It's top notch for basics and really cheap, I don't go anywhere else for my tees. I dig the Staple and the Paper for basic crew necks. They also do a great Raglan tee. One thing I want to add is that things are cheaper when you buy them online off the website in 'bulk' - for example, the Paper Tee is $21/tee if you buy 0-3, $15.75 for 4-9, etc. So if you are planning to stock up a lot, you can save a bit of dough that way - just pop into Mt Eden or Britomart first to try them on.

Barkers is great. I agree, though, it gets a little pricey. But I used to work at Hallensteins and honestly, the quality at Barkers is much better. As is the cut of their garments. Check out the Outlet at Onehunga and also the 'Outlet' section online. Also, you can sign up as a Barkers VIP (online or at a bricks and mortar store) and get 10% off full-priced items. That's not a whole lot, but more importantly, Barkers has several (I would guess 3-4) massive ""VIP sales"" that last about 1-3 days where their whole selection sells at 30-40% discount. They are usually pretty good about it in that the sale is a few weeks into the season, rather than the end when you can't wear it anymore. That's when you should swoop in and make your purchases (they usually start a day earlier online).

ASOS is always an option, since they have free worldwide delivery. The quality of the in-house brand leaves something to be desired but it's pretty cheap. You can also buy other brands from ASOS, too. Another online option (tending towards a younger demographic, however) is The Iconic, an Australian online retailer, which ships to NZ for free (orders $50+).

Pants you can definitely go all around for. Bear in mind that clothes (all clothes, not just pants) are priced ridiculously high compared to what people might be used to in, say, the USA (if you're American or familiar with US prices, try and find the prices of the same pair of Levis here in NZ for example and you'll see the way some things get inflated). 

There are a few other cool places to shop but based on your taste depictions I won't go into them too much. Country Road and Witchery Man have some nice pieces but are probably Barkers pricing or even more expensive. There are some interesting streetwear shops like I Love Ugly, Federation, Huffer, Suprette if you're into that. Some of it can be a little too trendy but you can check out a place like Area 51 store (just off Queen St) which is a little more conservative streetwear-wise, but again, pretty expensive. There is a cool little shoe store called Pat Menzies shoes that is inside a little alley thing beside Hallensteins Queen St - they have a pretty great shoe selection, especially for sneakers."

Years ago, when I was around 19/20, my life consisted of going to work, then coming home, having friends round and smoking weed and chilling.

every night without fail, we would put on a background movie on the xbox (xbox had just come out). 

Invariably that movie was Adam Sandler's masterpiece 'Happy Gilmore'. It became something of a tradition. It got to the point that the dvd would just stay in the xbox, and whenever we sat down we would just press play.

I estimate that I have seen that movie around 8-900 times over a period of 2 years (sometimes it would be played 2-3x a night)

It's still a masterpiece. "".....pieces of shit like you for breakfast!"" comedy gold.

percival__winbourne,confession,1388835305.0,"Fuck it, OP - if you can do it without emotional attachment, go for it. I did what you're considering, and the only regret I have is I didn't know he was dating someone else at the time, if I'd known, I'd have gone with a different person. Didn't like him very much, but was attracted enough to enjoy the experience and it was enough to help me start to figure out what I wanted, what I expected, and what I was willing to give. That being said, once you lose it you're probably going to want to have a supply on tap, so to speak. Sex *is* fun, and having it just once is like saying, ""oh, I'll just have one donut...""

If you need an emotional attachment, get out there and start dating like it's your fucking job, it'll help you to figure out what you will and will not accept in a partner, and get you comfortable with the experience of being on a first or whatever number date. Don't jump into bed until you find someone you're comfortable and mentally compatible with. Find someone you're compatible with and go for it. There's plenty of fucked up people in decent relationships, as long as you're conscientious enough to be aware of your weak areas and honest with at least yourself about acknowledging and working on them, you'll be fine. How many other eighteen year olds are fully-rounded and self-aware? Fuck all, if I remember eighteen correctly.  *Don't* expect your first relationship to be the be-all end-all - works out that way for some, but most of us have a few trial runs before we figure out the nitty gritty.

If you're not looking for long term, who gives a shit if you're all brushed up on who or what you are. Having a one-nighter doesn't require being a zen master, you just have to be willing and able. If losing your virginity will help you figure those things out, then fucking go for it.

EG look good, but I feel that their strength is as a mid-to-late team, their solo laners are great but Snoopeh is a volatile jungler from what I've seen. He's the player to watch for sure, since he was responsible for EG's big wins and big losses in Season 3 as a shotcaller."

Why? Because they are used on a different model of that machine. It's cheaper for the manufacturer to make identical keyboards for all models and then simply not use some of the buttons, than it would be to make a custom keyboard for each model.

I believe that this could be the case with this Phone button too. Another model probably has a built-in phone."

&gt; Angesichts der Breitenwirkung und dem Potential zu diskriminierenden Maßnahmen durch die Ausweisung eines Gefahrengebietes wird man vom Gesetzgeber mehr Mühe bei der Normierung solcher Befugnisse verlangen müssen. In New York hat ein Gericht die derzeitige „stop-and-frisk“ Praxis der dortigen Polizei übrigens gerade für verfassungswidrig erklärt, weil sie diskriminierend angewendet wird.

TheJumboShrimp,infj,1388835915.0,"I've only ever dated INTJs and I love it. There are so many benefits. I'm a listener, so having someone who is constantly thinking deeply about new things and sharing them with me is a big bonus. INTJs always have interesting things to say, which is very important in a friend or an SO with a listener INFJ. And when we do talk about his ideas, I take the role of a sounding board. I listen, poke at things that seem wrong for him to think about more until he's satisfied, then we do the process again. I know he enjoys it, so I feel good about it. It's never an argument, just a discussion where I play devil's advocate. However, not just any INTJ will do. I need a mature, self-aware INTJ who knows how to keep a reign on his emotions and not get into an argument over these things. Also, I like to make jokes to keep the conversation light (sense of humor still pending), so he needs to be able to laugh at himself.

I'm not there just for the Te, though. I love when he trusts me enough to let me past his Te exterior and see his sweet and wonderful Ni. It's a beautiful moment when we're lying down together, cuddling, and he tells me his deep feelings about his awe for the world and the things in it.

And last but not least, introverted! That's a requirement for me. I need to have someone who can relax with me quietly, or enjoys short nights out (I hate going out for longer than an hour or two). Also, they have to value their time apart from me, so I can be alone and play video games or w/e without feeling guilty.

So, I actually love INTJs! As long we we're patient with each other (I'm certain my Fe gets on his nerves more often than he admits), INFJs and INTJs are perfect matches and easily provide for our emotional needs, whether friend or SO."

MoustacheSanctuary,TwoXChromosomes,1388836892.0,"it always seems like the ""friend zone"" is something feminists spend a lot more time making fun of than men actually spend on complaining about.

regardless, why should only one party (the woman according to articles like this) be allowed to dictate the relationship and the other person just has to accept the terms unilaterally. Women get friend zoned too, but you'll usually see guys complaining about it because they're the ones that are expected to put themselves out there and make the first move. 

sure there are guys out there that expect women to sleep with them every time they do something nice, but there are also women out there that will keep guys who have a crush on them  around for their own gain (and vice versa). It's a two way street."

PatHeist,pcmasterrace,1388837047.0,"Depending on your local laws, your landlord could be financially responsible to provide a working telephone jack and potentially an ethernet port for you. And if you are renting a room, they may be responsible to do so to your room specifically. Also, depending on your local laws, installing any sort of wall jack that you are legally allowed to yourself could fall under the same categories as hanging pictures on the wall. In many cases you would be legally allowed to do so without having to be responsible for removal regardless of what your contract says. 

You're renting a place, but it's your home, and you're allowed to live in it. Most reasonable places will have laws to protect you living in it accordingly.

ruta_skadi,AskWomen,1388837424.0,"I think that both of those ideas are drawing the wrong conclusions from situations.

**Misunderstandings of the ""Nice Guy"" Scenario:** 

* It's not that being nice makes a girl not like you, it's that being nice isn't *enough* on its own. My criteria for a man is a little more involved than ""not an asshole"". 

* For those dudes that try to get girls to date or sleep with them by doing ""nice"" things for them, well, they aren't genuinely nice because they're doing those things to get something out of it. Women aren't just sex machines that work if you put in enough niceness coins. 

* Guys who think they are being nice but actually have some weird views of women and put them on pedestals aren't someone I'd want to date because it's weird, uncomfortable, and not a good relationship dynamic. 

* Guys who may very well be nice but who are too timid and awkward to talk to girls are unsurprising not going to do well with dating, but it's not because of being nice. 

* Guys who come on way too strong or are way over the top may think they're being nice or romantic but it's actually super uncomfortable. Think of Ted telling Robin he loves her on the first date. Similarly, clinginess does not equal niceness.

**Misunderstandings of the ""Girls like Assholes"" Scenario:**

* Someone might like a guy who is a bit of an asshole but it's not *because* he's an asshole. They like him for his other characteristics *in spite* of the fact that he's an asshole. 

* It seems like bitter ""nice guys"" often deem other guys assholes just because they are with the girls they want. Like the thought process is, *Ugh, she's with him instead of me! He's such an asshole for having the girl I like!* 

* Not everyone has the same threshold for what an asshole is. Maybe you find him abrasive and rude but she loves his blunt sense of humor. 

* Maybe he's nice to her but not to others so she isn't aware of what an asshole he is. Or, he wasn't an asshole initially and by now she's already attached to him. "

Equally, if they are renting to multiple residents separately, they will in all likelihood be responsible for providing each individual resident with that and their own phone jack.

If you want, you can tell me the general jurisdiction that applies where you live and I can find/link you the applicable laws. Because, well, it sounds like you are grossly misinformed about your rights as a tenant. "

Generally speaking I do things for friends because I like them and I want them to be happy but there have been some instances where I've felt I've wanted something back and, although I'm not sure yet, it might be that it's less getting something back but more that I feel they don't care enough, are too selfish, to want to make me happy too. Might be. Going to have to explore that."

Then he had an asshole boss and they both decided they had a fuckton of money and it wasn't worth it for him to work just to work, especially because the net profit of his salary was eaten by taxes and the extra car he needed to drive. 

So she works as much as she wants, and he keeps the house clean, pays the bills, takes care of their pets, cooks delicious italian food and he goes to the gym whenever he feels like it. Then they have awesome vacations.

Just look at how quickly UT3 and Halo 4 both died off (I know the retrospective communities both found them disappointing but they're not BAD games at all) and compare that to the massively increasing populations of the most popular FPS games.

I pooped myself when I was in the 2nd grade and tried to play it off like the girl next to me just farted.  I used to be *terrified* of pooping in public bathrooms, and when I was in 2nd grade, they would only let us go to the bathroom in groups.  I really, **really** had to poop, and the teacher wouldn't let me go until the next break.  I tried to hold it until everyone was out of the bathroom and failed.  

Shamefully, I went and sat down in my desk, and the giant mess of turds were just squashed all over my little 2nd grade ass.  The sad part?  I sat there for well over an hour before my teacher noticed and sent me to the principal's office to call my mother.  Then, I sat in shame in the principal's office until my mother came with a fresh pair of clothes.
