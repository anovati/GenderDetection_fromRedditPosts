yogimonster,exmormon,1389771729.0,"Ok I came home after being in the field for 4 months.  The shame of coming home early is almost unbearable at first.  He's gonna be depressed for a while.  He isn't going to be the same for a while.  For me I was a mess for about a month.  Imagine everything you thought your life was going to be shattered into a giant pile of shit in one moment.  That's what coming home from a mission early is like.  The cookie cutter life is gone so he is stuck until he figures something out.  For me I started to be my old self again when I got a job and started going to school.  I started drinking, at first I was drinking WAY to much so make sure he doesn't do that.  You just gotta let him figure shit out on his own and be supportive no matter what direction he chooses to go in.

Also when his ""friends"" start coming home from their missions he's probably going to get all depressed again.  One of my best friends from growing up got home from his mission and I was excited to see him.  The first thing he did when I saw him was ask me when I was gonna go back out.  I had to deal with this from several friends for a few years.  People still ask me if I'm going to go back out.  I don't know where I'm going with this but it's not easy to be in his shoes.  He'll bounce back though. "

Authiel,AskReddit,1389771773.0,"I'm friends with someone who is a main personality on a fairly popular ""educational"" reality television show.

I know a lot of spoilers and how much of the show is fake. (What a shocker: A lot, though the dialogue is largely improv.) He's a cool guy. I got some weird, rage-fueled messages from a fangirl when I answered a question she publicly asked on his Facebook. I guess she wanted attention and that I made her look like an idiot or something, because she started calling me a cunt and asking who I thought I was. I told him later, afraid I had insulted an IRL friend, and he said he had no idea who she was. Looks like she got unfriended.

Someone else I'm friends with was a one-time guest on said show. I was over her house for a photoshoot and the photoshoot was published in a fashion book. It was a neat time."

Women and men come in all shapes and sizes. As do transitioned people, as someone who delayed for a long while due to lack of confidence in my ability to ever ""pass"", almost 8 years after going FT I have only once had someone obviously guess my birth sex and she was super cool and complimentary about it ( I was in company at a bar, so I was obviously not at all happy she felt the need to say anything)

ThePinkPanther2,relationship_advice,1389772176.0,"Break up. Because you stopped putting effort into the relationship, you find it a chore, and you don't fully appreciate her and the relationship. 

No point in prolonging something that's annoying, a hassle, and stressful. Don't be the guy who makes her feel worthless and ""not enough"" because you can't find the courage to break up before it gets to that low point.  There does not need to be a horrible reason to break up - settling, a loss of attraction, or wanting variety is enough of a reason. 

When she's gone then you'll either understand what she brought to your life or you'll breathe a sigh of relief. You can see what else is out there, maybe someone more interesting or more compatible. She can find someone who finds her special, more compatible, and worth the effort. 

If you want to see it through then you're going to have to find common interests, get to know her hobbies, go on Askreddit and find questions that will spark long intimate conversations. The next time you visit, don't stay at home and do the usual. You don't want to do the usual which means that you'll have to take charge and change the situation. Tell her that you want to do x,y,z and make plans to do so. Look in the newspaper for local festivals, go paddle boating at the park, go dog walking around the neighborhood, go to the metro-zoo, or the beach. Plan romantic dates where you can actually interact outside the bedroom. 

Stop telling yourself that ""she would give anything for this relationship"" because she would probably do her best in any relationship if she cares enough to put in effort. She'll do fine after a break up - it just takes time. 

Anyways, once the initial puppy love fades then it takes a shit load of work to make a relationship last especially when it's long distance. A few texts and ""occassional"" conversations won't be enough unless they're full of quality conversation where you ask each other questions to find out about intimate details, life goals, ethics, anecdotal stories, ect. Good luck with which ever choice you decide.

I_am_the_night,news,1389772198.0,"I completely agree that the issue of mass shootings has been completely sensationalized and exploited by (usually) people on the left-wing to push for gun control laws.  I don't think that mass shootings justify taking away guns or aboloshing the second amendment, or even passing extremely restrictive gun laws.

However, this article talks about mass shootings almost exclusively.  Most gun-related deaths aren't the result of mass shootings, but rather single homicides (or suicides or accidents).  I don't think we should discount the potential of every kind of gun legislation (like background checks for gun buyers) just because mass shootings aren't going up, or mass shootings aren't likely to be as effective.  

I would also point out that the article mentions that many perpetrators of mass shootings have no mental health or criminal record, but many people who commit firearm homicides do have criminal or mental health records.  Also, that there is a significant problem with our mental health system in the U.S."

I think that works better in China/Taiwan and maybe Japan than it does Korea, but that would be based on anecdotal evidence and personal observation, so I won't go further on that.

&gt; Asian's aren't anymore hypergamous or materialistic then western white / black girls are. All women everyone are the exact same in those regards. Asian's are just more honest about it.

I wasn't trying to make them as a race seem more hypergamous ""by nature"". I agree that it's something shared by all. I wanted to point that out because there's so much Western women bashing around here that I think a lot of people end up forgetting that. 

Frankly, I don't even care that much about hypergamy. It makes socioeconomic sense when men generally experience more occupational social mobility. Overall balance in social mobility between the sexes is achieved through marital social mobility from women. [Source](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/cdewp/81-5.pdf)

PixelOrange,AskReddit,1389773034.0,"**First thing**

There was a video of a bunch of asian kids, I think they were Chinese, pouring gasoline on a small dog. They set him on fire and then followed him and ***laughed*** while the dog yipped and howled and slowly burnt to death. It was the most devestating thing I have ever seen. It was on YouTube.

I actually mentioned this a little while ago on reddit and someone else said they had seen it too. Nothing has ever made me want to kill someone more than that video.

**Second thing**

A picture on steakandcheese or whatever the site was called that was of a girl that was dead with a broom up her vagina. It was clearly faked but the body, the blood, the giant dildo sword that looked like the candle from *Clue*. I'll never forget it. I used to torment my best friend with that picture on a yearly basis. One year I couldn't find it. I was super sad.

This was before I was old enough to have my own computer so I didn't dare save it on the family computer. I didn't want it ever found by a family member.

**Third thing**

I saw a picture of a guy holding a child in his arms as he tried to drop into a bowl on a skateboard. He fell on his back and the kid's head cracked on the ground. The kid started screaming immediately, obviously. As a father of two children, that kind of stupid shit that endangers a child's life because you didn't have the foresight to think, ""This kid isn't wearing a helmet, this is really fucking stupid"" just drives me insane.

I mean, I've done stupid shit as a kid. I have a bad knee from being a dumbass when I was 14. I have scars all over my left arm from falling while skating over gravel while being pulled by a bike. But this is shit I did to myself. I wasn't 6 years old and in the arms of my father.

Greggor88,atheism,1389773143.0,"Looks like this went *far* over your head. Did you even try to interpret the cartoon?

The man on the left is depicted as angry and loud. He has a lot to say and he's not afraid to say it. The man on the right is depicted as quiet and patient. He's listening to what the other man has to say rather than yelling back.

Now look in their heads. The man on the right has a bookshelf stacked to the brim with books, symbolizing knowledge. The man on the left has nothing in his head but an empty bookshelf, symbolizing ignorance. Yet the one with little knowledge is preaching loudly while the one with knowledge is listening.

This is a graphic representation of the famous Charles Darwin quote: 

&gt;""Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.""

You understand now? The insinuation is not that atheists are intellectually superior to theists but that those who open their minds to learn are also quite frequently those who are the least outspoken with their beliefs.

letsgetcyclic,ffxiv,1389773148.0,"Gonna piggy back off you since you hit alot of good points. This is for when nobody marks targets/dps picks a target.

* When tanks que into Sasatasha or Copperbell Mines etc, and he tries to AOE tank, be patient. Focus down the primary target, and if he loses aggro on a mob, run it directly at him so he can regain aggro. I say this bc as a low lvl tank, most of the major eminity generating abilities like, Halone, Shield Oath, Provoke, etc... They get in the later lvls so it is generally harder to keep aggro on a group of trash that everyone has their own individual target of.

* I understand that they have access to flash, but it isn't the be all end all, AOE eminity generating tool. Give them some breathing room, allow them to spread hate on multiple targets before you go crazy. 

* Also pls for the love of all thats holy, unless its a Morbal Seed or something like that, let the tank initiate the pull. I say this bc there are some people who either get impatient/trolls who initiate a pull while the tank isn't ready. Unless it's a mistake, I generally give out a warning like, ""If you pull another mob again (whatever their name is) I'm gonna let you tank them.""

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389773689.0,"No, YOU don't get it. If they can afford to get away with it, they will.

If they can pay someone $14 an hour instead of $15, why wouldn't they do it in the first place? They dont give you that extra dollar to be generous, they give it because they have to. 

For as enlightened as you think you are you clearly don't even seem to understand the main goal of economics: maximizing profits.

Wages are decided when businesses and workers negotiate and agree upon a set price for the labor. Businesses try to give you as little as possible, workers try to get as much as possible. Since businesses generally have a better bargaining position, they win out, hence why government is needed. 

The idea of a business person paying $15 an hour instead of $14 when they can get away with it is irrational. You're the one who doesn;'t understand economics. 

What is essentially happening is they're using the extra vacation time to rationalize giving you a pay cut. That's how they justify it. If they just did it, it would look bad, so they instead wait until they can afford to give less.

And that's why the economy isnt recovering. Technically, it HAS recovered...corporations are profiting more than ever, stocks are soaring, but hey, because they laid a bunch of people off, they're more efficient than ever, dont need to create new jobs, and can basically exploit the crap out of the market.

And odds are that if you go from one circuit to another on the same box you're hitting at most 15A, while that connection from the main to the secondary box can be 60A, 100A, whatever.

For the first five years of drinking any kind of alcohol, I absolutely refused to drive. There was never a question of ""Am I sober enough to drive?"" it was always ""Have I had a single drink in the last few hours?""

If I had one beer, I'd wait at *minimum* two hours before driving. Not because I thought I'd end up crashing right away, but because if I hold tight to my refusal from only one beer, there's no way I'm even considering it at five or ten.

I've relaxed those rules slightly after ten years of driving and seven or eight of drinking. One beer really doesn't effect me that much, and I'll let myself drive after it. Two beers and I still maintain a proper time period before I'm able. More than two and I make other plans and just don't drive that night.

If the camera actually exposes as you set it and the photo histogram shows you're not clipping the whites i imagine it's more probable that your video files are decoded wrong (for whatever reason)."

superior22,summonerschool,1389774427.0,"I like that Riot tries to make 2v1 lane swaps more punishable because, let's be honest, it's boring as fuck. It's boring to insta-push top, it's boring to defend 1v2 bot, the jungler has to babysit top/bot after clearing his buffs, it's boring for viewers in tournaments. It's just boring for everyone included. When the strategy first came up it was a nice niche strategy, but now we see it in 50% (or even more) of competitive play. Something had to be done about it.

What most people seem to not realize, the attack reduction only applies for the first 8 min. of the game. After that it wears off. Early game, unless you play an ADC, chances are high the minions will do more damage to the tower than you anyway. The attack damage reduction only applies to champion basic attacks. The tower is as vulnerable as before to minion attacks. The ""only"" one who's screwed is the ADC who went top lane. 

While I don't know if this is the right way to go about it, something had to be done. 2v1 lane swaps, while a viable strategy, are boring as fuck to play and to watch. Not that I want to ban lane swaps completely, it should remain as a strategy in certain comps, but less common would be nice."

pizzaandburritos,AskMen,1389774477.0,"I would tackle the cleanliness issue first because that is directly affecting your welfare. The hygiene issue is more about helping him but he is not in the right mental state to be helped if he is this deep in lala land. When bad habits blind someone that strongly from the reality of how bad they have let things get, it's a psychological issue. Now, I'm not saying your roommate has a mental problem. I'm saying he has sunk into deep denial over time about his cleanliness and his hygiene to the point where nothing will make him change except a rude awakening. 

People in denial don't respond to anything less than a slap in the face. Think about it: the language that his brain is using to convince him that this is ok is not the language of reason. You cannot reason with him. He has lost all willpower on the issue, if he ever had any, so you won't do any good to try to motivate him or gently ask. The only choice you are left with is to scare him. Slap him in the face with reality. Force him to change. He will probably get really pissed at you at first. You may lose your friendship. But I imagine that he will eventually come to thank you. 

Some time when he is in his room, knock and go in. (He may not want you to but go in anyway.) Point to each dish, each piece of filth, point everything out to him and ask him what the f*ck he is thinking. In what world is this acceptable? You are stinking up the whole house. Etc Etc. Really dig it in, yell at him like you're a drill sergeant, don't be afraid to make him cry. 

I know this sounds mean and I am normally an empathetic person but you can't deal with people in denial any other way. Denial is this endless cycle of shame. Somewhere in his head he knows everything you're saying is true and he has spent all this time burying that because he is ashamed of it. Well, now you have to dig it up and when you dig up the truth let him also taste the shame, make him really face it head-on. It's the only way to get past it.

Another method would be to take pictures of his room and make a binder of all the filth he lives in. Sit him down and make him look at each picture and look at the mess he has learned to ignore every day. 

Another approach would be to blackmail him with the pictures. Tell him that if in a week he hasn't cleaned his room, you will send those pictures to ____. Fill in the blank with someone you think would be appropriate: someone whose opinion of your roommate matters to him. Honestly, if you wish to take it to this level, if you send photos to your landlord it could be grounds for his eviction. I would research the issue carefully before threatening that, but it may be a last ditch option. 

This is a case where you have to break him down before you can build him up. You really need to tell him, in a direct and not nice way, that he is totally out of his mind and he needs to get with the program. Once you have shaken him up a bit, show him your room (hopefully somewhat clean) and say, wouldn't  it be nice to live like this, to not have to tiptoe around piles of filth? To be able to find stuff, to not smell, to not have everyone look down on you?  Even if he has seen your room many times before, the thing is that he's been tuning out the reality of how other people live. Rein him back in. Get him to articulate to you that he actually wants to change, and then hold him accountable to it. "

And yeah, neither of us have specific numbers, but I think you are underestimating the effect temperature has on the card life time. We're potentially talking about years of difference here.

As for the fans, consumer grade fans are my interest and passion. - They're what I want to do with my life. AMD reference blower style coolers are made by Foxconn and use a brushless DC motor with a dual ball bearing by Siemens to alleviate angular strain from the force produced by the centrifugal impeller design. This type of ball bearing is extremely good at high speed operation and retaining stable rotation at high speed, even when subjected to non-axle-parallel forces. The potential deformative force of the bearing motion against the housing increases with speed, yes, but not as much as it does with temperature. More importantly, though, the bearings used are **not** lubricated with high temp grease. Since they're not designed to be used in high temperature environments. Heat (even what is produced from the proximity to a hot GPU) and living near the ocean are the main two things that are going to cause fan degradation by breaking down the bearing lubrication in this particular blower. In case you're curious, living near the ocean presents a higher mineral content in the air, which speeds lubrication degradation, and seeds the mechanical degradation process by causing surface deformation (leading to a recognizable 'clicking' noise). 4000+ RPM might be a lot for a single bearing fan or a sleeve bearing, but here it really is the temperature you should be worried about.

If you feel like you know something I missed, do tell me."

Rx16,LibertarianDebates,1389775000.0,"OP did a pretty good job of summing up Hong Kong, but there are some important things he missed, my apologies as these might be a bit scattered.

It should be noted, while the tax laws are short (200 pages after 60 years), Hong-Kong does have a nationalized healthcare system.

&gt; Hong Kong has a system of government-operated hospitals, which constitutes the majority of the health care system. People also have the option of a private hospital if they wish. There are more than fifty public hospitals, and twelve private ones.

...

&gt;This system of government-operated hospitals, open to all citizens, costs the Hong Kong government about 3% of GDP. Private hospitals, used mainly by the wealthy, and all other health care services bring Hong Kong's total health care spending to about 6% of GDP. Compare that to about 16% in the U.S. today, and rising.

...

The health and life of Hong-Kong has a number of problems going for it, while it is a 90% service based economy, lack of regulation has left it addicted to coal. It has a serious case of [air pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution_in_Hong_Kong). 

&gt;Even as early as 2000, the total negative impact to the Hong Kong Economy, including cardiorespiratory disease was in excess of HK$11.1 billion.[7] Research by three universities and a think-tank estimates that the pollution is costing Hong Kong about HK$21.2 billion a year in hospital admissions and lost productivity. In addition, about 1,600 deaths a year might be avoided if air quality improves.

...

&gt;The pollution comes largely from coal-fired power stations and traffic, although a significant contribution comes from the tens of thousands of factories in China's neighboring manufacturing heartland in the Pearl River Delta. 

Despite that though, they remain some of the longest living people in the world. 

Hong-Kong privatized their rail in early y2k, but has imposed some steep laws, such as a HK$5000 fine for eating, drinking, or smoking, in the paid areas of the station, or in the train.

Additionally, the while the bottom 60% of earners pay no taxes at all, the top 13% of payers pay 57% of the nation's taxes as opposed to the US where the top 10% of taxpayers payed 70.47% of taxes and the bottom 50% payed 2.25% in 2009. 

This means that the tax burden in Hong Kong resides largely in the upper-middle class and the upper class, while putting no income tax pressure on the lower class."

So yes, depending on the subject an atheist won't act according to the moral rules of a Christian, because it would be immoral from an atheist point of view.

In another post you mentioned:
&gt; He says that he can't see how atheists care about the world and that he says that Christians care about the world because they know that there is an afterlife and they want to please god.

Now atheism itself doesn't say anything about the style of life of a person. There are no rules bound to that label. But there are a lot of humanistic atheists who care about people and humanity on this planet. From my point of view it's actually much more important to think about future generations and the place where they will live. I won't do things because a god may think it's cool, I do things because I think it will help me, my children or my grand children. Often those actions also help others people children, too."

I have a 4 year old son. He plays hockey, t-ball, and golfs. Saturday I was at the rink at 10am for hockey practice. An hour later he had a 30 minute skating class. Then we had a 15 minute break and he skated during open ice for 2 hours. He is far from a couch potato. At Disneyland 2 months ago he was dead ass tired by 11am because we let him walk every where and only put him in the stroller when he asked. He was done by 6pm. The next week we went back and put him in the stroller every time we moved between an attraction. He was up until midnight.

Commod0re,WorldofTanks,1389775858.0,"Among other things:

 - Early steam powered tanks would be very difficult to drive in a straight line
 - Some tanks would have only one turning radius, period (M4 Sherman, for example)
 - Some tanks would have only one turning radius per gear
 - Some tanks steer via two gearboxes (the outside track is shifted to the next speed gear) so that would likely require a totally different method of steering for tanks that use this method
 - Transmission reliabillity was a major issue for some tanks, so some tanks would randomly just not be able to move at random points during the match. How fun would that be!
 - You would not have reliable vision for aiming based on what your teammates can see, but only what your tank crew (commander) can actually see
 - artillery would come with support trucks for supplemental ammo, and have a good deal higher firing rate, but would not be able to actually see where any enemy tanks are, only the map grid they reside in based on the latest radio contact from teammates
 - adhering to the team's tactics would be even more important
 - teams would be less diverse, as you would never see a german tank on the same side as a Russian tank. Depending on exactly how strict this would be adhered to, german and japanese tanks would either only ever be on the same team or on their own individual teams, russian and chinese tanks would only be together, and us, british, and french tanks would make up a team.
 - most of us would not play the game as it would be far more frustrating than fun for all but the most hardcore sim fans."

silverionmox,changemyview,1389776150.0,"&gt;The Celtic Tiger was not because of the Euro. The Euro was only introduced in the early 2000s when most of that growth had already occurred. Not to mention the housing bubble occurring at that same time, giving false growth. 

Ireland was in Bretton Woods, thereafter maintained parity with the pound, and thereafter joined the EMS and eventually the Euro. If you take Ireland as a positive example, then you should admit that joining the biggest currency union available has worked well for them.

&gt;Curiously if the Bretton Woods system did act as a unified currency that stability is an argument against it. It maintained the inequality between states.

I did say that the growth didn't look impressive on the graph, but the growth rates were actually higher back then. In any case, Europe was rebuilt after WW2 during Bretton Woods - it was the golden sixties! You can hardly argue that it prevented economic success or social promotion..

&gt;Its fine to have trading regulations and certain standards at an EU level. This is good for business. But I fail to see an argument for an EU wide justice system or an EU wide agricultural policy.

That's mostly your problem, since you'll only accept ""it's good for business"" as an argument. But in any case: EU justice backs up the reliability of your legal arrangements in the international market. EU agricultural policy is a military project, ensuring food security, as a reaction to the shortages during WW2.

&gt;I vote for parliament, a party gets in, the head of government is made of that party. I vote for the European parliament, a few representatives get in, no one has a majority, and since there is no majority there is little accountability.

There is more accountability, because there is an alternative. In a two-party system the ruling parties just take turns. A presidential election will force polarized alliances, denying voters the chance to vote for a party promoting a specific issue. Parties can and do disappear due to lack of support, so they have to struggle for survival.

&gt;One could hardly blame a tiny subset of a parliament for the choices of the parliament. 

You blame the ruling coalition. You can still vote for the opposition - you even have more choice, because there typically are more parties in the opposition, or you can support a party in government if you think it wasn't their fault.

&gt;The party votes for a party leader, and people vote for the party. The party leader still holds a huge influence on the outcome of an election. A party leader who did not win an election is seen as lacking legitimacy.

You can still win elections in a multi-party system. I don't see how forcing the people to choose for black and white, instead of letting them choose their shade and shape of grey, gives more legitimacy. Let the voters decide themselves on the tradeoffs between size/influence and specificity of ideology themselves."

You can't do that with Blichmann and use the thermometer because it has a vertical coupler arrangement.  Spike offers a horizontal coupler arrangement as well as all welded fittings for a cheaper price.  When I emailed Blichmann with a few questions about the coupler arrangement and what I intended to do with my future 15 gal kettle, the response I got answered not a single question I asked and parroted what their website already said.  My experience with Ben from Spike was the exact opposite.  

In fact I bought a 2nd kettle from Spike because I was impressed with their build quality and liked their customer service.  My parents bought me my first kettle for Christmas and I was very worried about checking it on the airplane ride home.  When I saw my box/kettle come across the baggage claim belt, I felt sick.

Perhaps Doyen ""forced"" Atlético to sign him as they are like a mafia ""today I help you to sign a player you want, but tomorrow you'll must sign a player you don't want or sell a player you want"". The lack of playtime for Guilavogui would be explained if Simeone disagreed with the signing and it was a ""political transfer"".

I remember that some journalist commented just after the signing that Guilavogui was a promising player, one of those who are sold in 2-3 years for 3x what they were bought. I guess all checks out."

Stroller. Make sure you strap them in every time you go from place to place. They will get to stretch their legs in line. Plus they will nod out on occasion.

Having cereal, granola bars, carrots sticks, etc on hand helped when he got hungry. Ear plugs are a must. The fireworks are loud, so are some of the explosions on some rides (Pirates of the Caribbean) they help him so much. We got the little small ones you could get at Babies R Us or Buy Buy Baby. Get a couple just incase you lose them.

Parades. Any parade that comes by check out. My son loves the parades more than the rides. Fantasmic is great but unless you get a good spot it might be hard for the little ones to see.

mundabit,Health,1389777427.0,"It works both ways too, the more you are exposed to ""adult foods"" and the less you are exposed to junk food, the more you lose your taste for junk. I never had soda as a kid, we didn't have it in the house. When I was first able to buy my own as a teen, I thought it just tasted like chemicals. The unhealthy nature of soda was obvious, so I never pushed myself to enjoy it. meanwhile, I loved chocolate as a kid and teen, but after a few years not eating it for a medical reason, I now think it tastes really sickening and bitter or overly sweet and tasteless (depending on the type)

It does take years, and its nearly impossible to do this as an adult because you access to the foods you want is pretty much only limited by your will power. But as a kid, your parents have the power to shape your palette.

You don't need a 3D printer to make vegetables fun in the early stages of introducing them to kids. Just explore different colours and textures, encourage kids to play with their food, to help prepare it or make it look fun."

That owner gets a free ride on your efforts by means of the interest (or even more if it's a bank), or by literally getting shares in the profit. The only thing they has to do is to spread his investment widely, so he'll keep his relative share in wealth of society. (Or he can gamble and pick a sector, getting even richer.)

Something like [this.](http://blog.woodbridge.lincolnapts.com/files/2013/02/Ballroom-Dancing.jpg) One advantage of being tall is that it makes spinning her incredibly easy! 

Something to avoid: The hunched over dance of the too tall. This occurs when you try and place your hands too low, I don't know if you are going to have this problem or not but if your back is hunched at all your hands are too low, move them up so your back is straight. However, it's traditional to keep them below her breasts.

bubbish,AskMen,1389778509.0,"I totally understand you bro, you want your friends to look and be as great as they can be, and that is truly a noble sentiment to spread. I'm the same way myself but I've learned from experience that while this intention is good (and truly makes you a better friend than most) it's pretty damned hard to get the point across properly.

The most important part is to get her mindset in order. She needs to be in a position where she understands that you're trying to help her and she has to be very open to the idea. Before she can get there, she has to sort of accept that she's suboptimal in this area and that she needs to acknowledge the problem. And most critical to all this - she must have **the desire to improve**. The hard part to all this is that this way of thinking is naturally submissive and it's a difficult position to be in. Nobody, especially someone with already low self confidence, wants to be in such a weak position. I believe people who manage this anyway have truly strong characters.

Also, don't just tell her what's wrong. You need some kind of followup prepared, not just ""you need to do your makeup better"" but also ""I have another female friend who might be able to help"" or ""I found these links online"". But again, none of this works if she's not first in a mindset to change and improve. If she's not, you're going to hit a brick wall.

How to get there? Talk to her in a relaxed and open setting."

Fight_the_fairies,fandomnatural,1389778526.0,"That song at the beginning was perfection. I appreciated the fact that Dean showed more emotion after Kevin's death and he wasn't just forgotten. Made me feel a tiny bit better.


Before the episode aired I was pissed by the fact Crowley's blood thing seemed to have been dropped, so I outright squealed when I saw what Dean had in his hand.


Crowley had me doing fist bumps, no joke. So many hilarious lines, but not only that, he had a very powerful moment with Sam inside his head and he seemed to genuinely fucking care what happened to him. And then that fight, all I could think was that Crowley *better not die*. Entire scene gave me goosebumps. Probably my favorite part of the episode.


Said it in another thread, but I swear that ""friend"" of Gadreel's was his boyfriend. He didn't deny it in the slightest. However, he's a coward, a piece of shit and needs to die as soon as possible. I disagree with Dean though, I'd prefer it if *Sam* killed him. It feels right. 


Cas was amazing, I loved every second of him, but he was a bit angrier than I was expecting. Was this due to Kevin or maybe a side effect of the borrowed grace? Also, eww, get rid of that trench coat. It's just not right. :(


Annoyed as hell with the ending scene. I would have much preferred Sam to throw a couple punches at Dean and them skip the sob story all together. How many times have they split up now and how often does that work out for them? That being said, Dean and Crowley teaming up is going to be...very freaking interesting. Hoping for equal awesomeness from Sam and Cas.

michaelnoir,exchristian,1389778620.0,"I think it's wonderfully expressed by Bakunin's God and the State, from 1871:"" Jehovah, who of all the good gods adored by men was certainly the most jealous, the most vain, the most ferocious, the most unjust, the most bloodthirsty, the most despotic, and the most hostile to human dignity and liberty - Jehovah had just created Adam and Eve, to satisfy we know not what caprice; no doubt to while away his time, which must weigh heavy on his hands in his eternal egoistic solitude, or that he might have some new slaves. He generously placed at their disposal the whole earth, with all its fruits and animals, and set but a single limit to this complete enjoyment. He expressly forbade them from touching the fruit of the tree of knowledge. He wished, therefore, that man, destitute of all understanding of himself, should remain an eternal beast, ever on all-fours before the eternal God, his creator and his master. But here steps in Satan, the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds. He makes man ashamed of his bestial ignorance and obedience; he emancipates him, stamps upon his brow the seal of liberty and humanity, in urging him to disobey and eat of the fruit of knowledge.

We know what followed. The good God, whose foresight, which is one of the divine faculties, should have warned him of what would happen, flew into a terrible and ridiculous rage; he cursed Satan, man, and the world created by himself, striking himself so to speak in his own creation, as children do when they get angry; and, not content with smiting our ancestors themselves, he cursed them in all the generations to come, innocent of the crime committed by their forefathers. Our Catholic and Protestant theologians look upon that as very profound and very just, precisely because it is monstrously iniquitous and absurd. Then, remembering that he was not only a God of vengeance and wrath, but also a God of love, after having tormented the existence of a few milliards of poor human beings and condemned them to an eternal hell, he took pity on the rest, and, to save them and reconcile his eternal and divine love with his eternal and divine anger, always greedy for victims and blood, he sent into the world, as an expiatory victim, his only son, that he might be killed by men. That is called the mystery of the Redemption, the basis of all the Christian religions. Still, if the divine Savior had saved the human world! But no; in the paradise promised by Christ, as we know, such being the formal announcement, the elect will number very few. The rest, the immense majority of the generations present and to come, will burn eternally in hell. In the meantime, to console us, God, ever just, ever good, hands over the earth to the government of the Napoleon Thirds, of the William Firsts, of the Ferdinands of Austria, and of the Alexanders of all the Russias."""

&gt; Back in 2007, Minnesota followed a national trend by passing an anti-smoking law that banned smoking in pretty much every public building, including bars.... The good owners of the Barnacles Bar were determined to find a loophole that would let their nicotine-addicted clientele feed their deadly vice in peace. 

&gt; They found it:

&gt; There was a line in the law that said if you were an actor in a play, and your character smoked, then you'd get a pass... Thus, the owners of the bar declared that they were staging a continuous live performance and that everyone in the bar was an actor.

&gt; The thing was, the law didn't bother to specify what was meant by ""stage performances,"" and really, how do you argue? So what if they didn't have a script--there is such a thing as improv. So what if they weren't getting paid--the law didn't say only professional actors counted....

&gt; This started a movement, with bars in other states under similar bans trying the same tactic. The authorities aren't amused and have levied fines against the bars for violating the ban, which several are challenging in court."

Also, NMW is raised slowly but consequently each year.

There is also an important thing to mention here. EU besides its positives obviously can bring some negatives. If someone thinks of uncontrolled immigration from EU as a negative then he needs to weigh it in with the positives. UK now tries to fight to get all the best from the EU (cherry picking), otherwise it will not eat the cake at all. Wouldn't it be a better strategy for UK to work on the changes which they can implement (for example raising wages, making sure people don't work below, even setting up some minimum levels for doing certain jobs - if that is possible) rather than fighting with EU about something which isn't even that much proven to harm UK (look most recent report).

This means - OK, maybe too many migrants came from EU but that is due to new EU accessions which have stopped for now. UK can implement any restrictions for future accessions using those grounds. Focus now on real issues."

Vordreller,learndota2,1389779470.0,"&gt;mainly the courier

You'll have to get used to it, but after a while, you'll remember how useful it is. Getting one early on is essential. I also advice going in to your settings and setting up keys for courier control. It doesn't have to be hard.

I set my F8 key to take control of the courier. Then I set Q as ""go to base"" and W as ""go to secret shop"".

So, if I know I'll need an item from secret, I'll do a quick F8-&gt;W-&gt;F1. F1 is selecting my hero again. Super easy. Once I see on the minimap the courier is about to arrive, F8-&gt;P(for shop)-&gt;buy what I need-&gt;close shop-&gt;Q-&gt;F1

Once you get that in to your fingers, it's the best thing ever.

Don't forget, double-tapping any select key will focus the screen on it. So double F1 centers the screen on you and in my case, double F8 will center the screen on the courier.

&gt;control groups

I've played over 500 hours now. I hate control groups and I avoid heros where I'll need to use them. Furthest I go is Venomancer with his wards. I just unify all commands(this is under settings) and have them do the same thing as venom.

I avoid playing Chen, Enchantress, Broodmother and basically any champ that has control groups as an essential part of their kit.

&gt;runes

Ward the runespots, check at every multiple of 2 minutes where the new rune is. It's that simple. Runes spawn at 0:00. When taken, it spawns at the next multiple of 2 minutes.

So, if nobody picked up the first rune and you pick it up at 3:59, you may well instantly see a new rune pop up at 4:00. It can happen.

&gt;Clinkz (how can anyone last hit with this guy? wtf)

Level the W first and use it to last hit, if you're having trouble. The extra damage gets very good for creeps at later levels, but your items will have to focus on mana regen if you're going that way.

&gt;Also, does anyone have any tips for Invoker?

Experience. There's no other way, just play him again and again and again and again.

I've played him a few times, I usually just stick to Snap Cold, Sunstrike and the summons. Also keep the invisibility runes up to quickly cast it if you think the enemy is going to gank you. The advanced stuff is pretty impressive, **if** you can pull it off.

I've been experimenting a bit with a support build, where I simply do Cold Snap and put Alacrity on my Carry. It's pretty nice."

She came into my office and I had my ALPO with me who was a female because they tell you never to be alone with a female in the Navy. I told the girl, that she shouldn't wear bright underwear during an inspection and should instead stick with what she was issued in boot camp (full ass white cotton granny panties) and I was going to have to reinspect her later. She immediately got super offended and said loudly 'why were you even looking at my underwear! That's harassment! Before I could say anything my ALPO immediately said 'bitch are you out of your fucking mind? It's a fucking uniform inspection!' I dismissed the young sailor quickly with 'I need to talk to my ALPO, we'll discuss this later' and she walked out near tears upset. As she was walking out I said ALPO please don't berate Sailors ... as soon as the door closed I fucking had a fit trying to stifle my laughing.

I was like holy shit, I know we were both thinking it but you can't say shit like that out loud! The young Sailor filed a complaint but it was quickly dismissed as not being sexual harassment and she had to stand her inspection again anyways.

For ADCs, again, there's red buff for the slow, and 700 health is nothing once again for the high burst champions since it's not effective health with no armor built even with another resistance item the damage is so miniscule and a last whisper (where this would usually be placed) would be so much stronger. 

For a specific case of Warwick, Warwick is not supposed to be 1v1ing champions late game especially. the 30 attack damage on Warwick who has almost no penetration is negligible. BOTRK is a much more effective purchase and has that slow effect you're looking for be it a less spammable slow.

Farage isn't fighting with EU only on the ground that he wants EU to change its policy about MPs being paid even if they don't contribute anything to the government. If he was, he should first sort out the UK's Sian Fien party. Farage doesn't like EU in general or rather everything about it as he doesn't try to change it at all, meaning for him it is a lost case. Why then does he take money off them if that policy is not his main goal? Maybe because it's convenient to have free money?

Also, in general, things in the world work on basic principle. You go to work, you earn money for doing work. You may not be doing work if you are forced to go to that work (for example prisoners of war doing mandatory jobs). Farage himself have his candidature for EU parliament MP, he won it and he ""does work""... by not doing it but cashing for. Was he forced? Can he do actual UK quitting EU from within? No. Thus, lack of the moral ground for his fight."

It's actually one of the most talked about role-switches which didn't work. Women wanted to make more decisions in the household/life (50-60's), but men kinda overreacted to that and became the '*whatever you say, dear*' kind of man. It's a big load of your mind not having to decide everything (and facing the consequences  - bad restaurant, unreliable type of car, insurance insufficient etc..), and men knew that :-)

Complete equality I haven't seen yet in a relationship, there's usually one partner who cuts the knots and makes the actual decision, and more often than not, it's still the guy. 

There's no better way to infuriate a girl then to say ""you choose the restaurant, I don't care"".  Apparently, deciding is still considered something only a *real* man can do.

My girl knows exactly what she *doesn't* want (the first 4 things I suggest), so while I still make the decision, it's always influenced by her in some way :-)

It mainly happens in white suburban areas where you have bored kids who want to cause a ruckus. Throwing toilet paper (or TP-ing) into a tree is also common. Both are intended to make a mess, but not actually do any real damage.
  
However, eggs can break windows (once again, personal experience), and if you leave egg on something painted, like the side of a house or a car, it tends to leave a stain, causing some damage. Also, if you TP a tree, then it rains on the tree before you can take the TP down, the soggy mess that is left behind is next to impossible to clean up.

That ""scant"" few policies are more common then ever. I did once a comparison and obviously UKIP are not total morons, they know how to word things and differ policies so that they are not too much taken as similar to BNP (party which clearly lost it).

&gt;nationalists is said like a terrible thing but all it really means is that they are primarily interested in what's best for their country.

Yes, even at cost of hurting foreign people just because rules in the country changed? (I'm referring to the example of EU nationals possible deportation). Also, leaving EU will have its costs. Farage doesn't say ANYTHING about these and doesn't have any proper plan or even idea how these will be solved and gives example of Norway, which clearly was in different situation (and yes, Norway doesn't have full sovereignty either, besides the fact it doesn't belong to EU).

&gt;but numbers are irrelevant with as large a population as the uk, 0.8% 

Now number are irrelevant??? Wait, so why all UK shouts about 1% of immigrants as being the worst what could happen to the UK? Nearly 1% of racists in UK is not a problem though, right? Well done rhetoric!

&gt;exactly why is that fucking very wrong or anything to do with racism? are they citizens? no they are not citizens they currently have a right to work here but nobody promised them the right to stay forever and it would not be unreasonable or in actual fact deportation to discontinue their unconditional right to work here if a new government decided so. they are not saying deport people who are citizens of foreign birth why exactly is that such a fucking terrible thing?

Tell that to EU nationals (it's not terrible to throw them away from the country they established in) and basically ruin their lives. NO PROBLEM WITH THAT, AT ALL. I wonder how Brits being abroad will like that idea (and EU would do the same if such restriction were put for EU citizens in Britain). Good luck welcoming around 1.5mln British citizens and taking them on welfare (as plenty will loose jobs) and caring about pensioners. They will be very happy about it.

I'm sorry, if you don't see a problem with the above I won't discuss any other points with you as you clearly don't want an objective discussion and are a selfish Brit, who actually shoots himself in the foot, just like a Farage does, who probably wants to retire in Spain... but won't be able to do it easily for his ""fight"" with EU."

Eventually though there isn't so much pie left and that's when the gloves come off ... with cable internet it seems like they were happy fleecing the territories they already carved out during the cable tv boom in the 90's and they've always had phone companies and satellite to compete with in their own territories that they carved out. The cable industry has been in collusion for years because they would rather fight alternatives than each other.

The Beauties is a really tough one. When you get into studying media you tend to get used to throwing a bone to certain directors as a matter of course when engaging in criticism.  By that, I mean when you come across something in a work that seems out of place or just plain bad, it makes sense to go straight to the assumption that it's intentional. The question then becomes ""what is the author trying to say by doing this?"".

And that's the wall I hit with the B&amp;B unit, specifically the sexual exploitation of it. I can come up with a few explanations of why they are the way they are (and why we are supposed to react the way most of us have), but at the end of the day I don't really feel that any of those explanations or critical interpretations really justify what's happening on the surface. That bugs me, because in every other case in Kojimas work a critical reading justifies what he's done.

Now, as has been said by others, in general they take the highest available quality version and create the lower ones from it for people who want faster / smaller downloads.

Note also that two files with the same resolution can have very different quality, mostly due to compression. The thing to look out for is the file size -- even a 2GB 720p will most likely look significantly better than a 1GB 1080p."

I'm 26f, and posting from a child's perspective. 

In addition to being hormonal teenage assholes a lot of the time, your kids are probably (I'm making assumptions about relationship with their late father) really hurting. 

I lost my dad was 13 and have three older brothers. They were 16, 20 and 21 at the time. 

Between us, we covered the spectrum of emotional responses to our Dad's death. Anger, guilt, blame, at ourselves, at dad, at mum, at the dog. Avoidance. Emotional withdrawal. Being an assholes was easier than dealing with the grief because you wouldn't be expected to communicate or contribute if mum didn't want to talk to you. 

My poor mother. Seriously, she was trying to grieve her husband and we were 4 irrational teens and young adults. We all said and did things we would take back as well adjusted adults. 

This may not apply to your situation but if it does then the whole family is probably unusually sensitive. 3 years is not a long time. It can take much longer to create a new normal. 

I remember feeling, for YEARS, like I was standing on the edge of a cliff on windy day, panicking, you know when your knees start to shake and you can't move for a minute because you're terrified you will somehow take a step in the wrong direction. If someone said or did anything remotely challenging or requiring patience or meaningful conversation I wasn't comfortable with I would panic and maybe say something hurtful, or get angry, or anything I could do to get out of it.

for every 10 girls who decide to take wrestling for example, that leaves 10 less out of the potential pool for other sports.

If you genuinely desire 50:50 balance in all fields (career wise) you are genuinely living in a fantasy world, not only is it not possible if there were no innate fundamental differences in gender behaviour, there actually are innate fundamental differences between us (behaviourally) due to our hard-wired gender."

First thing I'd change is to make your 'closed'  smile turn into an open smile. It doesn't hurt to show your teeth a little in a smile, and it looks a lot more genuine. I know that's a hard thing to change but try to keep it in mind. 

Other than that, I think you should limit the makeup for yourself. While I am not any familiar with how to do it, I am pretty fond of the natural look with absolute minimals in terms of makeup. Sure, mascara and a light touch of eyeliner is fine but I personally would tell you to avoid the bigger and thickly coloured area's like in today picture.

You have a good face and seem in a good shape, now it's just confidence and keeping in mind to smile brightly. I'd say a good 6,5/10 if you tone down the makeup, and a 7/10 if you manage to genuinely pull off ' open smiles ' "

silverionmox,europe,1389784544.0,"&gt; Up to who ? The Greeks didn't get to choose wether the referendum should be held...

The Greek government is mandated to take such decisions. It's the Greeks' choice how they organize their state and their decision making.

&gt;Newsflash, they're not. Please for the love of law of physics, provide a link of a debate with serious, qualified individuals about an EU exit, how the euro functions, on prime time on national television. What's that you say ? Can't find any ? Only propaganda and fear-mongering ? There's a reason there are no such things in the media.

And that's the fault of the EU how exactly?

&gt;Strawman. I'm blaming EU partisans, that means EU partisans in national governments, wherever they are. In fact, Papandreou now earns 50k at Harvard.

""EU partisans"" that were able to obtain a democratically elected majority mandated with decision power as per the laws and customs of their state. The population agreed with it.

&gt;In fact, Papandreou now earns 50k at Harvard. 

Which proves what? That Harvard and the EU are part of the great freemasonist conspiracy to enslave the world?

&gt;They just don't have their place when the EU is the subject, the people are too stupid. Gotcha.

If you think you can have a reasonable debate about very technical treaties that are 1000 pages long when the only possible positions are **YES** or **NO**,... you must either be delusional or deliberately trying to sabotage anything. What will the question be, anyway? ""Will you surrender your ancient sovereignity and enslave us to the Evil Union?"" or ""Will you agree to pool some resources and put up a united front against outside influence, with a lot of guarantees for your interests?"" Both describe the same option from two perspectives, but they will obviously give vastly different outcome. A referendum is an axe in the toolbox of democracy: great for cutting knots, but to build stuff you need screwdrivers and other finer tools.

&gt;The EU indeed doesn't have the power. Those who do have it, benefit from free movement of capital,

Capital also moved freely before the EU. At least now we have a banking union capable of ruling over banks. National governments had no leverage anymore.

&gt;from the fact that states can no longer borrow from their Central Banks and must ask financial markets, from the lack of any unemployment objective for the ECB in the treaties, from states selling public services, national news channels, newspapers...

Those are all policy problems rather than fundamental problems with the EU. That's like saying your country should be disbanded when your party loses the election and government.

&gt;Because if you're having sushi, you need sake. But there's no sake at the supermaket, so you're forced to buy wine even if those two don't go together.

Then start your own distillery. Democracy is hard work, you aren't always served your favourite food. Sometimes you have to cook it yourself.

&gt;Why do you think there's no debate in the media ? They wouldn't point the finger at their main shareholders.

Blame your media, I find plenty of discussion. Failing that, start your own.

&gt;Among other things, the media aren't putting the spotlight on serious, qualified opponents to the EU who are proposing to gather both the right and the left in the national interest (yes, they do exist). They put it on far-right and focus on immigration. Brilliant strategy to basically have people associate the idea that, if you're against the EU, you're an extremist and you don't like Arabs. False debates everywhere, and they eat it up too. You don't need to send in tanks or anything.

Again, blame your media, I can see all sides. There were several parties in Greece gaining ground, so you can't say they weren't successful or got no attention. But in the end the parties that supported the situation as it is still retained a majority. Apparently the alternatives weren't good enough.

&gt;Oh look, now it's the people's fault for believing in the EU. I should link it to /r/funny.

Elections are no free lunch. You can choose from the menu, but you can't complain afterwards that you don't like the dish... after all, you picked it yourself.

&gt;I've provided sources and explanation about Optimal Currency Area and asymmetric shock theories, please provide the same. 

No, you didn't. I answered you, do the same.

&gt;This needs to be done in evey country. You haven't asked them if they were okay with it.

They agreed to join the eurozone. It's like agreeing to go swimming and then complaining that you're getting wet.

&gt;Now it's the peoples' fault for protecting their national interests.

You can't blame the EU for being disfunctional when the national governments are the ones throwing a wrench in the works. Yes, I think the North should shut up and swallow a little inflation, and I do think the South should shut up and swallow a little devaluation. Regrettably, it's mostly devaluation in the South so far, but that's a matter of policy, no fundamental construction issue of the EU.

&gt;Nevermind that Luxemburg and Austria don't have any industry to rely on, they should raise their tax rates.
Nevermind that there will be no reason to delocalize to Eastern Europe if they raise their wages.
Nevermind the UK not caring about agriculture and going all-in on finance, they should help French peasants more.
Nevermind the German SMEs' quasi-monopoly in the industrial sector, lazy PIGS need to learn financial discipline.
Nevermind the Germans efforts, they should pay up for the other's mistakes.

You should learn to communicate clearly instead of thinking exclusively within your own frame of reference. It's totally hazy what you try to say.

&gt;Yes, let's see how long this goes on. Look at the 10year bonds rates and inflation. The situation is unsustainable. Do you think the markets are stupid ?

They aren't. They now know the ECB will hit them with the inflation cannon if they try to pull nasty tricks. So they keep quiet to keep their currents profits.

&gt;Now companies can delocalize whenever (even have to if they want to remain competitive), use workers (somtimes children) paid almost nothing, with no social/environmental protection, and sell the goods to the country were they were supposed to be produced in the first place.

How is that the fault of the EU? Thanks to the EU we can set social and environmental standards that individual countries never would get away with. At least now we're so big that companies - and other countries - have to listen what we say when it comes to consumer standards instead of dictating their terms to us.

&gt;It just doesn't cause record unemployment and poverty.

A 10% devaluation is still a 10% cut in wages. Of course capital owners have their wealth in a foreign bank account, so they become richer in real terms. I don't like that. In addition, countries who devalue often need to do it again and again. It's a sedative rather than a cure.

&gt;This is essentially Northern European thinking. The South should do like the North, nevermind the countries aren't structured like them or that they don't want it. Good example of the end of democracy caused by the euro. This also dictates the policy of other states who are somewhat okay but need to sacrifice to 'save' the euro.

Hey, they didn't *have* to join the euro. They really wanted to and freely agreed. For good reasons, I think, but perhaps they underestimated the possible consequences. Southern countries can and do change their policies, they're perfectly capable. Saying otherwise is racist.

&gt;See above, UK is made by history.

So you are against any change ever, since nothing is ""approved by history"" before it happens?

&gt;And even worse, by staying in the EU, it's disconnecting itself from the people it has links with. It's even coming apart (Scotland referendum, same thing in Catalonia) under the regionalism promoted by the EU.

I find it hilariously inconsequent that you beat the drums of sovereignity, specific national character and self-determination... and then turn around and deny that same right to nations that have been subjugated by other states in the past. The fact that the EU provides a safe and civil way to reorganize political borders to suit the demands of the population instead of having to resort to violence and war, as was traditionally necessary, is one of its triumphs.

&gt;Oh really ? Do elaborate, try to take into account the scale of the conflicts and see if that's the case.

Yes, sounds like any parliament ever. It's one of its strengths that it scales so well.

&gt;And when a doctor says my leg has to be amputed to heal my sore throat, I stop going to that doctor.

Sure, go to another doctor, i.e. try to change EU policy. I'll support you, there's too much austerity. But breaking up the EU would be the same as not going to any doctor ever anymore because you've encountered a questionable one.

&gt;I said I don't know when, or how the euro will explode, only that it will. The earlier a country gets out, the less suffering they'll have to endure.

So you've only got a ""The end is nigh!"" prediction.

Irony at it's finest since the national governments no longer have control of the strategic levers that can change the country. EU bait and switch at its finest, blame the national governments, not the irreductible divergent interests and economic needs.

As I've said several times, I disagree with the current economic policy which is counterproductive. That doesn't mean the EU is impossible.

&gt;Either way, go talk to the Swiss, the Norse who are outside the EU; the Swedes who are outside the euro; and the Icelanders who just refused to join the EU. Are they sovereign fundamentalists too ?

Yes, and they're getting a bad deal: Switzerland and Norway still have to comply to most EU regulation, but they don't get a say in it. The Swedes have found a loophole, and the fact that the EU doesn't do more than give them a tsk-tsk-tsk sound it just shows how *tyrannical and overbearing* the EU is. Iceland is putting their membership talks on ice, but they're far from getting their sheeps on dry land yet. They did relatively well so far because they avoided the worst of austerity. Likewise Belgium did okay too, for the same reason. As you can see, being inside or outside the Eurozone doesn't prevent countries from choosing not to implement austerity.

&gt;Because the press serves the system as explained above. But time will come when they won't be able to ignore the eurorealist movement.

That you wear different clothes do not change who you are as person, but it does help for people to notice you in general.

My biggest concern is that due to your tom-boyish approach with hair at a lot of the pictures, guys may not be as interested. Let it grow nice and long, in a single colour with perhaps some highlights. There are many types of styles, and where some men like to see the more extravagant and colourful styles, a lot of guys like the more natural look. 

Another thing that really really bothered me when I saw your pictures is that each and everyone feels extremely forced based on your ' smile '. Your smile is pretty much a flat line, with little to no emotion in it. As I said to other people, it's great if you can manage to have a genuine 'open' smile, which means that your teeth are showing slightly. It'll be hard to adapt but there needs a major change should you want to attract more male attention. See your cat picture, that is a gorgeous smile and you should have that much more often.

You were asking before how hair can be 'emo'. For a lot of people, you lose identity when you dye it in all kind of colours. A part of who you are is hidden behind a mask of something else. I've had many friends who dyed their hair in all impossible colours, but in the end they realised that it's just a phase and that they will grow out of it. You're 18 and the world is ready for the taking. Imagine you'd apply for a job at a company with rainbow hair. It usually doesn't go very well due to their etiquette of how to dress (Yes, they may not have it written but each company or organisation has certain expectations of their employees). So simply ditch the random colours and stick to nice and classy."

If you take what is generally accepted for small breeds, then the first 2 years count for 12.5 years each, so age 2 a small dog is equivalent to a 25 year old human.

Then for each following year you multiply by about 5, so that's 5x5=25. You add that up and your dog is basically the equivalent of a 50 year old woman.

As you can imagine, by now her prime breeding years are well behind her and any pregnancy becomes a high risk pregnancy due to the natural aging process.

Favorite is chicken piccata. Slice a chicken breast in half so you have two cutlets. Grind fresh black pepper over each cutlet and then dip them in flour.

GeeJo,Parahumans,1389785256.0,"**EDIT: NOW ALPHABETISED!**

Here are some characters from a superhero campaign I ran a while back - I'll omit the generic ""Alexandria-types"" and the elemental-ray-blasters, etc. The players were heroes/rogues, though, so most of these were a bit villainous. I've added my best guess on how they'd be classified by the PRT:

* **""Acme""** (*Shaker/Breaker*) Everything around her acted with ""cartoon physics"". In practice, she worked a lot like Circus. Small athletic Filipina, fond of one-liners.

* **""Affect""** (pronounced AFF-ect, rather than aff-ECT) (*Stranger*) Aura of total apathy. Causes people to simply stop what they were doing and stare into space. Effect lasts for a few minutes at most, and *can* be (but isn't always) broken if the victim is hurt in any way. Doesn't work as well as a ""Stranger"" type as you might expect - people don't care while they're under his influence, but they *do* see him and they do remember him afterwards. Typical emo/goth teenager in appearance and personality, made a living knocking over jewelry stores. Teamed up with **Goo Girl** and **Alchemist** for a time, as they were all **""Outcasts""** at the same high-school.

* **""Alchemist""** (*Shaker*) Can transform one type of liquid into another. Could affect a considerable volume, with an ill-defined duration. On paper, his power made him the strongest and most versatile of the **""Outcasts""**, but he wasn't bright enough to take full advantage of it. His primary use for it was in arranging underage drinking parties or, for combat, something like ""Surprise! Chloroform!"". He emphatically did \*not\* have the ""Skitter"" mindset to try something like transforming his opponent's sweat into acid. Socially awkward but somewhat genre-savvy, treated the whole ""superhero"" business as a giant game of D&amp;D. Dressed as a wizard: robe, hat, fake beard, ""potion bottles"" (water, until he came up with something better for it to be), the works.

* **""Andriy Savchuk""**, self-styled **""Assassin""** (*Blaster?*) Basically a ""Kira/Light Yagami"" knock-off without the smarts. Can induce heart attacks in anyone he knows the face and name of, with an unlimited range. Rather stupidly started his killing spree with people he knew personally and had public grievances with (including the civilian identity of **Taser**.) His identity was quickly discovered and he was ""accidentally"" killed by one of the players who was friendly with **Taser**, and who received only a slap on the wrist as punishment. Ukrainian immigrant with a thick accent.

* **""Avalon""** (*Shaker*) overlays an alternate reality over everything within 10 feet of her - it appears to be an idyllic meadow in summer. Stops most harmful effects from non-cape sources from entering (fire, poison gas, bullets, falling debris, etc) but is somewhat unreliable at stopping cape-generated effects.

* **""Babel""** (*Shaker*) A rather nondescript fellow, he had a power with a city-wide effect that caused people to rapidly lose the ability to understand one another. More of a plot device than a character in his own right, really. He never had a clear motivation beyond an ill-defined ""tragic past"".

* **""Bacchus""** (*Master*) Has an aura that lowers inhibitions and induces low-level euphoria, escalating to full on drunkenness with no hangover the following morning. Is capable of supercharging the aura into causing frenzied bloodthirst, but rarely has cause. Runs a very successful nightclub (Saturnalia), employs a small legion of lawyers to defend against conspiracy-rape/assault charges after people intoxicated by his aura engage in behaviour that they later regret. African-American, tall, handsome, dresses well. Slight tendency to be a bit of a control-freak, but not aggravatingly so. Was a major secondary character in a lot of storylines, but rarely got involved directly in the action.

* **""Backup""** (*Striker*) **Jewel**'s 14-year old son. Similar power, but stores people’s personalities rather than powers, and only drains the ""victim"" if he wants to. Very highly valued, as he can ""back-up"" heroes about to go into a dangerous situation - if they die, the ""soul-gem"" can be absorbed by someone to imprint their personality and memories, essentially resurrecting them in a new body. The absorption is temporary if the recipient is healthy, but was usually used on coma patients with the permission of the family or, later, clones. Jewel is massively overprotective of him, but for good reason; more than one plot involved the players rescuing Backup from whatever trouble he'd gotten himself into - Jewel's jewels were a convenient reward.

* **""Bits""**/**""Starfish""** (Changer) Minor villain who could disassemble himself and independently control his various body parts. Not that powerful, but all but impossible to kill as he could reform and regenerate from any surviving pieces. Japanese or Korean, I think.

* **""Blackmark""** (*Striker*) Can cause old wounds to re-open or bones to re-break regardless of how long ago the original injury was. Death of a thousand papercuts, basically. Thug/Enforcer working for **Plague**, who appreciated Blackmark's side-power of being able to intuit the condition of a person's body. Neo-Nazi leanings.

* **""Boo""** (*Master*) 6-year-old boy. Had an animated bedsheet with basic blaster powers as a companion. Parents died during an outbreak of one of **Plague**'s creations.

* **""Bubble""** (*Shaker*) While standing still can generate a forcefield that continually expands out - she can choose whether objects the field encounters are admitted or repulsed. No apparent upper limit to the field's size, but if it comes under enough attack, or if she moves, the field collapses. French, tends to play the ditz but is smarter than she lets on. Player character.

* **""Buzz""** (*Brute/Striker*) Can induce vibrations into objects or people he touches that take a \*long\* time to fade away. Strength of the vibrations varies according to the demands of the plot - at one point he was collapsing bridges. Mildly enhanced strength, decently enhanced durability, abrasive personality. **Taser's** brother, he only got more abrasive and at times outright xenophobic after her death.

* **""Cao Cao""** (*Tinker*). Creates hand-to-hand weapons, favouring blades. Examples include a longsword that collapses into a button, a weightless claymore, self-guided throwing daggers, and knives that sweat concentrated acid. Friendly but has a persecution complex, will interpret anything as an insult if it could possibly be read that way. Second-generation Chinese immigrant, but thoroughly Americanised. His pseudonym comes from the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"", the one book his father brought with him ""on the boat"".

* **""Charger""** (*Striker*) Induces a ""coiled-spring""-like energy in objects she touches. When someone else touches the object, it launches itself away with surprising power. The longer she touches the object, the greater the buildup, but she can't trigger the objects herself. The charging can take a little time, so she carries a bag of pre-charged items to pass to others as weapons or throw as traps.

* **""Clockwork""** (*Tinker*) Steampunk-themed tinker. Lots of brass, leather, anachronistic-looking robots and weaponry. 

* **""Conspiracy Nut""** (*Thinker*) Not a name chosen by himself (He preferred **""Prophet""**). Intuits connections between events, people, things. The power has a tendency to get out of control, leading to acute apophenia. A weaker version of Tattletale, essentially. He was a semi-frequent side-character who acted as a plot-hook generator whenever I couldn't be arsed to come up with a better entry-point, his flaws making for a good fudge-factor if I changed my mind about what was going on mid-story. Emaciated, wild-eyed, bad teeth, long hair. Looked like a crazy person and basically was. Uncle of **Leet** and ostensibly his guardian, though Leet was the one who actually ran the household.

* **""Cooler""** (*Breaker*) can transfer ""luck"" around, moving good/bad fortune between himself and nearby people. The effect fades over time - a person whose luck was stolen will gradually get back to baseline normal. Ended up getting somewhat neutralised once a team arranged a penny-stakes betting pool based around random numbers generated continuously by handheld computers; their end of the discrepancy evaporated as soon as it manifested (though he remained ""lucky"" enough from stolen fortune to repeatedly get away). Unfortunately for him, he's ginger-haired - he's now thoroughly sick of people calling him a ""Leprechaun"" and taunting him about ""Lucky Charms"".

* **""Copycat""** (*Trump/Shifter*), becomes a duplicate of whoever she last fought and defeated, including appearance and abilities. Correspondingly, refuses to fight anyone she regards as ""unworthy"" - comes across as arrogant as a result.

* **""Creep""** (*Thinker*) Completely deaf. Hears people's internal monologues, so he more or less gets by. Reasonably combat-effective as his power gives him a little predictive edge. Dies after his car is rigged to explode by someone worried that he'd overheard him plotting.

* **""Digit""** (*Brute*) Nullifies his opponent's muscle memory - they have to consciously think about everything they're doing (also enforces voluntary breathing, blinking and swallowing). Only a slightly above-average fighter in his own right, but people seriously struggle to fight him hand-to-hand or even to run away effectively. Muscle-for-hire, he was overwritten by **Geas** and went on a rampage until taken down by the players.

* **""Elastic Man""** (*Shifter*) Had ""Mr Fantastic""'s stretching ability, but it was painful to him. Lived as a civilian.

* **""Euclid""** (*Trump*) Eidolon-type varying powerset based around geometric shapes - touching a giant triangle? one power. A square? a different power. A miniboss without an established background. His costume would probably look ridiculous and he ended up looking like he was playing a one-man game of 'Twister' when he fought the players.

BPD is more like: ""I hate you, go away!"" and ""Please don't leave me I can't go on without you!"" The disorder is way more black and white and everything about their personality is more extreme than you'd expect of someone. They feel emotions way more intense than ""normal people"" would and that is why they more often than not automutilate (self harm) and think about suicide.

I think what other people are trying to tell you is that she often breaks up because she isn't feeling it anymore. I think they suspect that the reason she comes crawling back is because she doesn't want to be alone (which is NOT a good reason to get back with some one!) and that she still loves you some how (which is normal after most break ups and one of the reason people often advice a period of no contact). The point is that if she breaks up with you, the feeling is not *that* strong in the first place. Or, also a possibility, is that she just doesn't take those 'break(s) (ups)' not very seriously.

I'm not sure what kind of advice to give you. If you are an emotional wreck, I think it is best to do what *you* think is best for you. Just realise that you cannot change some one."

That feeling of hunger, that tells you how much you want to eat is impossible to replicate in a game, a bar that tells you that you're 50% hungry, or full, just tells you what you're body is telling you.

Yes, it takes you out a bit, but thats because there is no way for the game to give you the same general FEELING of hunger, saying 'i'm kinda hungry' doesn't tell you as much as feeling, the game telling you that you're 50% hungry lets you imagine what that would be like.

Someone who is 5' has the same innate ability to sucker punch you as someone who is 7' or 20' or 4', be rowdy, piss next to the drink stand, pull a gun, or pat you on the back, etc. To be intimidated -- or more importantly scared/frightened -- by someone merely because of their height is just... it's wrong on so many levels and may actually point to some sort of anxiety condition. Their height does not necessarily make them stronger, or more capable in any way. It only speaks to their reach.

In law enforcement, they say your first fight will be someone you don't expect it to be. A 14 year old girl, a 60 year old geriatric, etc. I worked in a prison, so I didn't have the luxury of getting in a fight with a 14yo girl but rather many capable men generally taller than me.

Regarding your own situation, I've got to give you the hard truth when it comes to unrequited love...move on as quickly as you can. It's tough as hell to unattract yourself from someone or unlove them but if you are not receiving reciprocal interest or attention, then all of your energy is being wasted. Finally, it was my own experience that unrequited love turns into self-loathing. This is the double whammy. Not only are you in love with someone who doesn't love you but you are actively hating yourself for that fact. This is precisely why you need to move on. You deserve to be loved back and anything that promotes self-loathing needs to be removed from your life. Here's to brighter days, friend. Hang in there."

lordfuzzywig,ProtectAndServe,1389786859.0,"No one here -- period -- will support the eventual death of this subject for simple noncompliance. No one. No one here will support the unprofessionalism of the officer(s) either. These fellows lost their jobs for that. Don't let the sensationalist ""acquitted"" title sway you. They lost their jobs. **But a jury of their peers determined they did not MEAN to kill him.** They saw this video, and others I'm sure, and listened to testimony. They determined these officers were not guilty.

We don't have to agree with the jury's decision. But that is how the legal system works. If we can't respect that, then I don't know what to say...

Officers are charged with making the best decisions they can. I have no doubt that the officers here felt they were making good decisions. There are a lot of things the cops did wrong. But a lot of things they did right.

**It's very easy to sit behind a computer screen and say, ""That was a really stupid thing to do.""** When you're actually fighting a subject who (especially when mentally ill can be very strong) may not just want to get away, but may mean to do you harm after you try to actually apprehend them, you make split-second decisions. Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad. Sometimes they're bad and nothing happens. Sometimes it's a good decision and bad things happen despite that. In this case, it was some bad split-second decisions that resulted in a bad outcome. Both Kelly Thomas and the officers made bad decisions. Thomas could have surrendered peacefully, but even when all these officers were on top of him, he refused to comply. We can say, ""Well he was mentally ill. You can't expect him to comply."" But now apply that to the officers. What are they supposed to do? Throw their hands up and say, ""Well, he doesn't understand us and doesn't want to comply. Time to pack it up and go home boys""?

These (former)officers will have to live with the results of those decisions and will have a permanent stain on their record and their conscience.

With all that said, this video is from like 2 years ago. In that time, many departments nationwide have looked to this case and reiterated the importance of training to deal with the mentally ill. So let that reassure you to some degree.

Why? It should be enemies flank, enemies dodge, charge, take cover, collaborate, rather than just stare at me in the open. The only difficulty slider is how fast you die and how quickly you kill. It was stupid in Reach (so thankful no Elites ran at me in 4 to kick me one time, killing me and half my team with it) and it's stupid now.

This is the shit they sell on tumblr fat acceptance. ""Omg just because I'm fat doesn't mean I'm not healthy"". And then proceed to be obeses and thinking the more fat the more healthy, and ""the body needs fat!.

Yes, the body needs fat. But not to the point when you're obese and can't hardly fucking move, while shoving tons of non-nutritious bullshit down you throat. 

I always here from these people ""the fitness industry is a multibillion dollar industry that's just making money by making people insecure about their weight"". But  wait, what about that multi-billion dollar fast food industry selling you unhealthy shit? That frozen foods industry that's doing the same that's selling you junk in the form of TGI Fridays appetizers in a box? Or that junk food industry that markets it's Dorritos and Mountain Dew directly to teenage boys, and especially with gaming promotions?

Of course the body needs fat, and you know what? Even those skinny, slim, average sized people you see have fat on them. But do you see skinny people dropping dead daily just because they have less fat?

This along with this tumblrette myth that all women who are skinny must be starving themselves or must be skinny to fit beauty standards is also bullshit. Some people just don't eat much, some people's bodies just need less food for energy, and some people can eat everything and not gain wait. People's bodies are different. I hate this assumption by this Fat Inspo shit that just because you like eating, are big, and have no self control that it's just natural and everyone else is just doing what they're doing to fit in. The assumption that you're a rebel while stuffing yourself with food sold to you by corporations with additives and other bullshit, whole you talk about the fitness or fashion industry when they both don't come close to the food industry and their money and bullshit.

Of course skinny, skim, athletic people are going to die and are prone to health problems. EVERYONE IS! WE'RE HUMAN! Of course a skinny person can have a heart attack, can get diabetes, and other ills. But guess what?  That fat is a faster way to these problems. Breathing problems, clogged arteries, fat there to put pressure on your internal organ. And also, it's better to be small in the case of a car crash because despite the stupid myth that fat is a cushion, it's not and rescuers have a harder time trying to save bigger people in accidents.

Vordreller,learndota2,1389787362.0,"&gt;It states ""Movespeed"" on Orchid. Orchid doesn't give any though.

Yeah, I meant attack speed. I'll change it when I get home.

&gt;Also the usual meta builds don't recommend getting Gale much early on at all. That's because the slow stays the same and the slow is what you get it for.

You have a point there. I was hung on the damage over time, but you're right, the slow is significant and doesn't increase with level. I'll change that.

&gt; The thing with arcanes is that they do give you the mana, but they are a huge investment giving you 0 hp or survivability. You will die easily when caught.

Yes, but isn't that going to happen eitherway, if I get caught? I think that with Arcane, I can be a bit more lenient concerning mana and even help the team a bit more. Suppose I got power treads and leave them on strength? It's not **that much** health and when you look at the difference in cost, it's 1400 for Power Treads and 1450 for Arcanes. That's 50 gold more, just over a single last hit more.

When you compare it to Power Treads, it's not really a ""huge"" investment. It's more a case of Power Treads building out of more items that you can buy sooner, thus ensuring your gold being invested. While with Arcane, you have to build up that entire 1000 at once. It's a bit more dangerous, but not by much.

&gt;From the ""I like to build boots first"" I take it you play in low level pubs.

Yup. My ranked MMR is going up and down between 2000 and 2200 currently. I put this last because it addresses the point you mentioned several times: Veno has low HP and is easy to take down.

At the level I'm currently playing, I've nearly never had that happen. Trilanes don't exist at this level, let alone someone from lane coming to gank mid. It just doesn't happen at this level.

I've also found that getting my Poison Sting maxed first makes farming really fast. I just make sure my lane doesn't get pushed and I have no trouble getting the last hits.

You mentioned high costs of Arcane and Shadow Blade, but I usually get them without much trouble, especially against melee mids.

I like doing Veno mid because it surprised me how easy it was to pick off the enemy mid with it. I've beaten Pudge players, I've beaten Kunkka players, etc... with it.

It's amazing how I can just stay at safe distances, move in to apply poison on an enemy and move back out. They use up their tango's and salves incredibly fast and I can farm in relative safety because nobody actually dares come near me. Getting last hits and denying the enemy has never been easier.

But like you said: low level pubs. I basically only ever play solo pubs. That's it."

ShesGotSauce,NoStupidQuestions,1389787463.0,"Man I forgot what incredible delivery he had.

Anyway, I take issue with the unit of measurement on the grounds that it is no longer culturally current. Boundaries of linguistic decency on television have been stretched so far that most or all of his seven dirty words, plus many more, are regularly said on television or at least have been said multiple times on television, although there are still many contexts in which some words are prohibited (""fuck"" is not to be said on Good Morning America but on The Wire it's ok).

So what think you of this scale: could the President of the United States say it in a press conference, could he say it in the State of the Union Address and how would the public react if he was caught saying it privately?

Jerk would be acceptable in a press conference given by the President of the United States. ""Quite frankly, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been acting like a jerk toward the rest of the world.""  He could not replace jerk with douchebag. In a State of the Union address, even jerk would be _avoided_ as an insult (though it's one of Carlin's sometimes words; ""I'm tired of Congress jerking around the American people"" would be fine). Douchebag would absolutely be prohibited.  And it would be deemed inappropriate, the use of the word itself, and crass were he to be caught saying it on a hot mic after an interview thinking he was off the record. If he said in the same situation, ""Benjamin Netanyahu is an incredible jerk,"" his use of the word jerk itself would be uninteresting to the public; only the fact that he had insulted a US ally at all would be scandalous.

And to think my first reaction to seeing OP's question was just to respond, ""they're basically the same"" until I read your thought provoking analysis. :-)"

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1389787816.0,"&gt; What kind of game would appeal to a feminist? An FPS to express anger, or an RTS to show cunning?

I would comment that anger or cunning *in videogames* are stereotypically  ~~male traits~~ attractive to male gamers. I'm going to guess that won't appeal to the majority of girl game players. There have been video games targeted towards girls which focused on team work. And I'm not talking about games focused on shopping or dress up. [Wikipedia: Women and Video Games.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_video_games)

There was a game called [Creatures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatures_%28video_game%29) where one basically taught a newborn creature how to interact with its world, like how to find food. It was surprisingly popular with girls. 

Even my sister liked World of Warcraft. I'm sure she would call herself a feminist. 

Other video games popular with girls were the Sims series. It was exploring a world and building a house, and putting stuff in the house while trying to keep your Sim happy with art, music, sleep, etc.

ygdrssl,RoomPorn,1389787872.0,"&gt; Subsequently the academic Ronald Hamilton made the link between the symptoms described by Chris and the poisoning of Jewish prisoners in the Nazi concentration camp in Vapniarca. He put forward the proposal that Chris McCandless died of lathyrism caused by ODAP poisoning from Hedysarum alpinum seeds which hadn't been picked up by the previous studies as they were searching for alkaloid instead of toxic protein. The protein would be relatively harmless to a well-fed person on a normal diet, but toxic to someone who was malnourished, physically stressed, and on an irregular and insufficient diet, as McCandless was. Subsequent tests revealed ODAP was indeed present in the seeds.

If McCandless did indeed suffer from lathyrism, it would have caused him severe leg cramps and limited mobility, which would have impeded his ability to forage for and hunt food. The ""poison"" on the seeds wouldn't have killed him directly. Instead, it would have impaired his ability to support himself and caused starvation.

I'm not disagreeing with you when you say, ""I think lack of food played a huge role."" His cause of death was certainly starvation. I'm just specifying how this starvation may have occurred, in case there are redditors here who aren't clued in on the whole story."

&gt;The money quotes:

&gt;&gt;Did some harridan you had a crush on in Year 9 laugh at your rad collection of Warhammer figurines once?

&gt;&gt;You can even take it online, so you don’t even have to conform to society’s Greerstapo standards by changing out of your gaming trackpants! 

&gt;&gt;Today the Starcraft Messageboards, Tomorrow the World: Trolling 101

&gt;&gt;But do you which fedora goes best with your jean-shorts and which goes best with the free t-shirt you got with last month’s edition of Skyrim? This subject is the answer to all your style needs, whether it’s what kind of fabrics don’t show Pad Thai stains, how to get the best out of your computer tan or deciding whether to sculpt your neck-beard or just let that baby run wild.

&gt;&gt;But how to lure a mate into your Fortress of Solitude when she wants to talk – out of turn – about things that aren’t you? 

&gt;&gt;Gentleman, Love Thyself: The Best in Internet Pornography
Because you’re sure as hell not getting laid anytime soon, buddy.


&gt;Nerd shaming (the video game titles Starcraft and Skyrim, the tabletop gaming reference, as well as the comic book references like ""Fortress of Solitude"").

&gt;Nerds are not the ""bros"". The ""bro gamers"" play CoD/Fifa/Madden/etc... they're the normal people who used to beat up video game players but who now are totally into these mainstream games.

&gt;But who is being singled out here? Normal guys who are gender-normative (the bros), or nerds *who are by definition gender-atypical*?

&gt;Tabletop gaming (Warhammer) isn't a typical male interest (the interest is mostly male, but most males don't play it). Skyrim is a fantasy RPG (archetypal nerd genre). Starcraft is a niche interest everywhere that isn't South Korea. ""Fortress of Solitude"" is a Superman reference - one which probably wouldn't make sense to most men.

&gt;In other words, gender-deviant males are being mocked for being gender-deviant. YET AGAIN, we see the so-called enemies of the gender system *mocking gender-atypical men*. 

&gt;I'll disagree with Camille Paglia for hours on end, but at least she knows that traditional masculinity resides in manual labor and sports radio, not in Starcraft or Warhammer. 

&gt;This mistake is even *more* unforgiveable for the fact we're dealing with an *Australian* website. I am an Australian - my nation is demented in its obsession with sport... its more jock-loving than the US, and we publically fund our olympic team, and nerdy guys get it even *worse* here than in America. Traditional manliness is and has always been pathologically sport-centric in this country. It is also strongly blue-collar (due to the old left/union movement's stronger influence here than in America) and often martial (owing to the whole ANZAC tradition). 

&gt;Someone *cannot* be Australian and not know the basic foundations of traditional masculinity in this country.

&gt;But did the article allege ""Men's Rights"" will be a giant rugby scrum? Did the article allege ""Men's Rights"" will be an Aussie beer-drinking contest? Did the article allege that ""Men's Rights"" will be people beating each other over the head with cricket bats to toughen them up? 

&gt;No, the article bashed nerdy characteristics - *gender-nonconforming characteristics exhibited by the male victims of the gender system*. It bashed *socially emasculated men* for being socially emasculated.

&gt;I barely know where to begin with how vile this hypocrisy is. If the official feminist movement were *serious* in its opposition to stereotypes, it would *give a fuck* about the plight of the male nerd. It would point out how they are victims of masculosexism and their bullying is partly gender-based and how even though their technologies revolutionized the economy they still get treated as second-rate men. 

&gt;But its pretty clear - far too many feminists are more than willing to forgive any man who is a strong, athletic, tanned, masculine hunk, and save all of their rage and hatred for men who don't turn them on.

&gt;The male nerd gets all the bad stuff about the male gender role without much of the privilege. Many MRAs are nerds. The sexually unattractive woman suffers the genderflipped version of this, and we all know how many homely women take Women's Studies (thanks Camille for pointing that out!). You would *think* they'd have some goddamned empathy for male nerds, particularly given how Carol Gilligan keeps crowing about how wonderfully empathetic and caring women are.

&gt;Instead, we get shit like the linked article. 

&gt;And then so many feminists wonder why 1) our movement is gaining momentum and 2) why we have no desire to become feminist allies. Shit like the linked article is part of the answer."

A very imperfect fix of course, but if you have to run say 2 miles, log out every .5 miles are so and re-login if the glitch is happening often.  It seems there are spikes when the glitch will continuously reset you over and over and other times it won't happen at all.

redwhiskeredbubul,TheBluePill,1389788683.0,"In all honesty, TRP reminds me a lot more of a far-right political movement than a simple collection of frustrated men. There's a book called ['The Authoritarian Personality,'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_personality) written after World War II, that summarizes a lot of it quite nicely. Regardless of what you think of the Freudian framework of the analysis, quite a lot of it fits. The authors found 

&gt;The resulting intrapsychic conflicts cause **personal insecurities**, resulting in that person’s superego to **adhere to externally imposed conventional norms** (conventionalism), and to the authorities who impose these norms (authoritarian submission). The ego-defense mechanism of projection occurs as indicated when that person avoids self-reference of the anxiety producing id impulse, by **displaying them onto “inferior” minority groups in the given culture (projectivity)**, with **associated beliefs that are highly evaluative (power and toughness)**, and rigid (stereotypy). Additionally, there is **a cynical view of mankind** and **a need for power and toughness resulting from the anxieties produced by perceived lapses in society’s conventional norms (destructiveness and cynicism)**. Other characteristics of this personality type are a **general tendency to focus upon those who violate conventional values and act harshly towards them** (authoritarian aggression), a general opposition to subjective or imaginative tendencies (anti-intraception), a tendency to believe in mystic determination (superstition), and finally, **an exaggerated concern with promiscuity.**

One could probably expand on this endlessly. Personally, I'd like to say the single biggest factor in TRP is a poor education and lack of access to courses that teach critical thinking skills. Some of the people who post there really are kind of sub-literate: they can't use basic punctuation, they have difficulty with homonyms, and can't formulate a basic argument of the kind you'd need to make on a GED exam. There are other people, however, who are quite educated. There's usually a crackpot quality to what they write and think, however, and they usually seem very frustrated with established higher education. The common thread is that they're people who've been treated as intellectual detritus and have internalized a sense of inferiority while blasting out anger towards the institutions that have wronged them. 

To continue ripping from the book (or rather, wikipedia on the book), the explanation for the autoritarian personality is supposed to be

&gt;  **a strict superego that controls a weak ego unable to cope with strong id impulses.**

What this means in English is that this kind of person has a very strong and harsh internalized sense of authority and a weak sense of self, which leaves them unable to deal with their own sexual desire or aggressivity. "

Andiemus,changemyview,1389788761.0,"Ok, I'm going to change the stereotype example to one that i personally know more about, but I'm sure the logic still applies to the ""mexicans are lazy"" one.

The ""mexicans have large families"" stereotype comes from a proportionally speaking larger catholic population in mexico compared to the u.s. and catholic philosophy is largely influenced by the thinking of Thomas Aquinas and other people that eventually leads to a condemnation of birth control and a belief that marriages exist to produce families, leading to catholics having comparatively large families vs the more modestly-sized ones in the puritanical roots of the u.s.

Stereotypes come from flawed conclusions about observations and the jokes come from the stereotypes, not the other way around. Nobody's going to tell a ""Mexicans have large families"" joke until someone decides that there's some rule about mexicans having large families."

Me being a real genius I sent her an anonymous card on Valentine's Day, which actually had the desired effect of cheering her up. She thought it was from another guy she knew and thought it was really sweet of him to try to cheer her up like that. But he denied sending it. So did every other guy she asked.

Then one of our mutual friends recognized my handwriting ^(wtf?) and I'm told the girl in question broke down crying at that point. She was so upset that the only person who cared about her enough to send her something on Valentine's Day was horrible, disgusting me.

wordserious,AskReddit,1389789302.0,"One is pronunciation. From my research, after more or less the 12th year humans lose the ability to distinguish subtle nuances in vowels. This means we literally can't hear some of these differences, which means we will never be able to pronounce certain phonemes in foreign languages. For me, it's the distinction between the sounds of ""i,"" ""e,"" ""ee,"" and ""ea"" in words such as it, the, bleed, sea. After 10 years in the US, I can tell that they are supposed to be pronounced differently, but I can't really tell the difference.

Another challenge are prepositions: with practice I now know when to use on, in, of and the like. I wonder if native English speakers realize how arbitrary these are. Example: why does software run *on* computers, rather than *in* computers?

Finally, phrasal verbs. In my mind, English just lacks some verbs and had to make do with completely arbitrary creations. Why do ""look for,"" ""look after,"" and ""look up to"" have the meanings that they have? In my native language, and in other languages that I know, these are completely independent actions and verbs that have nothing to do with ""look."""

TheMeerkat,buildapc,1389789545.0,"&gt; Man, thanks for the comprehensive response!! I guess in my reading about gfx cards and stuff, I glazed over the importance of chipsets and models/build series in favor of a single measure of performance. I guess there isn't an easy one. I do not know hardware!

Heh. There's no easy way to learn it, really; the knowledge just comes from observations about performance and AMD/Intel/nVidia's model numbering being relatively consistent from generation to generation.

&gt; Motherboard. I picked that one without much particularity, and I'm not totally sure how mobos relate to other components. Is that the best place to start?

You should start with the CPU and then pick a motherboard based on whichever socket it uses (your motherboard and APU match, so you seem to have a solid grasp on that concept, but I can explain more if you'd like). GPUs are motherboard-agnostic, as long as it has a PCIe x16 slot open (most modern ones do). ASUS and Gigabyte are the ""best"" motherboard makers, and you should generally stick with them; MSI and ASRock can occasionally be the best choices depending on use needs, but their quality varies significantly more.

&gt; CPU. I did just look at clock rate and wasn't aware it was an APU, although I've heard of this. I'm willing to spend a chunk of change for good performance. Better choose a totally new one.

For limited budgets, I'd go with an AMD CPU from the FX line. Typical budget CPU recommendation right now is the FX-6300, which has six cores and runs 3.5GHz. They also have the FX-6350, which is six cores with 3.9GHz, as well as some four-core and eight-core CPUs. All of Intel's mainstream processors are four-core, though the i7s (expensive and unnecessary for your needs) have hyper-threading. Hyper-threading refers to utilization of *virtual* cores, which allows it to split more than four parallel processes between only four cores.

&gt; There are decent benefits to Windows + some applications on a physically separate, more quickly accessible memory, though, right?

SSDs make the OS and common apps (Firefox/other browser of choice, etc.) load up insanely quickly, if you're used to an HDD. I like mine, but by no means is it a necessity. They're a lot more affordable than they were when they were new tech, though, in addition to being far more reliable.

&gt; RAM. So I'm sure 8GB will do it, and I should fill both mobo slots if it has them. Guess that can stay how it is.

Close -- if the motherboard uses dual-channel memory, and most do, then you should get two DIMMs (memory modules) at minimum, no matter how many slots are supported. For 8GB, that would mean two 4GB DIMMs. You do not need to fill up every slot the motherboard has if it supports more, but it would be in multiples of two. Some motherboards, mostly server-based, use triple-channel or quadruple-channel, which means they should have multiples of three or four.

Note that dual-channel motherboards will still *work* with only one module, it just reduces efficiency. It's generally not a good idea unless you're troubleshooting, i.e. you want to see if one of the two modules is defective.

&gt; Graphics card. Now I'm lost!! Based on what you said, I'll have to spend more money on this? Am I going to have to dig through some benchmark database, or can you recommend a popular, safe bet that meets my needs?

It depends entirely on budget. As of this generation, the stock recommendations for that price/performance ""sweet spot"" are the AMD Radeon HD R9-270x and the nVidia GTX 760, but there are competent GPUs below and insanely powerful ones above for both brands. AMD was the clear and obvious winner for the last generation of GPUs, but they're both neck-and-neck this gen. I'm an AMD fangirl, though, so I'd recommend theirs just by default.

&gt; So don't buy an extra fan (I guess the case comes with one and I didn't notice)

You generally won't need *extra* fans, but all cases come with them as a necessity. *Some* air needs to be moving to keep the parts without their own dedicated heatsinks in safe temps.

&gt; the power supply I chose was popular, not too expensive, and well more than sufficient wattage.

PSUs are the most dangerous parts to skimp on, but it's a safe bet to go with something from Corsair, Antec, or SeaSonic. There are other competent choices, but look to see if one of these two sites has a review on it: Hardware Secrets, JonnyGURU. Those are the only two sites with good PSU reviews (they're a lot harder to review than other computer parts, and a lot of people don't get this and just rate ""general performance"").

&gt; I posted this once I had $700 set aside, so that's my budget (including monitor and speakers). Maybe you can give me a starting-point of a few important parts (like mobo, gfx, cpu)? Then I bet I can fill out the rest reasonably.

Your budget is a bit low (without the monitor and speakers, the budget going exclusively to hardware is only ~$550), so I would perhaps recommend something like the FX-6300 for your CPU paired with an R7-260x for your GPU. Motherboard would be something based on the AM3+ socket, and your best bet would be from ASRock, actually -- I'm not a fan of their mid-range motherboards (~$100), but they've shown much more willingness than ASUS or Gigabyte to make very low-budget mobos (~$50) that perform their job competently.

Hopefully, this was helpful, and I do apologize for taking so long to reply this time. If you'd like to make another parts list, I'll look over it for you, or I can help you one-on-one on something like Skype."

Like the prior poster, I also think their insistance on a flat organization was their most significant mistake. Occupy had such potential but they refused to let their leaders emerge and from all outward appearances, they did not want to engage the institutions which are the stewards of the policies they opposed. I was really annoyed that they allowed themselves to become a caricature movement what with the drum circles and guitarmy's. The 60's model of protest, while captivating and influential in many ways, is no longer an effective model for addressing contemporary issues. In the era of the internet, disclosure, not sit-ins, will rule the day. Another missed opportunity on the part of Occupy.   "

That's indeed something you pick up very quickly. Even if they only act as instigators, any type of person is dangerous.

It's not my line of work, it's something I get asked to do sporadically. 'Security' also only works because people know there's a whole backup team right behind any team member. The most useful stuff, I picked up from female teammembers, who are masters at de-escalation, and who are usually more than a foot shorter than patrons.

And it's not that I am intimidated by a bigger person, it's that they are more inclined to 'go for broke' when confronted by a shorter ~~person~~ man. When my colleague (giant) asks them nicely, they mumble and comply. Very few men are going to throw a haywire at a guy who could snap them in half.

ipokebrains,todayilearned,1389790027.0,"It's not about living in a fantasy world (thanks for that), it's about thinking of a future where any 10 girls or guys can pick whatever sports they like. I wasn't arguing from a sporting perspective. This was in the context of a discussion on classical music, and I provided reference to a paper dealing with STEM fields. But you raise some interesting points, and I would like to add a few of my own:

Physically, there are some clear differences in terms of distributions between men and women ('default' muscle mass being a clear one) that will make them as a group more or less likely to be 'better', but there's no need conclude women can't compete. For anything outside of professional sports, I don't see why you wouldn't have just as many women taking up wrestling as men. When we're looking at 'men' vs 'women' we have a tendency to look at stereotype differences - traits that men and women *tend* to have. Elite sport necessarily involves only those people on the very tails of these distributions: those who are extremely, abnormally good at something. There is still a difference in their outcomes, and I would then say that another interesting point is that a lot of the sporting competitions we have today were specifically designed for men to single out particularly extreme masculine traits (sports not being seen as a traditionally feminine pursuit). One could imagine sports that were designed to take advantage of women's smaller size, flexibility and the different ratio of upper to lower body strength might have different biases (and they do). 

And again, this isn't a problem. I'm not talking about making society totally gender-blind, I just don't think we need to limit people because of gender. If that's just a stupid unrealistic fantasy, then colour me stupid and unrealistic.

(your example still makes no sense, as the same holds true for men moving into 'womens' sports so this would just even out)"

joethesaint,soccer,1389790586.0,"So here's what we know so far: BBC and Sky have both been told by their sources (quite possibly the same person/people for both) that Cortese has handed in a written resignation. Neither the BBC nor Sky have expanded on that, because they know absolutely nothing more about it. They can only regurgitate a similar incident from the end of last season, in which we thought Cortese would resign but then didn't.

Meanwhile, others close to Southampton - Adam Blackmore ([@bigadamsport](https://twitter.com/bigadamsport)) and the Daily Echo ([@dailyecho](https://twitter.com/dailyecho)) - say it isn't so.

Alex Goring Crook ([@alex_crook](https://twitter.com/alex_crook)) says he hasn't resigned yet, but ""it seems inevitable that he will"". Crook is known to confuse his own uneducated opinion with actual news from time to time.

So yeah, there's likely another twist or two to come in this tale. 

**Edit:** [""Major development"" on Sky Sports News.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNJMn4eGSms) Katharina Liebherr and Cortese reportedly in a power struggle. He has apparently handed in resignation and she has apparently rejected. She wants to reduce his role at the club and increase her own. He had threatened to resign if she went through with this. Of course she doesn't want to lose Nicola, and possibly Pochettino as well, so it's a stand-off."

It should be noted that before me, she explained that it just didn't do anything for her.  So *I* took that to mean the guys before me just plain sucked!  After some talking, she allowed me to eat her pussy.  And like you, she came.  I felt like I had accomplished something but later on she would tell me how she still didn't really like it.  What?

I didn't understand it then (I was 17) but after a while it was much clearer. That would be my first and last time eating eating her pussy.  I learned that it was just something she didn't like - like anal sex for other women.  I didn't want to force her to do anything she didn't like just because I liked doing it.  It helped our relationship in the long run.

So you're not alone - but I would believe it is quite rare.  Don't be silent in your assertions.  You don't like it.  Fine.  Let your men know that and hope they respect your wishes.

She eventually told my friend what the reason was, and he relayed to me that it was due to me taking back an invite to a party I had extended to her. I didn't handle that beautifully, I freaked out because her ex would be at the party and just told her not to come, but I don't think it was enough of a blunder to cause her to break up with me.

I remember all this because after the second day of radio silence I realized I was being stonewalled. At the time, I had been sent out to the outskirts of town for work, to help upgrade the systems of a store belonging to our client. It was an extremely rough day of stressful work, demoralizing setbacks and long hours with lots of waiting. I had been at the office until 3 PM, then went out to the store and didn't get back home until I took a cab after midnight. I just really needed someone to talk to so the entire thing stung pretty bad. I think that's when I started smoking.

I finally got her on the line and she mentioned a load of other bullcrap like how I once brought pastries for her and her roomie but not for myself. She thought I only had brought them for me and her and thus had disregarded her roomie. Of course, I quickly realized these were all coverups for some other reason, probably she had just grown tired of me and didn't have the ladyballs to be truthful.

As to what might fix her? I dunno and I don't care. She used to change boys like I change boxers and probably still does that. She moved abroad a while after all that."

As soon as the storm passed, we surfaced, but there were white caps/rough seas.My ""buddy"" surfaced behind me (which i was not aware of) and took his octopus (mouthpiece) out and immediately started choking and panicked. He immediately grabbed me wrapping both arms around me from behind and knocked MY octopus out of my mouth. I was caught totally off guard, being ""attacked"" and pulled underwater. Luckily, i was a certified lifeguard and knew to execute an escape maneuver. It was difficult with all the equipment on, and a dude basically riding me piggback style with a deathgrip on me. I finally got him off me. I was so pissed off that i spun around and threw a punch (above the water) as hard as i could right at his face and, to my great surprise, knocked him out cold.

I don't know what it feels like to have dyspraxia, but I do know what it feels like to be uncomfortable in my own skin and only feel ""right"" when intoxicated.

It's just this big mess of subtle psychology and flow of information that can be quite daunting to someone who's not used to it.

But maybe you can encourage him to give it a try sometimes. I've noticed a tendency in couples where the girl does most of the planning - the guys just don't get as much breathing room for that. It's easier for them to do like your guy and just lean back, go along for the ride. If your plans usually turn out better every time there's just no reason for him to do try."

if we're talking psychologically, diagnosably narcissistic, no, I'd say INTP's seem fairly unlikely to fall into that category.

narcissism, as a mental health term, seems to imply a great deal more desire for attention and expectation for recognition and special treatment.  have i seen some threads round these parts that seem to line up with this?  sure.  are they nearly as common as the threads where people are holed up, afraid of others, and navel-gazing themselves into existential crises?  nope.

INTP's being prone to thinking about thinking probably meta-think themselves into pretty self-centric mindsets, but I don't think we inherently tend to have unrealistically high opinions of ourselves.  we tend to notice our own flaws, and we tend to find it annoying and lame that other people don't disregard them immediately like we wish they would, but I don't think too many INTP's sit in delusion about what the world owes them.

I pity the narcissist.  They live in a terribly warped world and set themselves up for a great deal of struggle.  They make those closest to them suffer out of true delusion and they bury themselves further into the delusion with each person who abandons them.  They are certainly a challenge to know personally, and I tend to want to keep narcissists at arms length for my own best interest, but to hate them is cruel."

sunshinerf,AskWomen,1389791594.0,"6 months ago my BF of 5 years decided to tear my heart out, pour acid on it and watch it burn slowly.

I think the best things I did to get over this were completely cutting him out of my life and no rebounds. I had zero communication with him and I gave myself time to get to know myself without him. 

Even though I wasn't ever in the mood I forced myself to socialize. I rekindled friendships that were hurt by my relationship with him, I met new people. I forced myself out of that funk and relied on people who love me to help me through it.

Mornings were the worst part. Waking up and realizing he is really not there anymore, I'm alone and I have to be okay with it. But with that terrible feeling every morning I kept going. I did everything to distract myself. Work as much as possible, go out, volunteer with animals, be on the phone. Anything not to think about him.

Time went by and I started to genuinely smile again. Then last week I suddenly got a text from him when I woke up, wishing me a happy new year and telling me I'll always be his sweetheart and he misses me. And for the first time since the break up I realized that I don't miss him anymore. That I am really over it and ready to move on with my life. It was the best feeling ever!

It takes time, sometimes very very long. It took me over a year to get over my first big break up. Just be patient with yourself and don't expect it to happen like magic. One day you'll wake up and not have that lump stuck down your throat and you'll be happy to be breathing without him... Good luck friend. If you need support feel free to PM me!

I drank those pretty fast, because it's always fun riding in a pickup with the windows down and your heads out the window with friends, singing your favorite songs.  

When I had drank all but one of my Smirnoff Ice, I decided that I could just refill one of the bottles with Smirnoff vodka straight from the handle, and nobody would notice the difference.  I drank that one about as fast as the others, and that's about all I remember.  

We got back in the truck at the end of the night, and drove back to my friend's house, and I had to be carried inside.  But not before I puked into the dash of the driver's month-old pickup truck...

There is no apes -&gt; humans ""missing link"" because humans did not descend from apes. Apes and humans are **BOTH** descended from a common ancestor organism. No scientist have ever claimed that humans descended from apes. That's misstatement (probably deliberately ) made by creationists.

Do you think there is a ""Fossil Librarian"" whose job it is to make sure that every species that exists gets a corpse carefully in a peat bog at just the right temperature, pressure and humidity so that every possible creature has a fossil record? 

Not only are fossils rare, they are **underground** and the only way to find them is that some human has to accidentally be digging in the same spot they are in. Otherwise they **never get found**.  Most fossils that exist will never be found. 

By the way, once you do find a fossil, you can usually find tons more by digging in the same spot.  In Alden New York there is a creek bed that has eroded its way into a shale ledge. Its full of trilobites that have been fossilized into Iron Pyrite. (Fools gold) 

My dad has hundreds of them.

tauntology,belgium,1389791642.0,"When you make something like this easier, it will be used more and for things we can't even imagine right now. It's true that they have tons of ways to track us. Should we add one more? Should we make it even easier? The easier you make it, the easier it will be to abuse. 

The Firewall was an example. When they launch a platform with a clear goal, they will almost automatically start using it for all other options as well. 

Gambling websites need a license, else they are illegal. Some people request a UK-style porn filter by default, to ""protect the children"". Certain types of political speech are deemed ""bad"". Bitcoin is seen as a major threat because it could be used for illegal transactions and speculation. Just look at the GAS-fines. There was nothing wrong with the idea but it has led to widespread abuse. Give them a hammer and everything will resemble a nail. 

Do you really care the cops drove on the E40? Perhaps not. I do. Because the government doesn't need to know these things. It gives them information about me that they can (and probably will) abuse. Remember the terrorism scare a few years ago? In the UK, people were arrested for taking pictures of public buildings. 

As for the extra tax: I gave that as an example of what they could easily do with this information. You think the rush hour tax or the kilometer tax might be a good idea. But we already have that. If you drive more, you use more fuel. There is a tax on that. The perfect system, right? This would be a way to add an extra tax to that, with exceptions for powerful lobbies like transport. Or to tax foreign cars on our territory. 

Mobility is a really important part of freedom. 

GPS locators are pretty cheap, yeah. But this would be like every car having one built in, with a direct feed to the government. 

Isn't this going on already? Yes, it is. Belgium is party to one of those NSA-treaties. Is that a good thing? No, of course not. 

I would feel safer if the government didn't have this draconian power. "

MadreVolpe,todayilearned,1389791653.0,"Well all of that is defined by gender issues. Men are supposed to be more masculine, which means more aggressive, less nurturing, and less emotional. This makes women the obvious choice when deciding who should be a primary parent. Also, men traditionally take more dangerous jobs (construction, military) as they fit into to these gender roles better than, say, a kindergarden teacher (which would be seen as emasculating). THE POINT is that men need to be taking traditionally female jobs and positions at the same rate women take traditionally male positions, the problem is society tells men that they are NOT in fact men if they don't fit into a certain role. And that's how gender issues affects men.

mintyJulips,AskWomen,1389791660.0,"I think whether or not you stay with them depends on your end goal. If you are looking for marriage or long term commitment, and you know this person isn't right, then sure, break up. However, if you're not in any particular rush to find a person you can commit to or aren't looking long term, then there's plenty of reasons to stay with someone if the relationship is making you happy and you are having fun. 

I have never looked at a relationship as wasted time unless I've spent a significant portion of my time in that relationship being unhappy. I probably would view it as wasted time if I was looking for marriage and children, which I'm not. 

I don't believe in the 'one'. I believe there are literally thousands of 'ones' for every person out there. And the definition of 'the one' can change as you change with age. "

p3ndulum,TheRedPill,1389791934.0,"What I was trying to emphasizing/highlight was your average woman's *mindset*, not put them on a pedestal.

You know how fathers will often refer to their daughters as ""princess"" or ""my little princess"", and how they (girls) like to put on frilly pink dresses and wear tiaras when they are young (heck, even when they are fully grown)?

From a peripheral perspective, we know that these girls' fathers are just trying to be cute, if not just trying to establish their (king-like) authority in a soft way, but think about how that might affect the psyche after years and years of being *treated* like you're a perfect little ""princess"" - always being spoken to in a softer tone than most boys get to hear, always being spoiled, always getting your way, always being told ""shh, don't cry - it's not your fault"", etc, while in a society that is always mindful of how girls are feeling, bending to their every (feminist indoctrinated) whims.

We're rarely ever direct, blunt or honest with girls. Like when they ask us if their jeans make their asses look fat, even when it's true we soften the blow or just flat out lie to them and just tell them whatever it is we think that they want to hear.

Think about that; *we're (society/the ""matrix"") is always just telling girls whatever it is we think they want to hear*.

And so that's how they learn to communicate with the world, by speaking in a way that both *suggests* as well as *expects* **the fulfillment of fantasy**.

To tie it back to OP's theme, when you ask a girl for advice, she can only tell you what she wants *her* fantasy to look like and what it might feel like to her. Which is why they can't differentiate between what it is they want (the fantasy) and what they are actually attracted to and turns them on (game)."

'objectiveness,' however, implies a lack of emotional favoritism in decision making, which of course, is how we thinking types do our thing.  opinions are facts about specific individuals' unique human experiences.  opinions are not well established logically consistent patterns ACROSS unique human experiences, which is what I base my decision making on.  i don't think this is a uniquely INTP thing.  i think this is what makes one a T over an F."

Then our children can live off of the interest from our retirement accounts once we're gone. I think with corporations making record profits, the only way for the little people to benefit from that is to really invest in a 401(k).

ipokebrains,todayilearned,1389792835.0,"&gt; but it seems a lot of women just cannot accept nature when it comes to the sports that measure the absolute very best.

Ok, I made that exact point in my first comment. If you just wanted to rant at 'a lot of women' you could have made a top-level comment or replied to someone else.

For firefighters, whilst most women are generally weaker than most men, if there are individual women (and there are) that pass fitness requirements, they should be allowed in.

I must confess I don't know what a special OP is.

As for business, there's no reason to believe that a) that were it not from a lot of heavily-ingrained social pressure women could never be just as capable of being leaders and b) this kind of aggressive risky trading is really good for society. Let's face it, for the whole long history of humanity it's only been since the 60s that women have had control over reproduction, allowing us to totally change the shape of our lives and to become 'just like men'. It's going to take a bit of time for a truly egalitarian worldview to develop. It starts with equal representation in academia and the workplace, it ends when there is genuinely nothing remarkable about men wearing dresses and women cracking skulls (silly examples to make my point). It may sound like a fantasy land, but I'd like to think we can get there."

Gonji89,AskReddit,1389792846.0,"It happened when we were doing training at Fort Irwin, California. At first I didn't really notice it. I was wearing my ear pro so the sound of the shot going off was muffled. Then the most intense  pain hit my entire leg and I fell backwards onto my ass. They propped me up on my assault bag and called for a medivac and all that nonsense. I just kept saying ""Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck"" and my platoon sergeant was saying ""Private, it's gonna be okay."" To which I replied ""Sarn't that's what they tell someone who's dying!!""  He tried to keep me cool until the medics showed up and loaded me into a humvee and said, ""You're going to be okay, the bullet didn't hit anything vital."" All I can remember saying before we left was leaning out the back of the humvee and yelling ""Private Joe, you owe me a new goddamn boot!""  

When we got to the FOB and they peeled off my sock it hurt so bad it's not even funny. The bullet passed through the top of my foot and lodged in the rubber of my boot between the tread and the insole. I wanted to look like a hard-ass in front of the cute female medic so I took my stitches without anesthetic. That was a bad idea. Stitches on the thick skin on the bottom of your foot don't go in easily so she had to really poke and prod.  

Afterward it was business as usual except I got a profile from doing too much forced marching. I didn't think I needed crutches because, again, I wanted to look like a hard-ass. So I walked out of the CSH on my own two feet, wincing and groaning every painful step of the way."

According to her I had died a decade or so ago. She personally knew me in my previous life. She claimed I was a man and a healer, that I worked with indigenous tribes (don't remember exact details).

Simbablk,sex,1389792965.0,"So, what I'm going to say might sound harsh but...

As a guy who is also 9"" and quite thick, I'm here to say that yes you CAN take him!  I have been with many women who proclaim they wouldn't be able to take it all and - whataya know - she took it!  I've even managed to have sex with a woman with Vaginismus!  Her pussy was VERY tight and I managed to get fully inside her - it took a while (15-20min each time) but I got in there.  

I think the biggest obstacle for most women facing a man with a huge cock is mental.  Again, might sound harsh, but the things I told the all of the virgins and the woman with Vaginismus as I went to penetrate was open your legs and take some deep breaths.  That's it.  Slowly and with deliberate forward thrusting I was able to fully penetrate.  

If you ever meet up with him again, I say the same to you.  You say you were soaking wet so that's not an issue.  Lay back, relax, spread your legs, take some deep breaths and take it.  The stretching of your pussy might feel a bit uncomfortable for a few moments but it will pass.  Let him inside you.  I can't express enough for you to relax!

1. In Pre Primary (I was around five) one day we were called to all sit in a circle for some reason. This kid was on my right and as I sat down my right hand slid gently off my right leg onto his thigh (imagine what it would feel like if a bug landed on you). I look up and he's glaring at me. When the teacher comes over he gets her attention and tries to get me in trouble under the old ""keep your hands to yourself."" I deny what he says about me hitting him. I can still remember quashing her suggestion that I might have been trying to get his attention, you know, ""Hey (name).""

2. The other incident that stands out was in Year 1. I had my pencilcase open and he just grabbed a crayon (I can still remember it was the brown one) and randomly ripped off half the label. While it doesn't sound like a big deal to most people, I was a kid who liked everything neat and orderly so this was a big thing to me.

A few weeks later he moved schools. I was very happy and I haven't heard from him since."

This is something I find fascinating and think that benefits all bodybuilders. 

Increasing your strength allows you to increase your workout volume, and as a result, will affect your potential for growth. 

i.e. a guy who can squat 315 x 20 has a greater growth potential than a guy that can only squat 225 x 20. 

Layne Norton wrote an article about this 6-7 years ago, so I'll try to find it. It gives a much better explanation than my pathetic attempt. 

Anyway, give it a read!

timthemajestic,malehairadvice,1389793214.0,"Hair grows, on average, half an inch per month. It tends to grow somewhat more quickly when it's shorter, because the overall condition is healthier.

As for shampoo, anything you can buy at Walmart/Target/etc. is not great for your hair. These types of brands are very harsh on your hair, stripping it of all its natural oils and essentially ""shocking"" your hair every time you use it. Conditioner is most definitely necessary when shampooing, because it provides humectants and emollients that essentially replace the moisture that the shampoo has taken away. Using these brands without conditioner causes your scalp to kick into overdrive each time and overproduce oil which then soon makes your hair ""oily"" and makes you want to shampoo it again. This is the cycle that the manufacturers want you in so that you'll use more of their product and ultimately have to keep buying it because you use it up so quickly.

It is most definitely more healthy and beneficial to shampoo your hair less frequently than every day. If you use professional grade product(s) in your hair, there is no reason that you can't wear that hair for up to a week without shampooing. I know this sounds crazy, because it's not what we were taught growing up, but there is nothing BUT misinformation about hair health out there among every day people. If anything (especially for men), I would suggest washing your hair every other day, and if you're going to use a store bought brand, I would suggest Head &amp; Shoulders. And for the record, you can take a shower without washing your hair. In general though, I would recommend salon quality shampoo and conditioner. There are many great men's lines out there."

I had a spare REI gift card after Christmas, and i decided to get a nice pair of boxers. When they arrived and i tried them on, it was amazing. They fit really well. They didn't stretch out at all. 

The made me realize how big i really was. I got on a scale and weighed myself. I had gained 50 lbs since high school (its only been 3 years), and i was chubby then. 

So i started. Ketogenic diet, rock climbing and spin classes. And one full semester where my gpa depends on my fitness.

OutrunOutrideOutlast,socialskills,1389793579.0,"Definitely this. While it seems counter intuitive to just start calling/talking to people when you think your conversation skills are lacking it's actually the best thing you can do. The easiest thing to do is to put on a smile and maintain good (but not creepy) amounts of confident eye contact. This creates good rapport and will help the other person relax. The same pretty much goes for phone conversations except you can't make eye contact but if you're smiling you can even heat it over the phone. 

Also, try to make your voice sound dynamic. Good speaking skills and perceived intelligence have a lot to do with just the way you sound and not so much what you actually have to say but both are still important. 

When you're talking to people try using the words ""I/me/my"" less. As bad as it sounds a persons favorite topic is themselves. So if you want to be able to talk to them and keep your ""geeky outbursts"" control talk about them, be curious about what they have to say, and relax. Practice, practice, practice"

I believe that a lot of couples fall into a rut. They just stop initiating.

It could be for any number of reasons... they just stop.

A challenge like this would take those feelings away, you know it's coming, and there's no pressure on either party... it's just going to happen and you need to force yourself to be ready for it.
I can see how that can be exciting in itself.

If you think of it as a chore, or something that you've been forced to do, it will quickly become just that.

Simbablk,sex,1389793688.0,"Couple of questions:

- Is his cock hard when you're giving him a blowjob?

- Is his cock hard when you're giving him a handjob?

My advice would be this: have him stroke his cock in front of you.  Watch how how he grips his cock and the speed at which he strokes it.  Is he gripping his cock hard or not?  Alternate between sucking his cock and having him stroke it himself.  This will give you a good indication of what is needed to make him cum.  Watch his facial expressions.  Listen to his sighs and moans (IF he's vocal).  See what feels good.  Play with his balls while he's stroking his cock.  Lightly stroke the taint (space between balls and anus) while he's stroking.  Lick the taint.  Lick his balls.  See his expressions.  

Explore this together.  He might be like many men who just don't cum from handjobs and blowjobs.  Don't be angry or feel you're useless.  That's just some men.  If he isn't getting off from handjobs or blowjobs, then when you're able, give him some pussy.  If he isn't complaining, then it isn't a problem.  Wait until you're able and willing to fuck and fuck him to get him off.  "

this is valid, but when a person describes themselves as: ""in my late 20s and am trying so hard to find ""the one"" ultimate career. I am so indecisive and deathly afraid that I will be old with no job,"" it seems likely that they might benefit from shifting their priorities a little bit.

it isn't productive or healthy to seek total personal fulfillment from any ONE aspect of a person's life.  popularly, we are reminded a relationship shouldn't be ""your everything,"" but i think this logic applies to many things from family to education to career.  our culture is so obsessed with ""finding one's passion"" professionally (which i agree is a great way to go), but in hunting for a fulfilling career it seems that many people fall into the trap of aimlessness by failing to seek fulfillment in the many other areas of their lives.

i strongly disagree with you that intelligence, motivation, and ""moderate opportunity,"" are all it takes to attain a fulfilling career for most people, mainly because these terms are all highly flexible and they rely on whether or not someone has already achieved what you deem to be success to determine if their intellect, motivation, or opportunity was ENOUGH.  

were these things all it took, every smart, motivated, moderately opportuned individual would be good to go.  risk tolerance and a sense of support from others (or at least a lack of disdain from others) play HUGE roles in determining whether or not someones intelligence, motivation, and opportunity will be ENOUGH to achieve certain ends.

the fact of the matter is it's impossible for anyone to ""have it all,"" when it comes to total fulfillment in all aspects of life.  i stand by my reminder to OP that one's career is simply ONE aspect of life we can choose to value, and if it's leaving you frightened, paralyzed, and looking for help on reddit, it could be beneficial to explore the rest of life."

OE should be a slowly increasing, proportional penalty, rather than a fixed one that sharply limits expansion. 

Basically, if I go from 10 to 20 provinces in the current system, my empire shuts down from OE, but if I go from 10 to 12 it only takes a couple of years to integrate the new territory.

The way it *should* work is that I *could* go from 10 to 20 without crippling myself, but my income will suffer in my core slightly, and the new territories will take many decades to integrate completely.

bubbish,AskMen,1389794018.0,"Hi dude, I'm sort of flabbergasted by how alike we are. I mean everything from being a career-driven son of immigrants who never divorced, to length of the longest relationship, down to the view on kids. Your summary reads like a carbon copy of mine, you just happened to be born a couple of years earlier.

So that being said I'm afraid I won't be able to give you useful advice in the form you asked for. But I can give you my own view, and I've learned that it doesn't do me much good to dwell on my future. Like most things I've experienced so far, they seem to sort of work themselves out. I guess that sooner or later you'll meet someone who you don't stop enjoying after a while but the important point is that you can't really count on that, so there's no use in worrying.

But let me ask you this. Do you feel your career is worth the dedication you're giving it? Personally I'm very material and career/result oriented and as such a big part of my identity is defined by the professional part of life. That's not to say I can't enjoy other aspects of the everyday - I have plenty of fun partying, travelling and hobbies. But it all comes back to the sense of accomplishment that accompanies a strong professional career, and everything that entails. I can't, however, help having a sneaking suspicion that I should be focusing on something else. I just have no idea what. Maybe you can devote yourself to having more meaningful relationships with your friends, family and partners? I really don't know."

I agree that America is a highly distracted culture but that's not what's preventing reform to my way of thinking. Two things are apparent to me: 1) America is incredibly politically and culturally polarized right now. This means that our attempts at policy and institutional reform are always conflicting and fall victim to a political climate that only produces gridlock and a bonfire of the vanities where our politicians are concerned. Very little is accomplished on the legislative front and the situation is so bad that we recently experienced a government shutdown as a result of that polarization. 2) Profit motive: I am no socialist but the Wall Street collapse definitely underscored that American capitalism is in dire need of reform. Our policies are definitely being revisited but when you consider the aforementioned polarization, how much reform can we reasonably expect? Couple this with the fact that Wall Street has the ability to lubricate any campaign, politician or election with untold sums of money and you now have a situation where the average American is severely outgunned (so to speak) in terms of political influence. Long story short, we are urging for reform and following outcomes closely but we are inert due to our own way of government and our ever-present cultural and political polarization.  "

tangerinelion,intj,1389794510.0,"MB tests don't work *that* great on people in HS; not old enough to have developed fully.  Also when you have an introvert, getting their primary function right isn't always obvious.  As for their secondary, again at that age it's not fully developed.  

You can't take HS relationships seriously.  Sorry, but they're not and the kind of doubting, waiting, etc., is indicative of a HS relationship to me - not Ni.  

Also, rejecting authority is an INTJ thing.  Very common for INTJs to look at superiors as peers and talk to them as such.  Or to put themselves above superiors if they deem the superior to be incompetent.

That said, intelligence and MB type are correlated but it's not clear if that's inherent or if IQ tests and MB tests have overlap.  We know, for example from Mensa, that P(IQ &gt; 145|INTJ) &gt; P(IQ &gt; 145|non-INTJ).  But that doesn't mean INTJs can't do stupid things - like drop out.

*net time \\[computer]* will show the current time of the specified computer. Add */set* to the end to set your local clock to match.

soafraidofbees,TrueReddit,1389794621.0,"[Epigenetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics) changes refer to the ""marks"" on DNA that affect which genes get expressed in different conditions. This is why, even though all of your cells contain the same DNA, some of them have the special properties of skin cells, some are brain cells, some are blood cells, etc. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression tells the blood cells to turn on blood genes and turn off brain genes, and vice-versa. Some of this process happens automatically, but there are epigenetic changes that can be affected by the environment. One cool epigenetics study showed that the amount of care a young rat receives from its mother (measuring by how much time the mom spends licking and grooming the baby rat) affects which genes get expressed in the baby as it develops. These changes in gene expression go on to affect the kind of parental behavior the baby rat will show to its own offspring when it grows up. [RadioLab did a cool piece about this!](http://www.radiolab.org/story/261176-the-great-mother-switcheroo/)

We don't know much about the epigenetic regulation of human sexuality, but it is likely to play a part in identical twins who have different sexual orientations (and may be affected by prenatal hormone exposure, since hormones can regulate gene expression)."

So you only pay the higher rate on what's over. 

Example: 

Everything under $500,000 is taxed at 10%, everything over is 20%. This is just easy numbers to work with. 

If I make $450,000 in profit, I pay $45,000 or 10%.

If I make $550,000, I don't pay $110,000 or 20%, I pay $50,000, or 10% of 500,000, plus $10,000, 20% of the remaining $50,000, for a total of $60,000. This is more than if it was 10% regardless, or $55,000, but not as hurtful to growing business as a flat 20%.

In Switzerland the majority of males will go to some sort of military school at 20 and learn how to use the guns safely, then they can decide whether they want their own state-given gun to e stored at their own house or the local armory. This obviously will massively change the number of people with firearms that aren't competent and who want to use a weapon for any other reason than military or training.

At 28G, my bust volume isn't actually that big. I am rather shapely, with a similar height and weight to Marilyn Monroe and not *quite* as small a waist, but bust and hips effectively identical and waist rather close. That means it must be easy for me to look great, because I have a great body, right? RIGHT?!

I tell them I can't buy a bra in a store. They look at me like I'm just confused. I explain that with a 26"" ribcage, I need, at the largest, a 28 band and some 28 bands are too big. And while some local brick &amp; mortar stores will order 28 bands, they always sell out before I have a chance to get to them, and, of course, they don't order a broad selection, so I can't exactly try on new bras and see how they fit. As a result, I have to order online, and often that means internationally. 

Oh, and I decided it was finally time for a new ""fun"" swimsuit (as opposed to a functional one for training &amp; SCUBA). I've been looking through suits and looking through suits. I don't like tankinis and I find I don't like the tastes of the 1-piece suits, so I end up with bikinis. I finally found one I liked well enough in the 2014 collections. Yes, I found one I liked, just one. I ordered it, full price, and mentioned this to a friend. ""Why on earth are you ordering a swimsuit in *January*?"" ""Because if I wait, there won't be any in my size."" That was last week. Yesterday, I checked, and most of the stores I shop are completely out of that style in that size. One shop I've not used before has 1 left, and another has 2 left. I couldn't (yet?) find any on ebay.

Fights don't need TRT to be exciting, some fighters might need them to keep up with competition, but that doesn't mean fights should be regulated with unnatural levels. I'd like to see an even playing field. Though that almost never happens in professional sports. Everyone's always looking for an edge.

1:1 ratios are natural. TRT should be only be used, IMO, if the ratio is dipping. But in the current state of the sport I'm not calling anyone a cheat or a fake or getting mad everytime  I hear someone is using TRT as long as it's supervised and spoken about honestly."

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1389795508.0,"yes at u/catote alludes to here: there is a difference between being into wine and being into drinking with wine as your preferred beverage.

the issue is that wine can be a hobby and drinking can be a hobby.  one is about snobbily curating a cultured aesthetic experience by engaging in comparative study of the many dimensions where wine can differ; nose, color, body, vintage, grape blend, flavor.

the other is about alcohol and enjoying its effects.

are you into wine because you find wine fun or are you into wine because it tastes good enough to get a little buzz going?

personally i don't judge you for either.  drinking is the preferred hobby of a LOT of college students who don't develop addictions.  being a casual drinker is typically considered normal adult behavior as compared to tea-toting or alcoholism.  but if you're trying to convince your friends that you've picked up wine as a hobby when you haven't, they're probably going to know this is false if you're opening a bottle of barefoot chardonnay or trader joe's merlot.  this might make them think you're hiding something more sinister than a normal interest in adult beverages."

SpazMonkeyBeck,pics,1389795560.0,"While I do agree it's easier transport wise to drive everywhere here, there is a huge issue with parking. This is made even worse by the city's plans to rebuild most of darling harbour, they have effectively shut down one of the biggest car park complexes in the CBD, the one under The convention centre when it closed a couple months ago. Add to this the fact the they will also be closing Harbourside and the Entertainment centres' car parks, both of which are used by commuters everyday, for the rebid. The parking situation is going to get even worse in the next couple years before it gets better, lord knows construction works here take twice as long as anticipated, just ask the blue mountains, min. 2 lanes Sydney to Bathurst by 2012? Please it's 2014 and they're about halfway.

Also, I know I'm jumping to a completely different argument now but the government decided to 'restructure railcorp' effectively all they really did was spend a shit ton of money on renaming the entire fleet of trains. I know it's nowhere near enough to build the Parramatta-  Carlingford- Epping or Castle Hill - Carlingford lines that they have been proposing for years, but they could have bought a new train or two, half the ones we see are old and slow and horribly noisy. They could have even diverted it to the construction of the Norwest line which they are actually building. My favourite part about that line though, is that whilst it will connect to an already existing station, it will not continue, meaning that if you get on at one of the 8 Norwest line stops you have to change at Epping (a station which is already congested at fuck) for the CBD. Why you ask? Because the Norwest train line (the one owned by transport NSW, who also own the rest of the trains) will use a different type of train.. A single level, smaller train, as opposed to the current type... It makes absolutely no sense to me! They are effectively stonewalling any kind of integration of the Norwest line for the future, what happens when Sydney become more populated and the line cannot handle the volume of people using it? Keeping in mind it's not even due for completion until 2019! Sydney is expanding very quickly and the area this line will accommodate to is already very populated, so are the areas beyond the line. It makes no sense, to me anyway, to have only one line with different trains and they're spending 1.5Billion dollars to do it.

&gt;From the late 1980s a new school of linguistic relativity scholars have examined the effects of differences in linguistic categorization on cognition, finding broad support for non-deterministic versions of the hypothesis in experimental contexts.[5][6] Some effects of linguistic relativity have been shown in several semantic domains, although they are generally weak. Currently, a balanced view of linguistic relativity is espoused by most linguists holding that language influences certain kinds of cognitive processes in non-trivial ways, but that other processes are better seen as subject to universal factors. Research is focused on exploring the ways and extent to which language influences thought.[5] The principle of linguistic relativity and the relation between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic fields from philosophy to psychology and anthropology, and it has also inspired and colored works of fiction and the invention of constructed languages."

Vomiting_Winter,magicTCG,1389795588.0,"This will continue to be a problem until WoTC takes a lesson from Netflix and finds a way to provide the consumer with a reasonably priced way to get tournament staples.  If I had the choice of paying $20 for a fake Goyf, or $40 to for a new one from WoTC, I'll buy from WoTC EVERY SINGLE TIME.  That being said, when my choices are $20 for a fake, or $150 from SCG, it's not really much of a choice when Modern season is right around the corner.

For YEARS the consumers have been BEGGING WoTC for a way to give them their money in exchange for more Legacy and Modern staples, and for whatever reason, WoTC decided to a) not accept our money and b) make us pay even more to SCG or whomever.

I certainly don't think cards should be worthless; if they were, there would be no reason to buy packs, and WoTC would go under.  HOWEVER, it's just as bad for the game when the best decks cost more than your car.  Why can't tournament staples just stay in the $15-$25 range?  I've played Legacy for years.  When I started buying my collection, Dark Confidants were $10, Polluted Deltas, Flooded Strands and Force of Wills were $20-$25, and blue duals were never over $50.  Prices were reasonable, and the game was fun; WHICH IS WHY MORE PEOPLE STARTED PLAYING IN THE FIRST PLACE.  Nobody was bitching that prices were too high, and nobody was so over-privileged that they declaired anyone without a couple extra grand to throw around shouldn't be worthy to play against them.

TD;DR
Not too glad that fakes are being made, but it's WoTC's own fault for letting prices get so high without providing a legitimate option to buy more cards.  Hopefully it's a wake-up call to them."

Vordreller,learndota2,1389795604.0,"&gt;Since it's not causing you a problem right now though, a more constructive question might be what it's actually doing for you.

I'm going mid with this venomancer and I usually either get a few kills on the various mids that switch out(because I killed them and they want someone else to come mid) or it's someone like Sniper who can farm from too far away for me and then I just focus on getting a good amount of last hits, and ganking. Which works pretty well in my current situation. In other cases where I'm doing well, people usually just leave the lane and I get an early tower. That has happened on several occasions, where the enemy escapes with only a few HP every single time and I just push them out of lane again the second they come back. Eventually they just leave and I take their outer mid down.

I've played Venomancer both as mid and lane support and I usually win as mid. As lane support, it's usually a standoff, as the enemies don't get close enough for me to harass them. Meaning no kills for my carry.

This is why I don't like doing Venomancer support. Enemies seem to be smart enough to stay away from me in lane, meaning my carry won't get fed and we'll have a bad lategame. This kinda pisses me off and I start making mistakes, meaning I overextend in lane and they get kills because of my impatience.

Solo mid however, the enemy has no choice but to get in to a certain position to farm the creeps or try and harass me. It's a lot easier to abuse this because their positions are very limited and I can just bide my time while the poison does its work and they have to rush through their tango's a lot faster than normal.

That doesn't mean I sit back all the time. If I can get a hit in and the minimap is showing all enemies accounted for, I'll try and get that hit in. But I always check the minimap before taking a risk. If there's an uncalled SS, I'm not gonna take the risk.

&gt;I guess it helps you get runes

I do pay attention to that, especially when the enemy is Pudge or another rune-dependent mid. There are times when I'll just buy wards myself if everybody else refuses to do it. Simply because I want to avoid the enemy re-stocking their bottle.

&gt;Are you getting them first just because you don't need anything else and they'd be your natural next purchase, or is there some over-riding logic?


It puts me closer to Arcane boots, which is why I do it. I prefer Arcane over Power Treads, because of the extra mana, the active on the boots and also, it's only 50 gold more and has 5 more movespeed than Power Treads.

I've never gotten a bottle on Venomancer. Ever. I just make sure not to use Gale unless I'm absolutely sure I'm going to get the enemy, because they did something really stupid, like walk right in to the river to hit creeps, with only 1/4th of their health left.


Only mid I really don't to go up against, as anyone, is Death Prophet. A good Death Prophet is insanely annoying. They just go in to the river, wait for you to attack, do a Q on you and back off. They can just start with tango/clarity or even a regen ring and some clarities and do that over and over until you're pelted down.

But that's kinda besides the point here :P"

ecclectic,Welding,1389795721.0,"&gt;As a shop assistant, your primary task is to do helper things and having a more experienced welder take the time to teach you how to weld is not making the company money. In fact, the company would be losing money.

At some point companies in North America are going to have to come to the realization that they MUST train people rather than rely on them to get for-profit training from schools or head-hunting from other companies.

Labour pools have been over-saturated and diluted because people come out of trade schools without the required training to be profitable in any case, without the drive or self discipline to actually succeed in a trade and expecting to make remuneration that is generally unrealistic for the experience they have and completely unreasonable for the effort they desire to put into the job.

Starting out in a shop, in a helper position, number one, teaches humility.  Number two, it requires a certain amount of dedication and drive to take on the responsibilities, stay after work and learn or work days and then do night schooling for welding.  It might cost the shop money, but so does having to take a recruit from school (or, to a lesser extent, a competitor) and train them to company standards.

I'm not saying it's the best option for everyone.  Some people are very quick on the uptake and they have solid experience in manual labour and are good at building things going into school, I would estimate that that accounts for a little less than 50% of the people going into schools.  Many end up in trades programs, still, because the are deemed too 'stupid' for college or university educations.

Absolutely, I 100% endorse broad spectrum training that many schools provide, but there needs to be some practical experience going along side it.  Companies crying they can't fill gaps in their workforce need to start looking at what they're really doing to fix it.  Are they trying to put body filler over the problem or are they fabricating custom patches to weld into place, grind, buff and paint as a permanent solution?

I agree with you, just with some caveats.

Its hypocritical of any Christians to try to claim that this monument of the ten commandments are not a violation of this clause. We all know better. 

(UnicornofHate: seriously, invoking Islam to try to justify this display? Also - ""western law"" comes in 2 forms, ""English common law"" and ""The Napoleonic code"".  The USA's state and federal laws, (Except for Louisianna), are based on ""English common law"" which is NOT based on the Christian Bible, but instead is based on the practices of the English tribes at a time when they were all pagans, before Christian missionaries reached the British isles. The practices were eventually formally codified when the collective English Chieftans (warlords) forced the English King John to sign and acknowledge the Magna Carta, by which time the practices that were encoded in the Magna Carta had been in place for hundreds of years. 

The hypocrisy of current Christian fundamentalism revolts me now, just as it did when I was in seminary in the 1970's.   It is dishonest, unChristian and UnAmerican. It violates the most basic spirit of both Christianity and America."

GrapefruitHangover,education,1389795815.0,"Well here is a matter that some veteran teachers may not ever have experienced: being told over and over not to do what you believe with all your heart is a true calling. Before I finally decided to take the plunge and go back to school for education, I would literally have dreams that I was teaching kids in an abandoned, post-apocalyptic warehouse. I had made it into a classroom with bookcases, mismatched tables and chairs. 

No matter how many times I thought about how terrible it would be, how I wouldn't find a job, how I'd spend another 5 years and thousands of dollars in school, I couldn't deny it. It's what I need to do. In my experience so far, I've encountered an optimistic peer for every one that puts me down. I can't help but to think that we all need to make transforming education our number one priority and show some grit here. I'm prepared for a fight as soon as I graduate. Trust me; I've never owned a pair of rose colored glasses.

Edit: Perhaps your generation's excessive warnings will yield a new generation of teachers that will weather the storm. A little optimism doesn't hurt.

**Edit 2:** While I usually don’t care about getting down voted, I can’t help but think that this perpetuates and illustrates what the article is talking about. If you’re under the assumption that I’m some happy go lucky young student, you’re wrong (if that even matters). I’m interested in having open conversations about this subject because I think it’s the most important thing in the world; however, I can’t get past the negativity. Perhaps it has shut down many teachers in the past but it’s unfair to project that to your successors. Trust me; your message is loud and clear: you have no faith in future educators, you’re exhausted, you’re sick of teaching to the test among numerous other impossibilities and there is nothing that you can do about it. Perhaps this is not exactly what you mean when you write these articles and videos, but to those who want to make a major difference in education, this is how your message is being perceived. If you’re tired of teachers being the victim, then take control. You can start by stopping the negativity. "

superior22,summonerschool,1389795831.0,"Probably. I can see how jungler will probably try to take their main attention away from top and mid lane and focus more on bot lane. Most early-to-mid game plays happening around dragon and bot lane, encouraging teams to take dragon more often. This would literally force the ADC-support duo to stay bot lane because they'd lose their tower and dragon control pretty early into the game.

When I think about it, the change is probably not only because of the lane swaps. The ADC role is widely seen as under-powered right now. With the changes now jungler could be encouraged to focus bottom more often, which would probably shift the meta a bit from hyper sustain tanks into making the ADC more important again, like he was in season 2. When all the plays are made around bottom lane, and an ADC is stacking the kills, assists and dragons he'd get fed really fast.

This is just theorycrafting though. But lets be honest, with a weaker bottom turret there will be more plays, including the jungle, at bottom lane. Anyway, we haven't really tested the changes yet and will have to see how things pan out."

We team fought (dat Tibbers stun doe), burnt through everyone but the Annie, pushed mid tower and inhib and then got to the Nexus towers, Tibbs was back up for a stun/tank combo and we won.  50 minute game, but with one good push and everyone focusing the ADC and avoiding Annie (who was fed as fuck) let us push what we wanted and win.

R flipped out and started yelling at M through the bathroom door asking her who she went to Oliver Garden with.  M told R that she was pooping and to go away.  R continued to scream and yell and ask what guy M went on a date with about five minutes later M finally responded “My mother, I’m dating my mother.”   Then R asked if the leftovers had meat in them.

Put your chin above the bar and slowly, under control (in other words, try to use the same speed the whole way through) lower yourself until your arms are extended (2-4 seconds per rep).  Do 5x5.  Do it every day if possible, every other day if you feel sore or it is too much intensity right now.  At the start of each day, attempt to do one chin-up.  Just one. If you succeed, then tomorrow try two.  For each chin-up you can do, eliminate a set of negatives.  By the end, you will do one set of 5 real, good form chin-ups.

Also, if negatives get boring, get a chair or stool.  Put your feet on it and bend your knees and ""swing"" on the bar until your arms are extended but your feet aren't below you, they are behind you on the stool/chair.  This will shave body weight off of the movement.  Lift up with your arms, try to relax your legs (don't help yourself).  Again, 5x5 of these.  Try to do one real chin-up first.  If you can, do two tomorrow.  Eliminate a set of these per real chin-up accomplished.

Don't become defeated if you can do a real chin-up this time, but can't next.  It happens.  KEEP GOING, just do another set of negatives.  This WILL HAPPEN.

About the water temp:
Diesels of all types take extra time to warm up, just the nature of the beast. They want to be worked hard IMO. Idling in your driveway simply won't do it. In fact, I've seen diesels LOSE coolant temp while idling in the winter time. 

For your car, you're doing the smart thing by being nice to it waiting for the heat to build. To speed that up you could try restricting air flow to the radiator. At the very least, once the coolant gauge registers some temperature (the bottom of the gauge usually starts around 100*F in many cars) you're safe to feed it extra throttle. This means the engine oil isn't as thick and heavy anymore and is doing its job, which is the most important fluid in the car. Keep the rev's up by using a lower gear too and don't be afraid to use the turbo boost. I do the same in my 1.8t/manual A4. That should help keep you warm :)

As far as longevity:
There are a lot more emissions control on newer diesels, baring any issues with that stuff I see no reason the newer generations won't last as long as the last ones. Like anything else, take care of it and it'll take care of you. Enjoy!"

Likewise, a single European country of eg. 1/500 of the world population doesn't have much influence there either, except by cooperation. Go try negotiating with China as a single country. They have dozens of city mayors who decide over more people. Who's going to count for more?

&gt;The whole continent is sinking in tyranny in order to 'save' the euro, and the peoples' suffering fall on an implacable disdain. 

I don't know why you replied that to what you quoted, because it's totally irrelevant. You just fall back on repeating your basic POV: austerity is bad therefore the EU is bad.

You're doing yourself a disservice that way. Now you can just gather support amongst people who are both anti-EU and anti-austerity. If you limited yourself to being anti-austerity you could get much more done.

&gt;And the EU and/or the euro.

I just gave you the example of Belgium, still solidly within the Euro, going easy on the austerity sauce and weathering the crisis quite nicely, thank you. Now that you mention it, Iceland was hit by the crisis despite being outside the Eu(ro), so you can stop blaming the banking crisis on the Euro as well.

&gt;The situation of the countries I mentioned may not be perfect but it's fine compared to the eurozone. It shows being outside of it is not only viable but even preferable. Sweden weathered the crisis much better having kept its monetary sovereignty. 

Sweden weathered the crisis because of its social policies.

&gt;EU memberstates have accepted constraints that other countries do not embarass themselves with (free movement restriction forbiddance for instance). 

Please, don't embarrass yourself. The EU has done more for free movement than any country. One of the main arguments of anti-EU crowds is sovereignity so they can have border controls.

&gt;When the Chinese wanted to buy wind turbines in the US, Obama refused. When the French wanted to protect a strategic steel factory from being bought by an Indial mogul, the EU commissioner for competition intervened to make sure it would be sold. What power to the French voters have over that commissioner?

You're again confusinga disagreement with EU policy with disagreement with the existence of the EU. Let me give a counterexample: has any government ever anywhere dared to fine a giant like Microsoft? If a single country would do that, they would just laugh in its face. And yet the EU did it.

Dookiet,AskMen,1389796228.0,"I going to suggest some possibly unpopular things, but first a piece of advice (kinda). If you plan on staying in the same place while taking trips buy a condo, no to low maintenance , it will lower your tax burden, and save you money over renting a place long term. What I wanted to say was, if you happy enjoy it, but don't count anything out. My wife was convinced at 21 that she would be a successful doctor in a major city possibly married but with no kids. Now over 10 years later we live in a town of 50,000 and have two boys. She is a successful doctor, but her attitudes on other things changed as did mine. Meeting the right person often means you wan to change for them. My wife has always been less of a kid person than me and we make it work. I take care of the boys she works, it's easy to say what you want and don't want, but my suggestion is that's only temporary. The person you are is not the person you were 10 years ago and both of those are totally different from who you will be in 10 years. Get what you want out of life, but don't be afraid to change you mind at any time. 

TLDR: be who you are now, but understand what happens in life may change your attitude on anything."

My personal experience with this has been that, as my family becomes more affluent, we start seeing ourselves and other people in a very different light. For instance, sitting in first class sipping my drink while the coach passengers board and fight for overhead bin space and argue if seats should be reclined or not, it's very hard not to feel a bit beyond such rabble... I know in my mind that all those people are people just like me, but my brain comes up with justifications for the different conditions seemingly automatically. Why should my 7 year old have all this space that he doesn't need while a grandmother obviously struggles to walk down to the back of the plane and will have to endure the next 4 hours crumpled in not enough space? Because my wife and I worked hard enough and we like to have our child with us? I know in my heart of hearts that it's not fair, but it's easy to get used to it.

Note that I am very far from ultra-wealthy, but if this small difference, first class, can have this effect, imagine owning your own plane...

DERangEdKiller,AskReddit,1389796622.0,"**First semester: The People Pool**

We were about a month into the first semester of my Freshmen year when I started to really dial the place in.  I learned that not only was my older brother well known to be crazy, but he created a dynasty of crime from drugs, to female exploitation, to gambling.  My first taste of my future inheritance came in my math class.  

It was a pretty easy class, but our teacher, we'll call her Mrs. Lightyear, had a pretty interesting tick.  She would often start, and end most sentences, and seek an answer from the class by reffering to us as ""people"".

EX: ""People, People, People.  I clearly explained, the other day, the concept, and process needed to  solve this equation.  So what then is so complicated about the process, that none of you could get it right on the quiz people?""  

She said it a lot, and her classes always laughed about it.  My older brother the year prior had taken one of her classes and came up with the idea to start a money pool. It worked so well that he passed the concept to me, and this was the day I was going to start it.

Now the class had about 35 students in it, so I enlisted the help of two friends to start approaching our classmates during the earlier class.  The deal was 5 bucks in, house takes 10% winner takes 90.  It was a small pot, but for a freshman it felt like a lot more.  We'd hang out at our table in the cafeteria and as people wandered over and sat down, money would make its way down to me, and the couple people who hung around provided independent numbers to the gamblers so everyone who played could know how big the pot was, and I had more eyes making sure no one was going to flip.  

Usually there were 15-20 players, and by the end of the week, I could reinvest.  Anyways, the pool would start, and after a week you could count on a few things happening in class.

- Mrs. Lightyear would say ""people"" a lot 

- The players would ask a lot of stupid, or repetitive questions

- In the last 15 minutes the some people would look like they were about to explode while others looked like their father's died

- I get my 10%

- and we asked so many stupid questions to get another ""people"" before the bell that Mrs. Lightyear thought we belonged in the special education class.

That was the only time I ever looked forward to math class.


The only reason this worked is because a lot of the kids in my class either were friends, or they knew who my family was, and although I was the kindest, any and all malicious action towards me, whether I knew it or not, would be met with instant fury.  I was well protected, and no one said a word.

Another?"

trennerdios,AskReddit,1389796649.0,"I totally 100% agree with you. My parents raised me as if I was them. Unfortunately, I am almost nothing like either of them, so their tactics mostly failed. A lot of it was because they couldn't relate to me, or didn't try to. And my mom would wonder why I would never tell her anything that was going on in my life. Things got better after I moved out, and my relationship with them is very good now. There's still resentment, but I don't let it affect my relationship with them, and there's no point in telling them what I think about their old parenting tactics.


I don't know how I would've handled the situation different than them, but I'm pretty sure I will find out. My son is only 2 1/2 years old, but it's quickly come apparent that he's pretty much a little copy of me.

Amonette2012,facepalm,1389796913.0,"Well I think one could argue that the dude with the white beard might have been more likely to use a huge, self perpetuating life creating system (i.e. evolution) rather than making everything from scratch out of cosmic putty. I don't think it was created in the way hardcore creationists cling to either, there's waaaay too much evidence for evolution, we can watch it happening for goodness' sake. 

I've actually sat down with someone who considers themselves a hardcore creation scientist but genuinely wanted to know more about evolution, and it was one of the most difficult conversations I've ever had. He didn't have the slightest understanding of what natural selection was, and because he was constantly interjecting typical creationist questions, it took all night to explain. He was a little blown away by the simplicity of it, and the time it takes to happen. I'm not sure he believed me, but at least I managed to answer some of his questions. Creationism is a cult-like doctrine - followers are taught arguments that seem to make sense to them, but they sound idiotic because they don't take the time to actually study the thing they're refusing to believe. It's all very frustrating, like having an argument with someone who insists that the sky is green."

While I suggest seeing a professional first and foremost, what has helped me to be more creative is to find small projects which don't require much creativity - and then pure and simple pride rears its head and I find myself making that creative effort and being happier as a result (whether that's baking cupcakes or building a car, whatever floats your boat)."

enlightened-giraffe,photography,1389797039.0,"Superzooms always have to make bigger compromises, whether it be in sharpness, CA or distortion. While Sigma does make some great (even amazing) lenses in their more prosumer-oriented lines, their cheap(ish) lenses have had some pretty worrying inconsistency from unit to another, and a super zoom can only be done right with very tough quality control, there's a lot to go wrong.

You can check out dpreview graphs in comparative mode [here](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/lens-widget-fullscreen?compare=true&amp;lensId=sigma_18-250_3p5-6p3_os_m&amp;cameraId=canon_eos7d&amp;version=0&amp;fl=18&amp;av=3.5&amp;view=mtf-ca&amp;lensId2=canon_18-135_3p5-5p6_is_stm&amp;cameraId2=canon_eos7d&amp;version2=0&amp;fl2=18&amp;av2=4) and see for yourself how the 18-250 and 18-135 compare, go through the whole zoom and aperture range. Aside from the *strange* fact that the Sigma at 18mm seems to be sharper in the center wide open than stopped down, the Canon is a more consistent lens, while not great at least you don't get the dismal corner performance of the Sigma. Also, the Sigma goes from moderate barrel distortion at 18mm to pretty strong pincushion at 28mm, I can tolerate some distortion, but something like this would be pretty noticeable in a usual series of shots.

I suggest you put in the other lenses you were thinking about in the comparison page, neither the Sigma or Canon 18-200 are very good (for Sigma the 18-250 is better than the 18-200 due to newer design).

If you don't really need zoom capability over 135 i would still recommend the Canon 18-135, it costs a fair bit more, but that's the one i would buy. If you get interested in longer focal lengths you'll be much better off with a Canon 70-300 IS as a secondary and you'll have a nice overlap"

The sword's blade was broken, its magic powers expended and it's wielder was no longer able. The hero reached down and felt the hole with his hand. The famed mithril armor he had worn was killing him, the result of the fight he had fought. The mangled chestplate had been broken in and he knew he had moments before he succumbed.

Forgiveness couldn't be allowed, but I have empathized with you for some time. In the course of my quest to stop you I have learned much about you. Knowing the reasons and history behind you and your actions has given me an understanding and respect. Had it not been for you these last three years of my life would have been different and lifeless in comparison. It was you who inspired me and you who gave me the chances and ways of finding redemption, enlightenment, and love. You were responsible for me becoming great and for that I thank you. You were a villain seeking good ends through terrible, yet logical means. You were greater than I could ever be. With and audience of one, I can't help but grieve that all I have learned, all the deeper matters behind you and me will mainly be forgotten. You should know that this audience of one will never forget. I can only pray that I meet you in the next life, for I would like that very much. My time here is drawing to a close, and while I would have liked more time, I see no fault with the way things are ending. I now can only ask if you can forgive me.

Why aren't you instead changing your lifestyle FOREVER? 

Of course if you are dieting and then stop after a period of time and go back to old habits you'll gain weight back, you aren't the only one. 

When you plateau keep going, maybe increase your exercise, change your diet again to fewer calories, or something of the like. 

If your doctor has ruled out medical reasons why you cannot lose weight then you certainly CAN lose weight.  

**If you are depressed /r/depression, if you are beyond that /r/suicidewatch, but perhaps you should see your doctor about this issue, these feelings.**
 

Lastly go ahead and give up on weight loss but imo you shouldn't give up on being healthy. Eat healthy and if you lose weight then you do and if you don't at least you are taking care of your body the best way you can. 

Though I'm not going to tell you how to live your life. I'm of the opinion that all of us have one life to live, this is it, there are no second chances and when we are gone we are simply gone. So you should live your life how it makes you happiest (though not at the expenses of others and within reason). So if not worrying about your weight makes you happiest then stop worrying about it and stop carrying what society thinks."

Now, either you have the old style ramdisk (like back in the DOS days) where it's 100% volatile and you don't store anything on it, but you can use it as a (super-fast) scratch space.  Or you have the newer style software which stores the ramdisk's contents onto your disk upon shutdown and reads it back upon startup.  Which makes startup and shutdown slower, particularly since you would only use the ramdisk if you don't have an SSD; a ramdisk may have speeds 10x faster than an SSD, but in real world usage the SSD is a better option.

letsgocrazy,todayilearned,1389797287.0,"&gt; It seems like you're arguing that unions represent the individual, but they don't. They are a collective, and look out for their own interests exactly like company does. 

I don't really know why you're making the distinction. It's collective bargaining. A union is a collection of individuals aka a ""union"".

The purpose of the union is that the members all have similar needs - so by representing those needs, the union is also representing individuals.

Unions don't have their own needs as if they were some kind of chimera - it's not like unions need sacrifices of goat souls to keep them alive.

They need fees to function in much the same way any organisation does.

A private company is working for the benefit of the whole company, and in turn individuals who work for that company benefit from that.

My point is that peple seem to have no problem with human beings forming a company for commercial reasons - or companies forming partnerships to maximise profits; but they have a problem wioth human beings former partnerships to represent their labour.

&gt; Companies are bad for using their collective power for their own benefit but unions are good for doing the same thing...

I don't think companies are bad for using collective bargaining (economies of scale etc.) unless it's a monopoly. Likewise, I don't think unions are bad for doing the same. It's only natural.

Commercial companies, however, often feel they have a vested interest in stopping unions from doing what they do - hence the sheer amount of anti union propaganda in the US.

Also I concede that unions may have also over stepped their mark - but so have companies. It's a problem with humans, not unions."

panjandrumm,rpg,1389797438.0,"I spent a while one day with my GF talking about ways to make the magic in D&amp;D more realistic.  Her problem was that it wasn't realistic in any way.  I mean, when you memorize a spell, why can't you just keep casting it?  It *really* vanishes from your mind when you do?  And when you cast a spell, you just point at a spot and whooosh there's a huge ball of fire there, with like no effort on your part?

What we came up with doesn't answer your questions directly, but I thought was appropriate for this thread anyway.

We decided that casting a spell needs to have more immediate consequences.  The most realistic and simple would be that it takes a significant amount of physical energy to cast a spell.  Thus, magical exhaustion:

Every spell you cast gives you a number of exhaustion counters equal to the level of the spell cast.  Each turn you don't cast a spell (not including from wands, staves, or scrolls), you lose a number of counters equal to your level (adjustable for how difficult you want magic to be).  After each spell cast, you have to take a Fortitude save.  If you fail, you are dazed for a round once the spell goes off.  Perhaps you are also thrown back knocked down, so you have to waste a subsequent turn standing back up.  A new feat can allow you to take a will save once per day before you cast a spell to cast the spell without gaining exhaustion counters and without having to take a fortitude save after that casting.  This feat represents dedicating a significant amount of focus and adrenaline to getting a spell to work in a pinch.

The difficulty of casting can be scaled by changing the Fort save DC or by making there be more consequences for failing it.  I like this system we came up with because it's pretty simple considering how much more depth it can add, and only builds on the rules without changing the spell-level structure or anything (which is also pretty unrealistic and video-gamey).

The consequences of this rule would be that a caster can't just cast spells willy-nilly all day without considering whether or not it was the right spell to cast, especially if it is a higher level one, because they might not be able to cast anything next round, and might even not be able to dodge enemy attacks. (EDIT: Also, because you can't just cast fireball or magic missile all the time, non-damaging but otherwise crippling spells might be more useful in combat, and since you have plenty of time to wait out of combat, a wizard might find himself more useful doing non-combat spellwork, minimizing the risks he has to take in combat.)

Since you're looking for unpredictability in spellcasting, you could rename the exhaustion counters as ""chaos"" counters or something, so the more you cast spells, the more you're introducing chaos into the fabric of reality, and if you do it too much and can't withstand the effort, everything backfires.  Similarly, you could make it a Will-save and make it related to the Lovecraftian forces you mention, and failing makes you confused as the ""Confusion"" spell for the rest of combat or something.

In terms of creating spells, the only thing I can think of is to have your players come up with their own spells and submit them to you, then you assign them spell levels or something.  In my mind, if you get rid of the spell level structure, you're no longer using D&amp;D spellcasting (though that's not necessarily a bad thing)."

What really gets me is the people who insist that the earth was created by god, but by some means OTHER than the one we have all the evidence for. Seriously though, I tend to just use this line to shut creationists up. 

Also I think this idea could be very useful - think about it. If we could take all the people who make comments like the ones we're criticizing and get them to accept it, we'd possibly reduce the amount of religious pestering in science and education.

At the end of the day you're not going to mass convert people away from religion towards atheism - it's just not going to happen. But interjecting the idea that evolution was started by God might cause some shifting of opinions. The basic problem is that if you have churches going 'evolution is a lie created by the devil to hide the truth', you end up with people as ignorant as the ones in this facebook post. Now if we can swing those guys over to 'God created the world using science', maybe it will relax attitudes towards scientific education and advancement. A small idea can cause a great change. "

I was still a functioning good natured person....I just had right wing crazy bat shit conservative parents. I spent 2 years total in treatment over a 3 year battle with my parents against my will....here's what your in for. 

Detox is not that bad. Most of the people inside that are really bad and are coming off lots of heavy shit stay in bed. From my experience your next 7 days will consist of chain smoking cigarettes like you belong in the cast of Mad Men, gallons upon gallons of shit instant coffee will consumed, ping pong and board games will kill your time. You will moat likely go to lots of NA/AA meetings as well they were not my thing but be respectful or one of there diehard cult like members will shit on your soul. At my detox lunch time was like an 80s high school cafeteria. There will ve cliques....boomers, speakers, thug life's, middle age rockers, desperate housewives etc. Try to sit with the younger age ""what the fuck am I doing here crowd"" you'll fit right in. All and all just take it one day at a time. And take whatever good you can from it. 

   I met my girlfriend at rehab detox she was just a fun party girl who got sent there just like me....we have been together for 2 years straight and its the best relationship ever. We know everything about each other and we easily know how to deal with whatever emotional issues we have together. Going through the whole ordeal was tough but you might just find some light at the end of the tunnel."

anatomizethat,TwoXChromosomes,1389797594.0,"I went through this with an ex. I figured it out because the screen on my phone was open to a text I had sent to a (concerned male) friend 7 hours earlier. I also figured out (during a two day cooling off period) that he had read my journal. No one in my life had done that, and I used to leave the thing sitting on my kitchen table. So that really messed me up.

It sucks on both sides. I shouldn't have turned to someone else, but he shouldn't have gone through my phone. I told him so. I told him that we weren't married, or even engaged. I pay for the phone, it is my property, he has no right to go through it. Had he agreed with me, we could have moved on.

But he didn't. He legitimately thought it was his RIGHT to go through my phone if something felt ""off"" (his words). That (and a few other things) are why he's an ex.

**Bottom line is,** it's a breach of trust for both of you. I agree with [/u/Joywalking](http://www.reddit.com/user/Joywalking) though - we all talk shit sometimes. You need to have a conversation with him about this. It's probably a good idea to set some hard limits - you won't go through his phone, he has to agree to talk to YOU about things, not ex girlfriends. You've been together 3 years, this is a ""first time offense""...trust can be mended.

And for the record, I still feel incredibly awkward about handling electronic devices that don't belong to me. One day I was using my current bf's phone to look something up google (I know his password, he knows mine, clearly we're not worried about each other stealing one another's phones) and it still felt like creeping. So...yeah...best to ditch that behavior before it becomes a habit."

Oh no, I understand that. 

But in response to what you originally said (""If they acknowledge that a mens' studies course is needed or fair, or that there should be no women's studies course, but rather an egalitarian ""gender studies"" course that didn't focus on male privilege), I thought it was worth pointing out that *this specific* university does not seem offer a course strictly on women's studies. In fact, it has several courses that focus on gender in general and they seem to lean towards egalitarianism (though not knowing the full material covered or backgrounds of the professors, I could be one billion percent wrong). 

[This course](http://programs.unisa.edu.au/public/pcms/course.aspx?pageid=100798), for example, supposedly addresses the boys' issue in education and isn't that what many MR supporters ask for? 

(And maybe this means jack shit, but as a BPer and feminist, I'd be interested in taking a course that focuses on male issues. So there's that.)"

Whereas in the other situation, it's your daughter and the mother of your grandchildren. This means you've raised here through at least sixteen years of life, most likely significantly more than that. That's a lot of time invested. That's a very significant portion of one's life.

Suddenly Betty White is a pretty cool kitten that has a Internet-ready sense of humor, rather than just an old lady who still gets some acting work. She also went with it, embracing her new reputation as a bit nasty/foulmouthed rather than just taking little-old-lady roles. "

ibbity,relationship_advice,1389797877.0,"Kind of curious what the reaction would be if someone posted an ask like ""My boyfriend has a female 'best friend' who's into him and he knows it, they even dated for a while, and I'm pretty sure she wants him back or at least to come first in his life and is seeking to be more involved with him and to intervene herself in any relationship problems we have."" 

Sure, it sucks when a friend starts dating and doesn't have as much time for you anymore. We all get that. But you don't come off as ""friend who wants to see their buddy a little more often"" as you do ""girl who's jealous that her crush is dating someone else and is secretly hoping to maintain her place as #1 in his life.""

 If you *really* aren't interested in anything but platonic friendship with this guy (and truthfully, I find it hard to believe given the things you've said), then your first step should be to talk to the girlfriend and get to know her and show her that you are in no way setting yourself up as her rival. Then you accept that you are now the second-tier girl in his life and that his girlfriend has the right to feel uneasy about him being too intimate with you, and let HIM be the one to set the boundaries. Also, try to find yourself someone else to take his place as your closest confidante. "

It got so bad with me, that I didn't believe in my own thoughts/ideas anymore and relied on him to tell me how to feel, think, and make decisions. 

Often, I'd recount a conversation we'd have and he'd tell me I had it all wrong, and tell me what it was I'd ""said"" even when his recollection was completely contrary to mine. But it happened so often, I started thinking maybe I had something wrong with me, mentally, that was causing me to forget events or mis-remember them.

And then of course, there was just the simple manipulating comments of ""how could you possibly think that's a good idea?"" or ""how does it even occur to you to think that way?"" etc. I really did think I was stupid and had faulty logic. I believed him, because I respected him and wanted his approval. Pffsshh.

ilickthings,AskReddit,1389797904.0,"&gt; I would think that a substantial portion of viewers turn off the game after halftime because of work the next morning. 

Not completely true. Unsure about 2013, but in 2012 the viewership of the superbowl peaked [in the 4th Quarter.](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/football/nfl/02/06/tvratings.record/)

&gt; Another thing I have noticed is an above average number of work call outs on the Monday following the superbowl (likely due to lack of sleep, hangover, etc).

The NFL and TV stations don't give a shit about that.

&gt; Lastly, wouldn't moving Superbowl Sunday be great for bars/restaraunts?

No. Since they most likely already get a good customer count on Saturday, why would they want to blend that with the traffic they would get from Superbowl Sunday? Putting the game on Saturday would negate the good traffic they would normally get on Saturday.

&gt; aside from perhaps tradition?

That's mainly it. Most football is played on Sunday, that's how it's been for a long time. Companies have come to expect sick calls the next day, and businesses make more money by staying open later and showing the game on TV's.

Here's the breakdown for the options I've sent my fiance.  This is probably TMI, but I already did the math and figured it might help someone who's trying to decide what kind of linens to rent or buy:

**Tables:**

Option 1:  White cloths + colored overlay = $201+ shipping (plus $40ish for other tables like cake, gifts, etc)
Royal Blue overlays = $4.19 each (x12)
http://www.tableclothsfactory.com/Satin-Overlay-60-Royal-Blue-p/c07a_lay60_stn_roy.htm
White 120"" table cloth = $10.49 (x12)

Table runner (for head table) = $2.49 (x1)

White 60""x120"" (for head table) = $7.08 (x1)
http://www.tableclothsfactory.com/White-Tablecloth-60x102-p/wall_tab_60102_wht.htm

plus X white 60""x120"" white cloths for the gift table, cake table, etc.  ($7.08 each)


Option 2:  Colored table cloths (no overlays needed) = $166.56 + shipping (plus $40ish for extra tables)
Royal Blue 120"" table cloths = $11.99 (x12)
http://www.tableclothsfactory.com/Royal-Blue-120-Round-Tablecloth-p/d18a_tab_120_roy.htm
Royal Blue 60""x120"" (for head table) = $9.99 (x1)

**Chairs:**

Option 1:  Covers + sash = $278.20 + shipping
White chair cover = $1.99 (x100)
http://www.tableclothsfactory.com/Folding-Chair-Cover-Flat-p/wall_chair_flat_wht.htm
Sashes = $0.58 (x100)
http://www.tableclothsfactory.com/Satin-Royal-Chair-Sash-p/b15b_sash_ss_roy.htm

Option 2:  Covers with sashes built in = $255.34 + shipping
Covers with sashes built in  = $235.88 (for 100)
http://www.smartyhadaparty.com/White-Olfin-Folding-Chair-Covers-w-Sash-i6407.aspx

Total choices:

Overlays w/chair sashes = $520+shipping
Overlays w/o chair sashes = $496+shipping
Colored cloth w/chair sashes = $485+shipping
Colored cloth w/o chair sashes = $462 + shipping

Total spread from most expensive to least expensive is $58 difference.

Pros and cons:
+  We can resell
+  Don't have to worry about stains or deadlines
-  We'd have to do all the work ourselves to lay iron them and also lay them out
-  We can't be sure of the quality until we purchase them
-  Does not include cloth napkins ($850 quote includes cloth napkins for all guests)"

Griemak,Fitness,1389797923.0,"Stiff Leg Deadlift with dumbbells to work hams, core and lower back.  Romanian Deadlift with dumbbells to work hams and core.  Deadlifts with dumbbells are not true ""deadlifts"", the motion does not stop on the floor.  Romanians are usually touch and go a few inches off the floor, while stiff leg goes as far as the hamstring will stretch.  Add direct core work (side planks, weighted oblique crunches, dragon flags, russian twists, windshield wipers, etc) to round out the missing deadlift.

Deadlifts with dumbbells can be challenging as you will instinctively ""arm pull"".  Just keep your elbows flat, don't lock them, don't flex them.  Pull the dumbbell up your leg.  Each dumbbell will ""fit"" around your leg.  Keep them tucked as close to your leg as possible on the way up and down, this will also help to keep your arms out of the movement.

Using dumbbells on deadlift is a great way to practice form.  If your head, back, and butt are forming the true deadlift straight line, it will not be possible to swing your arms in a way that will help you pull the weight up and you will smack your shins or genitals with the dumbbell.  Good form stops this from occurring."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1389798116.0,"You are *not* an asshole! I can guarantee you *most* people, if not all, would not be okay with their SO contacting the person they broke up with you for, multiple times. You're allowed to have boundaries, the key is to have a balance. If you weren't okay with her having an male friends that would be a problem. However, she dumped you twice for this guy, and she's doing it again. She's proven that won't even bother to control herself with him. In fact, the only way someone should ever stay in a situation you were in is if they person agreed to cut off all contact (and didn't lie about it).

She knows what happened before, and clearly talking to him is more important to her than avoiding a repeat of breaking up with you. She likes the attention she gets from both of you. I'm sure the thrill of it all is better than being in an actual relationship. You're wasting your time with her. Do you really want to be dealing with this a year from now? You tried trusting her and she's just thrown that to the ground and stomped on all of that. Trust is earned, not given. If she doesn't want you to be paranoid, she shouldn't give you the biggest fucking reason ever to be paranoid. It's like punching someone in the stomach and getting upset that they're mad and in pain. 

She's self centered and clearly doesn't care about your feelings. Move on. The longer you stay in this relationship the more invested you're going to become and the harder it will be to leave. It will hurt so much worse what she's doing. 

She's manipulative and gas-lighting. No one here is going to tell you that you're being an asshole or paranoid. Yeah, you're being untrusting... but if you weren't there would be serious problems. She screwed you over badly. She doesn't just get to wipe the slate clean every time she comes back and apologizes. She doesn't deserve to be trusted. She's trying to make you feel bad so then you just accept whatever sorry ass treatment she gives you. 

Respect yourself and dump this girl. "

Theungry,Patriots,1389798241.0,"Not mentioned is the fact that the Patriots had at the time still expected to run a 2 TE offense most of the season with Hernandez and Gronk on the field, and that Welker didn't have the skillset to play X or Z every down, so he was becoming a situational player in the Pats system once Gronk was healthy...

Obviously that didn't work out as planned, but even then it doesn't seem like they lost anything by dropping Welker.  Edelman has picked up the slack as the high volume receiver better than Wes probably would have this year seeing as how Edelman is actually much more versatile.  

If anything, they gained in terms of developing three rookie receivers that probably wouldn't have seen many throws if Welker was in the offense.  Brady would probably have just leaned on Welker and not taken nearly as many risks throwing to the rooks, and therefore not given them as much opportunity to learn from their mistakes.  The ""sink or swim"" experience those three went through this year is going to pay huge dividends for the team over the next four years."

Anileda,femalefashionadvice,1389798302.0,"I'm torn about this. There's something nice to be said for walking into say Lane Bryant or Torrid and knowing that, in theory, the clothes there will actually fit you, as opposed to I dunno, BR or Gap because you don't stand a chance.

That said, most of these 'specialty' shops, especially for plus size, are shit. Lane Bryant's prices are ridiculous for their horrid quality, and that seems to be the standard. I understand more fabric = more cost, but I don't understand $60 for a simple blouse when it's so sheer I can see the hanger it's on. 

I appreciate the CONCEPT. In theory, a specialized shop would be just that--a shop focused on, say, women with long legs, or whatever fruit you are, etc. But in practice...I think it would just exacerbate the problems the fashion industry already has. 

As /u/lillakatt explains, sizing is not standard and stores more or less already do this. Already we have the problem of, ""Man, I really wish I could wear Ann Taylor but they just do not appreciate my hips."" Or whatever. Now it would be, ""Man I wish I had hips so I could shop at Ann Taylor's Pear Shop.""

Generally you are concentrating so hard on not fucking it up and you are so nervous about looking like an idiot in front of the person who is supervising you (and the patient), that the last thing on your mind is the size of the penis. That look of interest on her face probably had nothing to do with the size of your dick. She was interested because she was learning a new skill. And you need to grasp the head of the penis and hold it straight up regardless of the size or shape of the penis. You do that to straighten out the urethra so that the catheter slides in easily. Otherwise you meet resistance.

I have seen so many genitals over the years, and the only ones that ever make me do a double take are the ones where something is clearly medically wrong. Like...if it is covered in sores, or blood is pouring out of it, or the testicles have swelled to the size of grapefruits, or there is a giant tumour on it, or you literally cannot find the urethra no matter how hard you look.

It is desiring to change the views that are instilled in a society that have been present for years and years to come. No solution is perfect.

As others pointed out, a child is much more of a commitment and responsibility than a marriage is, and you can't just cut and run from your kid 5 months in when you realize shit-filled diapers and constant screaming at 5am are actually not very cool at all (and imagine doing this without a partner to have your back).

You can get the benefits of a relationship without the commitment (by cycling through women and moving on once it gets to the point where you can no longer run on the fumes of the honeymoon phase), but you cannot get the benefits of fatherhood without the commitment. Take a good hard look at what you want out of life, and really look into what investments are required to get it.

TowerOfGoats,asoiaf,1389798571.0,"I have to disagree with a lot of this. Particularly about Jon. Ostracizing and shaming her bastard son does mark Catelyn as kind of heartless, sure, but a bad play in the Game of Thrones? It's just the opposite! Minimizing the risk of a bastard challenging her trueborn children is a good, competent play in the Game. The Game is all about securing and advancing the power and position of one's House, and by Westerosi rules Jon is not part of that House.

Littlefinger too. She had no reason to mistrust Petyr, her childhood friend whom she considered a brother. And Ned had no reason to question Catelyn's judgment of him. When it comes down to it that was just a masterful play by Littlefinger. He manipulated Cat.

Where I agree with you is her relationship with Robb. She raises him up, telling him to command and be the Lord and then King he must be, but then she undermines him whenever it suits her. The Karstark betrayal is her fault. Catelyn's failure is that she can't let Robb fully take responsibility. She's too much of a mother."

internetsurfer,Frugal,1389798627.0,"I'm not sure if I agree. Looking at a few wine lists it seems like wine bottles tend to run about 3.5 times the glass price. An average wine bottle contains about 5 glasses of wine (bottle=25 oz average glass= 4-6 oz). At most restaurants the bottle is about 3.5 times the price of a single glass and the restaurant bottle price is 3 times the retail price. Using these numbers, if a couple goes out and each has only 1 glass of wine you would've been better off buying a glass. 

Example:

Option 1: Each order 1 glass of wine for $10 each ($20 total). Then on your way home stop at a liquor store and buy a new bottle of the same wine for $12. For a total of $32 you each had a glass of wine at the restaurant and have a new fresh bottle to take home giving you an extra 2 glasses. This gives you a per oz cost of $.91.

Option 2: Order a $35 dollar bottle at the restaurant and each have a glass. You can take the remainder 3 glasses home, but now you've spent $35 on only 5 glasses of wine, plus the additional $3 for 20% gratuity on the extra $15 you spent at the restaurant. This gives you a total of $38 spent on 5 glasses of wine for a per oz cost of $1.5

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1389798673.0,"There are 2 keys involved.  A public key and a private key.  These two keys are mathematically related.  The public key can be seen by anyone, the private key must be kept private.

For a good example of how this works, imagine the follow scenario.  You are trying to disarm a bomb and are awaiting for me to tell you the code to disarm it.  Imagine that the code is the number '14'.  The problem is, there are bad guys in the world who are also sending you information in hopes that you will use the wrong code and detonate the bomb.  But, we have a distinct advantage.  You have known me for a long time, and you know I always use a public key of 3 (and the bad guys know this public key as well).  So, how do you verify that you are receiving information from me and not a bad guy?  For this to happen, I'm going to communicate a few values to you.  If I send you the values message = 14 (the code to disarm the bomb), encrypt_msg = 20, z = 33, public = 3, then I can 'prove' that it is me sending you the message.  You can verify this by doing mod(20^3, 33) = 14 OR EQUALLY mod(encrypt_msg^public, z) == msg.  Note the use of the public key of 3, which is how you know it's me.  Notice how I have encrypted the original value of 14 with my private key (which I do with mod(14^private, 33) = 20).  If I was a bad guy, I would not have been able to encrypt the message because I do not own the corresponding private key.  Because I cannot encrypt the message, the decryption won't work, and you would throw out the message as garbage.

gerusz,Stargate,1389798748.0,"* I think lots of colonies would get founded after the initial shock dies down. The only planets I can think of that have a population density anywhere near Earth's were the Aschen main planets and Tollana. And honestly... if you're a part of a culture / subculture that is not especially location-bound and has some issues living alongside other cultures then colonizing an uninhabited planet seems ideal.
* With the Asgard core and all of Earth's industrial capacity we could start building neutrino-ion generators. No more fossil fuels!
* Also, since now most of Earth's industry can do whatever it wants, we would swiftly build a whole new fleet. Hello, personal hyperspace shuttle!
* Poverty would be solved with the same trick Sam invented in Unending... only on an industrial scale.
* Some colonies - especially the mining colonies founded by nations that were participating in the SG-program - will form a loose federation with Earth.
* The leading religion would soon become a variation of Buddhism that aims for ascension instead of enlightenment. They would declare Daniel the Thrice-Born as their prophet. St. Daniel would be rather reluctant to accept the title.
* Porn industry would have a lot more to work with. I mean... Jaffa, Goa'uld and Nox-porn are plausible, but I don't think even the Furlings or the Asgards are safe."

Primarily, I think our entire views on how we see femininity and women need to drastically change. However, it's easier and more efficient to put some laws in place than to change the mindset of everybody in the world. 

So, I guess there's a few problems that immediately come to mind that I think could benefit from some laws being enacted: I think prostitution should be legalized, regulated and taxed; Women's work should be compensated to earn as much as men; abortions should be legalized everywhere

These are just a few women's issues I thought of. There are certainly more, these just stick out to me."

Sir_Fancy_Pants,todayilearned,1389798897.0,"so let me see if i get this, you accept that fact that men and women have clear biological differences that allow them to compete and exceed on very different terms on physical tasks (i didnt actually specify that the sports of choice were actually physically dependant i.e it could be a choice between darts or chess or golf etc)

But you find the idea that behaviourally or mentally that are no differences at all.

this is clearly complete fantasy, for a simple realisation of this fact, subject yourself to a testosterone injection and then tell me it has no clear influence on your behaviour, or perform the same but with oestrogen.

to deny that we have inherent and different leanings and competences as a gender is simply to deny reality.

there are certain roles and fields that are more likely to be populated by men than women simply by virtue of preference and capability, likewise for women, while of course any individual man or women can indeed compete and succeed in that field she will be a statistical minority.

anyone expects gender parity in population in all fields and career avenues doesn't understand biology or evolution

Edit: Think of the drug as being able to assist you in becoming healthy again.

sleepyj910,exchristian,1389799186.0,"Religion is a fairy tale invented by humans.  All the evidence points to this being the case, and no evidence points to the existence of heaven or hell.

Religion survives not because it is true, but because humans are a communal species and usually try to conform to each other...they also hate being wrong, so they ignore evidence against their views.

The best thing you can do to feel better might be to read atheist literature and hang out with other atheists.  This may help you feel less alone, knowing all the fine people and scholars who have left the church and faced the fear you are facing.

As far as your parents, at least your sister made a beachhead.  You don't owe them an explanation, but neither should you feel compelled to go through the motions to appease them.  Your relationship with God, or lack thereof, is totally your business and not theirs.

A comforting fact is that the Universe is big.  Mind bogglingly big.  Like seriously, watch the Cosmos series by Carl Sagan.  So big the idea that humanity is important is ridiculous.  Why is it good that we are not important to the cosmos?  Because if the Universe wasn't designed for us, then it probably wasn't designed to punish us either."

houseQM,AskMen,1389799260.0,"Yep. A couples times. In 5th grade it was during recess. I had a crush on some girls and saw them in a group together. I went over to talk to them. She jumped in front of me and told me to go away. 5th grade me got mad and pushed her down. There was a pause and then she started crying. 5th grade me ran away. 

With my little sister, I think I was playing video games and she came in. Younger me with video games was not a good combination because I got so irate if I were interrupted. When she tried to intervene (she's a great sister BTW), I pushed her away and she fell. Then she ran out of the room crying. 

Of course, girls have made me cry too. 

I (stupidly) picked a fight with a girl when I was 8. (Told ya I had issues) I was used to picking fights and people not fighting back. I knew something was off when she started dodging. Like bobbing and weaving. Then, she punched me in the stomach. It was my first time ever getting hit - period. I cried like a baby (like bawling) and the female teacher stepped in before any more damage could be incurred. 


Second time was in 5th grade actually. I always prided myself on my ability to rank (or talk crap) about people. I never meant anything by it. Well, Pi picked the wrong girl that day (not the same one BTW). I said something and then her friends jumped in and basically gave the verbal assault of a lifetime. Good Lord, one female with sharp words is one thing. But a group. I was lucky to get out intact. I cried and then the girl I said the mean thing to told me to be careful about the words I used. Life lesson is I ever had one. 

Then, in 6th grade (I don't learn from my mistakes) on the first day of school no less, I sat at a table with a group of girls. One decided to play a game in which you hit the person next to you (made no sense, but sixth grade so yeah) Anyway, I get hit by someone and then I turn to a girl (who I am friends with now on FB) and hit her. Not hard, but I made contact. She gave me a WTF look and then hit me back (sort of hard). I then cried.

And then there was a time where a gay kid talked about my jean jacket in 7th grade after school. He was vicious and had his female friends laughing along with him. My best friend was with me and told me not to worry about it. I then cried. In front of them. 

Younger me was not a fun guy to be around. "

An autoimmune disease is basically the exact opposite; the body's immune system is over active and attacks its own cells because it incorrectly recognizes them as a threat.

It's just that I have done everything within my means, and I still can't be equal to a man in many ways. 

Not everyone has your perspective, and not everyone shares mine. We must acknowledge that even though we all share being a woman, we have lived and seen different things. You are obviously a person who values self-sufficiency. That's wonderful. If people assume that because I need feminism, that I am a weak and stupid person, that's their loss and really just screams irony on how much we *really do* need feminism. I'm not a damsel in distress. I'm a strong hardworking woman who is not being compensated for that hard work. That's unfair.

Also, obviously a woman can still succeed in life without special help. I am not asserting that at all, that would be silly. But not every woman can. In fact very very few can. Not because of weakness; but because of structural deficits that affects some women more than others."

houseQM,AskWomen,1389799471.0,"Guy here I got some stories about how girls made me cry. 

I (stupidly) picked a fight with a girl when I was 8. I was used to picking fights and people not fighting back. I knew something was off when she started dodging. Like bobbing and weaving. Then, she punched me in the stomach. It was my first time ever getting hit - period. I cried like a baby (like bawling) and the female teacher stepped in before any more damage could be incurred.

Second time was in 5th grade actually. I always prided myself on my ability to rank (or talk crap) about people. I never meant anything by it. Well, I picked the wrong girl that day (not the same one BTW). I said something and then her friends jumped in and basically gave the verbal assault of a lifetime. Good Lord, one female with sharp words is one thing. But a group is like a pack of wild dogs. I was lucky to get out intact. I cried and then the girl I said the mean thing to told me to be careful about the words I used. Life lesson is I ever had one.

Then, in 6th grade (I don't learn from my mistakes) on the first day of school no less, I sat at a table with a group of girls. One decided to play a game in which you hit the person next to you (made no sense, but sixth grade so yeah) Anyway, I get hit by someone and then I turn to a girl (who I am friends with now on FB) and hit her. Not hard, but I made contact. She gave me a WTF look and then hit me back (sort of hard). I then cried. 

And then there was a time where a gay kid talked about my jean jacket in 7th grade after school. He was vicious and had his female friends laughing along with him. My best friend was with me and told me not to worry about it. I then cried. In front of them.

Younger me was just a wimp. "

silverionmox,Economics,1389799966.0,"&gt; Trying to fix low wages by price controls is like trying to solve hunger by saying no one can sell rice for more than $1 a ton. If you're just trying to force rich people to give to poor people then use tax its a lot more efficient and direct. There's plenty of loopholes around the minimum wage (like hiring illegal immigrants or using customer tips to cover the difference).

There are other practices that are a better use of resources. The people should be eduated, the labor should be done by efficiency gains, automatization and other innovation. Naturally, it's not going to help much if you bar access to education for these people.

&gt;Sell all your shit on ebay then donate to the WFP or WHO. Or don't and be a hypocrite.

It's not because I argue for more strict fire safety measure that I'm a hypocrite if I don't spend all my money on fire brigades.

&gt;In other words, ""I think rich people should have their money taken off them and given to poorer people, and I'm not doing that myself until people richer than me do it first

I'm happily paying taxes, at much larger effective tax rate than capital owners, thank you very much. It's just your prejudice that considers taxes wasted money by definition. I, however, still want my money to be spent effectively, and that means where I can keep an eye on it and influence the spending.

&gt;I agree they're economically useless now.

So making them trawl the job markets where they won't find employment is just humiliating and demotivating. Blaming them for not being able to sustain themselves is just sadistic.

&gt;The point in question was whether we accept that millions of people are useless and are only good for handouts forever or whether we try to reform the system so they can be of use to themselves and other people.

I've already said it several times: education is the key. People who work three less than minimum wage jobs to make ends meet don't have the time or energy to educate themselves.

&gt;There's absolutely no reason these people can't learn to have more useful skills they're just raised in an education system that provides the vast majority almost no valuable skills and actively distracts them from gaining valuable skills elsewhere.

You can't expect the education system to predict the needs of the economy ten years beforehand, so that will never be completely solved. I know employers don't like to invest education in employees that might disappear - they'd rather poach themselves, but they'll have to if they want tailored education.
I don't know the specific problems of your particular education system, so it really varies from place to place what the problems and the potential solutions are.

&gt;The minimum wage will never be significantly risen

It doesn't need to be risen with shocks. It's mostly a reminder that a job that only justifies paying that little probably is a waste of time, that ""how low can you go"" is not a workplace game, and you're employing a goddamn human being, not a billy goat that feeds on weeds and sleeps on the ground.

&gt;It's only worth focusing on

I'm not focusing on it.

&gt;If you raised the minimum wage to $100 an hour it would either cause massive infaltion or massive unemployment 

I never advocated that.

Let's face it, the jobs that are lost by raising the minimum wage are barely useful to the economy and the employee alike, since they don't deliver useful experience. People have better use for their time. Take for example a single parent, who would probably have to pay most of her sub-minimum wage income to the babysitter. "

AlfredTheGreatest,TheRedPill,1389800119.0,"This woman is a ""therapist"" and yet she has no idea how male minds, especially young ones, operate.  Boys are facinated with weapons.  Throughout our evolution it was clearly necissary for boys to become proficent in weapon use, as well as appropriate cultural context for proper use of those weapons.  Those that did not were likely to grow up and be killed by weapon users, or ruled by them.

It's so sad to see this foolish woman project all her fear and insecurity into this poor boy.  He just wants to play at being strong and killing bad guys (enemies of the tribe).  This behaviour is so natural, common, and healthy.  These are teachable moments about when it is and is not appropriate to use violence, not some frightening episode.

This woman's inability to understand her male child is a perfect example of what's wrong with modern parenting.  Instead of being the proud mother of a little boy that's sensitive enough to care for his dolls AND wants to be strong enough to protect them from the bad guys, she just sees a defective girl.  How terrible it must be to think your child might one day grow into a strong man that is both willing and able to protect his family.  One day protecting his mother, perhaps?  

This story makes me sad.  Fathers of the world beware: This is what happens when you let women raise your sons without oversight. "

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389800171.0,"You're completely missing all of the nuance here.

First off, we don't know the level of intoxication that anyone person has without doing something such as a BAC test. Individuals have varying levels of tolerance and alcoholic metabolic rates that it frankly is damn near impossible to determine their internal state unless they're stumbling around. Throw in there that most individuals that are picking up drunk people are also *drunk themselves*, and we have a very grey area. Should you charge the perpetrator in this case, even though they might have been *more* intoxicated? If that's the case, you might be seeing more women charged with rape.

Secondly, drinking does not free you from responsibility, which is the point behind the driving analogy. If I chose to spend $100 last night on a bar tab because I was drunk when I really shouldn't have, that does not mean I get the $100 back. I explicitly gave consent to the bartender to rack that tab up. In the same sense, if a person gives *explicit* consent to have sex, then they're consenting to have sex. I'm not responsible for knowing what their internal state is - I don't know if they're forming memories or if their judgment is significantly impaired.

If someone is worried that when drunk they will sleep with someone that they normally wouldn't, then they should be careful about how much they drink or having people there to look out for them. In the same sense, if someone is worried that when drunk they will drive a car, they should take responsible actions such as hiding their keys or drinking around people that will look out for them."

And there is no way that saying ""Women need special help because they are unable to do anything for themselves like those big strong men can!"" is NOT going to say to people ""Women are unable to help themselves unlike those big strong men."" You can't make a statement and then expect people to interpret it to mean the opposite of what it says. 

And why shouldn't self-sufficiency be valued? What is there of value in expecting someone else to do the work for me? That's basically admitting that I'm not competent to do for myself, and why should I get something I'm not competent to earn? There's a difference in ""Women are not treated fairly in many areas and we should address this"" versus ""Women should get special help because they can't do anything for their poor helpless selves."" I completely support the former statement. I find the latter insulting. Making things fair does not have to entail any kind of special privileges for women. What it should entail is making rules that apply to everyone regardless of their sex, and strictly enforcing those rules. I can certainly see the need for special help for *certain demographics,* but those demographics are neither entirely composed of women nor is ""has vagina"" the sole criterion by which I would define someone who needs help."

ebonlance,Warmachine,1389800498.0,"The problem with the Troll battlebox is that it contains elements you'll use a lot as a Troll player, but as its own list it's frankly pretty terrible. I really think the box should be updated to Mauler/Axer instead of the inexplicable inclusion of double-Impaler (you'll rarely, if ever, use 2 in the same list).

What you want to do in the early game is use Snipe on the Impalers and boost attacks to try and get the critical effect (Smite) off on enemies. Pow 13 doesn't sound like much, but boosted it will do decent damage at range. You'll want to have Madrak cast Snipe twice so your impalers will have enough room to boost both attack and damage. This leaves him one fury to upkeep Sure Foot, which should be cast on himself. Brick up your forces so they're all within 3 inches of him - DEF 14 isn't impossible to hit but it's respectable for battlebox games.

Once your enemies are in your melee range, use the Axer and Madrak himself to put down the hurt. Leave some fury on Madrak each turn to transfer damage to Impalers as you will need to expose him to some damage as he does the most damage in your army. Also don't forget the lovely bullshit that is his Scroll of Perseverance, nothing ruins a carefully calculated assassination attempt like an opponent forgetting about it."

Drunken_Black_Belt,AskReddit,1389800506.0,"Technically my first time was in 5th grade, by accident.  Neighborhood party, friends and I made ""kamikazes"" by mixing all the soda on the table together.  I forgot which cup was mine, figured,  ""screw it it's all the same stuff mixed together"" and tossed one back. Turns out my friends mixed vodka, gin, and rum with their drinks without me knowing. They saw me drinking it without noticing, and fed me 2 more.  A while later I was in my mom's minivan feeling sick.


But the first time I ever got purposefully drunk, was the first weekend of Freshman year of college.  Lived in a hotel in the middle of NYC since my school didn't have dorms.  5 floors of the hotel were set aside for college students, and I made some friends the first day.  We get some liquor and decide to party.  I drank an entire bottle of rum to myself, plus shots of JD.  Eventually everyone is falling asleep except for me and this one girl, Christina. Christina was 24 and going on 11.  The biggest child I have ever met.  And also just BIG in general.  She looked like a playdoh person who was squished down to half size and left in the sun to long.  

I'm on the floor trying to get the room to stop spinning, and everyone else is asleep.  She crawls next to me and starts trying to cuddle.  I drunkenly mumble that I don't want to be near anyone right now.  She keeps trying to move my arm around her shoulder, and kissing my neck. After several ""no thank you""'s, I lose it and shout ""STOP TOUCHING ME I DON'T WANT TO HOOK UP WITH YOU!""  This of course leads her to start crying, and the other people in the room to wake up.  The girl whose room it was takes her and another friend into the bathroom to console her.  I was told to stay put.  Instead I tried finding my room.  I lived on the 14th floor, but being an old hotel, the floors went 11,12,14. Because 13 is bad luck.  So the next morning my friend whose room it was plays me back a recorded phone call we had, where she called me to find out where I am, and I spent a solid 5 minutes ranting about how we are being cheated by the hotel, we are paying for an extra floor that doesn't exist, and I'm going downstairs to get my money back.  

Eventually I listend to their advice and passed out in my own room, rather than drunkenly approach the front desk to curse them out.

**TL;DR-  I stopped a scam in a hotel**"

I know some people feel guilt about getting a new pet after they've just lost one, either because they feel it betrays the pet's memory, or they don't want to feel as if they're replacing their lost pet.

abeyante,sex,1389800580.0,"&gt;I've always had a thing for domination and rape play. I remember when I was about 5/6 years old and I had fantasies about a boy kissing me against my will. I used to fantasize about Peter Pan in that scenario which I think is hilarious now.


Hahahahaha oh god, reading this made me realize that I was very similar as a child... All my early sexual fantasies as a very small child involved male characters that I ""liked"" (Ash Ketchum was most common...HA) kissing me/stripping me/touching me while I was super embarrassed, crying, pretending I didn't want it. But really I did, I was just embarrassed because at that age ""liking"" someone gets you made fun of, and is seen as shameful, so I didn't want the other person/people to know I wanted it, basically.

Thinking about it that way, I think my childhood culture of ""ooooooh so-and-so likes so-and-so!!!!"" crush-shaming must have pretty heavily influenced my association with humiliation/embarrassment and sexual arousal. All my crushes were always deep dark secrets, only for the closest of confidants. And even in my fantasies, I got off on the idea of trying to maintain the secret, on the idea that I would be made fun of for enjoying sexual things."

As for the front axle, it looks like a non-CAD Dana 30, but I'd need to see the passenger side of the axle tube to be sure.  Basically, you can swap in a Dana 30 or front Dana 44 out of a TJ, or a Dana 30 from another XJ, MJ, or ZJ without any issues.  There's a good guide on XJ axles here:

oldmonty,AskMen,1389800703.0,"There's two things Id like to address from what you wrote. The first seems kind of reasonable like you don't want kids right now and you want your freedom. The second makes it seem like you actually don't even want a relationship though, which is odd because that's the topic of this question. 

I can understand not being ready for major life changes like pregnancy and marriage, that part is fair and you'll find plenty of guys who agree with you. The rest of what you wrote, however, makes it sound like if I were to get involved with you it wouldn't even be a relationship until very far in. 

&gt; If I met the right person I'd be cool with one day living together

One day? People I've known have moved in together after 2 months of a relationship and while that's a little extreme I'm not going to date you for 6 years before we bring up this issue, at this age. 

&gt;I would be adopting-not getting pregnant. 

This whole sentence you wrote seemed to make a lot of sense but then you ended it with this line as if you knew exactly what your situation would be like that many years down the line. 

Honestly, I demand nothing from a partner, I would be put off if you weren't at least willing to think about this one day down the line. If we were considering having kids together the relationship would have to be very serious and very far advanced.

At that point I think we would want a kid that's ours, DNA wise. Not that we couldn't also adopt, I'd be open to that.

The way this all sounds to me is as if you want to hold your relationship aloft, or at a distance. We may live together but we're only going to rent so if something happens it won't be a big deal and we may raise a child but it won't be ours so If one of us bails on the relationship the child can belong to only one of us.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389800789.0,"I've gone through this problem from the other end a couple times.

With one of my exes, sometimes she would be super tight some days, and we just didn't have sex.  We'd do other stuff.  Some days it was totally okay, but if it wasn't, then we wouldn't push it.  I mean, if it's not going to work, you kinda know it's not happening, so find other ways to satisfy each other.  But that's just one side, as it *usually* wasn't that much of a problem (although we'd always start out really slow).

But I've had this problem with someone else as well.  She wasn't *super* tight or anything, but she was a bit, and sex did require a decent amount of buildup for us to be able to do anything.  There always has to be foreplay, including fingering (which done the right way, can loosen her up).  I can count the amount of times we had sex without fingering her first on one hand.  It's just not going to happen otherwise.  Lube was used at times as well, and that definitely helps to slide in.  

Also, assuming he's on top, have him go in maybe a cm at a time - go in a cm, come out, go in maybe a cm again, come out, go in 2cm, rinse and repeat until he slides in easy.  Going down on him a little first can help as well so he's not going in dry."

If you don't have some sort of scientific filter, then you just accept things you want to be true, and never accept what is actually true.  And how can you live life with blinders on?

If we do it this year we are going to have to pay even more salary cap to QB AND keep him on the roster because if we practice squad him we could lose him just like Tanney.

And going into gamedays next year we are much better off being able to carry an extra backup lineman, LB, CB, WR, or anything but a 3rd string rookie QB that won't see the field.

And finally, if we don't compete/make the playoffs next year then JG and this coaching staff are (very likely) gone. No reason to stick the replacements with some later round developmental QB chosen by the previous regime.

I've seen this happen to pretty much every girl I know: even if we're not calling it rape, they've almost all been taken advantage of in a situation where they didn't have any real option of saying no.

You need to remove as much of the green as you can (without damaging your hair, obvs). Manic Panic tends to fade quite a bit on its own anyway. 

I'd recommend removing the color over the course of one week. Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo, then deep-condition it. Do this again a couple of days later. You *should* see a lot of the color coming out. If you've washed it twice and haven't seen any difference, then get a color remover. 

When the green is gone, you can dye it with your auburn dye. I have a feeling you'd get the best results by mixing a small amount of red Manic Panic dye with your conditioner - the red dye should counteract the rest of the green.

Basically, be patient and gentle with your hair - don't bleach the crap out of it, and don't cover your head in baking soda or lemon juice or whatever."

Your claims however are ""Its D because i say so"" there is no working or evidence to support your claim, no applied reasoned thinking, in fact it actually shows very poor reasoning since the degree or effect of ""societal constructs"" are completely unknown, and no body would be foolish enough to declare to what degree (at all) it has an influence.

Giving a eulogy is only vain if you turn the whole thing into a speech about yourself. It should be more about what kind of man he was, how much he affected the people around him, and that he will be missed. Practice it in front of a mirror or a dog a couple of times so you get used to saying the things that might make you cry, this way you are better able to push through and finish your speech. 

There are resources online for how to structure a eulogy, but pretty much (after the officiant goes through the biography) you tell a funny/touching anecdote about a time you and your Dad did something fun or maybe a time you screwed up and he set you straight, then you talk a little about how the way you were raised and how it's helped you live right, and then you close with something about how you will miss him and his advice. Don't make it too long, if you go with more than two anecdotes be sure that they tie together with some kind of theme you can wrap up with.

Even in a particular city rates vary greatly. Chicago's ""safe"" neighborhoods have roughly the same murder rate as Toronto. The dangerous ones are much more deadly because of cartels transporting drugs and street gangs.

screenmagnet,AskWomen,1389801638.0,"I would be totally into dating a guy with no career aspirations, provided he wanted to be a stay at home husband/dad. In that case, I would want him to show off his domestic skills (e.g. by cooking for me, keeping a clean house, fixing stuff around the house), show respect and appreciation for my career, and be upfront about his desire to be a stay at home dad.

If he doesn't want to be a SAHD, though, then I want him to have good career prospects, so that our combined income will be enough to comfortably cover housekeeping expenses and a top of the line nanny.

In general, I prefer to date men who value their career less than I value mine, though. Because I need him to be open to relocating with me for jobs, taking paternity leave, days off work when the kids are sick, etc. I would not marry a man who worked long hours, had a demanding job, or little flexibility in his career.

They also have a very heavily promoted idea that women actually WANT men to push through their boundaries and that if a man is ""alpha"" enough, the woman will start to WANT him to ignore her protests and just have sex with her against her will anyway. Not to mention their sister sub, where ""Red pill women"" tell each other that women should never say no to sex and talk about how ""I never say no because I know what will happen if I do"" [i.e. he will rape her anyway] and this is presented as a positive thing.

LSD - I first notice that colours seem a little bit brighter and my mood is enhanced. I almost always shrug it off as placebo effect, but my experience tells me it's usually not. Then 10 minutes later I will see the first waviness visuals. 10 minutes after that, I'm tripping.


DMT - You take the first 2 hits, and the visuals hit you almost instantly, it's so apparent. Then you take the third hit. As you are holding it in, stuff starts to get really weird, whether you are trying to hold on to reality or not you feel it slipping away. Right before you exhale, your body goes limp, and your mind flies away.


I don't have enough experience with shrooms or 2c-x to answer about those, but I have taken them, and I guess the onset is kind of similar to LSD but obviously different in their own ways."

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1389801675.0,"the point of my argument is that all humans are motivated to become fulfilled differently and thus ""a proper amount of motivation to have a fulfilling career"" can't be defined.  in my view, all humans are equally motivated to do things, what differentiates individuals is WHAT they are motivated to do.  bear in mind you also can't bar random slapperdoodles from conversations about reality no matter how badly you want to because they actually exist as counterexamples to your logic (unless i'm misreading you and you're actually using the word slapperdoodle to mean hypothetical people who don't actually exist).  further, in a poor economy the random slapperdoodles multiply drastically.

i'll admit my original phrasing was a bit abrasive.  i don't think work is SUPPOSED to suck or that it's impossible to find a job one enjoys for the most part.  however, to assume billionaires are worthy of their wealth while others deserve to starve due to their purely imbalanced motivations is silly.  the imbalance of opportunity in the world accounts for far less personal freedom across the board than you assume.  this doesn't mean everyone has to give up and resign themselves to the misery of a professional world, but it does mean for those whose personal interests aren't highly lucrative there is a higher likelihood their motivation won't prove sufficient unless it is much greater compared to someone with lucrative interests.  

when there is an imbalanced level of motivation required for two people to achieve the same ends it might be worth exploring whether achieving the same ends is in both of their best interest, or if one might find fulfillment more easily in different ends achieved through means that they find to be commensurately motivating."

The Bosnia operation, when it happened, was an example of a textbook military operation as it should be, but the West simply wasn't interested until after Srebrenica and the public outcry became too great. By contrast, the first Gulf War started within a few months of the Iraqi invasion, once it became clear that the Saudi oil supplies were at risk.

I believe both of those were justifiable military interventions BTW, but it's obvious why one of them demanded swift action and the other didn't.

It sucks being rejected, and if its too much time/energy for you right now, then put it much lower on your priority list and focus on making friends, not girlfriends. Sometimes that leads to something, or at least keeps up your socialization so when you have the energy to try again, you're not out of practice.

Women may prefer a more outgoing and gregarious guy in the initial first impression, and you can't really meet anyone if you're never making conversation, but you can still be a more reserved guy and find a girl who is on that same wavelength.

When my SO and I started dating a year ago, I made it clear to him early on that at our age (I was 29, he was 35), we should know after a year of serious dating whether or not you want to marry that person. That's not saying that there should be a proposal at the one year mark, but you should be headed in that direction. If you don't know after a year, it's time to cut your losses. He agreed, and I'm happy to say that after a year of serious dating we're headed in the direction of marriage."

'I don't really know'  'I'm taking a private spiritual journey' and 'I'm not sure what to think sometimes' are great ways to deflect interrogation should they bring it up.  You aren't challenging them, but it's clear that you aren't on their bandwagon.

Edit: MuzzEmil was right on the math, I cited another forums' mistaken numbers without checking, apologies. Regardless, the DVOA isn't predicated on PPG, it's based on an offense's performance in specific situations (down and distance) versus the league average.

Having her meet all of your friends won't help in this case, because then she'll feel surrounded by people who are all experts in something she knows nothing about. She's scared to talk to them incase she reveals her 'stupidity' (as she sees it) or to dance incase they think she's rubbish, etc.

How about starting a beginners class in something that neither of you have any idea how to do. That way she might hopefully make some friends and won't be as worried about other failing. Just make sure you don't compete with her in the class."

Towards the end of my junior year, the empire was now mine for almost an entire school year with no problems.  When my older brother graduated, my twin dropped out, so the empire was all mine.we got another bomb threat after lunch which was about 2 hours before the end of school.

Now what you have to understand about my school is that due to its unique location, we actually had two factions of the local Norteños going to the same school as us.  My personal flair to our school's underworld was that I got along with everyone.  I supplied both equally, and charged the same.  I was Switzerland, and I basically spoke for the white kids when it came to the reprobate scene.  It was never easy dealing with the two groups when they fought, but by staying impartial I kept them from at least seeing anyone white as an enemy, and there were quite a few white kids beaten after my time when my sister went there.

I didn't know what was coming, but I knew 2 things.  There was going to be a bomb threat, and anyone who hadn't picked a side needed to stay seated at the field.  

I spread the word through the girls that hung out in my crew, and they spread it to everyone else.  It was intense.  Before the first class everyone was happy.  During the first break you could see most of the crowd seemed a little tense, and by lunch everyone stuck to their biggest circles.  Shit was going down, but I didn't know what and that freaked me out.

I left campus to get lunch (A special perk of being me), and came back high as fuck with a bag of Burger King.  That's not really relevant, but it happened that day.

20 minutes after the first class after lunch ended we were given the notice, and we started filing out to the football field.  I wanted to see what was going on, and also be able to make a clean getaway, so myself and most of my friends sat at the far end of the home bleachers near the top.  It was next to a concrete snack shack we could use for cover, and there was the baseball backstop and metal bleachers between us and the parking lot.  Get away plan was set, so we settled in.

As the last of the faculty was crossing the giant practice field towards the stadium, the first emergency vehicles were getting ready to do their thing. The principal would be with the emergency teams while the Vice Principal ran the head count against the role sheets.  That was when everyone who wasn't white and a few who were (2/3rds of the student body of a school of 1500 students) stood up, and then filed down the stadium.

They pushed right passed the stunned teachers in a calm and orderly manner, but just didn't speak.  They went down the stadium steps, and they scaled the sides of the bowl next to the bleachers.  They walked across the football field to the visitors side of the stadium, and all sat down.  It was like they staged it to show me, all the know nothing nerds, and all of the white kids who were alerted, but didn't want any part of it that this is us.  We are different then you.  We are other.  It was creepy as shit.

Then they all jumped up and started throwing punches.  You could hear everyone on the bleacher side's, mine and the staff included's, jaws hit the ground.  Then my school counselor, a gorgeous woman in her early 30's, about 5'6"", and maybe 120 pounds, who thinks she's invincible, ran across the field and dove into the crowd like a demented amazon.  We lost her in the crowd immediately.  

The VP and his crony, the Athletics Director, flew down the side of the bowl and across the field, the staff right behind them.  You could see them in the brawl trying to separate random fighters, and drag them onto the field to space out the brawlers to make them easier to identify, and handle.

The athletics director had an idea who runs the shows around school, and he made a slow beeline through the fighters towards them.  Out of the two leaders, one was punching the other in the face hockey fight style, while the other was done, and trying to strangle him.  As the director neared and grabbed the two, they immediately stopped, dodged, and then you see a random fist knock the director out.  I think it happened in slow motion.  

At the same time, the Vice Principal was dragging out a random girl, and then I saw someone I know, who confirmed at the reunion throw one of those old metal garbage cans, and hit the guy.  It was sheer savagery.  

It only took about 5 more minutes for the cops to realize where the real action was, and then the uniforms started cuffing random brawlers.  The fight defused slowly, and the brawlers were forced to sit on the field (all the ones who didn't use the long cross-country trails to escape into the low income housing development that is).

The two ""suspected"" (lol) leaders were caught, the Athletics Director had a black eye, the VP was being treated for a concussion, and my counselor, the demented little amazon had a torn shirt, and looked nervous and on edge which made me think she wasn't just frazzled from being in the brawl, I'm almost positive she was somehow sexually assaulted in that crowd, because Every straight guy with a pulse talked about how much they wanted to fuck her, and she never showed up in our crowds without at least one of the male faculty for the rest of my tenure as a student.  I kinda liked her, so I asked around, and though everyone said they didn't see anything, a few of them seemed like they were dodging.  Nothing I could do about it, so I dropped it.

After everything was calmed down, all the white kids who were sitting on the home side were told that if they had a car, they can go home.  All the Frosh/sophs, and buss riders were to stay in their seats, and do their homework.

My friends and I were walking to the parking lot, planning to stop at the local trailer park to ride a friend's dirt bikes, and smoke some weed when I heard my name called.  It was the Principal, and he wanted me to stay behind for some questions.

I thought he meant right then, or pretty soon.  I didn't think I'd be the last one to leave, and I didn't expect to be questioned by the principal, and our county Sheriff.  He's busted my brothers for some small things, and broke up several of my brother's parties.

They wanted to know who started it, I said I didn't know, I was in shock it happened.  Almost 2/3rds the school just participated in a massive fight.  How was I suppose to know who started it.  That's when the principal tipped his hand.  He said that he knew I was well connected.  Who my brothers were, my parents, almost all the staff loved me, I had a 3.8 GPA at the time, and I was in many clubs, and one of the most active members of the student government.  Almost nothing happens in this school that I don't know at least something about.  I thought ""Snap! They're fishing, they didn't have shit on me.""

That was when his boss, the District Supervisor, stormed in demanding answers. When the principal said he was just about to get some and pointed at me, his boss looked at me, saw who I was (one of the students his son coached and talked about who was also his golfing buddy's son) and dropped his shit.

He asked if I was in the fight, they said know.  He asked why they were questioning me, and when the principal couldn't give him a good legitimate reason that he knew my parents wouldn' raise hell over, he told me he was sorry I was held, and that I was free to go.

One of the best days of high school.

I was hanging out with some friends a couple days ago, and somehow we went from medieval torture devices to a ""would you rather"" setup involving said torture device v. rape where the victim orgasms. One person went on and on, for what felt like an uncomfortably long time, about how they would much prefer being brutally tortured and killed to being raped and orgasming during. Because apparently people ""never recover"" from that, and remain ""broken"" and nonfunctional for the rest of their lives. I felt so, so, SO uncomfortable because...um...I've been raped. I didn't orgasm (because he'd gotten so many drinks into me I almost died of alcohol poisoning) but I felt pleasure, or at least acted like I did (it didn't seem ""real"" and there was some mild dissociation), and yes, it really did break for me for a little while. I felt so ashamed, so wholly used, like the whole thing was my fault because I didn't fight. But jesus fucking christ, to imply that you'd rather be *tortured and murdered* than be raped and feel physical pleasure despite the violation really cut me to the core. My life isn't that bad, what the fuck. But of course I couldn't say anything because then I would have had to be *that girl* who stops the conversation because she was raped... fuck."

* If you have the bathroom open up into the living room it will make more room in the kitchen for at least a tiny table and two chairs.  If you put them between two door openings it will be awkward.

* Ditch the wall between the kitchen and living room, put another run of base cabinets into a C shape and have a breakfast bar with a few stools under it.

* You have no coat closet in the front of the house.  There really is NO storage in this house.

* Your kitchen layout is terrible.  There is no room for counter space once the sink is in place.

* I would bump out the mud room and laundry, it is really taking up useable space.

I know I am talking about it again but resale value is important for almost 100% of people.  Kitchens and bathrooms sell houses.  I personally would rather have a smaller bedroom than a tiny bathroom and I am a dude.  If you aren't adding a closet to the office to turn it into a bedroom then make it WAY smaller.  Think about a detached office in the backyard, could be a great option."

Their hardware is similar to the old hardware I have for this whitebox.  The onboard SATA controller isn't very good, but I have a 3Ware 9650SE, which is supported in ESXi 5.x and seems to do well.  I would change the setup to JBOD for ZFS and let it handle the storage pooling.  I notice two things here.  One is that their performance numbers running as a NAS don't outpace a 1Gbps network link.  The other is that running as a FC SAN gets much, much better performance.  That's what I am hoping for.  They're also using OpenFiler and Linux SCST, whereas I'd be going with OpenIndiana and COMSTAR to put the HBA in target mode.  Overall, it does appear that building my own whitebox FC SAN is in fact doable, it's doable in the configuration I've considered, and it can be done for a cheaper price for performance than iSCSI.

Yes, this sub is full of success stories but it is also full of a lot of people who will happily put their success into perspective for people just starting. 

A year and a half ago, I was like you. I was 306 and just stuck. I'd tried other diets with some success but it always came back. You know why?! Because I went right back to what I'd been doing! So I went to my doctor and he prescribed phentermine for me and said it would help me lose about 10% of my body weight. Cue me rolling my eyes at what a drop in the bucket 30lbs was to someone 300+. But I thought, ""whatever, I'll take it. Something is better than nothing, I guess."" 

5lbs down, great! But what's 5lbs?

10lbs down, that wasn't so hard. I wonder what would have happened if I had skipped that second helping at dinner the other night?

15lbs down, skipping seconds worked! Maybe I'll go for a walk a couple evenings this week and see what that does. 

20lbs down, holy crap I'm actually starting to see it, I think! This hasn't been so hard. Maybe I'll sub in another salad here and there. 

30lbs down, well shit! I guess my doctor was on to something. And I really didn't even have to do much! But what I did do really seemed to help. Cool!

My 3 month prescription was done and I was on my own but I kept doing the little things I'd already been doing and it kept working! More walks, more healthy foods, more water, less soda, fewer desserts. Whoda thought, eating better and exercising actually work? 

I say all this just to illustrate that DIETING doesn't work. Changing what you do and how you live your life does. 100lbs down in a year and a half and I still go on lots of walks, but now there's some running mixed in. Instead of healthy foods subbed in here and there, its 'cheat' foods subbed in for the healthy ones here and there as a treat. Diet pills aren't the answer, but they were the kick in the butt that I needed to help me get out of my rut. And yes, you'll gain it all back if you go right back to where you were before you started taking them! 

You're smart! You KNOW what behaviors got you to where you are right now. Logic would tell you that continuing to do those things will keep you moving in that direction. Make a decision to step off that path, not to be skinny but to be healthy and live your life the way you want to live it! It won't be quick and it won't always be easy but it will be worth it. You'll hit bumps in the road, you'll suffer setbacks, you'll get frustrated but you'll also see changes in yourself that you never knew possible. 

You can do this. You're not worthless. "
TheFarnell,outside,1389802554.0,"Boot time is, sadly, more a question of your own hardware.  Some users report very rapid boot times but then lag accumulates during the session and if they play for too long without logging out, the lag becomes unbearable.  You might have your hardware set up differently, so that the boot lag is pretty bad but once the system is running you're good to last.  It really varies.

Your initial approach is one that is really common. I'm currently finishing my master's degree and most at this level use the same approach. However, it's really easy to overlook information when doing this. What we've been taught for most case-studies, such as this description, is this: the first step is always to describe your environment. Write down what the static situation at that moment is, all the attributes that influence your problem. Then separate them into two categories: the aspects you can influence, and the ones you can't. Then, look at what you have, and how you can minimize the aspects you can't influence, and how to maximize the ones you can. Finally, after you've done a full analysis, start thinking about how to proceed from there, the best approach. This might cost a bit more time in preparations, but will make your approach much more efficient.

It's basically a SWOT-analysis, but applied to problems instead of entities. It works well, and will give you insight into most business situations. Again, good luck on your applications and I hope you get into the college of your choice."

If you are not active as a support, or 'bored' as support (i.e watching your adc farm while doing nothing), then it's more of an issue of how you're playing the role than the role itself being bad.

screenmagnet,smalldickproblems,1389802848.0,"I understand. I just wanted to reassure you that when we are on the job, we don't really look at our patients as peers or sexual beings. When I am in the work mindset, I view a patient as a collection of body parts, a mysterious diagnostic puzzle to solve, a living body to practice skills on, a frightened person to comfort, a challenge to communicate with, a problem to fix, and most important of all - a precious life that is literally in my hands, whose death I could be directly responsible for if I'm not 100% on top of my game at all times.

So, when I am examining a patient's penis, I'm not thinking about how visually appealing it is, or how it would feel inside me. Instead, I'm carefully going through a mental checklist and looking for signs of disease, just as I would do when examining a painful knee, the inside of an ear, or the back of an eye.

s54b32dd,technology,1389802968.0,"The problem is that in many markets, people don't have this type of freedom, as there are limited options for that ""last mile"" connection.

In many communities there are less than a handful of contracted/established ISPs that have completed the ""last mile"" network piping (typically a cable company and a telcom, and if you're lucky, an independent ISP who typically piggybacks on another, larger company's infrastructure). These companies are fully aware of their competition, and set their pricing/options accordingly.

In my particular suburb, there's Comcast or Century Link. Century Link has cheaper service plans, but Comcast allows for more bandwidth. If both of these providers were to decide to throttle network traffic based on various filters, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. As a hypothetical, I may be forced to choose between throttled speed for two common internet uses; gaming and streaming video. Do I want to use Netflix, or do I want to be able to play on PSN/XBox Live/Steam?

These are the kinds of difficult end-user decisions net neutrality is attempting to prevent. By forcing ISPs to treat all data the same, it allows people the freedom to choose what they'd like to use their alotted bandwidth for.

BUT WAIT! You say. This decision doesn't affect your ability to watch Netflix! It only says that Netflix has to pay for a portion of the traffic they're using! They're a bandwidth hog, they should have to pay more!

While it may be true that Netflix is a bandwidth hog, it's also true that if we start treating all online video services like Netflix, which is the essence of ""tiering"" network data, ultimately, it stifles competition. If Netflix is the only one able to afford the price hike associated with their traffic use, this effectively limits the options of any new entries in the market designed to compete with Netflix. To find interesting case studies on limited competition in markets and how that affects pricing for the consumer, we need look no further than the cable companies and telecoms themselves who already went through similar innovation-stagnation cycles of their own.

The main fear associated with the end of net neutrality is that data tiering/the tiered pricing model becomes the status quo, and we, the individuals, as consumers and producers of content, lose out on the potential for further future innovation and development, effectively relegating the internet to another content medium that is controlled and priced solely by the ISP, who ultimately holds the keys to the content.

This may be an alarmist, dystopian view to a lot of people, but in all honesty, there's precedent for all of this; tiered pricing and differentiating content sources meant the effective end of innovation periods for the telephone, radio, and cable television. None of these pricing models or tiered media devices has changed significantly in the past 20 years, and the fear is that the internet will be relegated to the same fate.

In my personal opinion, a lack of net neutrality can and will cause a lack of significant innovation in network traffic until the ""last mile"" of wiring is no longer necessary for internet access."

I would suggest using all three of these for harvesting.

I wouldn't stress about it too much.  If you obsess over farming, you'll likely derail your leveling quite a bit, which is a good way to suck the fun out of the game."

If it's just the ring/pinion that need to be replaced, you can buy a replacement set for about $200, and a setup kit for ~$100.  Labor for a single ring/pinion set is generally about $300 or so, but YMMV.

It doesn't matter if the custodial parent is the mother or father, if they are not paying what they should the state will sue them and garnish their wages.  The bottom line is that the Courts are a neutral system.  If fathers are losing custody more often than women, its because the Courts are consistently findings that the father cannot provide for the child as well as the mother can, not because there is some sort of sex bias.  I know this because I have helped fathers win custody many many times.  I have also seen fathers lose custody many many times, and it wasn't because of the Court, it was because they just didn't care enough to make the necessary changes that would allow them to properly care for a child.

That's correct, but (at least we were told by reps and resellers) that using anything other than OVM for virtualization would stick us with Per Proc+25 named users/proc licensing (essentially doubling the cost).

Only as long as failover can't touch anything remotely resembling to the Prod LUNs.  Anything more timely than flat-file restores was going to mean full licensing (proc and named user) for the failover equipment.

I'm glad he got that belt before he retired though- you could see how much it meant to him when the winner was announced.

I feel sorry for him since he was such a nice guy but I think he'll do pretty well for himself. He was Lee Purdy's cornerman in the Alexander fight and he was quite often a pundit when he was out injured last time. He's got a good head for the game."

A few things that stand out right off the bat - hmm, the banking district, the freaking bank of Punjab has a branch in London. Then there are other things like the guards at Buckingham Palace who are often switched out for guards of other countries like Malaysia. When was the last time you saw guards from Malaysia guarding the white house or downtown Manhattan? The fact of the matter is this, since England as a whole was a great conquering force and spread throughout the world to Honk Kong, India, Malaysia, Burma, the rest of the UK, Australia, and countless other places they have embraced the international audience far more than we have in America or in this case NYC. You are speaking purely from a population perspective and I'm taking into account the whole picture. 

and then there's this whole tid bit that I just copy pasta'd

London was the centre of the British Empire, the most powerful empire the world has ever seen, covering over 40 percent of the globe. This later became the Commonwealth, and due to this, so many from so many countries came to London, for them, the world's hub. 

There are more New York banks in London than in New York. In London you can trade with Tokyo in the morning, then New York and LA in the afternoon. Because it is always '12 o'clock' in London - it's officially the central point for the rest of the world. In New York, you can trade with London but Tokyo has gone to bed. That's why so many US banks have offices in London. Its geographic location on the globe enables its office hours to overlap with normal office hours for other countries across the world that account for 99 per cent of world GDP.

There are 550 overseas banks in London - more than any other city in the world.

More international telephone calls are made to and from London than any other point on the planet. 

London is the largest aviation hub in the world with Heathrow carrying more international passengers than any other airport in the world.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1389803741.0,"Here's the thing: you may not actually be doing a good thing for her by bridging the gap.

Assuming that you're providing a normal level of affection and commitment, her problem stems from her own insecurity and lack of confidence. She acknowledges that this is an internal problem within herself, not an external problem with the relationship. She wants to work it out, and she doesn't want you to change what you're doing.

With that in mind, you might ask yourself why you are going against her explicitly stated desires and want to change what you're doing. Providing her extra reassurance isn't going to help her insecurity, it's just going to enable it. She isn't going to be able to work this out if you're not listening to her when she tells you what she needs. This is about her getting comfortable with herself and your relationship. If you're putting a band-aid on the symptoms, the actual problem is never going to get dealt with.

Why not sit down with her and ask *her* how she wants to deal with this? I mean, I think it's always a good idea to choose one's words carefully in order not to intentionally hurt someone.

It is designed to remove small pockets of unwanted fat that is resistant to diet and exercise.  Most plastic surgeons will not even operate unless a patient is at or near their ideal body weight, and typically only a few pounds of fat are removed.  [Before and after example](http://www.nycosmeticmd.com/photo-gallery/details.cfm?ID=47&amp;StartRow=1) (NSFW).

There are several different types of weight loss surgeries that involve reducing the size of the stomach (Lap-Band, Gastric Bypass, etc.).

DERangEdKiller,AskReddit,1389803851.0,"When I went home for the summer, my twin had a hat with the sticker, and I told him if he's wearing it, then the value of first purchase is moot, and looks really stupid.

He got this really sad look on his face, took off the sticker and went outside for a cigarette.  When he closed the door my mom couldn't stop laughing, and told me how important that is in his circle of friends, and that she hadn't been able to make him do that for over a month.

devonclaire,triathlon,1389803861.0,"Thanks. Yeah, it's extremely frustrating!

The pool I've been going to is 25 meters long. This morning I swam 27 laps in 30 minutes. I feel like that's really slow, but the person in one of the lanes next to me was going much faster, and the person in the lane on my other side was going much slower. Feel free to tell me if that's pathetic, swimming isn't my thing so my feelings won't get hurt. Thanks so much for your help, lordrashmi. 

Edit: Half of those 27 laps were with a pool buoy, so I wasn't using my legs. This probably altered my time. Next time I'll watch the clock when I'm not using the buoy to get a more accurate time. 
 
Edit 2: When I say lap I mean two lengths of the pool. Maybe I'm not defining it correctly. "

shogi_x,television,1389803931.0,"I'm a big fan of The Wire, so naturally I watched Treme.  Tried to anyway.  While I enjoyed the characters (really, some of the most endearing characters I've seen in a while), the music, and the depth of culture on display, it was incredibly difficult to watch simply for the fact that I had no idea where it was going.  I went into each episode with no expectations, no hopes, and no fears.  Everything that typically makes me antsy for the next episode was totally absent.  That's not to say that I wasn't looking forward to anything- just that the usual draw was not there.  Eventually that made it difficult for me to keep watching, and ultimately my interest just tapered off.  

I tried to describe it to a friend once, and the best way I could explain was that Treme is a character driven mockumentary about the life and slow recovery in post-Katrina New Orleans.

There are some real golden glimpses of New Orleans culture in Treme but, to me, engrossing television it is not."

Trepanated,AskMen,1389803971.0,"A rule of thumb I've heard is based around the idea that women and men tend to respond differently to stress:  women by crying, men by telling.

And when a man sees a woman crying, he should treat the situation as if he were dealing with a man who is yelling.

I'm sure there are any number of failure states for this rule of thumb -- among other things, crying and yelling can be responses to situations other than stress.  Nevertheless it may be useful at times."

ipokebrains,todayilearned,1389804018.0,"So I'm going to try and ignore the snarky bullshit tone you put on everything as I can see it's kinda your modus operandi. Dealing with facts then. I'm not going to do an extensive literature review for you, but I'll link you to a couple of papers showing the relative importance of societal over genetic factors when looking at results of intelligence tests (not intelligence itself, as there is still some debate about how to define it and if it's really practically 'testable'). Here's one (ref: on twins, a great model for nature vs nurture), showing an estimated influence of environment (as opposed to genetics) at 60-70% for spatial and mathematical tasks. Further, there is an entire school of thought focused on the fact that behavioural outcomes are merely heritable, not necessarily deterministic, and therefore that the environment has a huge effect on how genetic differences manifest (ref). 

This does not take into account the difference between males and females, which we can assume is having an additional effect as we know that the sex differences in academic achievement have been narrowing along with increasing egalitarianism (ref). There is also a lot of evidence that specific training has the effect of minimising or completely erasing sex differences (ref).

Now there is some evidence that men are overrepresented at the tails of distributions (ie. both very high and very low achieving) (it's an oldie, but fairly representative ref). But this is not really relevant for most people (and therefore society as a whole), it's more that if you find the best and absolute worst couple of mathematicians in the world, they're likely to be men. For the vast majority, it's going to get pretty even pretty fast in terms of raw ability.

If you have some other literature that points to other conclusions (ie. that manage to separate social conditioning from genetic factors), I'd be happy to go through them and we can discuss them if you'd like. As far as I'm aware, such studies would be fairly impossible to carry out, so I'm going to stick with the scientifically defensible position that a large proportion of our tests for intelligence show a shrinking gap between the sexes as women are becoming better educated, and a large effect of environmental factors on cognitive ability (as measured by tests). 

This is my tl;dr: *The outliers of any given group at any given task shouldn't be used to justify a systematic inequality for the large middle ground that almost all of humanity inhabits. So yes, I'd expect that if were relying just on ability, men and women would be almost exactly equally represented in most things.*

If Uncle Bob is getting married, or Aunt Berta passes away, or Cousin Joe's kid is getting baptized, we're supposed to go.

So that fact that my ex went after black guys caught me off guard. It seemed that he was trying to do as many things as possible that his father would disapprove of, while being completely ashamed of who he was. 

The icing on the cake was that he emailed my mother telling her I was a cheating whore and that he left me, but that he still wanted to be apart of my son's life and tried to arrange visitation through her without telling me."

Nope, you're wrong.

We believe God, acting through priests, is the only One who can forgive sins or manifest the Real Presence in the Eucharist. We believe the Pope is the head of the Church on Earth (Christ being the ultimate Head of the Church), and we believe that we can (if we choose) pray to the Virgin Mary, immaculately conceived and sinless, to intercede for us to God the Father.

ZapActions-dower,AdviceAnimals,1389804242.0,"It's a virus.  Nothing causes it.  As far as can be traced, the virus crossed over from the SIV or Simian Immunodeficiency Virus in African monkeys to humans, probably through someone using a knife to cut infected meat and injuring themselves with that same knife later on.  This introduced the virus into their blood stream and they became infected with what is now known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus.

They spread the disease either by sexual contact or having their infected blood come into contact with an open sore or wound of an uninfected person.  The virus can be transmitted only in specific bodily fluids:  blood, semen, pre-cum, vaginal fluid, and breast milk.  The two most common ways to transmit it are through sexual contact and through the blood.  The reason anal sex is such a good transmitter of the disease is because the anus does not lubricate itself for sexual activity and also because the walls of the anus are less resilient.  Which means that unless you are very properly lubricated, you have a decent chance of causing microtears in the lining, basically small openings in the lining, smaller than a papercut.  Now, this isn't a big deal at all in normal circumstances and they'll heal very quickly, but they are openings that could allow viruses present in the semen or pre-cum to enter the body.  Anal sex between a man and either a man or a woman can transmit the disease equally well if the first man has the disease.  The receiving partner is less likely to transmit the disease to their partner.  Also, vaginal sex is less likely to have this issue, and chances in both cases are diminished with the use of a condom.  However, any sort of sex is dangerous if the area in question (be it vagina, anus, mouth, or hand) has a cut, open wound, or sore on it.  Any opening in the skin or inner lining could be a pathway for the virus.

The other major transmission vector is through direct blood to blood contact, most dangerously through sharing needles.  Hypodermics are *never* reused in hospitals because of this, and if you see a doctor or nurse reusing a needle, you need to stop them.  This is much more of a problem with people who use intravenous drugs such as heroin.  Be *very* careful of unidentified blood or needles you may find on the ground somewhere.  That's the worse thing you could prick or cut yourself on.

Does that help?  Do you have any other questions?"

Most people really will have a peak higher than 10 that's just the bare minimum needed to support a fertilized egg that's trying to implant. 

OP was questioning if she did ovulate based on what her doctor said. Based on her numbers she most certainly did ovulate, it's that she has weak ovulation or a problem with the corpus luteum and the drugs will help with that. If you look at the literature this is what you will find supported out there. 

This is not the first time I have heard of a doctor telling a patient anything less than a 10 doesn't confirm ovulation. That is flat out wrong and I don't know if they are misinformed or just trying to dumb it down for patients so they don't have to explain it.

Transit cops came on to do ticket checks, the guy said he didn't have one. They asked him for ID, he didn't have that. They asked him where he was going, he said ""Clackahamas"", which gave the cops a chuckle. They asked where he was from, he said Salt Lake City. He was really paranoid when talking to them, and they eventually just let him off the train to buy a ticket, but then I saw them run off the cab I was in to get in the next one, since they watched him walk into it.

Breakfast_King,swtor,1389804578.0,"Basically it's off-rails space pvp.

You choose between three different classes of ships: Strike Fighter, Scout, Gunship, and soon they are adding the Bomber.  You fly around and battle over three control points with up to 12 people on each team.  You earn a special currency by playing that you can use to buy different components and upgrades to your ships, and you choose a crew to give you special bonuses as well.  You can change ships every time you respawn.

It plays a lot more like an action game than an rpg, although you gear out sort of like an rpg and you have a few skills available.  It also is virtually unaffected by your character's level, so you can jump right in on your 40-something and start at the same place anybody else would.

The latter of which is the equivalent of winning a College Football conference championship, or maybe of advancing to an NFL conference championship game. The AAFC had 8 teams and played for 5 years.

They won the NFL championship in the following years: 1950,1954, 1955, 1964

In that time, the NFL had between 13 and 16 teams. So a championship there is more along the lines of winning a conference championship game and advancing to the Super Bowl.

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389804660.0,"&gt;However, the enemy's plan relied on the fact that he knew, years in advance, where M and everyone else relevant would be. 

He had double agents pretty much everywhere. It wouldn't be so far-fetched that they would be reporting on individual whereabouts. On top of that, he *was* an MI6 agent, so he knew the protocols.

&gt;He managed to hack into the computer of the head of MI6--which is not only very difficult but also probably impossible since it's probably not connected to the Internet.

No, I doubt it's not connected to the internet, regardless, he could have a wireless plant that connects it to such a thing. They probably have proxy servers to make it difficult, but if he has people working from the inside it wouldn't be that hard.

&gt;He knew that Q (who was just hired, at the time, meaning that the enemy wouldn't have known of him until late into his planning) would be smart enough to decrypt whatever he had but not smart enough to realize it was a trap.

Perhaps it was just an assumption. He didn't necessarily *know* it would work, he was counting on it and went along with his plan anyway. He *wants* to die in the movie, he's going to kill himself along with M because he wants to end everything. He doesn't ultimately care if he gets found out and killed, but he's going to try his damndest to get to his goal.

And in regards to Q, his smartness and arrogance is what did him in. He thought he was one of the smartest people out there in terms of computer and technological science, so he didn't even bother to *consider* that someone could be setting him up for something. Silva played on that, and quite frankly got lucky.

&gt;I find this even worse since it's not only stupid but also clearly extremely dangerous.

He had to isolate them from everyone else and set his own terms of battle. Silva held all the cards everywhere else. So Bond lured him out to a place where his technology wouldn't really help him and Bond could work it down to just him and Silva."

In your 20s you're responsible for making a lot of grown up decisions on your own without anyone hanging over your shoulder telling you that maybe you shouldn't because there is a possibility you might change your mind. Why should this be any different? I got a tattoo when I turned 18 that I mildly regret now, 8 years later, but I don't hold the tattoo artist responsible for doing something that I ended up regretting.

As that group approaches equality, the basis for defining their collective oppression requires reaffirmation using increasingly thinner substantiation.  Eventually whatever small differences remain must be greatly exaggerated to perpetuate the movement.  So modern feminism seeks identity and meaning in any little trifling difference in the female experience as a basis to define and justify feminism.


Where are the feminists that want to create gender equality by providing domestic abuse shelters for abused men the same as for women?  Where are the feminists that seek to throw out antiquated alimony laws?  Where are the feminists that seek to have female dominated professions opened up to men?  Where are the feminists that insist that police ought to treat women equally under the law (as in, when you attack someone you go to jail)?  I'll tell you.  There aren't any.  Why?  Because feminism is no longer about equality at its heart.  It sells as gender equality but it comes out as women wanting equal benefits but not so much with equal consequences under the law."

be *enthusiastic*.  communicate clearly what you want, observe the reactions you get from the things you do, and experiment.  talk about things before, during, and after coitus itself.  

don't watch porn to see how you should act during sex, do and say what comes naturally.  ""yeah yeah yeah"" isn't sexy.  uncontrolable moans are sexy.

you can be submissive or whatever, but **don't be passive.**  sex is a dance for two or more people, so even if you're on the bottom, work for it and make it better.

Have an idea of what you want, and be open to experimentation.  know what it takes to get you off.  It's ok to not like certain things.  be safe, and be choosy about your partners: sex without love is like love without sex.

detailed: 

when you're on top, rock forward and backward instead of just bouncing up and down (though that feels good too, you need to have a good idea of how far up you can go.  if the guy slips out and you land on him, it can really hurt).

ArchaeologyNerd,sex,1389804786.0,"I have always been really antsy about IUDs, but I got a Copper (non-hormonal) IUD inserted after finding out that birth control caused me to have severe migraines. It can be really difficult to find a good method of birth control when you have a migraine problem from the hormones because the Mirena (hormonal IUD), or the Rings, or many of those options also use hormones which can cause the same problems as the pill. Many of the new IUD's out are a lot safer than the ones from the past and have less than a 1/1000 chance of any complications that may require surgical removal. Where I live (In Canada) it's significantly cheaper than the hormonal IUD (mine was $62 as compared to around $350). Just putting this out there for people  considering IUD's. Though it does hurt like hell to get put in. It's nice not having to think about it as much. As for the bottom part that sticks out, that's a string made out of plastic that you can get cut shorter/usually softens after a few days post-insertion. Hope that helps! Also, I'm not a doctor, so, you know, ask a real one if you're considering it. Just sharing my experience."

Griemak,Fitness,1389804789.0,"I'm 36.  I find that if my diet is crappy for a few days in a row, I don't feel as well as I could.  Soreness and cramps are part of that.  I usually have to deload when that happens which can mess with motivation a bit when you get caught up in numbers.  I also found out that I'm low on vitamin D and zinc from a physical I had, so I started taking a multivitamin.  I can solidly say this had no impact for me.  As long as I keep my schedule solid, eat well (not perfect, just well, at least 50g of fats per day helps a ton here), and deload properly instead of pushing through failures: I don't have soreness, at all.  That is not to say that some days I wake up a bit more stiff and creekity; nothing a good stretch doesn't fix...

Can you solidify your schedule at all?  The more days off you have, the more you have to go through DOMS all over again.

Is your diet good?  Could get a physical and rule out deficiencies and other issues... just in case.

Is your program good FOR YOU???  You may need to tweak it a bit.  As I age, I have to incorporate deloads more frequently (but do not need to back off the intensity as much)."

TheFarnell,Quebec,1389804878.0,"&gt; La question n'est pas là. Le problème est qu'un symbole religieux n'est pas neutre, il exprime une vision de l'autre. Et dans le cas de l'Islam, c'est entres autres une vision extrêmement offensante des athées et des homosexuels qui est véhiculée.

Voilà le problème.  Si on demande au gouvernement d'intervenir contre la présence de symboles religieux parce qu'ils sont perçus comme offensants, c'est parce qu'on demande au gouvernement de *définir l'intention d'une religion*.  Ça, c'est inacceptable dans une société qui garde l'état et la religion séparés.

&gt; Tu prends pour acquis que la personne portant un symbole religieux choisira son symbole plutôt que son emploi. Je ne le crois pas.

Plusieurs le font, pour tant.  Et ceux qui le feront, iront où?  Certainement pas dans les bras des valeurs de la société qui vient de leur imposer un choix déchirant et leur couter leur emploi.  Dépourvus et fâchés, ils se tourneront vers les fondamentalistes de leur religion - après tout, pour eux, la rhétorique combative des ""méchants blancs qui en veulent aux pauvres musulmans"" prendra facilement racine.

&gt;  One of the effects of the sex-obsession in **our culture**

""Sex-obsession"" is not a cultural thing.  It is a human thing.  Our brains are wired to be obsessed with sex.  I'd be very interested if there were a culture in existence that didn't obsess about sex(at least as inwardly as we do, if not as outwardly).  Chances are, it would be far more sex positive of a culture than ours, as we have seen the more we try to repress and shame human sexuality, the more it fights back and manifests itself in day to day life and culture. 

&gt; And people are not capable of expressing a total and mutual gift of self to each other through homosexual sex acts.

I'm not gay but I would find this a very preposterous argument.  Your point seems to be that since gay men can't get pregnant or both opposite sex organs aren't involved, that some how the emotional aspect is lacking as well.  Coupled with the fact that **people are born gay and cannot change that preference**, as has been proven time and time again, it should be obvious a person's capacity for total love is not limited by their ability to have unprotected heterosexual intercourse.

Or the concept that pregnancy must be possible for it to be a fully loving act is absurd.  What if a woman doesn't want to get pregnant?  Should we tell her that she is in cable of full pure love?  Your argument seems to convict equally those who use contraception as those who are for all intents and purposes sterile.  

I do appreciate your explanation because it seems to be a good representation of the catholic church's stance, but the argument falls flat when it dictates and measures a person's capacity for true love.  Your definition of Natural Law highly is flawed because it doesn't hold up to the test of reality.  "

azoenophile,relationship_advice,1389804931.0,"Both. 

If you feel love in a particular way, he should make a concerted effort to make you feel loved. If his love language is different than yours, you need to communicate you love him in the way he wants to be loved. It's also helpful to know your partner's language so you are able to see when they do certain things that it is an act of love for them. It's easiest for them to demonstrate love in that way, so you should try to see that behavior as loving/caring. 

You're not asking him to change the core of who he is. You're asking him to communicate his love to you in a way that you feel loved. If he's not willing to make those sacrifices now, I doubt he will be twenty years from now when you are both complacent. Now is the time you should be deciding if you are getting what you need from the relationship. It's normal to expect him to love you in a particular way once you communicate that. If he isn't willing to put in effort in that way or tries to make it about him (""but you're trying to change me!""), it will only get worse. "

An educated guess on what's going on based on your description:

It sounds like what's happening is RES can't run until page load is complete, and Safari apparently no longer says ""hey, page load is complete!"" until all assets load. Since adblock is blocking stuff from loading, RES can't start.

That's why if you wait long enough (a couple minutes or so you said), eventually RES loads -- because there's a timeout where Safari eventually says ""ok, I'm not getting that asset. I'm done."""

[This is a map](http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.texastribune.org/media/images/statewide_elections_98-08_JPG_800x1000_q100.JPG) made by the Texas Tribune showing how Texans vote. Blue is for Democrat and Red is for Republican. 

[This is a map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Texas_population_map2.png) of Texas by population. As you can see where the population is concentrated is where most people in the state vote Democratic except for in the south. 

Gerrymandering has kept the purple/blue creep almost invisible up until now. If you want info on that just google ""Texas gerrymandering"" and it'll bring up a whole host of shit. The Republicans totally redid the districts to give themselves an absurd advantage when the Democrats started to catch up with them in the state legislature. 

In fact [here is a link](http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legeleaders/members/memberstatistics.cfm) that shows that between the years of 2009 and 2011 the number of Republicans shot up and the number of Democrats disappeared. In 2009 the number was 74 Democrats and 76 republicans. In 2011 it changes to 49 Democrats and 101 republicans. 

You can also see a discrepancy between the numbers between 2001 and 2003 which was also the year Tom Delay and the Texas GOP got in a huge amount of trouble for redistricting. If the Texas GOP hadn't been redrawing the lines for their benefit for the past decade Texas would already be purple. 

[Here](http://www.thenation.com/blog/174652/texas-redistricting-fight-shows-why-voting-rights-act-still-needed) is an article summing up the redistricting history. There are better ones out there if you look though. There was even one Democrat candidate that was literally written out of his own district. Had his house literally cut from his own district so he couldn't run. "
JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389805081.0,"&gt; Why is this? 

1) Better education....average worker hasn't taken econ 101 and knows competition is only good to a point. Businesses will try not to compete if doing so harms their long term interest...price wars are bad for business, but common place among the worker side of things.

2) MOre of them. There are only so many businesses and job openings, but there are a TON of workers clamoring to get jobs.

3) Desperation. You need a job more than the job needs you. You're replaceable, but your job isn't. Losing you is a drop in the bucket for them, while it means the world to you if you don't have a job.

&gt;How does artificially mandating more worker benefits solve this problem?

By making them pay more, duh.

&gt;Well, what happens if that wealth does not actually exist to the degree the legislation says employers must pay out? 

This will generally be the exception to the rule rather than the rule, and we should not let something that only affects a small portion of businesses near the brink cloud our thinking of the greater good for all.

&gt;Layoffs, offshoring, etc., that is the consequence.

So,...we should just eliminate the minimum wage and let our corporate overlords abuse us instead? That seems to be what the opposition is gunning for, and I say we don't negotiate with hostage takers. The right seems to want us to engage in race to the bottom thinking, that because banana republics and the likes of china make their workers work long days in sweatshops for little pay, we should do to remain ""competitive."""

At this point, buy what you can afford, and maybe if you can afford to buy a few bigger ones second hand, you can have those at the ready when you wake up one day one or two hormonal cycles later or so and realize you're a cup or two bigger than before you went to bed.

JustLike2Share,BipolarReddit,1389805086.0,"I love my Latuda, 80 mg. It really helps with my depression as well as my thoughts. I need an antipsychotic because my depressive episodes include psychosis, so Latuda fights both for me. It is not my only medicine though. 

Other antipsychotics that worked for me were Risperdal 40mg and Invega 3-6mg. My other experiences with those listed: Abilify (starter dose) was ineffective and too stimulating, leading to insomnia. Geodon (starter dose) was also too stimulating, inducing hypomania within a week's use. It took 6 days inpatient hospitalization to stabilize after going off of Geodon. Seroquel 400mg was too sedating to perform regular daily tasks/function on a standard level, but it was effective. However, I missed 2-3/5 days per week of my sophomore year of high school due to being unable to wake up. I would also fall asleep in class when I did attend. I switched from Lithium 900mg as my mood stabilizer to Lamictal 400mg and feel a million times more clear headed. I also look less swollen since I was having some serious chipmonk cheeks on Lithium. 

Other knowledge: Zyprexa is the holy grail of weight gainers. Depakote can be sedating, but works well if you cannot tolerate Lamictal. But if you are on Lamictal, I don't see why you would need Depakote added. When on Lithium, you would most likely have less side effects on Lithium Carbonate. I don't know anything about Tegretol or Saphris besides that there is no generic for Saphris. Also very important: there is no generic available for Latuda either, so it can be pricey even with insurance."

Now the ISPs can discriminate any way they want. We're not sure what they might try, but there's potential for some things in the future:
* Sell you packages of websites like satellite or digital cable channels.
* Put websites on a low-tier service unless they pay a fee per user.
* Slow down traffic that originated outside their network
* Block services to try to force you to use their own, such as blocking or slowing netflix to promote redbox."

Fizjig,wiiu,1389805149.0,"After I wrote this I sat down and played about 30 minutes of ZombiU. Not a great choice for me as that game is super stressful, and nerve wracking. 30 minutes was about all I could deal with playing that game and then I was burnt on playing anything else.

I picked up a couple of other games I didn't previously have to give myself something different to do recently. I tried NFS, but hated the controls. I think I just need to wait for Project Cars. 

I've also picked up a couple independent titles from the E-shop. So far Little Inferno is pretty fun, but I found myself getting bored with it after about 45 minutes. 

I have been playing W101 off and on for a long time now, but I have to admit with that game you either ""get it"", or you just don't. I'm slowly progressing through the game, but not because I'm good at it, it's more because even if you die a bunch of times it lets you continue until you figure it out. On a couple of occasions the instructions were so vague on where I was supposed to go, or what I was supposed to do I found myself Googling it just to get an answer. I'm all for games not holding your hand, but if I have to go to a different medium just to figure out how to complete basic moves that is a flaw in game design. 

I gave this a ton of thought and what I really want more than anything is a game Like Dragon Quest. A big sweeping RPG style adventure for the Wii U. I have WWHD, but its not really the same thing. WW as with most Zelda games are quite linear, but are disguised as open world.

That is arguably correct.  However, I don't recall reading about patient's rights in the Bill of Rights.  There is an established hierarchy here.

 You'd have to ask the secular parents of a circumcised child why they made the decision, but I *can* tell you why the state doesn't intervene- there is no substantial interest in doing so for the state.  By contrast, FGM causes far more harm for no established benefit.  It is not an equivalent procedure, no matter how many times anti-circumcision people make the comparison.  Also, I can't name a single religion that calls for FGM, but even if there were one, there would be a state interest in intervening because unlike circumcision, FGM is not harmless."

Sir_Fancy_Pants,todayilearned,1389805298.0,"it is a completely invalid and unreasonable approach to believe that due to a handful of experiments on identical twins (genetic clones), that some difference on a specific metric allows you to extrapolate and quantify the effect of societal conditioning for all of society in all areas.

This betrays the very understanding of a complex system, there isn't even an irrefutable link that a conventional IQ test or spacial reasoning score directly relates to increased performance in a real world task.

It could be perfectly reasonable to suggest that actually he or she who scores lower on the test might do so due to consideration of some other metric that has positive advantages in other areas.

Lets not overstretch and pretend you can expand out the very limited and minuscule experiment and think it highlights and shows more than it does.

By virtue of the system under consideration it is impossible to isolate and therefore quantify societal influence on an individual and expand this to the population at large (its even impossible with identical twins as there societal exposure remains unknown unless they were raised and born in the lab under carefully controlled conditions).

basically your data points are invalid and they are as invalid as saying because it rained today it will rain again exactly the same in 1 years time (the quality of your ""evidence"" betrays the complexity of the system under consideration) 

however what you highlight in terms of the population of extremes i certainly agree with (but this can equally be explained  through genetic ""theory"" quite easily ), but surely you can recognise leadership such as president or CEO and other highly sought after or converted position represent extreme states. so one would expect to see a higher population of males in highly desirable leadership and powerful roles. yet under your belief this should be prevented as you want a false 50:50 forced quota.

There is no question that men and women have minor similarities , but should the role dictate a selection criteria that these differences are of merit then the best candidate should be filled to the role.

This is also completely ignoring the free choice women have of raising children, and should they engage and wish to do so (of which a large majority do) you cannot expect any significant time off you willingly take to not influence your career.

if two candidates are completely equal, yet one has 1 year less experience, you will go with the greater experienced candidates its just common sense.

I'm guessing the churches you've grown up in are liberal mainline Protestant? For the most part, they do indeed seem welcoming to Catholics and respectful of our beliefs but remember that there are plenty of creeds that hold that Catholics aren't Christian and the Pope is the Antichrist (among other things). Those are the denominations that I really have a difficulty with, rather than (for instance) Anglicans and Methodists.

by_a_pyre_light,Battlefield,1389805394.0,"Well, your problem is your play style. You just admitted to being part of the sniper problem, sitting back at a far distance to try to take pot shots. Your *perception* is that's what everyone else is doing, but it's not the case. Your issue is that you've been relying on the Doritos in Normal to locate people when sniping, and now that they're gone, you're having a hard time finding people. You'll need to train yourself away from that crutch if you want to continue sniping in HC. Instead of focusing on snipers, watch the objectives and pin people as they come in. 

Or, be useful, PTFO, and try to actually capture objectives and be a forward player like others. You can still use recon class and be usuful by deploying the spawn beacons forward to help clear rooflines. You can use sensor balls to rack up tons of points, even if you don't get the mini map to see it.  

The best option, though, is to try another class. If you're telling me that you suck at a class, try a different one. 

I run as Engineer and Support. In Engineer, I use a FLIR-scoped PP2000 to quickly acquire targets and drop them. The enemies show up **bright** white against a black background. Can't miss 'em, and with a silencer, they'll never know where I'm shooting from. I get points for kills and anti armor actions, as well as repair actions.

As a support class, I use a canted site LMG w/200 round mag, so I can go close range or distance. I deploy ammo for teammates, and I lock capture points down with claymores and heavy MG fire. 

Play to your strengths and support the team. 

Finally, you mention your TV- what console are you on? PS3, Xbox 360, and Xbox One all have issues with AA, and good AA is essential for seeing people at a distance. AA basically reduces all the jaggies, which means target acquisition is easier, because with lots of jaggies (aliasing), objects and people at a distance become a blurred mess that runs together. So, good AA like on the PC, will mean the difference between IDing a target and not seeing someone. A bigger TV won't help with that. "

nostalgicBadger,INTP,1389805489.0,"Honestly -- and don't let this dissuade you, if that's really what you want to do -- but if you're a competent programmer, game development is one of the worst places to be. The pay is generally way below standard for the field, 60-80 hour work weeks are not uncommon during crunch time, and it's common practice to lay off most of the development team after launch, so there's little job security. Again, if you're passionate about it, go for it, but there are probably other areas that you would also find rewarding, and you could always work on indie projects on the side.

Otherwise, the best advice I can give is that it's never too soon to start building a portfolio.

Oh my god! My boyfriend, with no prompting, once tentatively asked if I would be OK with the idea of some ""light role play"" where we just imagine that he's impregnating me while we're fucking... I literally thought he had somehow found out that I was really into that (I don't think I'd talked about it on reddit before so I was confused as all hell) but DAMN SO PERFECT! Hallelujah! I wasn't even the first to bring it up!! He's only mentioned it a couple times since then, in passing (I'm not sure if he realizes how much I'm into it...lol) but oh my god, even that little amount has been *so so so* endearing to me &lt;3

I like how impregnation fantasy is both sexy and romantic. Like, it's not only about owning and claiming

&gt;After all, what says to the world ""I've claimed this female"" more than putting a baby in her?

(me gusta)

...but it's also super romantic because it heavily implies the whole ""mated pairbonding"" thing that humans do. It's basically roleplaying not only the claiming of a body but of the forging of a potential life-long commitment. Holy hell!

&gt;Also I like imagining I'm a preggers cowgirl, with an extra set of breasts and udders and all that. There is appeal is being dehumanized and humiliated.

I'll admit I've masturbated to this idea more than once. I used to be really into hentai with women kept pregnant like dairy cows, with their breasts hooked up to pumps. Ahh, the golden days of porn in high school lol"

**Edit: Here ya go! I wrote the story and realized at the end that I made them homes rather than an apartment. My bad! :/**  
  
  
Life is full of patterns. As a child, you grow used to the consistency of your parent coming in as the sun rises, laying out the days clothes and making sure no belly is unfed by the time the noon bell rang. You grow, and soon you are out the door by nine in the morning every Saturday to hang out with the kid down the block, stalking the same stomping grounds before your arrive home at curfew, and not a moment later. Time flies and you're also flying, down the interstate at ninety miles an hour like you always do because you have a knack for speed, and you've never been able to shake it. Teenage impulsiveness morphs itself into a full time job, manicured and pressed to conform to the nine to five mold that pays the bills. Then, out of nowhere, you're in your thirties and looking out the bay window of your new home, watching your neighbor tend to the same bed of flowers as every other day, wondering how you'd let time escape you.

Like clockwork, around seven each morning after the neighborhood kids are off to school and surrounding neighbors are in their respectable homes tending to chores of their own, Achilles Jørgensen, or as he introduces himself, ""Jørge of Norge, It's-a-college-thing-that-stuck"", meanders to his back yard tool shed and gathers his needed gardening supplies. From there, he will proceed to the southern garden that has seemingly statuesque waves grown into it so that you were momentarily convinced the garden bed were rolling hills. And each day, after pulling the weeds and providing some much needed water in the spring heat, which according to the residents is rather unusual for this time of year, he wipes the sweat from his brow and arranges the flowers in a way that covers each of the egress windows. When he looks pleased with his work, he returns the tools to the shed and disappears into the house by approximately 12:30. From there, the yard lies in silence until the sun sets and the shouting takes over.

During the unloading of the hauling trucks a month earlier, Jorge and his wife Svanhild, an admittedly beautiful norwegian couple in first impression, made it a point to introduce themselves with the passing of a decorative cutting board crafted by Jorge, topped with a Troika cake that Svan had baked herself. They stressed that it was the least they could do as far as house warming, as Svan often has night terrors that are regrettably noticeable from the outside world, and has had a history of wandering in her sleep. This had been the reason the last resident of my home had left after only a few months stay, though the topic was dropped there. They insisted that I come to them if any of these occurrences became too disturbing, which I agreed to do despite knowing that my niceness would quickly overpower the thought of intrusion on another's personal matter. I told them I was no stranger to sleep disorders and to kindly return the favor, as my insomnia often meant lit windows, background music, and movement late into the night. The groundwork of coexistence worked out, we shook hands and I parted to do some unpacking.

For weeks, little sound emerged from the home except the occasional yelling and shouting I'd attributed to most fighting couples. In the morning, a cup of coffee in my hand, I stopped to look out the bay window towards the distant hills, catching sight of Jorge during his gardening routine. I had been up for four days, the coffee merely an object of comfort at this point, and the idea of watching something other than television or Netflix for the hundredth time was greatly appealing. Jorge went about as usual, gathering tools from the shed and stationing himself in front of the garden bed. How he found something to do each day was beside me, but I could appreciate a fellow human with motivation. After a few minutes Jorge turned his head and the pattern unraveled as I saw Svan who had, by then, exited the back door of their home and started walking towards the tool shed. I could hear his shout as he stood up and tried to get Svan's attention, but she continued towards the shed as if he were a brush of wind. He ran and stepped in front of her, grabbing her shoulders and shaking her a little harder than I would have thought necessary, causing her to start screaming and flailing her limbs as he nearly dragged her into the house with an expression of grief and disappointment on his face. The yelling continued inside the house for a couple more hours and when things quieted down, Jorge emerged to put away his tools and close up the shed, right back into routine.  
  
By five o'clock that night my vision started getting foggy as my eyes lolled around in my head every five minutes. Static patterns morphed into buzzing lines, nearby sounds appearing distant and distant sounds undoubtedly close - I was getting to that dreadful point of my insomniac trip where I'm no longer behind the wheel. Delirious episodes a rather infrequent occurrence, as most sleepless bouts lasted only a couple days at most, differentiating between reality and dreams was almost impossible. I turned all of the lights off, sprawling out on the couch with a fan on high blast to counteract the heat seeping through the windows. A streetlight across the road cast a glowing ray onto the coffee table, illuminating the slide of my 9mm sitting gracefully on the edge. My partner in crime, though never used for more than plinking.  

""I wonder if you and I will ever have our day together. I can tell you're anticipating it as much as I am."" I said, wielding the gun to aim at an imaginary enemy on the ceiling. The gun was begging me to shoot, but I knew better. 
  
Almost on cue, the sound of distant shouting overtook the fan's blades. At first I thought it was a trick of my mind, but then the sound came again, this time louder. The shouts more urgent and louder than ever before. I climbed off of the couch and flipped the fan off, silence filling my ears and leaving me with an intense feeling of vulnerability. Unable to squash it, I held the gun tighter and started in a slow crawl to the window until I was eye level with the sill. Only darkness from their house, except a faint glow of light from behind his flower bed.  

Out of seemingly nowhere, a blood curdling scream broke through the night air and cut right to my bone - a scream I was not familiar with in the months I'd lived here. I jumped up and ran for the kitchen to grab my cell phone, unsure if I would need it but damn certain I wouldn't risk being without it. When I returned to the living room, the screaming had stopped. The egress windows were now blacked out, the entire house sleeping in the night, or so it seemed. After a longer look I noticed an inconsistency - the shed door was now hanging wide open.  
  
""Should we do something?"" I asked, the gun getting warmer in my hand with agreement. ""But, what if we get caught? What if something crazy is happening over there?""  
  
A voice in the back of my head spoke up, *We'll be fine. You've got me, remember?*  
  
I looked down at the gun glistening in the moonlight, unsure of who to trust, ""But, it's their business. Plus, what would the cops think? Some crazy insomniac out to serve vigilante justice...""  
  
A pause, *What if you do nothing... one of them could be hurt.*  
  
""And what if I do *something*? There might not even be a problem... we've been here before..."" The worry and apprehension was apparent in my voice. The memories of pills and white-washed walls and a faint odor of disinfectant all combined to create a knot in my stomach. I couldn't go back there.  
  
*With me, you have all the power. You know this.*
  
I did know. Staring the gun straight in the eye, I took care of the only problem I was certain of, and man, does sleep feel like heaven. "

A pretty typical definition of a cult is a sufficently deviant or novel religious body, that often commits crimes or otherwise harms it's followers. 

Of course, what counts as ""Sufficiently deviant or novel"" could depend on anyone. Is the Westboro Baptist Church a cult because they're pretty special? How about the Heavens Gate, or the Jehovah's Witnesses? 

I suppose a slightly more touchy-feely way to draw a distinction could be to say that religions help people find faith, but cults use the human sense of faith to take advantage of people. Think of a cult as a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"". It looks like a religion, it involves faith like a religion. However, once you start to dig a bit deeper, you'll find outright malicious and nefarious intent. "

I understand what you're saying, but I dont think most non-Americans realize how sparsely populated the Midwest or Western states are. 

I will say, city transit systems are much more difficult to build/maintain in sprawled out cities, we deal with that quite a bit. But the reason high speed rail does not exist between most US cities is because its nowhere near economically feasible. Amtrak loses significant amounts of money every year, so the federal government is wary of expanding the money-losing venture. 

As a Chicagoan I would love high speed rail connections to the rest of the country (we're kind of off by ourselves), but its not economically feasible, even with a metro area of 9.5 million at one end. I'm stuck flying through one of the world's busiest airports to get out, or driving. I realize Australia's density is even less, but with how expensive high speed rail is per kilometer, connecting the majority of US cities would not be profitable. They are working on high speed rail on the East and West coasts, but most of us are out of luck."

- You can only track 5 quests at a time. To track the 6th daily quest, go directly to your journal and click Map to find the location.

You might find [this explanation](http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/maryc4.htm) useful. As it says, if you are comfortable with asking sinners on Earth to pray for you, why would you not ask the Mother of God in Heaven to pray for you?

You're right, though, that we do not pray ""to"" Mary in the same way that we pray to Jesus. Mary herself cannot grant requests, she can only ask God to do so.

&gt;Where does it say in the Bible that Mary was sinless? Have I missed that somewhere?

[Luke 1:28] is the strongest evidence we have. If the Creator of all things decides to send His Son to Earth, selects a woman to bear Him and then sends down an Archangel to tell her that she is ""full of grace"" or ""highly favoured"" (depending on your preferred translation), doesn't it stand to reason that He would select a sinless vessel for this? How could the Son of God be born of a sinner? 

You may not know that Catholics do not hold to *sola scriptura*: instead, we follow the Sacred Tradition passed down to us by the Apostles, from which the Bible is drawn.

PirateCodingMonkey,askgaybros,1389805823.0,"&gt; Sex is huge - I know. Is it so big that throwing away everything else is the correct thing to do? I don't see why two bottoms cannot work..

sex is **not** the only part of a relationship. if it were, then many, many straight couples would have divorced/broken up after years together. even gays in long-term relationships go through periods where sex is less important.

the question is, is sex the main component of your relationship? is it what defines your relationship? if you didn't have sex with your guy (say it was medically impossible for some reason) would that be a deal breaker? if it is, then yes, you should probably move on.

yes, two bottoms can work, but you may need to take anal play off the table, or allow a 3rd to come in from time to time.

&gt; This is my first relationship - this is his. He has been with 80+ people I have been with him.

assuming that you meant ""this is not his first relationship"" above. however, saying he has been with ""80+"" men is not saying that he's been in a relationship before. i've been with several men (i doubt it's anywhere near 80+ but nothing wrong with that, as long as he's been careful) but i've only been in a ""relationship"" with 4 or 5. a relationship is more than a hook-up or even a fuck-buddy. it's about spending time together, being there for your mate, taking the good with the bad.

i know of successful gay relationships where both men are submissive and bottoms. it just means adjusting your expectations and realizing that sex is only a small part of a relationship.

&gt; We talked last night for 8 hours and it turned into ""I need to think about this relationship because we aren't satisfying each others needs even though we satisfy everywhere else""

in this case, i would suggest two things. first, you need to relax. you are anxious because you are afraid you won't be able to satisfy him. stop trying so hard. take anal play off the table for now. if he wants to be satisfied anally, you can buy a toy and get him off that way. work on building your confidence. second, once your relationship is more stable, be willing to open up the relationship. this involves communications, trust, and setting rules. being open doesn't mean that he doesn't love you or find you attractive. it means that you realize that you can't meet all of your lover's needs - which is a fact no matter who you are in a relationship with. (in a closed relationship, you will still have times where your partner doesn't meet all your needs, but you sacrifice those needs for the sake of the relationship.)

the good thing here is this: you are talking about it with him. keep talking and exploring options. be open to what he has to say and be truthful with him about how you are feeling. if you love each other, you will work it out. all the best to you."

&gt; as you want a false 50:50 forced quota.

I at no point advocated a forced quota, my original comment actually pointed out how such a system could be damaging.

&gt; There is no question that men and women have minor similarities 

The point I was making (and that is supported by every piece of scientific evidence I can find - the stuff you then just summarily dismiss based on nothing), is that men and women are FAR more similar than they are different, even with existing societal pressures pushing us in separate directions.

&gt; This is also completely ignoring the free choice women have of raising children, and should they engage and wish to do so (of which a large majority do) you cannot expect any significant time off you willingly take to not influence your career.

This is a interesting issue, and in response I advocate what a lot of countries are now considering or have implemented - shared parental leave so that no one gender is shouldering more of the burden (or getting more of the joy) of raising children.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389805857.0,"&gt; because you think this. i do not. don't push your beliefs onto me and others.

Well, you seem to be trying to push yours....seems to be we're at a quandry in that respect.

&gt;true, but marginal rates on ordinary income come in much closer to 40-50%. and when you want to put a flat tax on everyone without any loopholes or deductions, that is going to be the rate you are going to see on ordinary income, which is just plain ridiculous. it seems to be a theme for any kind of basic income: stupidity and ludicrousness.

Marginal rates mean nothing if there are loopholes around them. My idea brings those rates closer to being in line with Europe, say, 30something%. 

&gt; that is going to be the rate you are going to see on ordinary income, which is just plain ridiculous.

Not really, considering EVERYONE recieves basic income. 

Say you make $15k (full time min wage). You pay $6k and then you get $15k. You go home with a total of $24k. Say you make $30k. You pay $12k, and get back $15k, so you actually go home with $33k. Say you make $50k. You pay $20k, but pay $15k. That's a 10% tax. Say you make $100k. You pay $40k and get back $15k, so you end up paying 25%. Say you make $500k. You pay $200k, get back $15k, and only pay 37.5%.

The tax is progressive in practice. And that's only on ONE income earner. If you have a couple, you have 2 people recieving UBI so you can either get $30k in checks every year, or if you want, I guess you could treat UBI itself as a deduction. 

So $50k for a married couple? (this is median household income btw). They pay $20k, get back $30k, and make $60k. A median household income with 2 adults will effectively be TAX FREE under such a system. 

I know UBI seems crazy at first, but it could work in practice. Seriously. I ran the numbers myself. Granted, they're only rough numbers that may not apply well to unforeseen consequences you may encounter in real life, but UBI is very doable.  And it would likely benefit 80% of the population.

Also, welfare trap, you heard of it? Yeah, when you work and you're on welfare, you lose all your benefits, where you effectively pay like a 100% tax in your income (lose as much as you gain). UBI fixes that. WHich is why it has the flat tax. It's flat because it's meant to claw back the benefits in a fair and efficient way. 

Also, you do realize that UBI would replace social security, welfare, etc. right? I assume universal healthcare though, because giving money for health insurance instead of just covering everyone would be inefficient. We'd be spending as much a we would no universal healthcare, with worse results since everyone would only be able to afford those bargain basement bronze plans or whatever."
madhjsp,nfl,1389805858.0,"I went to UVA while he was our offensive coordinator, so here are my thoughts from a comment I made in the ""Lazor to Lions"" thread yesterday:  

&gt; Lazor ran a very traditional pro-style offense, somewhat conservative for the most part, but nonetheless fairly effective. We won 8 games in 2011, our best season with him on board. That year, he got surprisingly good production out of a pretty unheralded QB in Michael Rocco, a decent-at-best set of RBs, and a receiving corps lacking any real stars or physical types.

&gt; I always felt that he had a good head for coaching, a decent feel for playcalling, and a knack for coming up with solid game plans that our team could execute well, despite relatively limited offensive talent. As I see it, he was mostly held back by two major factors:

&gt; 1) Aforementioned limited talent. He never got the chance to work with a reliable QB at Virginia, or anything better than passable RBs and possession receivers. Now he'll have Stafford, Bush &amp; Bell, and Megatron et al.

&gt; 2) Our head coach, Mike London, has to be one of the worst in college football. Long story short, he insisted on QB rotations with mediocre backups, when it was clear that Lazor's offense functioned better with a single starter. Lazor left after 2012, and we won 2 games in 2013 behind an offense that was almost completely unwatchable. And somehow London didn't get canned, but that's a subject for another post on another sub...

&gt; Bottom line: I liked what I saw in Lazor's ability to design an offense with limited talent in college, so I think this is a good move for the Lions, given their wealth of riches on that side of the ball.  

This was in response to a comment from /u/tee2green, another UVA alum who made these points:  

&gt; We always had a pretty decent offense despite not having a whole lot of talent. We had QB Michael Rocco carry us to 4 straight wins in 2011 and our first road win at FSU in a loooong time.

&gt; His offenses were pretty vanilla though. Loved to run the ball. Almost always 11 or 12 personnel. One guy goes in motion striaght across the formation. Single back power runs. Loved the rollout dumpoff to the TE. Guaranteed 5-6 yards.

So while my main thoughts were kind of Lion-centric, I still think my main point stands, that he's competent enough to design a solid offense even if there are some personnel limitations. Tannehill will be the best QB he's ever worked with as a coordinator by a mile, so while his offense may not be incredibly flashy by its nature, I have high hopes for him and wish him success with you guys.

Hola-Mateo,IWantToLearn,1389805903.0,"Something that helped me tremendously after voice lessons was learning how to properly warm up before singing.

A great excersize to warm up your pipes is to start at the lowest note you are comfortable singing, then play the first 5 notes of that scale while singing along with an ""Ahh"" sound, then back down to the 1. Straight to the 5th then down to the 1 with out hitting any of the notes between. Do this chromatically as you move up in pitch. 

Once you go as high as you can go, try starting over with an ""Oh"" sound and ""Ee"" sound.

Try this for 10 minutes a day and you'll notice your range, dexterity, and vocal quality improve dramatically! 
Also singing after your warm up will sound much better on the whole as well!

Good luck!"

I've been pregnant twice - had an abortion when I was 21 and a child when I was 37.

I made the right choice when I was 21 - but it still WASN'T EASY.  ***Nobody wants to have an abortion.***  It's a constant fight between what *you think* you logically know vs what your body wants to do vs. grim reality and an honest analysis of what you are capable of.  

I was really good at being pregnant.  I was strong, I had focus, I was able to completely stop all of my bad habits with ease (smoker for 15 years?  No problem, I quit immediately).  It was like I was, I don't know, *built for this*?  (please read in a very sarcastic tone).  

There are lots of things in this world that when you look at from afar, the answer seems easy but once you're in the situation and are really dealing with it, are much more complicated.

Example?  The asshole pro-life conservative whose daughter/wife/mistress had an abortion.  In his public life, abortions were bad, horrible, worst thing ever.  Make it personal and his views change completely (while still trying to take the right away from others).

Elessar20,Guildwars2,1389806020.0,"Story time? Nice! 

So I've been quite a bit of a farmer because I like to be able to purchase the really cool or expensive stuff. I farmed my Volcanus in under one week and transmutated it onto a ascended greatsword. I've often thought about getting a Legendary for my warrior but was unsure which one to get: Twilight or Sunrise. They both look incredible but in the end I didn't want to farm hardcore for a month or probably even more to get it. 

While browsing /r/Guildwars 2 I've encountered some of the mystic forge threads that were showing stats about precursor crafting and how many attempts you will need in average. Being a pretty lucky guy to this day in Guild Wars 2 I thought to myself 'why not challange my luck? I'm sitting on 130 gold right now and don't have any new goals that I'd have to save up for'. So I bought some rare greatswords for 50g and threw them right into the mystic forge. Around 30 swords in I get Dusk. At first I couldn't believe it but then I was confronted with my old disunity whether to get Sunrise or Twilight. 

I thought I already made my decision and put Dusk onto the trading post, paying 45g listing fee. After a week of watching videos of Twilight and how awesome it is I rethought my choice and took it off, wondering why the hell I don't get my gold back. That's how I learnt that the listing fee isn't anything to be trifled with and was pretty frustrated after. 

So Dusk was already half the battle, I'd have to *just* get the materials and map completion, right? Boy, how wrong I was. After some research I stumbled  over gw2legendary.com and decided to use it because you could see your actual progression. Then I realized how much work I still had to do. 250 ectos? 77 mystic clovers? 250 of EVERY T6 mat? Map completion and 250 obsidian shards?! Damn, this is huge. I started to make a plan of how I should get enough gold to get all the stuff. I'd go on a dungeon run early in the day and farm Orr events for T6 mats and rare drops for ectos right after. I did CoF P1, AC all paths, Hotw P1 and later CoE all paths nearly every day until christmas. 

In the end I was pretty lucky with the mystic clovers. I got them for around 190 obsidian shards altogether while the average is around 230. But I had only 100k karma left and I needed around 400k more to get the other 250 shards. So I stopped doing dungeons and even bought a karma infusion for my ascended amulet to get even more karma while doing all the Orr events I could find. I managed to get around half of every T6 mat and bought the rest straight from the TP because I was getting fed up with Grenth &amp; Melandru all day, Gates of Arah was already bugged unfortunately. The ectos were easier then I thought at first, I used to get around 10-15 per day from dungeon tokens, 10-15 from world bosses and another 10-15 from rare drops. 

With all the event chains in Orr I made enough Karma to get the remaining obsidian shards much quicker then I expected. Afterwards to my former dungeon runs I used to farm every orichalcum and ancient wood node that was accessible every day with all of my 3 chars but after getting to around 400 orichalcum ingots I got extremely fed up with it and decided to buy the rest. 

Then the last part came: Map completion. Usually I love to explore new things and stuff but this was really hard for me. My main char was sitting at 84% when I started so I didn't have that much to do, but at least 160 hearts. You all know how annoying many of the hearts can be. In the course of december I managed to get the WvW map fully completed, luckily my server got red, blue and green side one after another. 

After a month long journey the long awaited moment came: I forged my Twilight! I even took a look at the TP because I was curios; there was an offer from a buyer for a fancy 2700g and I was hesistant for a moment because I'd make around 900g profit. But I ran out of Karma and farming around 900k Karma would take me a lot of time so I decided against it. 

Right now I'm thinking about getting Sunrise for my guardian but this time I would make it slowly and spread it over months.

iBL1TZKR13G,AskReddit,1389806069.0,"It's all in your head. When I first started going I was the same way. I'd go to the squat rack and have to take 5 plates off of each side. And the beautiful women walking around everywhere didn't help matters. Constantly thinking if they are looking at me or judging me. 

The truth of the matter is that anyone who is at the gym and in great shape is more concerned about how they look and couldn't care less about others in the gym. And at the end of the day, you are there for a reason. Not to stare at girls or try to impress the big guys with how much you can lift. You are there to make yourself better. 

I work as a trainer for a few people around my school and the first thing the people I help do is try to throw as much weight as possible on and struggle to get a single rep, then sit up and say "" I used to be stronger"". I don't care how strong you used to be, or how strong you are now for that matter, just that you feel good and are healthy. 

Strength comes with work. The moment people stop caring about impressing  all the bigger people, that's the moment you start making improvements. 

So lower the amount of weight you do and do full, obtainable workouts. One of the people I am helping get into shape has rheumatoid arthritis and he tries to bench press 300 lbs and never does a full rep. You won't impress anyone with how much weight you can re-rack.

tricksy_trixie,MakeupAddiction,1389806073.0,"My favorite waterproof mascara is Buxom Lash Waterproof. Doesn't flake or clump, stays put even when my allergies get my eyes watering, has the brush type that I like (it's like a rubber spiky thing instead of the wiry bristles), and is a reasonable (to me, at least) $19 a tube. Also it comes off easily with my eye makeup remover (I switch between Philosophy just release me and Clinique Take The Day Off).

Runners up are Clinique High Impact Waterproof and Lancome Definicils Waterproof. Clinique is waterproof enough for me about 90% of the time; I have had a few issues with it but it's relatively inexpensive at $16. Lancome is great and really stood up to the test - lasted through my engagement and wedding without budging, both occasions with lots of tears shed - but is a pricy $27.50. I struggle to get the Lancome mascara off though... even with the Lancome eye makeup remover...

I definitely don't recommend the Sephora brand waterproof mascara. Somehow it both runs and is impossible to get off with remover, and it was the clumpiest thing ever. "

VoxMeretricis,AskReddit,1389806090.0,"Ok, here's a lot more than you asked for, from someone who just finished her MA in medieval history and is beginning the PhD - as part of my research, I work very closely with the art history department at my university and in fact one of the members of my PhD committee is an art historian:

First of all, for god's sake, make sure this is something you LOVE. And I mean obsessively LOVE. Accept the fact that right now, academic jobs are very difficult to get, you'll be poorly paid, and it's going to be a very time consuming and probably expensive process. There's just no way around it. This is why you need to really love what you're doing, because you're going to have to sacrifice a lot for it. 

Second, getting a TAship or a fellowship is going to be crucial. But they're competitive, even more so because art history is a chronically underfunded department and field. That means you need a stellar application - it is absolutely, 100% crucial that you start developing your relationship with your old professors again. Obviously avoid the creepy one, but you're going to *need* good letters of recommendation. Not just ones good enough to get you into the program, but ones good enough to get you funded.

Luckily, NY has the excellent SUNY system. State schools are the way to go - don't even bother with private ones if money is a concern. If you want an MA and a PhD, studying abroad is a good addition, because you're going to need a language other than English to pass your MA exam (at least in the art history program where I am). 

Speaking from the experience of a friend who is in the art history department and is funded at the PhD level: as part of her funding, she teaches her own class. Meaning, she has to do all the preparation work, all the grading, give all the lectures, and be available basically on call in addition to office hours to help her students. She has 50. This takes up a good 30 hours a week, more or less. (In my own department, I don't have to teach, I TA - I do about 20 hours a week for my students in terms of grading, attending lectures, office hours, etc. I also have 50 students a semester.) On top of that, she has her coursework which takes at minimun 30-35 hours a week. This does not include any independent research she's doing.

You have to understand that graduate school is an intensely stressful time sucker. You're not done when you get home. You're not done on the weekend. You're never done. There's always more work to be done. Sure, some days you blow it off and binge-watch three seasons of Archer. But most days, it's work work work. And all for a poorly compensated job that you'll be worked just as hard at.

Now, you could find a program that's less rigorous. But it's hard enough to get an adjunct teaching position for these types of fields these days (I'm not even touching on how tricky it is to get a tenure-track teaching position). You really need to be able to demonstrate that you're not just an art historian when you complete the PhD, but that you're a *great* art historian. You need to stand head and shoulders above the crowd if you want a good job when you're done. Fields like art history (and medieval history!) are just not as valued as STEM fields. They're underfunded, tend not to be as respected in academia, and you really need to understand what you're getting in to. 

With all that having been said, I find graduate school to be the most rewarding intellectual experience I can imagine. I just love it. But I went into it understanding that I was putting myself into a lot of debt (even being funded doesn't mean 100% of your living costs and school costs are covered, and if you work outside of school your school work will suffer, if your school work suffers you're damaging your chances at your future career) and making a lot of sacrifices to do so.

0x_,RedditDayOf,1389806405.0,"&gt; Main one being, in my experience, people asking this are really asking 'So what are you really?'.

I think i understand that. It must get tiring. Theres only so much you want to talk about in the open too, so there is always the option to continue a line of discussion in private message. Im not your average redditor who has done no reading on the trans\* spectrum and just wants to *tell you what you are* to alleviate their awkwardness with transgender people.

&gt; They want a simple answer.

There is no simple answer in sexuality or (trans\*)gender. I feel trans* identity and expression is more complicated than sexuality, and people are only just getting their heads around trans vs. cis. Thats the opposite of what im reaching for.

&gt; Other reason is, it's nobody's business but my partner's and my doctor. There is literally no reason for anyone else to know.

Im no doctor, but i come from a perspective of wanting to understand every trans* expression, to better understand my own.

&gt; I have a hormone imbalancing condition, for that I am being treated, but it's not quite the same as traditional HRT.

Absolutely confirms part of my understanding of the multitude of things that can go into gender identity and expression (expression if not policed by society/co-opted by individuals). People tend to reach for one explanation, like ""its genetic"" or its due to pre-natal conditions, but its a mix of things and really varies from person to person. Absolutely predisposition to a hormone imbalance could contribute.

May i ask, are you or have you ever considered yourself asexual? I ask due to imbalance of hormones condition, which i have seen in asexual people on more than one occasion.

&gt; Well for the first one I'm gonna have to do some digging, so I'll get back to that. 

After you do, if there are any you deferred, may i re-ask them as a reminder?"

octochan,pokemon,1389806421.0,"Hey Dude!

First, Congrats on being interested in competitive battling. This gen makes it super easy to IV Breed and EV Train so it's very accessable. Here are some pointers.

1) Natures are important. Natures determine what stat you can potentially max out for your pokemon and which stat you're abandoning. If you look at the [basestats of Gengar](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gengar_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\)#Base_stats) you can see his Special Attack is VERY high and his Attack is pretty low. You want to accent this by not only giving him a good special moves (your moveset looks pretty good!) and maxing out his Special Attack EVs but giving him a complimentary nature. Modest would be a good nature, but boosting speed is always safe as well.

2) EVs should be maxed out. A safe rule of thumb is to max out two stats and put the remaining 4 in HP (or something.)  For certain builds there's more finesse in it, but starting out just max out whatever your nature increases, and whatever you want your pokemon to do. For Gengar it'd be safe to max out Special Attack and Speed.

3) Held items add a completely new level of strategy into the game. While having two possible mega evolutions has its own benefits (psyching out your opponent, having a backup in case one gets KO'd before it mega evolves, etc.) you sacrifice your potential to do crazy shenanigans. 

I'm guessing you know what abilities you want to have on your pokemon. Your biggest downfall from this set up are your counterproductive natures and split EVs. And while you breed for the right Natures/Abilities on your next team don't forget about IVs!

Hope this helps!"

Then, I drain the canned tomatoes into the jar, put on the jar's lid and shake. The liquid from the canned tomatoes pretty much gets most of the remaining sauce out of the jar, which gets added to the pot and then I add the canned tomatoes.

abeyante,AskWomen,1389806460.0,"I'm in one!

This is the first ""open""/poly relationship I've ever been in, and holy shit, I'm never going back to monogamy. This is wonderful.

I'm not sure if I'm a true gold star poly person since I don't want to have multiple life partners/primaries/husbands/whatever. But I don't like the term ""open relationship"" since it so often implies you're not supposed to form emotional bonds with other partners.

In my last relationship I had discovered nonmonogamy, and the idea that it was possible and OK in the real world today. I was overjoyed! It sounded like exactly what I'd always dreamed of. My ex was VERY strictly monogamous. We broke up for completely unrelated reasons, but I swore to myself I wouldn't get into another monogamous relationship just because I ""had"" to.

Right now I'm dating the most amazing man in the world. Literally, the most amazing person I have ever met, have ever been in a relationship with, etc. He's brilliant. Perfect. I could go on, but I won't. He's also nonmonogamous, so our relationship was ""open"" from the beginning. We date other people, sometimes sleep with friends that we like. We're currently looking into finding play partners to have fun with together :)

It's not that I feel some sort of compulsion to sleep with people other than my boyfriend. It's that I think monogamy for the sake of it is pointless. If he meets a super cute girl who's funny and smart, and he wants to date her, why shouldn't he? If I find a hot guy on OKC who likes world of warcraft and wants to be MMO buddies and maybe fuck me somewhere down the line, why not? I love my boyfriend so, *so* much, and he loves me. I'm never going to find someone I like ""better"" than him, the same way meeting a new friend won't make me stop loving my best friend!

I recently got to meet a ""metamour"" of mine (not really, more like a FWB of my boyfriend, I guess? But I love the term metamour) and it was SO much fun to bond with her over our mutual interest in my boyfriend. It's an amazing, indescribable mix of pride, love, and endearment to see him flirting with girls. To know how happy it makes *them* to have such a beautiful, warm, kind person giving them that kind of feeling. To know how happy it makes *him*. Awww &lt;3

And I have a longtime friend who's ridiculously hot, whom I've always wanted to sleep with (and who's always been into me). I can finally act on these feelings! I've known him for years, it's not like I'm going to ""leave"" my boyfriend for this dude. We make great friends but we're never getting married. We enjoy each others company, and we like to make out. I love him, but that love doesn't somehow *threaten* my love for my boyfriend.

The way I see it, there's literally no reason to be monogamous. I mean, 99% of the sex I have right now is with my boyfriend, because he's absolutely amazing, and this is the best sex we've both ever had in our lives. But if some shiny new fling comes along, why should it have any bearing on how we feel about *each other*? I just don't get it!"

GreenGemsOmally,CFB,1389806463.0,"The part-time member in the ACC allows ND to continue to keep independence for football (very important for historical identity and pride), allows ND to join a very strong conference for other sports (namely basketball, hockey, lacrosse and soccer, even though the B1G is a good conference as well), and gives them a geographic footprint outside of the midwest for recruiting.

ND has no problem recruiting and drawing interest from the midwest right now. They're able to recruit successfully in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, etc., just because that's where the school is located. (Partially) Joining the ACC gives ND better access to the Southeast and Eastern Seaboard, which has some excellent recruiting grounds. 

Honestly, I don't see any real advantage for ND to join the Big 10 over the ACC even as a full time member, except for the fact that they're located in the same region. The real draw is from the Big 10's side, because they want that money and interest of having ND in their conference. ND doesn't match nearly as well as an academic institution to the academic footprint of the Big 10 and would be playing second fiddle to Michigan and Ohio State.

3. Because if I have a genuine reason to not smile, being told to smile is invalidating my reasons for not smiling, insinuating that I have a responsibility to appear happy when I'm not, and trying to control how I express myself.
4. It is almost exclusively told to women because it's apparently our job to go around looking happy all the goddamn time. Men who aren't smiling constantly? No problem. OMG a woman appears to have a straight face, alert the media, we need a smile report down here, stat! It's a bullshit double standard.
5. Because it's none of their business how I wear my face.

I think the anger generally comes from being told repeatedly to smile by strangers, by family, by fucking everyone who thinks they have a right to make you change your appearance for them. *Some* people may be doing it in a genuine effort to cheer someone up, but there are better ways of doing that than trying to dictate someone else's facial expression."

digitalpencil,LifeProTips,1389806669.0,"I only really wanted to point out how this can be achieved in OS X but you keep popping up in this thread so i'll try to explain.

I've been using Win/*nix and OS X professionally, as a developer for over a decade now and they're all of them, completely competent OSs. OS X has a bash shell, apache stack &amp; debug tools straight out of the box. Although I tend to prefer linux, it's become my primary OS these days due to software compatibility I need for work.

They're just tools. This whole 'argument' over ones more configurable than another is horseshit. Some need extending, some need stripping back, all approach things slightly differently (OS X/*nix being the most comparable due to shared origin). They're all of them completely fine to work with.

As for value for money; it's a fluid concept that means completely different things to different people. If you're quoting builds by the man-day, use the machine/environment that's fastest for you. You may end up spending £400 more on one than another but you'll recoup the investment in a single project.

It's just preference, everybody has one and none of them are 'wrong', 'amateur' or more restrictive than another.

One final thing, contrary to an apparently prevalent opinion, 'user-friendly' is a *good* thing, not a bad one. It's what we strive every day to achieve in our own builds."

Where I live is about half Cubs and Cards fans.  I'm in a college town, and the college students are more Cubs fans (a lot are from Chicago), but the locals are more Cards fans.  So, I've had plenty of friends who are Cards fans.

For me it's always been a friendly rivalry.  I will always root for the Cubs to beat the Cardinals, but when it comes to the post-season, I'll generally root for the Cardinals to win.  My friends will joke about our teams beating each other and stuff, but it's never mean-spirited.  We're both ""old-school"" franchises, having been around since the 1800s...we've shared a lot of great players and other personalities...Rogers Hornsby, Lou Brock, Dizzy Dean, Harry Caray.  I think that for many fans of both teams, there's a certain level of respect that we afford the other side of the rivalry that we don't extend to most other teams out there.

Compare that to the perceived rivalry between the Cubs and the White Sox, where it pretty much seems like the Sox fans just hate the Cubs with an absolute passion, and the Cubs fans...well...occasionally I remember that the White Sox are a baseball team.

It is you who are presenting a binary view; that something less than what you perceive as the ""best option"" is ""bad"".

&gt; Says who? In principle, there's no reason we shouldn't be able to engineer dislike out of people.

WTF? You aren't arguing for ""transhumanism"", as much as the eradication of the characteristics that make us ""human"". What does it mean to exist as a sentient being without the ability to *dislike* someone or something? Who gets to decide what kinds of preferences are allowed or not? And people think anarcho-primitivists are misanthropic?

&gt; Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. Sensations are not dualistic. Pain is simply the result of a particular series of nerve impulses. You don't need to have felt good to know what pain is like. I don't need to have been bald to know what it feels like to have hair. Nerves simply don't work that way.

You misunderstand the metaphor. Humans ""baseline"" to their environment. We are an incredibly adaptable species. We perceive our current state as ""normal"". If you eat gourmet food every day, it becomes routine, and ""regular"" food will become unpalatable. Perpetual bliss will eventually become meaningless. Conversely, there are many people today who live full, rich, happy lives in conditions that most Westerners would consider ""unbearable"". No AC? Barbaric!

&gt; So predation is the product of authority? Cancer? Aneurysms? Malaria? Typhoid? Polio?

Ah. So, first I think we need to acknowledge that (complex) life is not possible without death. Our deaths will provide resources so that others may live - if only via the liberation of my atoms for reuse in another organism. Predation may not be particularly ""pleasant"" to think about, but it is necessary. We would not be human without predation; the evolutionary path that led us here could not happen without it. Predation enhances biodiversity, and helps maintain healthy ecosystems. And being a herbivore does not preclude predation; if you are killing the plant in order to consume it...

As for your other examples, they are *largely* impactful as a result of authority's impact on human behavioral patterns. As we transitioned from band societies to dense city populations, the opportunity arose for very virulent disease to evolve, or simply become markedly more prevalent, in response. The malaria parasite has existed for a long time, but it exploded in conjunction with the widespread adoption of agriculture. Typhoid outbreaks require dense populations and have often occurred after widespread deaths (war, for example). Ironically, polio became more prevalent (like allergies) when we *increased* city sanitation. Even cancer is a more prevalent disease amongst affluent countries, in general. Globalization has probably killed more people via the spread of disease to previously unexposed populations than anything *ever* - the introduction of European and African diseases to the Americas killed millions of aboriginal peoples. (And that's ignoring the other ecological disasters caused by globalization, such as loss of biodiversity and things like the Irish potato famine.) *All* of the conditions that lead to these epidemics arose from authority structures."

RyanGlavin,AskHistorians,1389806834.0,"The main opponents that U-Boats faced throughout much of the early parts of World War II were British and the Polish ships that had escaped and gone to Britain.

The British had 19 long range boats of the O,P, and R classes. Weighing in at around 1400 tons and with a range of 20,000 miles while on the surface, they would make for excellent Pacific patrols, barring their leaking fuel tanks. They were very unsuited for the Mediterranean, which is where they became stationed. 11 out of 15 were lost in the Mediterranean.

They also produced in vast numbers T class submarines, which were produced at 1235 tons to allow more hulls to be created in agreement with the restrictions of the London Treaty. Three sets of these boats were built, each with varying improvements on the prior. 

Set 1: 15 Boats, first was HMS Triton. Commissioned November 9th, 1938.
Set 2: 7 Boats, first was HMS Thrasher. Commissioned May 14th, 1941. 
Set 3: 31 Boats, first was HMS P-311. Commissioned August 7, 1942.

The U-class was first developed as a small training submarine, clocking in at 630 tons. Succeeded by the slightly altered V-class, the U-Class was well suited to both the North Sea and Mediterranean.

It's hard to explain the next part, as they didn't really deal with them, since it was rare if each sides of submarines actually saw each other. Basically, it came down to who was the first to shoot. For example, the HMS Triad was sunk on October 15th, 1940, by the Italian submarine Enrico Toti. To quote, 
""At 0110 hours the Italian submarine Enrico Toti (C.C. Bandino Bandini) encounters a British submarine in position 38º16'N, 17º37'E described as of the Perseus class and they pass at close range on opposite course as the Italian submarine rakes his opponent with machinegun fire and fires three rounds of 4"" with her deck gun claiming two direct hits. The British submarine fires back scoring a hit on the conning tower of Toti but this caused only slight damage and wounding two sailors. A torpedo misses the Italian submarine by a few meters. As the British submarine pulls away it submerges but by this time Toti has also launched a torpedo which makes a direct hit. It is almost certain that her victim was HMS Triad (Lt.Cdr. George Stevenson Salt, RN). She will be the only British submarine to be sunk by an Italian submarine during the war. "". 
Basically, the Italian submarine was able to sink the Triad because he was able to open the first shots of the battle. Both direct hits to the pressure hull that crack the hull and direct torpedo hits are guaranteed to destroy a submarine.

Another British submarine, HMS Thistle (T-Class), was destroyed by U-4 on April 10th, 1940, from a torpedo fired at close range (250 meters). There were no survivors.

A large amount of the combat would either be engaging on the surface with the deck gun in earlier parts of the war (in which the opponent usually dove deep to avoid), or being lucky enough to fire undetected with a torpedo to sink the enemy submarine if they were on the surface. Since torpedoes didn't work below an operational depth of 25 meters, the deep seas were once again the submarines friends, since they could avoid being attacked by enemy submarines."

Products I've used in the past:

Lancome effacernes: this is probably the best medium-light coverage undereye product on the market--doesn't crease, waterproof, great finish, but it just didn't have enough coverage.

Benefit Erase Paste: good ability to color correct, but it creased like hell and smelled like burnt crayons

Hourglass Hidden Corrective concealer: you know...I hate this product.  It clumps up/separates on my skin and it is the only product that does that.  I've never heard anyone else say that though, so maybe it's just me.  Good level of coverage, good finish.

Tarte creaseless concealer: this stuff is really thick, which makes it hard to blend/get a thin layer that doesn't crease.  Definitely a difficult product to use in this area with a brush."

Eating a lot is like working out. You can't walk in and bench press 400lbs your first day, same with eating a lot. So just add 250 calories to your daily intake for a week, repeat.

If you can do an intense, but very short workout in the morning it can help increase appetite. I sprint for about 2 minutes (won't but enough calories to be concerned) and it helps me put down a big breakfast. 
Eat more on your small meals. Your first goal should be to get 3 full meals. Then you can start adding snacks or extra meals.

I make shakes without protein powder (it's expensive and you can easily gain without it). 

1 cup of oats (blended first for texture)

1tbsp olive oil (no taste)

vivvav,OnePiece,1389806954.0,"**Nami vs. Arlong:**  
  
Probably still Arlong. Nami's not that strong, and Arlong is a pirate who sailed the Grand Line for many years. Remember, he didn't go to East Blue by choice, he was sent there thanks to politics. I mean, all you really have to do to fight Nami is not stand under the thunder clouds she's obviously making, and unlike a lot of people who Nami has fought, he's no idiot. I'm not saying Nami wouldn't be able to put up a fight at all, but I consider Arlong stronger than even really a good amount of the Baroque Works members were. Luffy beating Arlong was a testament to Luffy's strength, not Arlong's weakness. Luffy really didn't grow in strength at all during East Blue, he was already pretty much powerful enough for the Grand Line.

**Chopper vs. Wapol:**

**Robin vs. Crocodile**  
  
Unless Robin knows Haki, she's screwed.  
  
**Franky vs. Rob Lucci**  
  
Lucci. Franky is my favorite character, but I don't think he'd ever actually hit Lucci in the Shogun Mech, Lucci's just too fast. Franky's only real shot is the Radical Beam, which is pretty easy to dodge. If Franky COULD hit Lucci, he'd take him out. The problem is, I don't think he can, but Lucci can still wreck Franky's shit.

&gt;TL;DR: The parts of the Open Internet Order that imposed regulations concerning net neutrality were vacated because the FCC classified internet providers as ""information services,"" not ""telecommunication services."" The anti-blocking and anti-discrimination requirements, according to statute, can only be imposed on types of telecommunication services. It's the FCC's own fault, not a government conspiracy against net neutrality.

Unless the FCC reclassifies ISPs as telcos (which I'm not even sure they **can** do), those provisions are in serious trouble just based on the text of the statute."

I had 4 copies from back when Betrayers was in Standard, and after watching Travis's second video series, I was convinced the card was playable so I bought 12 more at $1 each thinking they might go up to $3 if the deck saw fringe play. I sold them last week at $8 each, so a little under $100 profit. That spiked way higher than I expected, I guess because of LSV's video.

I bought 4 Karn about 2 years ago on spec at around $12 each, and let my set go last week as well for $160, so a little over $100 profit there. My motivation for buying in was looking at how low it was and reflecting on the reasoning in these two articles comparing it to Nicol Bolas (and noting that Bolas had retained a very high value at the time): 

http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/finance/21807_The_Financial_Value_Of_New_Phyrexia.html

I've made a bunch more money by just getting playsets of cards that I plan on playing with and then holding onto them until they rise in value because they were good after all, but I wouldn't call those speculations.

The lesson for me is, don't try to follow cards other people are hyping (because at the time I bought into those two specs, nobody was talking about either card). Instead, follow your instincts and look for cards that you think are good but under appreciated and as off-the-radar as possible."

Not to mention the fact that the term ""natural"" vs ""man-made"" is so arbitrary and fuzzy that it's completely meaningless.

&gt;In short, saying something is ""made in a lab"" in no way means it's poisonous or harmful and saying something ""grows naturally"" does not mean it's safe and harmless.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389807052.0,"Here's the thing about these bull**** minimum wage arguments.

Say you have 2 workers. You pay them $7.25 an hour, or $14.50 an hour together.

They raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour. You now have to pay $18 an hour a worker.

So you let one go and only have to pay $9 an hour.

Here's the big elephant in the room. As a smart business person who obviously likes to cut costs and maximize profits...WHY THE **** WOULD YOU HIRE TWO PEOPLE IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH ONLY HIRING ONE?!

It makes sense if, say, you could automate the job at $7.50 so they just broke the bank where automating is cheaper, but barring that...why would you hire two people when you can get away with one? The only reason would be if the economy became desperate and workers lost their bargaining power and would have to accept doing twice the work now and...oh wait, that's what our current economy is doing. 

You see, these guys who argue against the minimum wage seem to miss the big elephant in the room. Corporate greed. The fact that they can manipulate workers and take advantage of bad situations....which is the very reason why we established the minimum wage to begin with. To place a limit on corporate greed. 

If a business lets you go because of a wage increase, 90% of the time, it's probably not because they genuinely can't afford it. This only happens to people barely making it to begin with. Most of the time, it's because they're greedy jerks who like to take advantage of situations to push for cost cutting measures. Don't let the arguments fool you. Corporate profits are at record levels. And they're still laying off. I once knew someone who was told to his face that they're laying him off despite making record profits. It's not about a lack of money. It's not about how hard the minimum wage is for (most) businesses. It's about corporate greed."

feedmahfish,askscience,1389807172.0,"Remote sensing is a wonderful tool.  Quite frankly, the world looks so much different when viewing it under a variety of different conditions and circumstances that it's actually easier to quantify differences within landscapes than it would be to just go out and measure those differences in the field.

So, remote sensing is the technique of using satellites and other imagery equipment to get geo-spatial information.  Explaining with satellites, Remote sensing uses high quality cameras that can take in different color bands (termed the spectral resolution of the camera) at different pixel resolutions.  Color bands include: Blue, Green, Red, Infrared, and others.  An image with high spectral resolution means that multiple color bands are captured in that image.  So, you can actually change which color bands appear on which of the color channels and display the landmass in a whole new way. 

For example: instead of R-Red, G-Green, and B-Blue(where R is the red channel/gun, B is the blue channel/gun, and G is the green channel/gun), you can move which color band goes through which channel.  So, you can actually get R-Infrared, G-Red, and B-Green, and what you'll get is an image called a [false-color composite](http://www.geospectra.net/lewis_cl/remote/lv-234.jpg).  The original blue colors now are green, the originally green colors are now red, and the originally red colors are now showing near-Infrared.  This color combination is especially useful for looking at vegetation vigor because more vigorously growing plant stands will appear as a darker red due to the heavy absorbance of green.  This is much easier to look at than the simple RGB ""true color"" bands.

Additionally, we can use other color band combinations to achieve different effects.  What if we have a lot of smoke blocking our landsat image?  We can use a different spectral band combination!  We can use this combination:
R - Shortwave IR, G - Near Infrared, B - Green.

[You get this as a result](http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/5000/5328/whitesands_l7_31jun01.jpg).  Another false color composite.  But this one shows ""natural"" colors.  For the most part.  It shows soils as a multitude of colors, areas with no vegetation or very sparse vegetation are more orange.  Lots of vegetation is green.  But you'll notice there's no particles in the air:  the color combination is actually best suited for cutting through that.

So, spectral banding is the best part of remote sensing via landsat imaging in my opinion.  Additionally, landsat images have a spatial resolution, which is called a pixel size for short.  Pixel size refers to how much land area is represented by one pixel  In other words, higher spatial resolution means 1 pixel = 10^2 m, or 1^2 m.  Obviously, higher pixel ratings means larger files.  So, that's the downside.  But the nice things about pixels is that they represent one color (termed a brightness value).  So, if you have pixels within a range of values, you can estimate things by just simply adding them up.  Just, how suitable your estimate is depends on the size of those pixels.

We also have temporal resolution ability in remote sensing.  This is an easy concept.  It's how many pictures are taken of the same spot over a period of time.  In otherwords, if a satellite take 5 pictures of the same spot in a year, then the temporal resolution of that image is 5.  Thus we can analyze the same image over a year for differences.

Nice aspects of remote sensing.  Governmental groups are already hard at work using remote sensing technology and their efforts spear head the development of new analytical techniques for spatial and geographical/geological statistics.  So, really, the question shouldn't be, what can governmental groups do to assist... it really should be, what more should governmental groups do with remote sensing?  "

Sir_Fancy_Pants,todayilearned,1389807180.0,"&gt;The entire first half of your last little screed demonstrates a total lack of understanding of the scientific process, and our knowledge to date

oh quite the contrary i assure you, it is indeed you who doesn't understand not only the scientific process but the entire principle of evidence based reasoning and the application of logical consistency.

You clearly don't understand the limitations of processes and data, and certainly to think the evidence presented allows you to quantify the effect of societal influence on society is actually quite amusing.

you may as well claim the existence of the colour yellow influences the positivity of field crickets by 9.3%

You also seem to not understand that while men and women are indeed very similar its entirely a relative term. relative to a banana indeed the difference is virtually indistinguishable. however based on hormone production which is irrefutably known to influence behaviour they are very different and distinguishable. its almost as if i was suggesting the level of difference and the weighting should be based on the criteria for the role (what a shocking and novel approach eh, actually selecting candidates based entirely on merit and capability based on the role requirements).

I believe you lack both experience or understanding of the scientific process outside the simplistic soft sciences, have no understanding of the concept of falsifiability or validation, and furthermore fail to grasp the concept of errors and uncertainty.

 The fact you think there is a scientific consensus or mutually supporting evidence in agreement of ""men and women are FAR more similar than they are different"" shows you don't even understand a scientific based claim, literally what you have you written is meaningless unless the difference is wrt to some criteria of assessment.

""men are women are far more similar than they are different in height compared to the size of stars""

the fact you even entertain the possibility that all the differences are known enough to make such a claim is pretty inexcusable (not with the height example your original example)

When girls tell you that you're too young for them it's not a ""shit test"". It's a rejection, that you should accept. The attitude of ""no"" not meaning necessarily ""no"" is harmful and *wrong*.

Negging/teasing/""witty"" one liners are all part of this attitude: You don't treat women like people, but as child-like androids with whom a certain conversational approach will lead to sex.

hopewings,relationship_advice,1389807471.0,"Just wanted to write and say that I read your edit.  I can relate to what you're going through, especially the part that you get offended by what strangers think of your relationship. ""I thought to myself that I didn't explain my thoughts correctly, I'm just making him look bad, I'm exaggerating, etc etc.""  and ""I just thought it was different than that for some reason.""  I never thought that I, an intelligent, top university-educated, working a professional white collar job woman, could have allowed myself to be in an abusive situation.  But I did, and I stayed for YEARS.

I also never felt ""unsafe"" or that he would actually ""hurt"" me, but all that changed when he realized I was finally done with him for good.  They say hindsight is 20/20, and it sure is.  I would look back at the times that random strangers would find out little tidbits about that relationship and get angry on my behalf, or tell me that he was a bad person, and I felt like they were saying I had ""bad taste in men"" or something.  No, strangers were concerned for me, and I wish I would have listened to them -- and my gut feelings.  I wanted to leave so many times, but he would always beg and plead, threaten to kill himself, destroy objects, and get into huge dramatic fights.  So I would stay because it was easier...

Finally, I want you to know that you are not a failure, that you can do better, and that there are good people out there, who don't yell and abuse and make a complete mockery of what love truly means.  Having experienced such darkness means that you will be able to appreciate the light that much more.

When I was 36 I had the same clarity of view.

OP, are you a relatively handsome, not-fucking-creepy, well-kept dude in your early-to-mid 20s? If so, you are a stripper's dream. 

Think of it like this: The majority of her day is spent grinding on fat, stinky, old men and listening to them tell her how beautiful she is, how they want to sleep with her, how they want to get her a job in their office, blah blah fucking blah. These guys are called ""Marks"" because they're only good for the money. You, on the other hand, are near her age, not hideous, and treated her like a normal fucking person, which she is. 

You gotta remember - these girls are people too. I've hung out with strippers outside of the strip club on plenty of occasions. It's usually a good time, because they're hot and have good bodies, so you take them to a pool or the beach or somewhere they can show off their assets, and you'll get stares from everyone. Jealous men, envious women. Your 'stock' goes up, because you're one dude hanging out with four sexy chicks. Yeah, it makes a difference. 

*Some* of them are doing some escort service (read: hookers) on the side. The vast majority, in my experience, are not. They just want to kick it. If they're working a decent club, it's a good bet that they're making more money than you, unless you're raking in a fat six-figure salary. "

by_a_pyre_light,Battlefield,1389807604.0,"Tagging people in HC is still good, because if someone else kills them, you *still* get the points, but yep, you can no longer rely on it for target acquisition. 

&gt; I never use the FLIR scope, I will try it but doesn't it take away from the games visuals because you are always looking through the scope? 

Again, that's your play style, so that could be an issue if you continue to play that way and use it. Plus, it's a 2X scope, so it's not great for sniping, but would work fantastically for DMRs if you play a front-line sniper. 

If you use it like I do, you're not glued to the scope; you spend most of the time not looking through the scope and just use it to quickly snap to a target and shoot them, then carry on your business. 

The AA on the PS4 is pretty good, and has been compared to the AA on the PC version, which is why I left the PS4 out of the previous discussion. It shouldn't really be an issue for you. You can read more about the PS4s advantage over the other consoles here: http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-battlefield-4-next-gen-face-off

In all, it looks like the issue is play style and weaning yourself off the spotting crutch if you want to continue HC. In fact, I stand by my other statements that you should really expand your class repertoire in HC to experience the full advantages of the game mode, but you can work your way into it.

The best thing my list has going for it is resiliency and redundancy.

The main reason the list has a great  Delver matchup is because Wasteland and Price of Progress are dead cards, and Stifle is pretty close to dead as well.

While splashing black would also give you access to nice targeted discard spells as well, ultimately Lingering Souls doesn't provide enough over my other spells for me to want to dilute the deck. "

Griemak,Fitness,1389807895.0,"I got lucky and scored (yay puns!) a physical therapist that was a soccer nut to help me through an injury.  To build endurance and fortitude (stave off injury) at the age of 36, it was scaled down, but the ""idea"" of the program was similar to Stanford's soccer program that is available with a Google search.

Simplified:  

Resistance training: squats, stiff legged deadlifts, shoulder press, chest (bench) press, chin-ups, rows.  This offers a push and pull on the main muscle groups.  I added calf raises.  Whole body workout, 3x a week, took about 30-45 minutes as it was NOT a linear strength program, but a circuit.  The FAQ-&gt; has at least two routines that are like this.

Endurance training: 2x a week, back-to-back (I did it on Sat and Sun morning).  LISS, or Low Intensity Steady State.  I used an elliptical, set the resistance low enough to keep a good jogging pace, but high enough to keep my heart pumping and sweat pouring.  1-2 hours.

HIIT: 2x per week, between the resistance training.  I did this on a treadmill, fartleks would be closest to describe them.  The first few jump offs were tricky, but I got it.  So all out sprint for 30 seconds, remember this speed setting.  At the end of 30, you use the rails and jump off to the sides of the treadmill (straddling the belt).  Then slow it down to a good jogging speed.  Get on and go 2 minutes, then start over.  The interval is: 30 second max sprint, 30 seconds holding on to the rails and not moving while the treadmill slows down, 2 minutes at a slow jog or fast walk.  Then ramp the speed up to where the max sprint is and don't start timing until the treadmill gets there.

How was I testing for progress?  Each Thursday, my second HIIT day, before we started therapy, I did a timed shuttle (suicides) run, 10-20-40-20-10 yards, best of 2 efforts.  On Monday, my first resistance day, I had my resting heart rate recorded.  As two long LISS days were before it, I was shocked at how it was elevated compared to Friday.  Watching that fall was really cool.  It means more to my general well being than shaving a tenth of a second off the shuttle run.

Anyway, /r/bootroom would help you as well.  Indoor isn't usually speed sensitive.  Strength on the ball and reading of the play is of greater importance."

1. A gesture unlock that can be enabled in the security section. It is faster and easier than entering a PIN, password, etc.

We rarely, if ever, need a lock screen security when we are at home and it is very tedious to input all the time. But when I want to go outside, I don't want to go to settings-&gt;security-&gt;etc and re enter a password or a pattern or whatever all the time. I think being able to change security settings from a quick setting toggle, on the fly, would make things so much easier.

3. If you could, try copying and incorporating more things iOS has that we don't. I'm sure there's plenty of things that they may have that Android doesn't. Same goes for HTC and Samsung exclusive things if it is possible to replicate. Just a few ideas and would happily donate.

VoxMeretricis,AskReddit,1389808112.0,"I thought I'd add this, since I forgot to before: when choosing which schools in the SUNY system you're going to apply to, do a *ton* of research on the members of the department. A good committee will make or a bad committee will break your academic career. A good rule of thumb is that you should have read one book-length work (meaning either an actual book or several academic articles) published by the art historian you want to work with and ideally one article-length work published by the other members of the department it's likely you'll work with. In my university, you need 3 people on your MA committee and 4-5 on your PhD - so do some research on at least 4 members of the department, with the focus on the one person you'd like to work with. If you have real problems with their scholarship, you're going to have real problems as their student. Obviously you're not going to love each one of them, but you want to be sure you can at least work with them all. 

Get in contact with the person you want to work with at each school - just send them a friendly (and FORMAL) e-mail introducing yourself and telling them you're interested in applying for the program at their university. Ask them questions, ask for advice about funding and the type of scholarship you'll be doing there. Ask them to put you in touch with one of their current graduate students so you can get a sense of what the campus and department environment is like. If you can get there to meet them face-to-face before decisions are made on applications, that would look really good.

Finally, good luck!! I have found it to be an incredibly rewarding experience, and I'm sure you will too. "

Oh, there's plenty. I assume you're familiar with the likes of [Jack Chick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_T._Chick) and [Bob Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jones,_Sr.) but the likes of the [Free Presbyterian Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Presbyterian_Church_of_Ulster) openly profess this. I've always assumed that some independent Southern Baptist creeds hold this view but I'm too lazy to check.

&gt;I agree, my only point was how ironic it was seeing a member of one of the most exclusive denomination complain about not being recognized by other denominations. 

I think the difference is that you feel unrecognised by not being allowed to partake of Catholic communion. That isn't how I see it. Catholics are excluded from communion by the doctrine of the Orthodox Church. I respect that but I don't believe that that means the Orthodox don't view Catholics as Christian.

Similarly, it doesn't mean that Protestants are not Christian just because they are excluded from Catholic communion. I'm only referring to those creeds that maintain that Catholics are not Christian, not to the sacrament of communion."
soitcause,AskReddit,1389808121.0,"Yo. I'ma let you finish, but you're missing the best part: 

Spicy Ginger Simple Syrup



Peel a couple finger lengths of ginger. Chop it. Throw it in a pot.

Get a couple tablespoons of sugar. Throw it in the pot.

Red pepper flakes? Throw in the pot.

Cayenne? Fuck yeah. Throw it in the pot.

Drown it all in some water and stir. Medium-low heat for a long ass time (usually 30ish min) until it boils down. Your final product should be a bit thinner than regular syrup, but thick enough to linger on your finger before dripping off.

Chill that shit in the fridge before you burn down the house with the firestorm you're about to unleash.

Is it cool yet? It better be.

Grab yourself a mason jar (or multiple, you probably can't handle this alone). Pour in your rum. Pour in your ginger beer. 

Now SLOWLY, I repeat SLOWLY pick up your contain of ginger annihilation and pour it into the jar. How much doesn't matter, but I heard the more you pour the more likely you are to blaze with the fire of a thousand suns as your friends sip their ""drinks.""

Squeeze a slice of lime for that delicious acidic kick. Fuck it. Throw the whole slice in.

Stir.

When you think you're ready to step over into the realm of gods, take your first sip. Does it taste like a regular Dark n Stormy? Wait.

Do you feel that fire rising in your throat? Can you feel the flames of glory dancing at back of your mouth. Relish that sensation. Relinquish control to your inferno scorched fate. Watch as the world around seems to slip into sub-zero temperatures in the face of you, a sea of flames incarnate.

Watch, and then take another sip."

Being sexually assertive, however, can easily rocket you into any guy's top 10. You can be sexually assertive while still maintaining a sense of tact and feminine allure. The vast majority of women guys run into are sexually reactive, meaning that they just wait around for sex to happen to them. For the most part, this is just biology. This is what makes women who are self-starters when it comes to sex such a rare treat. 

It feels great to know that you are desired, and being with a woman who knows what she wants and knows how to convey it makes it so much easier and enjoyable.

However, keep in mind that this opens you up to rejection. A lot of women have a hard time dealing with this because they're used to being the gatekeepers of sex. If you initiate, it may not go the way you want it to."

I don't shop at Walmart because their business practices suck and they treat their employees like shit, not because of the deservedly low wage they pay said employees. They should be taxed more heavily (ideally as a percentage of payroll that qualifies for welfare or something like that) but retail clerks shouldn't really be getting paid more.

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1389808278.0,"It is really difficult for me to conceptualize G-d. I feel like trying to understand G-d would lead to head explosions - the concept of an eternal, singular, omniscient being who created everything and has a relationship to everyone? Sometimes I feel like I'm tripping on acid (or rather, what others have described that to be) when I really try to wrap my brain around that. Yet, no other concept of G-d even remotely makes sense to me. 

So I, as a weak human, to even begin to relate to G-d, have to rely on metaphorical language and analogies. Those are the tools I have. So I read about G-d's hand, and G-d's tefillin knot being revealed to us, and wrestling with G-d and G-d speaking to us.

Sometimes that's really easy - usually when I'm at a difficult point in my life -and I need the comfort of a very intimate G-d. I need that parent figure because I feel overwhelmed, unable to exert control/order on the chaos around me.

Sometimes that's really hard - usually when I'm at a difficult point in my life ;). That's when the structure of prayer is very helpful, to show me that I'm not allowed to give up on this, that I have to keep working on it. That's when it's hard to see G-d as all that G-d is without saying ""OMG G-d! What the heck happened to your benevolent loving side? Could you lay off the Judgey McJudgerson part for just a while?"" 

But just like the silent treatment in personal relationships is NOT helpful, it's not helpful here. It's okay to say to your spouse, ""I'm really mad, I need some time to cool down and think this through, and then I can talk about it."" That's what the structure of prayer does for me. ""I'm not ignoring you G-d... I just need some time to cool down right now."" So, that's why, for me, prayer on the structural level is so important. We have it every day. We say the same things. Some parts resonate more throughout different times of our life.

So this at times really important, at times not; at times really easy, at times really difficult relationship is shown through prayer, through studying, through living life according to Jewish values and laws."

Brightt,DebateAChristian,1389808290.0,"&gt; Because the purpose of sex is primarily to create life.

Bonobo's and dolphins have sex for pleasure and for strengthening bonds between individuals in a group setting. A kangaroo has 3 vagina's, one of which doesn't end in a uterus and is quite literally just a cum dumpster.

I'm sure there are other animals that use sex for other purposes than procreation that I don't know of.

Is it immoral of them to have sex other than for procreational purposes? If your answer is along the lines of ""animals don't posses morality"" (something that is demonstrably false by the way), then my next question is, why did your god create those animals in such a way that they would have sex for pleasure, and then tell us that having sex purely for pleasure is immoral? Kind of a double standard, no?

EDIT: I'd like to add that if sex is primarily to create life, then why isn't their any scripture or reasoning against having sex after menopause? Because after that, there is no way to create life through sex anymore, so they shouldn't be having sex anymore."

&gt; The protesters were routinely beaten

Which is atrocious. However. I think MLK thought there might be riots and massacres if nonviolence wasnt how this violence was met. Also, any protestor violence gets spun by the media, and widely discredits protest movements.

&gt; That's a philosophy you're not likely to see today. Aside from the Scientology protests, I've don't remember seeing a protestor get attacked and not fight back.

You mean anons? I dont recall them getting attacked, by scilons? Not by cops right?

There are not exactly many protests where cops attack first, perhaps why you dont recall seeing a protestor get attacked (and like you pictured, not fight back). Dispersal, detention and arrests are not the same as billyclubbing protestors without provocation, although the UC Davis cop comes close, dispassionate or no that was assault.

&gt; Again, I'm not equating radical with wrong

Again, not once did i say you did.

&gt; but if you break laws to demonstrate, you are being radical.

Absolutely disagree, again, in the strongest terms, that constitutionally protected civil disobedience is radical. You do the gub'mints job for them by helping demonize protest if you say so.

&gt; To do so with the intent of change established laws and customs fits most definitions of radical. 

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/radical

See. It really doesn't. The definition reflects an uncompromising approach to change. As opposed to:

Why does everyone keep parrotting this? Are teenagers, and people in general, really that stupid not to know how to hide their posts from family?

Here's one way:

Click on a friend. Set them as an acquaintance. Set your posts to be viewed by Friends except acquaintances.

Fuck! You could also create a custom list and put a bunch of people on that ignore list and post only to this list.

I've been doing this for 3 years now. All my family is on facebook, and they have never seen even one of my posts.

I don't buy this BS that teens are leaving because their parents are invading FB. I think teens are leaving (if they really are) because FB is becoming ad filled, cluttered, bloated, and boring. 

I am probably generalizing, but I think (from my teen cousins feed) girls tend to share selfies or pouting groupies with a lot of ""lv u grl"" statuses. And boys tend to share memes and other ""hilarious"" posts (pilfered from reddit, no less).

RyanGlavin,AskHistorians,1389808573.0,"Plenty. The United States Navy and the Kriegsmarine had an entire war going on before the declaration came through. The USS Reuben James was sunk by Erich Topp in U-552, during a convoy battle on October 31st, 1941. The convoy, Halifax 156, was a fast convoy of 44 ships escorted by 5 American destroyers. The Reuben James was a four stack destroyer from  WWI.

Topp fired two torpedoes, one of which hit the Reuben James on its port side, splitting her in half. Only forty-five out of 160 of the crew survived, being picked up by the other destroyers.

This event was a profound shock for the U.S. public, as she was the first ship to be sunk by enemy combatants during the war. Harold Stark, the Chief of Naval Operations, stated that ""Whether the country knows it or not, we are at war."" in response to the sinking. Woody Guthrie memorialized the sinking in a ballad [seen here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICy5P1pKy5A) Roosevelt used the sinking as an opportunity to push congress to repeal the Neutrality Act and engage in the War of the Atlantic. Several amendments were passed by congress, after lively debates. The Senate vote was 50-37 in favor of the amendments on November 7th, while the House voted 259-138 on November 13th. The amendment basically stated that US merchants could arm with gun crews, and at ports of ""belligerents""(In actuality just ports of the British Isles and the Dominions). U.S. navy gun crews, known as the ""Armed Guard"" manned the merchant guns."
i_lick_telephones,AskWomen,1389808573.0,"I'm really not informed as much as I'd like to be on laws and programs and acts pertaining to the equality of women, so I don't want to jump the gun and start going off on a topic I don't feel qualified at this point to answer. Primarily, I think our entire views on how we see femininity and women need to drastically change. However, it's easier and more efficient to put some laws in place than to change the mindset of everybody in the world.

So, I guess there's a few problems that immediately come to mind that I think could benefit from some laws being enacted: I think prostitution should be legalized, regulated and taxed; Women's work should be compensated to earn as much as men; abortions should be legalized everywhere

But it just goes through a checklist of things before you use it online and if it finds something not on the checklist it won't allow it online because it ""thinks"" its hacked.

It won't ""know"" a hacked Pokemon is hacked if you're careful and make sure nothing that isn't on the in-game checklist doesn't end up on the hacked Pokemon while making it."

***The Sidecar***

* Two shots Brandy or Cognac
* One shot Cointreau, Gran Marnier, or Triple Sec
* One shot lemon juice

Stir in cocktail shaker with ice, serve in chilled Martini glass edged with sugar, garnish with a strip of lemon rind

***Eastside***

* Two slices cucumber
* Mint
* Two shots gin (Plymouth, if you wanna be fussy)
* One shot St. Germain or [Umeshu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umeshu)
* Three-quarter shot fresh lime juice.

Muddle cucumber and mint, add ingredients and ice, and shake. Strain into old-fasioned or highball glass, serve with mint and cucumber garnish.

***The Last Word***

* One shot gin
* One shot Maraschino liqueur
* One shot green Chartreuse
* One shot fresh lime juice

Shake in a cocktail shaker, strain, and serve straight up. Thanks, Murray Stenson, you abusive asshole, you."

Aside from bankroll management, position, etc, I would say *controlled chaos* is the key; being wildly unpredictable and never risking a lot of chips on your bluffs.

When you're raising, you should either actually have the best hand possible (note: I'm not talking about having what you *think* is *probably the best hand*, but the best hand relative to the street and board texture), or you should have absolutely nothing at all.

You'll find that players won't know what to do against you, and will begin makin bigger and bigger mistakes against you through their sheer frustration. Also, people fold to raisesore often than they probably should, so take advantage.

I would also suggest making a concerted effort to never be the first player to go all-in unless you actually have the best hand and are reasonably sure you'll be called.

Avoid all-in bluffs or committing your whole stack on draws. Let your opponents be the ones to make the decision to play for everything, and you just get better at reading them for strong/weak.

So ... Just think ""small hands are for small pots"" and only bluff at small pots."

Society determines the morality of the group. Morality is not mutually exclusive from social beings. Some people formed a society and thought ""You know what, I don't think it's good that we kill other people. We should ban it."" While other societies were formed and thought, ""We should sacrifice people every so often to appease the gods.""

They're relativistic because inherently *there are no moral truths*, going under the axiom of moral subjectivity. Is it moral to not kill someone? I want to be a part of a society that says that, because I don't want to worry about me or my loved ones being killed or chosen for sacrifice. The justification comes from a society that deems it immoral."

Here we need to distinguish between non-sentient life, sentient but non-technological life, and non-technological life.

Europa could easily have non-sentient life, maybe even as complex as fish or squid, and we'd never be able to tell at this point. The same is true of non-technological sentient life: They can't signal us, and we can't see them.

Most of the different races are basically branches of human evolution based on the environment (the world is basically a lot of large islands/Small continents).  Dwarves were basically the slave miners of the old regime and have over time developed into the stereotypical short brawny dwarfs of pop culture. 

The dwarves bore the brunt of the oppressors aggression, being forced to mine the minerals needed to keep the war machine rolling.  When that empire began to crumble, the dwarves were one of the first to rise up and reclaim their lands.  This consisted of mostly the high mountains, where they would have their homes carved in the sides of the mountains (think Mesa Verde), and deep tunnels where they mine for minerals which they then sell to outsiders for things they can't grow or provide for themselves.  Most of their food comes from terrace farms secluded in valleys hidden away from the view of the outside world, but is supplemented with food bought from other regions.

For the most part they are incredibly distrusting of outsiders, and are fiercely independent.  Trade with other groups typically takes place in heavily fortified dwarven trading camps in the lower mountains and foothills.  Very few outsiders are allowed beyond that point."

*F*-face. Lack of symmetry so one eye drooping, half of the mouth droops when smiling (kind of like after you get a novocaine shot from a filling), differences in pupil size, if they stick out their tongue and it goes sideways

*A*-Arm. Can the person raise both arms? If they are not responding to verbal commands/ language barrier present, grab their hands and squeeze one at a time, and both. Is one hand not moving?

*S*-Speech- is speech slurred or makes no sense? Unresponsive to questions or verbal commands?

*T* Time. Time is brain. Time is brain, time is brain. Call 911. 

It's important to remember that just ONE of the FAS is enough to call 911. If the person is very young (less than 50) or you are emotionally close to them it can be difficult to really believe it's happening.

Strokes can be caused by bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic) or blockages of arteries in the brain (ischemic), sometimes both happen simultaneously.

Instead, I have a vision of myself. I have a vision of my future and my legacy. My legacy to my university is two-fold. First, I want to leave behind a successful and self-sustaining competitive rock climbing club. Also, I want to leave behind a super well-organized saxophone section in the marching band.

In order to achieve both of these, I need a reason to stick with them even when I get busy and even when these organizations hit low points. /r/getmotivated helps me maintain that vision of success.

For my future, I want to be fit, successful, and happy. I want to own my own business, have a family, and go rock climbing. And I know I need my schoolwork and grades for that. I know I need to diet and exercise for that. I know I need to maintain my optimism and hope for that. And that's what /r/getmotivated helps me with.

Like Sir Edmund Hillary said, ""We do not conquer the mountain, we conquer ourselves."" My mountain is large, with pounds of fat, lots of books, tons of hard work, and more than likely several actual mountains. But my focus is making myself into the person who can climb that mountain.

Tavarish,Games,1389809131.0,"I think we should consider **what** that exclusive content is and how it does affect game and gameplay environment.

I would argue that BioWare slicing out rather major lore mission from ME 3 and making it DLC, maybe not exclusive but they milk you for it, while knowing that it's **huge** lore thing. That is scummy and should say to gamers ""Stay away, these guys will milk it like no tomorrow!""

Or DICE trying to pull fast one over players and make certain weapons **retailer** exclusive, but backslash was so insane that they had to scrap that plan. In game like Bf 3 weapons do matter as they have very different stats.

Or Treyarch re-making Nuketown for Blops 2 as pre-order exclusive, then after release tried to swipe it under the rug and take out from lobbies.

Obsidian gives exclusive achievement[s] and item[s] to certain level backers of Project Eternity. Shouldn't affect games balance, but they are exclusives for pre-orders / early adopters.

I think inXile wanted to do similar thing with Wasteland 2 and Torment, but backers themselves wanted that model to be scrapped. If memory serves me right.



What about developer exclusive content? DICE [attachments, camos / paints...] or Bungie [weapon etc.]. People seem to be 100% ok with that most of the time, but how it's different from pre-order exclusives? Especially when those toys are for MP in *""compatitive""* games.

**Why indies are more likely to ""get away"" with exclusives than major developers?**

Funding.

Indies, like Bugbear, really need that funding where Kickstarter and Early Access really can give that cash. In order to get people jump in you need more incentives than just interesting concept and/or tech demo. Because, lets face it, major publishers has taught gamers to expect *[timed] exclusives* for theirs pre-order.

Difference being that pre-order can be lifeline for indie project where e.g. BioWare will produce that Mass Effect 23 even if you don't pre-order because they get all funds from publisher. It's why people aren't cracking on indies so hard about things like this car.

P.S. I'm very very surprised if Bugbear, with theirs record this far, if this car is anything else than slightly different model of X class of cars and exclusive paintjob. "

Why do spatial abilities predict mathematical performance?
Tosto MG, Hanscombe KB, Haworth CM, Davis OS, Petrill SA, Dale PS, Malykh S, Plomin R, Kovas Y.**


Spatial ability predicts performance in mathematics and eventual expertise in science, technology and engineering. Spatial skills have also been shown to rely on neuronal networks partially shared with mathematics. Understanding the nature of this association can inform educational practices and intervention for mathematical underperformance. Using data on two aspects of spatial ability and three domains of mathematical ability from 4174 pairs of 12-year-old twins, we examined the relative genetic and environmental contributions to variation in spatial ability and to its relationship with different aspects of mathematics. Environmental effects explained most of the variation in spatial ability (~70%) and in mathematical ability (~60%) at this age, and the effects were the same for boys and girls. Genetic factors explained about 60% of the observed relationship between spatial ability and mathematics, with a substantial portion of the relationship explained by common environmental influences (26% and 14% by shared and non-shared environments respectively). These findings call for further research aimed at identifying specific environmental mediators of the spatial-mathematics relationship.

About a third of the variation in spatial ability at age 12 is explained by genetic factors; a little less than half of the variation in mathematics at this age is genetic. We find no sex differences in the genetic and environmental influences (either in magnitude or type) on mathematical and spatial variation at age 12. The observed overlap between spatial ability and mathematics is substantial (r &gt; .40). Approximately 60% of this overlap is explained by common genetic effects, with 40% of the overlap due to environmental experience.


**Magnitude of sex differences in spatial abilities: A meta-analysis and consideration of critical variables.
Voyer, Daniel; Voyer, Susan; Bryden, M. Philip
Psychological Bulletin, Vol 117(2), Mar 1995, 250-270. doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.117.2.250** 

In recent years, the magnitude, consistency, and stability across time of cognitive sex differences have been questioned. The present study examined these issues in the context of spatial abilities. A meta-analysis of 286 effect sizes from a variety of spatial ability measures was conducted. Effect sizes were partitioned by the specific test used and by a number of variables related to the experimental procedure in order to achieve homogeneity. Results showed that sex differences are significant in several tests but that some intertest differences exist. Partial support was found for the notion that the magnitude of sex differences has decreased in recent years. Finally, it was found that the age of emergence of sex differences depends on the test used. Results are discussed with regard to their implications for the study of sex differences in spatial abilities.

Gender effects on mental rotation in pilots vs. nonpilots.
Verde P, Piccardi L, Bianchini F, Trivelloni P, Guariglia C, Tomao E.**

INTRODUCTION:

Mental rotation ability has an important role in human navigation and, together with other cognitive abilities such as processing speed, working memory, and attention, is crucial for aircraft navigation. In the human performance literature, mental rotation tasks have consistently yielded reports of gender differences favoring men. The aim of this study was to compare the gender difference measured in a specialized population of aviators vs. a matched population of nonpilots.

METHODS: Studied were 41 pilots (20 men and 21 women) and 38 nonpilots (20 men and 18 women) matched for age and education. Pilots were stratified for flying hours. Participants performed a mental rotation task (MRT) in which accuracy and response time were recorded, and also completed sense-of-direction (SOD) and spatial cognitive styles self-evaluation scales.

RESULTS: Men had significantly smaller response time in the MRT (men 279.6 +/- 147.0 s, women 401.6 +/- 361.3) and greater SOD (men's score 49.1 +/- 8.6, women's score 46.6 +/- 7.8), but these differences were absent among pilots. A positive relationship was also identified between pilots' response times and their flight hours.

CONCLUSION:These data suggest that the effect of gender on the speed of cognitive spatial processing is absent in a population with aviation experience. Gender effects may be associated with a low spatial cognitive style, whereas in groups such as aviators, who are expected to have high spatial cognitive style, other factors such as experience may come into play.


**Population sex differences in IQ at age 11: the Scottish mental survey 1932
    Ian J Deary,    Graham Thorpeb,    Valerie Wilsonb,    John M Starrc,    Lawrence J Whalleyd**

There is uncertainty whether the sexes differ with respect to their mean levels and variabilities in mental ability test scores. Here we describe the cognitive ability distribution in 80,000+ children—almost everyone born in Scotland in 1921—tested at age 11 in 1932. There were no significant mean differences in cognitive test scores between boys and girls, but there was a highly significant difference in their standard deviations (P&lt;.001). Boys were over-represented at the low and high extremes of cognitive ability. These findings, the first to be presented from a whole population, might in part explain such cognitive outcomes as the slight excess of men achieving first class university degrees, and the excess of males with learning difficulties.

IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,minnesotavikings,1389809213.0,"Here's the thing... As much as I want to say that there is no way Bridgewater *doesn't* go #1 overall, I can't say that.

At this time last year, plenty of people thought Geno Smith was going to be a Jaguar at #2 overall. They also thought Sharrif Floyd was a lock for top-5 pick. Hell, just a few months ago, Tajh Boyd was going in the top-10 in plenty of mocks I saw.

I'm not going to say that Teddy will drop, because I don't believe he will. Here's what I believe: the hype train is loading the engine with coals right now, and speculation is rampant. There are going to be monumental changes once more information is available about these players.

* I wouldn't be shocked if one of the top QBs (Bridgewater, Manziel, Bortles, Carr) drops *way* down in the first round, or out of it entirely.

* I wouldn't be shocked if Bridgewater doesn't end up going #1 overall, or even the first QB off the board.

* Clowney could slide.

* Other QBs (Brett Smith, David Fales, McCarron, Tajh Boyd, Mettenberger) will see their stock soar after the senior bowl, combine, and pro days.

What I'm trying to say is that the deck is going to shuffle and a lot of pieces are going to move around. As much as I want to scoff at Kiper's mock, I can't. Weirder shit has happened.

That i was saying it was all about your genitals, when my point was more oriented around how you were socialized by your parents/guardians/society, and your gender constructed, due to your genitals prompting society to assign you a gender at birth.

Thus my question of MAAB or FAAB has multiple components to it.

&gt; Well, don't let my experience confirm anything... there's plenty of people like me who have no hormone imbalances

People who are trans\*, may or may not have transgender symptoms, might be diagnosed as trans if they saw a doctor, if they had MRI scans might have transgender brain structures measured... for instance, or otherwise be trans* on a lesser scale, you mean?

Or how about people who might have only previously seen themselves in a cisnormative light, and do not feel trans* at all... are they also included in the plenty of people like you (agender) too?

&gt; and I haven't had that all of my life either. We're all different.

RyanGlavin,AskHistorians,1389809301.0,"U-537 made one of the only armed German landings on North American soil in WWII. She left Kiel on September 18th, 1943, made a brief stop in Bergen on the 30th, and then headed out to sea again.

Their mission was to set up an automatic weather station on Labrador, and on board they carried the scientist Dr. Kurt Sommermeyer, and Wetter-Funkgerat (WFL) number 26, the sixth in such a series and manufactured by Siemens. 

U-537 arrived on the northern tip of Labrador on October 22nd, and for 48 hours laid anchor. The crew carried onto shore 220-pound cannisters and various masts. It was set up 400 yards inland on a 170 foot high hill. 
After finishing this mission, U-537 went onto an uneventful patrol off of Newfoundland, and returned to Lorient on December 8th. 

Since U-537 was lost with all hands in the Far East in late-1944, only Dr. Sommermeyer and a few crew members who transferred off the boat knew of its existence once the war ended. 

The station was rediscovered in the 1980's by Canadian Coast Guard crews, after the story became known once Franz Selinger, an engineer from Siemens, decided to write a history of the German weather service."

&gt;What are the unfair, unrealistic, irrational, self defeating, contradictory, or just plain crazy reasons that you have been broken up with for?

I mean sure the people who already had things lined up were lying. But it's hard to say 'I'm cheating on you' or 'I found someone else.' It's a cowardly not to give the truth, but it can feel reasonable to want to soften the blow—especially if there was nothing the partner could have done. Sometimes people just meet someone better. 

What's fair in that situation is hard. Is it fair to hand out cold truth that might leave them insecure in relationships for a while? Or is it fairer to let him think that his dick was just too big and he needs to find someone who can handle someone impressive?

I'm not trying to justify any actions here. But I don't think conceptualizing these kinds of break ups as the fault of a crazy person is at all healthy or useful for thinking about future relationships.

Including anarcho-capitalist and voluntaryist schools of thought.

Only if you adopt a politically problematic definition of 'capitalism'. Which, of course, you do.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389809461.0,"Well, seeing how you're assuming $40-50k is 60% of your income, I'm just gonna esimate you're worth around $80k a year. Let's crunch some numbers, shall we?

So you earn $80k. You pay taxes on $32k federally. You get back $15k. So you pay $17k, ot about 21%.

This might seem like an increase, but I want to show you something else.

http://www.whatsmypercent.com/

If you type in $80k, you'll see you are better off than 94% of all other income earners. Dude, you're in the top 10% of the population. Really, check your privilege before you complain about taxes.

Or, put another way, idk if you're married or with a girlfriend or not, but say that $80k is between the two of you. It gets even better here. You pay the same $32k, but you get back $30k because there's two of you.

So you end up only paying $2k, which is 2.5%. This will be a massive tax CUT for you. For a married household, that's only 53 percentile, but that's still not half bad.  You're above the median and you pay very little in taxes. Kerep in mind this replaces payroll and crap too. Oh, and because universal healthcare is theoretically included in that number, no insurance premiums either.

Russian_Surrender,AskMen,1389809500.0,"&gt; I don’t want to move companies for a small increase

You're in great shape.  Having been in the position multiple times in my life, the best negotiating position to be in is one in which you are 100% happy - and equally happy - with either outcome.

You simply explain the situation to your new potential employer and say exactly what you said above:  ""I don’t want to move companies for a small increase"".  You can go into a few more details and explain *why* (i.e., risk of taking of new job, current employer obviously values you, loyalty to existing employer, benefit waiting periods, etc.), but ultimately, the decision isn't about the companies, it is about you.

So (just making up figures for example), you go to the offering company and tell them something like ""Since I started the interview process, my current company bumped me to $80,000.  I really like the opportunity here, but I don't really think I can take the risk of a change, and alienate my curren employer, unless you're able to get me closer to $95,000.  I understand if that doesn't work for you"".

So now you're going to end up in 1 of 2 positions:  Stay with your current employer making $80,000, or go to the new employer making $95,000.  You're equally happy with both right?  Can't lose."

Real estate has the advantage of being collateral for the mortgage loan. The returns aren't spectacular, but there's no way any bank will lend you 500K to go risk on the stock market. If you lose and go bankrupt, the bank gets nothing. With real estate, they get the equity you've already pumped into it. 

So instead of, say, 200k that you invest completely in the stock market, you pay 100k on downpayment, get around 500k mortgage for a 600k house. Invest the rest of the 100k in the stock market. Your overall ROI is likely to be higher even if real estate growth is considerably lower than S&amp;P 500's.

With real estate, you get to risk the bank's money and leverage your credibility and salary.

That's leveraging your money for you. It's one of the fastest ways a lot of the middle class build net worth (and lose it too)."

heartosay,Christianity,1389809568.0,"No worries.

Basically, on the evidence available, the RCC believes that it would make more sense for God, having decided to send His Son to be born of a human woman, to ensure that that sacred vessel woud be sinless. 

I erred when I implied that Jesus *had* to be born of a sinles woman, since obviously that decision was down to God alone and He could have Christ born of a sinful woman if He so chose. But we believe that Luke's account of the Annunciation goes against that. How could an Archangel describe a sinner as being ""full of grace""?

So, if we accept that Mary was sinless, she must have been born without even original sin, hence the Immaulate Conception.

That said, there was simply no reason for Mary's ancestors to be born sinless, as this was a limited-edition, one-time-only gift of God to ensure His Son would be brought into the world by a sinless woman.

After all, if Mary was descended from Adam and Eve, on a literal reading of the Bible, (just for the sake of argument) how could all her ancestors be sinless?

Does that clarify things?"

sockalicious,space,1389809734.0,"&gt; This surface is unimaginably far away, and there are no good techniques to measure the distance to the background radiation, we look like we're in the center of the sphere. It's actually far away enough that our position doesn't matter - the change in perspective on the surface that would be caused by moving large distances is miniscule. 

So this isn't quite right.  It turns out that we are inside a flat universe that was formed in a big bang and underwent cosmic inflation.  Everywhere we look, the universe is homogeneous in mass-energy distribution and the thermal radiation (the microwave background) is the same.  The universe is in equilibrium thermally.

Every point in a flat universe that underwent inflation looks like it was the center of the big bang.  No matter where you are in this flat universe that underwent inflation, you can look in any direction and see that distant parts of the universe are in thermal equilibirum and have similar mass-energy distributions, to within the limits suggested by early quantum fluctuations.  No matter where you are in this universe, you can't stare far enough off into space to see the back of your own head; that's because the universe is flat and a straight line never curves back on itself.

It turns out there's no 'unimaginably distant surface' from where this microwave radiation is coming.  Space-time is itself radiating it, everywhere; equilibrating thermally with the rest of the universe in doing so.  

The fact that we can look in one direction and see 13 billion lightyears; and look in the opposite direction and see 13 billion lightyears; and see that the cosmic microwave background is the same in both directions; suggests that the universe must once have been much smaller than it is now, otherwise, those two parts of the universe could not be in thermal equilibrium.  Light, and heat, and energy, could not yet have reached from one side of the universe we can see to the opposite side during the age of the universe.

Therefore the universe must have been much smaller once than it is now; and, since we observe a homogeneous (mass-energy distribution and thermal equilibrium), isotropic (same in any direction we look) universe, therefore at that early time, the universe must have come into equilibrium, down to the limits imposed by quantization of mass and energy.

Those primordial quanta are visible today as tiny unevennesses in the cosmic microwave background of our sky."

Zaorish9,pathofexile,1389809919.0,"I still think you should buff Evasion instead of nerfing IR. I still think that if evasion was buffed by just adding a lot more life to the lower right of the tree, then IR would not be as obvious a choice  -- because then Evasion would be a viable defensive option since if you are not mitigating hits (Evasion) then you should be better able to take larger hits (evasion with high life).

Ultimately I think that life needs to be more closely associated with Evasion than with armor.

Better yet, just switch the functionality of Armor and Evasion:

* Armor gives you a % chance to avoid all damage, but is associated with high life (i.e. your armor plates completely block the attack from hitting the character's body, but the character's body is beefier and when he does get big hits he can take them)
* Evasion is associated with lower life, but mitigates hits. (i.e., you only take 'glancing blows' because the character knows better how to move while fighting, but the character is less tough and can't take harder hits)

I think this would not only be a much better balance, and reduce the excessive popularity of IR, but it would also make logical sense with ""Greenish"" characters being more 'slender and nimble' types with lower HP than the Marauder. You can't have them take the biggest hits but not have the best HP, it just doesn't make sense for hardcore play."

Is it possible that this sentence could actually be applied to you from your girlfriend's point of view? She may see that you are currently addicted, smoking too much (as you yourself describe it) and are allowing that addiction to negatively impact her. I'm not saying this is the actual state of things, just that this may be how she sees it. 

The root problem may not be *weed*, the problem may be the *addiction*. After all, from her point of view, she does have negative anecdotal evidence of weed - she's dating someone who uses it to self medicate, not recreationally, and who considers himself addicted to it. She may find that, as you have more control over your intake, she starts feeling less prejudiced against it even though right now she seems against any level of use. 

On the other hand, it sounds like you both are being pretty hard on each other. She's saying things that make you feel dehumanized, and I'm sure your contempt for her position of ignorance is coming across in your arguments. That's not good for either of you.

Proceed to purchase a world class and extremely fit centre back. Any leftover money should be saved for the summer, where the real change would come from.
Proceed with the season, keeping Montolivo in the centre in the 3 man midfield or the right side on a 2 man mid. De Jong will be given defensive freedom to roam playing alongside Montolivo (Yes, I said it, Montolivo is our focal point), protecting the ball for Montolivo. Cristante, Poli and maybe Nocerino to rotate in the last spot. Honda and Kaka behind Balotelli/Pazzini, or Honda behind Kaka and Balotelli/Pazzini (this allow Kaka to move about less, making decisive run when it matters). El Shaarawy, Birsa and Robinho will rotate with Honda and/or Kaka, as having one of the two in our team along with Montolivo is important in keeping the creativity and through balls flowing.
Training regime should be revamped, giving more specific training, with aim to improve a player's fitness and teamwork without trying something too unconventional so that players reach top fitness levels and then something new could be tried out, this should help prevent players like Kaka and El Shaarawy to sustain injuries over and over.

Good so you will be familiar with the concept of evolutionary psychology then?

and particularly the different selection pressure applied to man and woman wrt to the biological mechanics of reproduction.

i.e by virtue of the fact the in an example of 9 men and 1 woman  the reproduction rate (and survivability) is significantly compromised relative to the reverse of a 9 women and 1 man scenario.

and thus simply by the virtue of the biological mechanics the ""Value"" historically through our evolutionary past has been greater for women than men as they are the limiting factor of reproduction, and this naturally leads itself to allow the disposability of men without compromising the re-productive security of the species. which itself allows men to engage or evolve into high risk high reward behaviours or skill sets, without jeapadising the species existence to a much greater degree than females.

or put more simply, because 1 man can make many babies but 1 women can only make few babies, men throughout all of evolution have had a greater degree of freedom to develop or change their genetic ""powers/talents/skills/attributes/traits"" than women have

(this is even ignoring the increased likelihood due to XY versus XX on random mutation and adaption etc)

EDIT: [It's true! Nooooooooo](http://moviepilot.com/stories/1216091-the-real-reason-star-wars-7-s-screenwriter-was-fired)

EDIT: Oh, I know he was a great option:

&gt; The choice of Arndt to pen a treatment makes perfect sense, given both his prestige as a screenwriter and his close relationship with Disney’s equally secretive Pixar — he’s the screenwriter of the cheekily titled Untitled Pixar Movie That Takes You Inside the Mind for Up director Pete Docter, currently in preproduction — but there’s one more reason still that Arndt would be so appealing to Disney and Lucasfilm: He’s a Star Wars expert.

&gt; Since winning the Oscar for Sunshine, Arndt has lectured extensively on the art of storytelling at numerous writers’ retreats, like the Hawaii Writers Conference in Maui and the Austin Film Festival, always featuring a lengthy and detailed explanation of why the original Star Wars’ ending is so creatively satisfying.

&gt; At these talks, Arndt always tells attendees that Star Wars’ enduring appeal has to do with resolving its protagonists goals’ nearly simultaneously, at the climax of the movie. In the comments section of a discussion about a Star Wars talk Arndt gave at the Austin Film Festival in 2010, one attendee of the seminar notes, ""Arndt stated that if a writer could resolve the story's arcs (internal, external, philosophical) immediately after the Moment of Despair at the climax, he or she would deliver the Insanely Great Ending and put the audience in a euphoric state. The faster it could happen, the better. By [Arndt’s] reckoning, George Lucas hit those three marks at the climax of Star Wars within a space of 22 seconds.""

&gt; Indeed, in the third act of Star Wars, as Arndt explained to his young screenwriting Padawans at the 2009 Hawaii Writers Conference, its central characters' main goals all are met on pages 89 through 91 of the original Lucas script: At the crescendo of Star Wars, a spectral Obi Wan urges, “Use the Force, Luke,” and he does, thus reaching his inner goal (fighting self-doubt to become a hero). Han Solo reappears (meeting the philosophical goal of overcoming selfishness with altruism) to shoot down Darth Vader, which allows Luke to use the Force to mentally guide his shot and blow up the Death Star (outer goal and inner goals simultaneously met).

&gt; So while it remains to be seen whether Arndt will forge ahead with an entire script for Episode VII, clearly, as Vader might say, “The Force is strong with this one.”

Second, I am drawing from the actions of the population of Windhelm, drunk or not. They're the supporters of the war, and potentially the people who flesh out their army. It's important to involve them in the overall analysis.


And finally, Ulfric's actions towards the dunmer (as others have pointed out) that live in Windhelm show obvious disdain. As the leader of the Stormcloaks he is their moralistic figure-head; allowing the dunmer to be treated in that way is a hint to the overall mood of the Stormcloaks.

Given the extremely minimal risk in male circumcision and what are widely reported to be negligible downsides in a typical scenario, this is going to be very difficult for you, especially if your only tactic is to compare circumcision to FGM."

It also bothers me that they do the same damn thing every time (anybody who went to a block party will know what I'm talking about): Diplo takes his shirt off and gets in the ball, two dancers shake their asses, dancers strip a volunteer down to his boxers and grind on him, girls come up on stage, and nobody bothers to DJ.

US liquefied natural gas is only about $1 less than Russia's in the European market (likely very intentional on Russia's part). European leaders are talking about at least setting up some relationship with the US, since Russia has been shown to be an unreliable partner at times and convenient ""crises"" tend to happen in the dead of winter, causing prices to spike. 

Long story short, the US doesn't have to force natural gas on anyone. Several countries have offered to pay for the infrastructure to export it as long as a quota is met."

However, there are noticeable flaws. The scene where Leutnant Werner has a rag thrown onto his face is one of the most glaring: He's an officer, even if not actually part of the crew, and such an act would have demanded a very large amount of discipline and punishment.

Another one is the fact that La Rochelle was being bombed in August of 1941, and the fate of U-96 herself. La Rochelle wouldn't be a functional base until November of that year, and even barring that, no Allied bombers really had the range to reach La Rochelle. U-96 herself was not sunk until March 1945, at her berth in Wilhelmshaven.

Also, mechanically, any sort of damage to the pressure hull would have been immediately worrisome to the crew, as one loosened screw would be enough to destroy her, while in the movie plenty of scenes have screws flying all over the place, and that's barring a bomb dropped right onto the deck of the boat.

A lot of women leave pornography with horror stories of rape and degradation, and sexual, physical and emotional abuse.  Since pornography tends to promote towards the male gaze (I.e it shoots with the intent that men will watch) often times women and the things that might excite them are entirely ignored to fulfill the male fantasy.  Most women don't like getting face fucked or pounded in the ass with no lube, and the fact there is very little porn that aims to fulfill fantasies of women is indicative of that.

Read [this](http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/windows-8-vs-windows-rt-what-s-the-difference-1086980) if you want to know why. 

More specifically:

&gt;**Windows RT vs Windows 8: software and compatibility**

&gt;There's a big difference here: Windows RT comes with Office preinstalled, and Windows 8/Pro doesn't. However, Windows 8/Pro are compatible with existing Windows programs and Windows RT isn't. 

&gt;Windows RT apps must use the Microsoft-style interface, although Windows 8 programs can use the traditional Windows desktop too.
Windows RT also restricts what APIs (application programming interfaces) developers can use, especially for web browsers.

ebonlance,PS4,1389810494.0,"&gt;they could afford to pay employees more

And there's a reason why they don't. The work is only worth minimum wage because of how replaceable the person is, and the number of people who would want to work. If you doubled minimum wage they would happily can a significant portion of their staff knowing that any remaining workers would be stuck either dealing with the increased workload or replaced by the swaths of newly unemployed people who would happily replace them for a couple months before getting burnt out and repeating the cycle. Changing the minimum wage does not change the amount Walmart management's is willing to spend on payroll, and they will rebalance their staff as much as possible to avoid spending as much as possible - including bringing in people skilled enough that they're worth the new minimum wage.

Minimum wage workers get paid what they do because they're not worth much. They're easily replaceable, unskilled, and in high supply. Raising the minimum wage does not change this, except for increasing supply. We're still going to be subsidizing people either way.

You want to solve the problem of subsidizing peoples low wages, fix education and occupational training. Bring skilled labor back to the US. The problem isn't that unskilled workers aren't getting paid enough, it's that we have too many unskilled workers in a world where it's cheaper to produce in third-world countries and ship back. "

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389810510.0,"His high usage isn't really a problem.  His assist rate is well above average for a big man and he shoots at a high enough rate that high usage is detrimental to the team.  

Beyond that, the team is structured in such a way that our offense makes sense with a lot of pressure on Boogie.  Our 2 guards are streak shooters that do best when they get kickouts.  We don't have an offensive-minded 4 (at least while Landry is out), so Boogie has to make up for them with plays inside.  Rudy Gay has been doing very well with limited shots and seems to benefit from Boogie getting attention.  Isaiah Thomas is also able to play his game best when Boogie gets a lot of touches.  

When you have a PER of 27 with a good shooting percentage and a decent assist rate, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to have a high usage rate on a successful team.  Boogie's offensive game has been a benefit for the Kings. "

I know a girl, that I wanted to date at one point, who expressed she was a firm lesbian, but has had a mixed history of boyfriends and girlfriends, and had slept with me a few times in 2013.

2.) Our safe lane was up against an aggressive trilane. Our safe lane got destroyed because veno refused to rotate to the safelane. They laned against a solo elder titan, who won the lane because the venomancer was more concerned with last hitting than harassing the ET. The veno fucked up lane composition and refused to cooperate to rectify the situation. Oh and need I remind you that he *abandoned the game* a little over 10 minutes in? He fucked our game up, then left. There is no excuse.

3.) our MMRs ranged from 3500 to 4500. ""new to this game/hero"" is no excuse, and wasn't an excuse anyway because I believe the player had about 2000 hours in dota 2.

Edit: I'd also like to point out that we don't get angry first. We communicate with randoms. We ask nicely for cooperation. It makes us angry when people go out of their way to ignore communication. No one is ""bossed around"", they are given suggestions to help the team. ""veno, the safe lane really needs your help."" Suggestions that go completely ignored. Dota is first and foremost a team game and when players put themselves before the team, the team as a whole suffers."

""29/30: August 18 Biber sailed, all eighteen returned safely. Claims of a landing ship and a Liberty ship sunk were not substantiated by Allied records and no official reference of the attack.

August 31: K-Flotille 261 forced to abandon Fecamp. Most of the Biber were destroyed and abandoned and those which were taken away were subsequently destroyed in a night action with an Allied armoured column. This marked the end of K-Verband operations in Normandy.

An advanced base was prepared at Poortershavn and Hellevoetsluis at the head of the Waal/Maas estuary. The main base being Rotterdam. 30 Biber and 30 Molch were sent here. A further 60 Molch and 30 Biber were sent to Assens from Heligoland and Groningen respectively. 60 more Biber would arrive in the area in January 1945.

22/23 December 1944 - 18 Biber sailed from Poortershavn and Hellevoetsluis. This operation ended in failure. British MTBs surprised the Biber whilst still being towed and instantly sank four. One was mined and one returned damaged. The remaining 12 disappeared. One success - Alan a Dale 4,700 ton - sunk.

23/24 December 1944 - 11 Biber sailed - none returned.

24/25 December 1944 - 3 Biber sailed - none returned.

By the end of 1944 - 31 (thirty-one) Biber lost in return for one merchant ship sunk. Only 8 (eight) of the Biber lost were claimed by the Allies.

27 December 1944: - 14 Biber preparing to sail. Two torpedoes accidentally fired into the lock, 11 (eleven) Biber destroyed. Remaining 3 (three) sailed - none returned but Biber 90 found drifting off the North Foreland on 29 December by HMS Ready with the operator dead at the controls. It was attempted to tow this Biber to Dover but due to deteriorating weather the Biber sank . On its recovery 10 (ten) days later a post mortem on the operator established that he had died from carbon monoxide poisoning.

At the end of 1944 only 20 (twenty) Biber remained at Rotterdam

29/30 January 1945 - 15 (fifteen) Biber sailed from Hellevoetsluis
   One sunk following collision with floating ice.
   Five forced to return with ice damage.
   One found beached downstream from Hellevoetsluis after spending
      64 (sixty-four) hours at sea looking for a target.
   Five failed to return.

3 February 1945 Both the Molch and Biber depots attacked by air - no Biber losses. Damage to installations prevented anymore operations in February.

Summary of K-Verband operations in January and February shows that during the former month there were 15 (fifteen) sorties and 10 (ten) losses and during the latter month 14 (fourteen) sorties and 6 (six) losses - no successes in terms of Allied ships lost or damaged were achieved in either month.

6 March 1945 - Hellevoetsluis, another torpedo accident - 14 (fourteen) Biber sunk and 9 (nine) damaged. 6 March 1945 - 11 (eleven) Biber sailed - none returned.
   One captured by an ML off Breskens.
   Four found abandoned along the coast at North Beveland, Knocke
      Domberg and Zeebrugge.
   One sunk by gunfire off Westkapelle on 8 March.
   Five vanished.

11/12 March 1945 - 15 (fifteen) Biber and 14 Molch, S-Boote and Linsen.
   13 (thirteen) Biber failed to return and 9 Molch.
   2 sank by RAF Swordfish off Schouwen on 11 March.
   4 sank by Mls off Westkapelle.
   4 sank by shore batteries of Flushing and Breskens on 12 March.
   1 sank by Spitfire off Walcheren on 12 March.

californiabound,TwoXChromosomes,1389810738.0,"&gt; When I was eighteen I finally worked up the courage to have a sexual experience with someone and they adored my body, this helped me so much. Just recently as I've entered my twenties I'd managed to put my self consciousness behind me and actually learned to appreciate my B's.

My advice is to get back to this.  The only reason you started feeling insecure again is because of the guy you're with.  If anyone feels like your breast size is inadequate (which is ridiculous seeing as Bs are pretty average), the next best thing is to have confidence. If you like your boobs, then he has to as well.  Don't worry about something that is *his* problem, just love what you've got and don't let him get you down!  Bonus, that kind of confidence is sexy enough to make up for anything negative he may think about your body.  

My experience: as soon as I started thinking ""screw what you think, I'm sexy"" when getting busy, I got a lot more positive feedback."

viceywicey,AskMen,1389810987.0,"It's hard to say without knowing him a little more.  Men respond to this type of criticism differently depending on their perception of self/body-image.  For example, I used to be chubby and have always had a deep insecurity that I've slowly resolved by changing to a more fit lifestyle.  If I started getting bigger, all you'd have to say is, ""Honey, you're packing on the weight"" straight to my face and I'd get my shit together, no harm no foul.

Your guy, is he insensitive about his weight?  Has he ever had weight issues in the past?  Has he ever exercised, but has stopped recently?  What about you?  Do you exercise regularly?  Do you eat healthy foods?  Have you ever brought these concerns up before and how did he handle it?  Asking for a singular ""how"" oversimplifies the emotions involved and could be disastrous.

I think the focus should be less on the amount of food he eats and more about his lifestyle.  Eating two plates of food is hardly a problem, if he's hitting the gym 5 times a week.  But if he's eating 2 plates of food, then sitting on the couch for two hours to watch TV before running back for a nightcap, then his intake isn't meeting his output and this is a problem.

My first recommendation would be to make it more about the ""us"" then the ""you""; as in, ""Honey, I love you and I want to be able to spend the next 'X' number of years with you.  Let's get healthy so that we CAN spend the next 'X' Number of years together instead of having to worry about one of us dying from diabetes or something"" or some permutation of this.

My second suggestion (warning: this is an extreme one) is to take him camping (assuming he hypothetically enjoys this).  Only thing is that the campsite is a 4 mile hike with a 20 degree incline.  Maybe there's a romantic surprise at the top to celebrate however many years you've been together (campground sexy time!).  You have to get to the top though to get it.  When he's close to death at 1 mile in, hopefully, a light-bulb might turn on in his head: ""Holy shit, I'm literally dying.  This is not good.""  Credit to Bill Burr for this one."
Diguiseppimon,AskReddit,1389810988.0,"The only time my mom has ever been really cool towards me (my mother and I have a long standing history of hatred towards each other). 

I have this stuffed Siamese cat, Pickles. I have had him from they very day I was born, and he has a permanent place next to my pillow. Pickles had to have some reconstructive surgery when I was 2, after I left him outside and my dog had his way with him. So his face is put back together, but he is missing an ear, and one of his eyes are sunk in.

When I was 6, my moms friend from high school came to visit for the first time in years, and she brought her daughter (same age) with her as well. It was right after Easter, so I had just gotten this new Barbie that had this stuff you put in your/her hair and it made it colorful. That little bitch used up ALL my blue hair streaky stuff. I was really upset about that, so I stopped playing with her, and left my room to play outside. I came back a little while later to find her hunched over my bed, facing the wall, with Pickles no where to be found. I asked what she was doing, and she proudly held out my beloved Pickles, and said ""I fixed him!"", and had his sunken in eye halfway out of his head. I instantly snatched him up and smacked her cheek as hard as I could and yelled ""DON'T EVER TOUCH PICKLES OR I'LL KILL YOU"". Obviously, this threat mixed with her crying prompted our parents to rush into the room. My mom asked what happened and she goes ""She hit me!"", which made her mother upset, and when my mom asked me why, I tearfully held Pickles out to her and showed her what that little bitch did to him. All she did was look at her friend and shrug, and said, ""Well, you shouldn't have messed with Pickles face"". They left right after that. 

Tl;dr--The only time my mom has ever really stuck up for me, after her childhood friends kid messed with my stuffed animal that I've had since I was born. 

**Edit**--Forgot to mention why it makes me mad thinking back. Basically, don't fuck with Pickles. I've had friends come over in the past few years that sit on my bed and see him and try to pick his eye out of his face, and I immediately snatch him up and yell at him. His eye is fine, leave my friend alone. "

With that having been said, stop *asking* him if he wants you to do nice things for him. That puts the pressure on him to accept your gestures. When you notice he needs or wants something, just do it. He doesn't want someone to take care of him if he's sick or stressed - okay, fine. There's lots of other ways to do things for people. Some of my favorites:

Small, unexpected treats: being surprised with my favorite candy bar at the end of a long day is great.
Doing surprise chores: nothing makes me feel better than walking out in the morning to find my car cleared of snow after a snowstorm.
Experiences together: mentioning how I'd love to rewatch Deadwood and coming home to find it all ready to go one night, or how I'd love to go see X movie and finding he's planned a movie night for us.
Making an effort to be supportive of things: he's not a fan of Doctor Who, but he knows the differences between Nine, Ten, and Eleven because it's something I care about. 
Helping de-stress: If I'm stressed, nothing makes me more stressed then having to constantly reassure someone that I'm fine. Find other ways to support him. Maybe sit quietly together and listen to music, maybe give him some space, whatever works for him. Sometimes not doing something is actually the best thing you can do for someone. "

For this society to function, we all agree upon what is right and wrong for us, and then we apply those to all future interpersonal relations. We subscribe to the moral code dictated by the society as a whole, and that is where justify our judgment of moral actions by comparing them against our moral code. There is no *objective* moral ground to compare it to, which a moral relativist would say, but they might say that there is a societal one - and they're perfectly within their rights in condemning those that go against that."

It's not necessarily bookstore greed (more just inefficiency), but you will almost never get your best deal.  When selling books, you'll want to try and find a student buyer.  Barring that, compare buyback offers from services like Amazon, Chegg, ValoreBooks, and Cash4Books.net.

A shameless plug: my startup, [Texts.com](http://texts.com), allows you to buy/sell textbooks with the people on your campus (no fees / commissions).  We'll also compare the best buyback prices from the companies I mentioned above.

As for buying books-- you have a few options.  Finding old editions and international copies is a great way to save money and still have a physical textbook (which is important to many people for various reasons).  If you're okay with pirating / torrenting books, look around and you'll find some solid resources (I won't risk linking you to anything specific).

Lastly, I'm willing to bet that $800 figure is quoting the bookstore price.  Again, assuming money is an issue, the convenience of the campus bookstore is almost never worth it.  Instead, you should be comparing prices from places like AbeBooks, Amazon, Chegg, BiggerBooks, etc. etc.

You can compare all of those vendors (and more) by searching books at[ Texts.com](http://texts.com).  We do make a commission (affiliate links), but you'll still find the cheapest deal.

JordanLeDoux,Portland,1389811200.0,"In fact, in the very early stages of the CRC, before it was a thing most Portlanders had ever heard about, that is the sort of bridge that the City of Portland was pushing for.

Vancouver wasn't really interested, and only Oregon and Washington had the ability to kill the project. ODOT pledged to let Portland kill it by proxy though, and that let Portland force Vancouver into accepting light rail.

Then Adams fell out of favor with the public, Occupy happened and soured the city (ironically) on the concept of public good, and the owner of Plaid Pantry paid for his own independent study showing that the toll and traffic models used in the CRC were massively flawed. 

That was tough enough as it was (with Vancouver taking every opportunity to bitch about the $700 million in the $4.5 billion bridge that came from light rail), but then the rich fucks that use Pearson Airfield essentially told the Feds, Oregon, Washington, Vancouver and Portland to go fuck themselves and almost forced a complete redesign because of height restrictions.

Then, after they finally got a basic design for the bridge, the Coast Guard vetoed it because it wasn't high enough to accommodate some vessels that needed to get up river, and that just about killed the project.

Portland and Vancouver are too far apart on what they want, Pearson Airfield and the Coast Guard make it almost impossible to design a non-lifting bridge, and the Feds won't let anything but a non-lifting bridge get put in.

Oregon wouldn't be able to build this bridge even if we threw the entire state budget at it (over $12 billion)."
beefcakez,naturalbodybuilding,1389811201.0,"I've found that my shoulders are the most lagging part of my body, and due to injuries (from lifting like an idiot early in my career) I've hindered my training. 

So, as a result, I've had to stop doing most presses and begun to do more concentrated work. 

So, now my routine is as follows (only work sets listed):

DB Lateral raises

* 4 sets of 8-12

Rope Face pulls

* 3 sets of 10-12

DB presses (with elbows slightly forward to protect my acrominion)

* 4-5 sets of 10-8-6-15 reps (old Vince Gironda routine)

If the pain my shoulders act up, I'll switch the DB presses for DB upright rows (single arm at a time)

I'll do this routine 2x a week and use a 2-0-2-0 timing (2 second concentric, no rest, 2 second eccentric, no pause). 

On my off days, due to injuries, I'll do rotator cuff training exercises like rotations and some of those crazy exercises shown in the [Smart Overhead Pressing](http://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/1ubsgu/smart_overhead_pressing/) post I made a while back. 

As for tweaks I've made, I learned a technique to isolate the lateral delt while doing DB raises from Vic's Natural. If you hold a 5 lb plate at the edge with just your fingers (not at the center hole) and do a lateral raise, the traps are tucked down and back such that they aren't used. Made a world of difference for my technique. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp4VXKGS3MY) 



Getting stronger, so I can get back to lifting heavy!

4. there are less audio queues for terror, but there are more than sufficient.

5. The run and hide aspect is more pronounced.  You can even use the environment to some degree (vaulting tables, etc.)

""Cold temperatures immediately after your cool-down help bring your heart rate down and increase your circulation, which in turn helps reduce your recovery time. The increased level of blood your heart pumped to match your body's needs won't be allowed to pool in your tired muscles, and those muscles will clear the lactic acid more quickly.

Additionally, exercise can cause muscles to become inflamed -- the swelling caused by small tears in the muscle fiber -- and a cold shower may help to minimize soft tissue inflammation and its associated pain."""

Primary Skills: One Handed, Sneak, Alchemy
Secondary Skills: Light Armor, Block
Optional Skills: Smiting, Enchanting, Illusion

This is a QCQ build that is based around stealth play but also fully capable of going toe to toe with an opponent.

Skill Breakdown.

One Handed: Pretty self explanatory, makes your daggers and swords hit harder. You want to max Armsman ASAP and pick up Fighting Stance and Savage Strike. Bladesman is optional because the damaged gained from the critical strikes is negligible. 

Sneak: Can't be a very good assassin if you're seen all the time. Pick up one rank in Stealth and just leave it at that unless you have nothing else to rank as after the first perk point it only goes up 5% at a time which is pretty minor. Backstab is a must have and should be picked up ASAP and you can go all the way up to Assassin's Blade if you want to use daggers for kills. Then go ahead and pick up everything along the left side of the tree, Silence and Shadow Warrior aren't needed but can be handy and fun.

Alchemy: Because it fits the whole assassin vibe. Max Alchemist and work up to Poisoner, nothing else is needed.

Light Armor: Gotta protect yourself yo. Max Agile Defender, nothing else is needed.

Block: This skill is what will save you for those botched assassinations and you have to go toe to toe with someone. Blocking with one handed still applies the perks with the exception of Block Arrows, Elemental Protection, and Shield Charge. The key perk you want tho is Quick Reflexes, this perk applied with Silent Roll allows you to slow down time quickly roll forward and have free shots at your enemies back because the time slow is still in effect even after you stop blocking. Power, Deadly, and Disarming Bash aren't needed but being able to disarm your enemy is very useful. Put one point in Shield Wall and level it up when there is nothing more valuable to put points in.

Smithing: You likely wont be making your own equipment so this is only used for improving your swords, daggers, and armors.

Enchanting: Most of the stuff you will use is pre-enchanted but if you want to you can make your own specialty daggers.

Illusion: I debated putting this in as a more mandatory skill but decided to leave it as optional. The man thing about Illusion is that the Quiet Casting perk makes your Shouts silent! This has a ton of uses alone. 

Pretty much all the weapons and armor you will be using will be gained from The Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild quests. You can do archery but where's the fun in that? Getting close and personal is much more fun."

The_Last_Leviathan,AskReddit,1389811390.0,"This rather long one from George Graham Vest is featured in Dean Koontz ""Watchers"". I cried when it appeared in the book, which is my all time favorite:


The one absolutely unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog. A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer. He will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings, and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.


If fortune drives the master forth, an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him against danger, to fight against his enemies. And when the last scene of all comes, and death takes his master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by the graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad, but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even in death.

For one thing, education has been reaching more and more people ever since the dawn of the industrial revolution, with no signs of slowing down. If you think people are stupid now, imagine what it must have been like a thousand years ago, when only the 1% of the 1% (the aristocracy and the clergy) had any access to information or even knew how to read. If you think it's a problem now, it's one that's in the process of being dealt with, with incredible results. Unless you're not a fan of democracy, I highly doubt that stupidity will start to pose more of a social problem than it ever has since the Revolutionary War.

 Stupid people just receive an amount of attention disproportionate to their representation in the populace or the influence they wield, because communications have improved by so much and we tend to focus on the outrageous more than the typical. That's why you think it's getting worse. In reality, you just had less knowledge of the ignorance that was always out there.

Invoking actual goodness and decency will have no effect, save for making Knights Templar demonize your cause as the work of the Devil. After all, they are certain that their own cause is just and noble, and anyone who stands in the way is a deluded fool at best and another guilty soul to be ""cleansed"" or evildoer to be killed at worst, and doing so is not even Dirty Business (except, sometimes, for how much it makes ''them'' suffer, having to hand out all this justice).

JorddyK,AskReddit,1389811657.0,"[Ideopathic Intracranial Hypertension
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension)

&gt; Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), sometimes called by the older names benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) or pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), is a neurological disorder that is characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) in the absence of a tumor or other diseases. The main symptoms are headache, nausea, and vomiting, as well as pulsatile tinnitus (sounds perceived in the ears, with the sound occurring in the same rhythm as the pulse), double vision and other visual symptoms. If untreated, it may lead to swelling of the optic disc in the eye, which can progress to vision loss.[1]


[Chiari malformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiari_malformation)

&gt;Chiari malformation, or sometimes known as Arnold-Chiari malformation, is a malformation of the brain. It consists of a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum (the opening at the base of the skull), sometimes causing non-communicating [1] hydrocephalus as a result of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow.[2] The cerebrospinal fluid outflow is caused by phase difference in outflow and influx of blood in the vasculature of the brain. It can cause headaches, fatigue, muscle weakness in the head and face, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, nausea, impaired coordination, and, in severe cases, paralysis.[3]

[Sciatic Neuropathy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatic_neuropathy#Pathology)

&gt;Pain caused by a compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve by a problem in the lower back is called sciatica. Common causes of sciatica include the following lower back and hip conditions: spinal disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and piriformis syndrome.[3] Other acute causes of sciatica include coughing, muscular hypertension, and sneezing.[4]

[Rhabdomyolysis
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis)

&gt;Rhabdomyolysis /ˌræbdɵmaɪˈɒlɨsɪs/ is a condition in which damaged skeletal muscle tissue (Greek: ῥαβδω rhabdo- striped μυς myo- muscle) breaks down (Greek: λύσις –lysis) rapidly. Breakdown products of damaged muscle cells are released into the bloodstream; some of these, such as the protein myoglobin, are harmful to the kidneys and may lead to kidney failure. The severity of the symptoms, which may include muscle pains, vomiting and confusion, depends on the extent of muscle damage and whether kidney failure develops. The muscle damage may be caused by physical factors (e.g., crush injury, strenuous exercise), medications, drug abuse, and infections. Some people have a hereditary muscle condition that increases the risk of rhabdomyolysis. The diagnosis is usually made with blood tests and urinalysis. The mainstay of treatment is generous quantities of intravenous fluids, but may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases.[1][2]
Rhabdomyolysis and its complications are significant problems for those injured in disasters such as earthquakes and bombings. Relief efforts in areas struck by earthquakes often include medical teams with the skills and equipment to treat survivors with rhabdomyolysis. The disease was first described in the 20th century, and important discoveries as to its mechanism were made during the Blitz of London in 1941.[3] Horses may also suffer from rhabdomyolysis from a variety of causes.[4]"

The real issue is enforcement: If criminals don't expect to be caught (and most don't), the punishment won't deter no matter what it is. According to wiki ([source](http://www.ncpa.org/pdfs/st229.pdf)), about 5% of rapes in the US will lead to prison time.

Kmodek,AskReddit,1389811873.0,"My sister and I used to get money to buy candy at a little store on the corner of my street and we were asking my mom for money or bottles to carry in to get change for candy.




So instead of just giving us each a quarter, my mom asked me and my sister who we'd want to live with if my parents got divorced.  My sister said she'd want to live with my mom and my mom handed her money.  

I said I'd want to live with my dad, and my mom looked at me and was SO pissed, and she told me I had to spend the rest of the day in my room and that I didn't get any money for candy.  

She would always come up with little things like this that would cause us (usually me) to get in trouble.  If you just looked at her wrong, she'd beat the crap out of you, so you had to be on guard all the time.

This one just stands out because I felt horrible for saying I'd want to live with my dad, but I was just a kid being honest.  I remember how confused I was and I felt like my mom hated me.  

I recently found out that my mom tried to get my aunt and my great grandma to take me when I was a newborn because a 3rd kid wasn't wanted and I was a girl.  Plus, my mom was (still is) a pain pill addict and having another kid REALLY interrupted her drug addled haze she lived in.  

I'm 41 and I don't speak to my mom at all at this point.  

TL/DR:  Mom asked which parent I'd want to live with after divorce and I said my dad, so I was grounded but my sister picked my mom, so she got to go buy candy.

Eev5,AskWomen,1389811880.0,"Butternut gratin! Super simple, but those are often the best flavors. :) If you want this to be a vegetarian one pot dish, just omit the minced pork. (Based on Laura Vitale's Butternut Squash Gratin. She has loads of great easy recipes, google her!)

As a side dish (without the meat), this would feed 6 people. As a dish on its own, 4 ish? My family consists of big eaters, so I'm not sure.

Cook some minced pork (or beef, or even turkey, whatever you have on hand!) and set aside. Peel and cut up a butternut pumpkin in about 1 inch cubes. (I once didn't have enough butternut, so I added carrot and potato in there as well, worked out wonderfully! You could add other root vegetables too). Chop up some onion and add to a skillet with high sides with a splash of olive oil. Cook until soft. Add some minced garlic, and let that cook till it loses its raw flavor (not even 1 minute). Add your vegetables, season with pepper and salt, cover with a lid and let it cook on medium heat for about 10-15 minutes, until they start to soften up. (They might fall apart a bit, but that's okay! As long as they're cooked, we're all good.)

Add about half a cup of milk and half a cup of cream, I'm just winging it most of the time. (I use light cream, but you can go heavy cream, but I'd use a little less then.) Add some poultry seasoning too, and let it reduce for a few minutes. Add your meat back in.

While having the vegetables cooking away, you can work on your topping. Get a couple of slices of white bread, and put it in the food processor until it's all crumbled up. (I just do it by hand, but I wish I had a food processor, haha.) Melt about two tablespoons of butter, and get yourself half a cup of grated cheese. (I use a mix of 4 cheeses specifically advertised for gratins, but you can use whatever cheese you like!). Mix that all together.

Transfer your vegetable mixture to a buttered up casserole dish, and sprinkle the bread/cheese mixture on top. Cook for about 30 minutes in a preheated 200 degrees C° (400 degrees F) until the top looks nice and golden brown.

This is my family's all time favorite dish that I cook! Really soft flavors, so this also goes down with the kids pretty well. :) "

The GPu on my new laptop is a hair more powerful than the old one but uses much less power. 

Benefits to desktop: so much more powerful than any laptop you can buy, at any price. Huge, beautiful monitor, full size mechanical keyboard, super-accurate mouse, etc. It's the perfect gaming computer. Much better than even my big G73 ever was, even though that was an excellent laptop for gaming. 

Benefits of laptop: portable. Duh. And for a cost of around $800 it's still a very competent gaming machine. I use it fairly frequently because I travel about every other weekends to visit my parents or my friends who live 1-2 hours away. I like the 14"" form factor. It's perfect for playing games like league of legends, civ V, DOTA, minecraft, KSP, etc. the kinds of games I usually play with my friends when I'm visiting. Laptops are not good platforms for games like BF4, Metro, etc. which have either very demanding graphics and/or require high precision. 

If you mostly play less demanding games and you travel regularly, I'd recommend getting a decent 15"" laptop with at least a 750m GPU. If you rarely travel, and you like playing games with high end graphics, you should get a desktop. Only really hard decision is if you really like to play high end games AND you travel a lot, and you can't afford both lol. "

RyanGlavin,AskHistorians,1389812129.0,"It's not that the U.S. didn't have an answer to Drumbeat, it's that the greater portion of the destroyer fleet was engaged in escorting of troopship convoys and capital ships across the Atlantic. The amount of destroyers in the Atlantic was relatively constant, but were already engaged in escorting numerous convoys.

The main point boils down to this: Did the *Tirpitz* attack, or did a Uboat attack? If the Tirpitz attacked, Admiral King from his headquarters at Washington would have directed the Atlantic Fleet commander, Royal Ingersoll, to engage and sink her. However, if a U-boat attacked, an entirely different naval command would have had to respond. 

These naval commands were called Coastal Frontiers. The commanders of these frontiers kept close track of naval and commercial ships. In the event of hostilities, the commanders were expected to defend the frontier. 

The most important of these commands  was the Eastern Sea Frontier, stretching from the Canadian Border to North Carolina. It was commanded by King's classmate, Adolphus Andrews. 

Andrews, while being the biggest, actually had no warships under his command, and had to call on the Atlantic fleet for warships in case of a U-boat attack. The help was nonexistent-the Atlantic Fleet was preoccupied with escorting convoys. 

So, Andrews did the best he could and assembled a ragtag fleet on twenty ships:

7 Coast Guard Cutters (165' *Dione* and six 125' ships)
4 prewar 110' Sub Chasers
3 200' Eagle Class subchasers
2 1905 gunboats
4 large converted yachts.

In actuality, only the 16 knot *Dione* had any sort of chance to engage a U-boat.

Andrews also had no aircraft, the U-boats greatest deterrence, at his command. He eventually  was able to get his hands onto blimps, which was commissioned as Combat Squadron 12. They flew 45 ASW patrols and six convoy escort missions in January 1942.

In short, the U.S. *possibly* had answers to fight them off, but were unable to use them due to the fact that they were already preoccupied in other war-time duties. That's not to say there wasn't any answers, but the answers that did exist were extremely rag tag and relatively ineffective.

They stopped because Andrews was able to implement two things: ships were only to sail at the daytime (implemented in April) and full on convoys were implemented by mid-May. Seeing an immediate reduction in sinkings, Donitz withdrew the force to easier grounds."

bisousdarling,MakeupAddicts,1389812168.0,"Ok. I'm not going to talk you out of it, but conversely, talk you into it. Is it ridiculous to spend $170 on a compact? Yes, obviously, BUT if it's something that you think you would keep forever, then it's worth it (to me). I've held that compact since /u/insidiousraven owns it and it is heavy and sturdy and built well. Also, if you get that compact and love the pressed meteorites, it's only $55 to replace the powder and you are helping the environment by reducing waste since you don't throw the whole compact out. 

Now, if you don't think you want to have that compact forever (and legit, this is the kind of thing that could totally be passed down through the family), then don't get it. If you don't actually want the pressed meteorites, also don't get it!

But there are a few servers that do not have sleeper and you can safely disconnect without worrying about being killed while doing other things. 
**2**. I've found that loot in radtowns usually respawn as quick as 5 mins. Rocks and wood piles take around a night/day ingame to respawn. Not too sure
**3**. Start out in an Official server, get a feel for it. If you like it and have no problems(you probably will), stay. Otherwise, disconnect and find a community server to your liking. If you want a sleeper server, find one that has that. If you think you've found a server to your liking, log in and ask players/admins questions. (i.e. How many players are required for an airdrop, etc). Ask about rules and anything that might make you not want to play on the server.
**4**. I'm not too sure, I'd estimate them both to be around 10-15 minutes. Someone else may have the exact time. 
**5**. Each of your characters in each server you play on is unique. You could be dirt poor in server A and be drowning in c4 in server B. 
**6**. The previous patch certainly did ban a lot of hackers. Though this game is still in alpha so more exploits will be discovered and fixed. Recently theres a new hack that makes everyone commit suicide. If you find a low population server that has dedicated admins, you should not have any long term worries with hackers.

A few more:

* [Aria](http://myanimelist.net/anime/477/Aria_the_Animation) -- As slow and lacking in plot as it is, it's one of those series where you just sit back and enjoy. Akari is the type of character who enjoys everything, even what most would consider mundane. For example, I hate getting up in the morning to start the day, while Akari delights in the ""sounds of the day starting"" (i.e. the sounds made while cooking breakfast). It's a beautiful series that will help you realize how the little things in life help make it enjoyable.
* [Millennium Actress](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1033/Sennen_Joyuu) -- I'm not sure if I can put this effectively into words, especially without spoiling anything. If I had to sum up my feelings about it, it would probably be that it's our experiences and how we go about life that matters more than the end goal - fame, money, etc. In the film, Chiyoko is a nationally acclaimed actress, but what matters most to her is ""the chase"" (i.e. chasing after the man she loves), and, although she faced seemingly insurmountable difficulties at times, she never gave up and, at the end, did not regret her choices."

Inmates on death row can make more appeals than people not sentenced to death (because you want to be damned sure you're killing the right person) which costs a lot in terms of court time etc. This also takes a long time - the average death row inmate spends close to 15 years in prison before being executed.

shelleythefox,confessions,1389812455.0,"I have 3 children, and I never really enjoyed being pregnant either. I was able to feel my babies, and that was really the only part of being pregnant that I liked.  I was exhausted, crabby, and miserable the entire time. There's nothing wrong with you.

 Your financial worries are really only compounding the problem. You may want to look into the laws of your state/county and see if your employer is following the law regarding your maternity leave. American employment is terrible about maternity leave, but even that sounds really sketchy to me.

When you get back to work, compile a list of things you've done to help improve your workplace or exceptional things you've done and ask for a raise if you need one. 

I always felt so much better after the birth, and after a while your hormones will even out and everything won't seem so awful. One small bit of advice I'd like to impart is not to make any major, life-altering decisions right now until after the birth and you feel more like yourself again.

Be sure to let your doc know about how you've been feeling regarding all of this. If I'm not mistaken you may be at an increased risk of post-partum depression. I went through that with my first child the entire time I nursed him (9 mo.), except I didn't recognize it for what it was at the time, so I never told anyone and felt crazy and very very alone the entire time. There isn't much in the way of care for new moms after the birth except the 6 week checkup, then it's a giant void and you feel on your own with the whole mom-thing. If you end up with PPD, this will all be magnified and make you feel hopeless. (This is all hypothetical, you may not get PPD at all, in fact you may just feel amazing, everyone is different)

Talk to your husband about all of this. DO NOT INTERNALIZE your feelings about this. You need his support right now. I know you don't want to disappoint him since he's so excited about it, but letting all this boil under the surface isn't good for you. You need to take care of yourself too. You can't be all you can be as a wife and mother if you are feeling this way."

animuseternal,writing,1389812527.0,"I'm not a genre writer, so the process is likely different, since self-publishing is much more acceptable in that other universe. I submit to journals, normally 3-8 at a time per story (after, if it applies, waiting on my top-tier no-sim-sub journals). And then I wait.

As for editing ... I take it as far as I can by myself before I have anyone else look at it. I need it to be as close to what *I* want the story to be (or what the story tells me it needs to be) before I let other minds and perspectives in. If I do it too early, I find that other voices can steer the story into a different direction that isn't authentic to itself. So I have a few trusted readers, but I only let them see anything when I'm either really stuck or really proud (cause the pride needs to be beaten down).

EDIT: Also, rule of thumb: most journals only publish short work as-is, so it MUST be perfect when you submit. Editors might have some small edits here and there for it, but that's rare and, either way, it must be *done*. Even more rarely is coming across an editor that wants a rough story so badly that they're willing to work with you heavily for it. For every rough story with tremendous potential, there's another twenty stories in the submission queue that's ready to go as-is."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389812708.0,"Think about how your face looks if you're watching videos of cute puppies or talking with someone you like. You probably unconsciously smile slightly and have a bright look on your face. If you look in the mirror and smile, you'll probably notice that the shape of your eyes becomes a bit like upside-down crescents. It's a bit like squinting except more subtle. When you squint you usually use both your cheek muscles to push up and your eyebrow area muscles to push down. I think if you just use the cheek muscles, it creates a smiling effect. 

Another way is to widen your eyes ever so slightly. Think about the difference between if you are listening to a lecture versus if you are in an interesting conversation with someone. When you are engaged but still relaxed, your eyes give your face an ""open"" look, which basically means you look attentive but not alarmed. Whereas if you are bored you probably have a blank expression and if you are concentrating or uncomfortable you probably have tension in your face. So when someone takes your picture, think of it as if they said ""Hey, guess what?""  and you are about to hear them tell an exciting story. "

I was always a nerdy little kid into computers and technology, and I also have a bit of an artistic eye.  In high school I started being more serious about making websites, and in college I got a part-time job making various websites for the university departments.  I was using mostly Photoshop and Dreamweaver at this time.

After graduating, I put all of my previous work, including the university work and other freelance jobs in a portfolio, taught myself CSS and was featured in CSS Zen Garden, which then led to a job at a decent-sized design agency that had big clients like Bluetooth, Motorla, Carrier, etc. There I learned a lot more about coding backend stuff, different server side languages like PHP, ASP, .NET, Java, etc.  I also started working more in pure text editors along with Photoshop.  Then I got another job working for a non-profit, where I learned more about working with templating and content management systems. 

These days I dabble in a little bit here, a little bit there, all self-taught.  For personal stuff I do some digital art and painting with stylus, some vector and print things, and some digital photography with a mirrorless APS-C 50mm lens system.  I work with JQuery libraries and plugins, some frameworks like Bootstrap and some custom made ones, as well as WordPress, Drupal, SharePoint, MySQL databases, etc.  I work with UI / UX stuff as a normal part of developing and designing websites, both using my intuitive sense of what works well and researching common / best practices.

I didn't know about that subreddit that /u/francesmcgee mentioned, but was going to suggest checking out European bra suppliers: bravissimo.com and http://myintimacy.com/

The last link should also provide a bra fitting specialists in your area. 

The second thing I would recommend is to find exercises that will strengthen her core muscles. Not just crunches, but core muscles all around. Related to this (and perhaps to the anterior tilt mentioned), I have personally attributed Wing Chun (a martial art) to solving my back pain, as I haven't had any since I started practicing it. Most martial arts have some sort of core strength training.

At first I thought it was just the core strength exercises involved in a martial art, but now that I see /u/francesmcgee mention the pelvic tilt, Wing Chun would definitely help with this, as the proper stance requires tilting the pelvis in a way that tucks the tailbone in. 

So, I'd recommend:
* a properly fitted bra
* a well rounded routine of ab/oblique/lower back/etc exercises
* tucking the tailbone

I like to think of relationships in our lives as described by a tree. The roots are our families, the earth all of the foundation they laid out for us. Each branch is someone you've met who has influenced your life. Some branches split off into several branches--when a relationship opens doors to other relationships. Some stretch on and grow thick and strong with us over the years, producing buds and leaves and fruit and nurturing our own person. Some are stunted and stop being productive, some we must forcibly trim off and end. But each contributes to who you are.

Unless a particular branch stops helping you grow, or starts making it so that you can't grow around it, or begins infecting you or other branches, I don't see why you ought to cut it short."

This connects back to what I was saying before: we are so quick to try and separate ourselves from other people in ways that dehumanize them, regardless of whether or not the methods by which we do so are meaningful. I think that anybody who truly has such a problem with low average intelligence should support improving education for everyone, rather than lamenting the fact that other people aren't as smart as them.

Another such definitive battle, or what would constitute a battle, would be Operation Drumbeat. I have already gone into detail about it, but I will share the total losses of sinking by U-boats in American waters from December 1941-August 1942.

Total:
80 patrols by IX type boats, with 384 ships sunk, for 2,011,085 tons, with an average of 4.8 ships sunk and 25,138 tons per patrol.

104 VII patrols, with 225 ships sunk, for 1,111,371 tons, with an average of 2.2 ships sunk and 10,686 tons per patrol.

In total, that is 184 patrols for 609 ships sunk, a total of 3,122,456 tons, with an average of 3.3 ships sunk and 16,969 tons per patrol. 

Total losses for the Uboats were 10 IXs and 12 VIIs, for a total of 22 boats, and an exchange rate of 27.7 ships sunk per each U-boat lost."

Blacksheep01,movies,1389813025.0,"I fully agree with this, and most do judging by the upvotes you are receiving. 

I view Lucas in the following way. He had a great idea in developing the world of Star Wars, the background myths, the ""present"" universe, the general conflicts the characters in this world would face and the resolution to those conflicts etc. However, the problem has always been his precise implementation of those ideas. He is a great big idea guy, none of this would exist without him, obviously, but he is far from the best at writing dialogue nor are his decisions about exact story arcs all that great. 

You can definitely see all the hands ""restricting"" him in the original trilogy, those people gave his fantastic big ideas a better representation on screen, just like Solo's ""I know"" line from Kershner and Ford was better than the generic ""I love you too"" Lucas wrote.

I remember Lucas stating in extra materials that came with episode I that he now was free to do everything the way he wanted, no other hands in the dip, and then the poor quality of the new trilogy made sense. He had no more Kershner ""spoiling"" his terrible, generic lines, no more old British cinematographers telling him his exact shots were rubbish. And as a result, he put out a piece of junk that never underwent any serious critique and it clearly shows.

I'm at least glad to see arguments over Episode VII's script, means there are teams of people critiquing direction, dialogue and setting which often makes works better."

Scarcer,microgrowery,1389813107.0,"The cheapest way to grow a little plant (cause lets face it, people screw up on their first try,) is to set up a ~ 2x2x4' space. Get a timer, and a decent light (you honestly could even use a desk lamp to get some minimal growth), just turn it on for an hour or two and make sure the light/shroud doesn't get way too hot (don't want to start a fire).

Get some quality soil, a large pot to grow the plant in. Nutrients are tricky to learn as a beginner so I recommend starting with FlorNova and read the label. Once the plant is vegging nicely don't feed nutrients more than twice a week ( one water between each feeding. )

So, hang the light up over where the plant will be; even better if you can adjust it. When the plant is decent, and taken up half the available height, switch to 12v12 (unless you go auto flower). During flower the plant will likely double in height by the time you harvest.

* Light is light, the plant will grow.

* Better the light, the better the growth/harvest.

* Need to have absolutely ZERO light leakage into the grow area, especially during flower; it will screw up your plants cycle at night.

* I don't suggest modifying the plant your first time if you have no botanical experience, it may increase yield but it's important to understand the growth cycle and growth structure.

* If you insist, I suggest trying to learn how to top and train/scrog.

**These are just general points to keep in mind, it's your job to do the research and learn the details.**

If you already have the space available, you can easily get comfortably started for $60-100 with out having to scavenge for resources. Optimally for small growing spaces you should invest in a T5 array for a small sum more money; they take up little vertical room and work great. [Something like this](http://www.greenerhydroponics.com/Sun-Blaze-T5-HO-22--2-ft-2-Lamp_p_79157.html)

They travel in a larger arc (i.e. more of a straight line) by flying out to the side; if their 'desire' to travel on that arc (i.e. their momentum) is greater than their weight (plus some maths), they'll do that.

Tavarish,Games,1389813191.0,"If PhysX is anything else than HW driven physics engine that applies physics to objects and particles I'm very surprised. Especially when considering that **all** its effects can be calculated by CPU's [even if super shittily thanks to Nvidia] while scene itself is still drawn by GPU.

If PhysX was actually core graphics rendering API wouldn't it be *close to metal* and game running on it wouldn't require Dx9/10/11/11.1 from player? Just like Mantle will replace Dx fully in games that support it.

This to me says that PhysX functions on top of Dx9/10/11/11.1 as it adds gimmicky, pointless, particles to the scenes where Mantle replaces Dx fully for scene rendering purposes.

I think it's little bit silly if people try to downplay significance of Mantle and what affect it can have on PC gaming if it gets more and more popular among developers. It could lead into place where AMD users get 2-3x FPS of Nvidia users thanks to Mantle Vs. Dx.

Do you think Nvidia would kickback and watch it to happen? I don't think so, I think they would cook up exclusive API, Dx replacer, of theirs own. Especially when Nvidia is as likely to adopt Mantle as AMD is to adopt PhysX.

Initially I should have been more clearer, I think.

If Mantle does what it's hyped to do then it's not some gimmicky bullshit like PhysX and future will show how Nvidia reacts to it."

You can do this more easily by giving said population the exact same diet, but one with gluten removed. But to my knowledge it's never been done. So instead we get a large-scale placebo effect on people who completely change their entire lifestyle, some of which are in with people who have known scientifically valid reasons to be on that diet, and some of which do not.

I still harbor large amounts of hate and anger towards him.  If life ever presents me an opportunity to inconvenience this guys life even in the slightest, hands down I will take it.  Kudos to you ladies who can rise above the pettiness of it all, but I just haven't been able to get past it yet, even though I'm in a happy relationship now (with the roommate)."
mrellisredding,relationships,1389813291.0,"Dramatic.  I always wonder what this kind of person would be saying if they'd been in a relationship before social media.  Would he be upset that your not taking out ads in the paper professing your love to him?

It's your account and you can do what you want with it.  Personally, I agree with you.  I've been with my gf for four years and I can count the number of recent pictures (&lt;6mo) of us posted to social media on one hand."

bassistwanted,pics,1389813301.0,"&gt;Well I didn't comment on liability

The comment you responded to with 

&gt;Growing up in the country there is an unwritten rule. If you find a gate closed, leave it closed, if you find it open, leave it open. It's common sense and basic manners. 

Was this:

&gt;So they let her out and Dish still isn't liable.

So you in fact did comment directly about liability."

America isn't the only country out there, and every country has different views on body shape and beauty, i think people tend to forget that. "

Sir_Fancy_Pants,todayilearned,1389813319.0,"ok what wasn't said and is actually the fundamental driving force here, is that evolutionary we have been exposed as a gender to two very differing selection pressures based on our past roles, there are clear and evident physical changes between us, and this is mirrored through hormones and various objective modern day testing on certain characteristics, and traits based on gender (agressiveness pain tolerance, stress testing competencies etc).

It is simply ridiculous to think that having been forged and grown under two very different defined roles through all of our creation (i.e evolution) and having clear and very prominent physical trait differences that our minds are identical and behave in the same manner.

we do indeed have the same fundamental thought processes and cognitive capabilities, but if you think that millions of years of significant different roles in existence can be completely separated from our genetic legacy (wrt to mind) then i simply don't subscribe to your view.

men and women have different leanings towards different behaviours and skill sets, while they may indeed in each individual case be overridden by by environmental factors this still wont result in a 50:50 gender balance.

lets not forget for true equality etc women would have to be as criminally active as men. so in terms of murders, rapes, sexual assaults these would be committed by both genders at the same rate. else for every man incarcerated is one man less in the ""Job pool"" and one woman over saturating the split.

And it is absolutely logically bankrupt to think that its valid that  men have a behavioural leaning or commitment to criminal or deviant behaviour, but dismiss as not valid that they can have a behavioural leaning or commitment to excellence or advanced skills.

i dont see many women campaigning that prisons should be more 50:50 and that there should be more gender representation against murderers and rapists do you?

or is that when suddenly the argument breaks down?
