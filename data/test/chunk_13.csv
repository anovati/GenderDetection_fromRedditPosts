AgentDL,AskMen,1389027704.0,This question comes up on a weekly basis. 
tek1024,AskReddit,1389027706.0,"Mixing amphetamines or other ADD meds and antianxiety meds (xanax, klonopin, etc.) can turn you into a lunatic temporarily. Anyone I've seen who took higher doses of those together gets hyper and emotional, then either collapses with exhaustion or can't remember what the hell they were just talking about (or both). Rinse and repeat till your liver and kidneys can detox the body back to balance; meanwhile that person's friends are preoccupied trying to keep the person calm and attentive till they're back in control and not in danger of hurting themselves. Basically stresses your brain, heart, and other organs for nothing.

If you're prescribed these meds by a physician or psychiatrist, they have you on a dose that's right for you. These drugs used in recreational doses by people that have no reason to take them can really do harm.

My gut feeling is that he is in fact playing 'long game' as others have said.

Because that's what ladies' men do. Alternately you will be added to his group of ladies for a time.

I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

If you look at my examples, I wasn't talking about different languages within a given field of science.

&gt; I think you'll find that oceanographers are in fact very concerned with [ocean acidification].

Sure, and sometimes oceanographers worry about the absorption spectrum of water-bound hydrogen while analyzing remote sensing satelite data. But you're avoiding the primary thrust of my argument: oceanography constitutes a vast body of knowledge which, owing to the scale and composition of oceans, behaves in ways that an individual hydrogen molecules does not.

Quantum physicists (typically) don't understand oceanography. Oceanographers (typically) don't understand quantum physics. Don't you agree?

Of course you do. The differences in language between an oceanographer and a quantum physicist are not just convention. Both scientists describe behaviors which simply aren't relevant considerations in the other's field of study."

Unrequited love is a pain and I try to remain as unattached an as emotionally unavailable as long as possible. I'm also super jaded and dark so it goes against my image to be falling in love so goddamn easily.

I fear intimacy. I know it's a problem. But in a relationship, one person will always like the other person more (at least at first). I'd like to be the party that isn't as invested so if it goes belly up, I didn't leave my heart on the table.

0x_,mylittleandysonic1,1389028234.0,"&gt; IMAP and POP3, the majority of users rarely view the website or use the Webmail Client

So i assume your data costs revolve around attachments?

Can you reduce this without hurting your users, im just reminded of how reddit does so well with data, by only keeping thumbnails and everything else is off site. If you were text only i imagine you'd do better, whats your attachment size maximum? Can you encourage more use of offsite storage, you could publish a list of services for it...

&gt; Mass emailing Anypony Email users is a hell of a lot harder than saying ""just mass email everyone"" ahaha

Well i've never so much as ran an exchange server on a VM just to fiddle with it, so i have no idea, you probably use some linux equivalent to be lighter anyway. I just imagined it like you'd have an admin overview to be able to Ctrl+A everyone :P (i suppose any email client would break if you just added 3000 CC's tho)

&gt; Thank you very much for your post, you've given me plenty to think about.

A pleasure, i find this kind of thing very interesting.

&gt; The donations I have received so far will at least keep the main mail server on until the 9th of February.

Im really glad cos i looked at the site, saw the appeal thing, and dreaded it was all a bit late. You have a month to try and engage your userbase and find some agreeable way forwards now i guess.

&gt; The backups will go offline and the support server.. well.. 

You gotta do what you gotta do.

&gt; I might start renting that out to other people to make some income from it

I am confident of my diet, and have never felt apologetic. I have never had social issues due to that, and have even had people come to me and ask for dieting/cooking advice.

If you're fertile and ovulating, then it should only take one time. The next time the guy does it, it should be with a different female, so he can maybe make another baby. It's going to take him at least an hour to find another female, so it's better if you get bored and go away."
Spishal_K,explainlikeimfive,1389028243.0,"/u/bulksalty hit this on the head, but for an even simpler explanation for those that need it: Video game graphics are basically etch-a-sketch level compared to movies. They're just flat (or semi-flat) pictures pasted onto wireframes of varying complexity. Newer physics engines may move these wireframes around in more lifelike methods than the past but it's all still pretty simple.

Movies on the other hand are hand-edited models each several times more complex than any video game character. Lotso from Toy Story 3 had nearly 3.5 MILLION individual hairs on his body, each and every one being physics calculated for wind and motion 60+ times a second. Just imagine that. That's just the MOTION of one character. Now add in all the others plus color, lighting, and multiple camera angles. The sheer complexity of your average CGI movie is mind-boggling.

It also depends much stronger on the tactics the battle participians use than in any other system i've played before. A strong guy could for example try to grap his enemy - and throw him into lower orbit with his next action. If the baddy can't fly, teleport or something like that, the battle (or if he doesn't have any imunitys probably even his life...) is over for him.

Diguiseppimon,ADHD,1389028667.0,"I'm pretty sure my doc is just a psychiatrist. 

**To update anyone who previously commented on my question and/or cares**


Went to the doc on Saturday. Told her how my regular adderall (which I was only on because I didn't have insurance prior, so it was the cheapest option) was wearing off after an hour or two, and leaving me in that spacey feeling. My boyfriend was with me, so she asked him some questions about how I am on and off my meds, and which he liked better, and what kind of things he notices. I am known to have anxiety problems, I also have a family history of bi-polar, so I get very, VERY moody (I like to chalk it up to me being a Cancerian) at times. Stimulants are known to make your mood way more shitty. I told her I tend to get more upset when I get stressed out about things, which happens pretty easily. She put me back on Vyvanse 70mg (which she says is like the equivalent of 30mg of adderall), and also has me on Tenex(?) for my moods. Apparently there is a long acting form of Tenex/Intuniv that works really well for people with ADHD, that also have mood swings/anxiety, but there is something with the insurance companies that make you try the short-acting version first? I was on Tenex/Intuniv before, and it DID help, however, it made me REALLY sleepy, and gave me these weird tingly feelings in my arm that made is hard to sleep, so I had to stop because of my work at the time. I also liked the Vyvanse from what I remembered, but it was starting to cause these weird breathing problems where I had to yawn every few seconds to get enough air in my lungs, and was also giving me tingly feelings like my limbs were falling asleep constantly. She chalked that up to anxiety, and we are going to try again. 


Today is my first day back on Vyvanse in almost a year. It has not had the immediate effect where something 'clicks' in your brain and you know it is working like Adderall does. I feel really spacey and kinda woozey today, but that could also be because I am sick. Last night, my arm started the tell-tale hurting after taking the Tenex, but luckily I took it early enough in the day that it wore off after a few hours. I will probably make my own thread here in a bit, didn't mean to hijack yours OP. 


My doc also said that because she worries about my moods and such, that she thinks that we should give the Vyvanse a try for a few months, and if that is not giving desired results, then she would really like to try Stratera I think? It was either that or Concerta, I forget which. 



But to answer your question /u/overmindthousand : stimulants are hit or miss, usually when you take one thing for ADHD, you will end up taking something else to combat whatever else you have. If you really do have adult ADHD especially, it is something that you are going to have for life. You might grow out of it enough to learn to control it without medicine, but that takes a lot of trial and error. Only your doc can really give you advice. Definitely be open and tell him/her anything you have concerns with and what you would/would not like to try. Communication is key with all of this, as results really do vary from person to person. If there are any side effects you dont like, or things just dont feel 'right', make sure you let them know. "

It is a bit old now (first written in the early 90s, updated about 12 years ago), and the Andes have been a hotbed of research in the last decade so that book is a bit out of date, but it is still a good introduction and overview. It is a textbook so it might be a bit jargony or won't explain a few concepts that students of anthropology would be familiar with, but I've always found it to be accessible to pretty much anyone.

I can't think of any other good overview book, though there are a few more fairly accessible books that deal with specific societies or periods. There probably are some books written for a popular audience, but I haven't read or looked into them. 

If you find something, I'd just say to be careful; the Andes are one place where pseudo-science authors and people who just don't get it love to focus on, so there could be a lot of misinformation out there. Feel free to send me the link to anything that you do find and I can try to evaluate it."

littlep2000,explainlikeimfive,1389028802.0,"Assuming your payment is the same every month. The simple answer is compounding interest. Loans are nearly always calculated on a daily schedule, so as the principal (unpaid amount) is large at the beginning, that interest accrues quickly, and adds to itself (compounding interest) on a daily basis, diminishing the amount of principal that is covered. A good way to combat this is put your loan on a weekly or biweekly payment schedule, that way you pay down the accruing interest more often rather than letting that first day of accrued interest be compounded for the remaining ~30 days of the month. 

The more complicated reasons. Financial law, banks can be allowed to collect even more at the beginning of a loan to cover their potential losses. Origination fees (think administration) can be rolled into the opening payments, as well as mortgage insurance, depending on the buyer, this is the banks way of protecting themselves further from default.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389028807.0,"Can't tell if serious question, but the representatives of the government are, to a degree, chosen by the people to act on our behalf. The system isn't perfect because we've fallen into the pattern of only having 2 viable candidates, but we can still choose people to represent us. They are elected to make important decisions on our behalf because they're generally more educated/qualified, and because the average person doesn't have time for the day in, day out routine of politics. 

Beyond that, I'm gonna ask you to get beyond these silly notions you have that seem to be leading our debate. Go back to my wall of text post. We need government to improve our lives. That's the purpose of government, to preserve and improve our lives with rules and regulations, and in more modern times, wealth redistribution in some cases. It's part of the social contract, which doesnt hold up AS well nowadays since you can't leave because there's government anyway, but hey, you should probably recognize your ""free market"" is very much the same way....leave one company most of the time you end up having to work for another. 

No offense, but libertarianism is he philosophy of angsty teens that are like, cramped out, man, at all these rules, man, and no one should tell me what to do, man. Even though those rules are normally (not always admittedly, but normally) in place for our own good. Sure, you can argue it screws up, and sometimes rules aren't put in place in good faith (was watching MSNBC talking about obstructive abortion laws, for example), but this isn't a reason to be against government, but against certain politicians and what they want to do with government. Quite frankly, I'd like to move this discussion away from these abstract philosophical notions against power because it seems to be a red herring....it's completely unrealistic to have a society in which everyone can just do whatever they want all the time. At the very least, you'd need government to enforce your ""rights"", and that would still involve ""force"" or ""men with guns."" 

Liberarians don't seem to realize that we live in a society where our choices affect one another, that we need rules to govern our lives to a degree, and that there will ALWAYS be some ""men with guns"" somewhere. Our system was designed specifically to dilute this power and make it impossible for one person to rule over us. We have separation of powers, and worst case scenario, we are given a right to our own guns. It's not perfect, but hey, it's a lot better than the alternatives. In other countries, governments are given more power, sometimes absolute power, and this leads to more men with guns oppressing people. In some cases, businesses might be the men with guns, and this will happen a lot without government....mob rule and businesses with guns...businesses becoming government. The difference with our system is power is a bit more diluted, and we elect people to represent us. It's not a perfect system in practice, admittedly, but honestly, it's highly favorable to any alternative, including this ""let's get rid of the state and all sing kumbaya and engage in free market capitalism"" crap libertarians seem obsessed with.

Once again, the big advantage of our government is power is diluted among different people, so no one person can impose his or her will. That and it's supposedly representative. To get rid of this, I think, would produce very negative consequences. There's no guarantee what would replace it would be better,a nd quite frankly, I think it would be much worse."

Prisons as they are now should be abolished altogether, they are a black hole of money and potentially productive citizens. America puts her inmates to work in order to compete with cheap labour, but better is the Norweigian model, centered on rehabilitation and trust. The sooner you reintegrate people into society, the sooner they can become productive again and stop costing the state money. There's nothing to stop them working to support themselves sustainably during the rehabilitation to keep costs down. Our arcane justice system, based on revenge and retribution, is a shame on us.

Tax evasion must be tackled more imaginatively. It is impossible to close every loophole without also introducing prohibitive restrictions. It must be mutually beneficial for companies to pay tax, with incentives that also benefit the long term national interest.

I believe in independent journalism, i believe you can't silence the internet(not yet at least) and even if you do, someone, somewhere will comment and others will read, to close the floodgates you need a global wide censorship policy and even the most paranoid conspirations can't see that happening anytime soon. 

I believe in small sites that know their audience and gather news from those independents, i believe in opinions rather than news(which basically are either PR or propaganda), i believe in the voice of the many helping individuals to form unique subjective opinions, this process is basically compatible with our primitive way of exchanging information within a tribe, over time if given enough time reason prevails. 

And when traditional media will be less than a joke with ads for impotence pills, the internet and its audience will step up and lead us into a new world of decentralized information,  millions of tribes, with just as many opinions and one identity, one purpose, one will. 

Sounds weird, right, but think about how much accelerated progress the world realised in the last 10-15 years, not only in one country, but tens of countries experienced reform because people knew that they live under different standards and this became unacceptable.

The burden of evidence is always on the prosecution to prove that the defendant has broken a law. You're taking issue with the law, not how it's being prosecuted.

The moral argument is that a teacher is an authority figure almost akin to a parent. There's a huge difference in power and authority between a teacher and student. This makes it impossible for there to be true mutual consent. The student always has it in the back of their mind that it's a teacher, so there would be consequences if they did something wrong, or that it's ok because it's a teacher asking them to do it. It's also why most universities have similar rules against faculty having relationships with students, even though the students are of age.

I also tend to find myself biking more living closer to town. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a solid 7 miles from downtown, but it's still only a 35 minute commute for me and is often faster than driving during peak times.

Now here is where it gets fun. If you have other devices from the case, parse out an entire word list of everything on there. Pagefile.sys and Hiberfile.sys as well.  Get it all into a dump. Throw it at the brute-force. This at least increases your odds by about .00000000000000000001% chance. But remember, humans are lazy. We like to use the same password for the same things because it is easy to remember. Even if he used special characters on it, if you get the word right the software should throw every rendition of the word regardless. 

Now if you do not have anything else from the case, you can do a Wikipedia dump (they have it available on the website, its about 100GB) or if you know what type of movies or music they like, go online and get everything and make your word list.

einTier,IWantToLearn,1389029731.0,"The biggest thing that improved my sleep is making the bedroom solely a place for sleeping.  That means if you have a television in there, get it out.  The bedroom is not for watching television.  Same with the radio and anything else that is a distraction from the primary purpose -- sleeping.  You are no longer allowed to listen to the radio or watch television while you lie in bed waiting to go to sleep.  If you keep bringing your laptop to bed and reading reddit until 3 or 4 am, you are no longer allowed that luxury either.  

It will take some time, but what you are doing is training your brain that when you get into bed you are preparing to go to sleep.  Once your brain correlates sleep with your bed, you will get sleepy almost as soon as you lie down even if you weren't really sleepy to begin with.  It freaks me out that today I can't even read a few pages in bed without falling asleep when just a few years ago I'd be up all night even if I was lying in the dark doing nothing.  I go to bed now when I need to go to bed, not when I'm tired, and sleep well the entire night.  All this is due to this one simple change: the bedroom is for sleeping.  

You can do a few other easy changes if you're still having problems.  Humans seem to sleep better in a cold dark room than anywhere else.  So, lower the temperature in the house by a few degrees just before bed and make sure that the room is dark and stays dark.

Plus, it's not really that hard to make a guess at what some people make based on their profession, so it's not like I'm really surprised.  It kind of blows my mind that a store clerk making minimum wage would feel uncomfortable when they found out their doctor friend is making six figures.  Could they not have taken a shot in the dark before and realized their wages aren't really comparable?  

Plus, it depends on your friends/family, etc.  My friends and I have all different kinds of salary levels, and it really doesn't change much at all.  The only difference is that someone who makes more is probably more willing to say ""I got this"" when we're buying beers or something, but to us, it's not even flaunting.  No one cares.

I let my prescription lapse because 1) the condition they were prescribed for is mild and 2) I didn't like the idea of a medication where you weren't supposed to just stop taking it suddenly and 3) while they really reduce the physical effects of nervousness, they also kind of made me feel mildly 'blunt' for lack of a better term.

That said, I think they're a valid approach to dealing with performance anxiety, particularly with someone in your position (suffers from anxiety, performance in the short term, outcome is important), simply because, speaking as someone who has been trying mental approaches to overcome performance anxiety, it simply takes a long time to break or dampen the negative conditioning loop."

turtlehana,DebateAnAtheist,1389029809.0,"Theists have faith. They'd rather put a Deity/Deities in place of the unknown. 

I do not have faith. I'm perfectly fine with not having all the answers. 

I'm not saying to myself that there being no Deity/Deities is one probability so I'm going with that one (being atheism). I'm not giving it that much weight. 

Theists are saying that a Deity/Deities is the only possibility and are putting faith in one of those out of all the existing religions. 

I made my decision after Sunday School, Youth Group, Going to a Christian College, studying religion, studying mythology, and marrying a Christian (who later after trying to find answers for me became an atheist). I just didn't choose to be an atheist. I didn't just say this is one possibility so I'm going with it. 

I realized that we no longer believe in Greek Gods, Egyptian Gods, Mayan Gods, etc and that there are lots of religions with the same outline. A Theist chooses one of these but have no way of knowing if the one they choose is correct, it is a gamble, it is faith. 

Deists and Agnostic dismiss religion but still think that their is a probability. They are not putting faith in anything, they aren't dismissing anything except religious doctrine, they simply do not need the answer or feel that the answer affects them. 

I simply do not believe any God(s) ever existed. That we, in the past, put a God(s) in place of the unknown and I'm comfortable not knowing what we don't have answers for yet. I don't need to make up a reason for something just because myself and science cannot explain it yet. I'm a Gnostic atheist... I am personally 100% certain. I'm not putting any faith in it or money on it because the answer does not matter.

I don't put faith in people. I know and evaluate a person. I know what they are capable of or not and I learn from trial and error. I count on them and if they are not accountable they are not given trust. Once they earn trust they earn respect. I don't need faith.

wannaridebikes,blackladies,1389029823.0,"&gt;If graduated, then there's usually demand for English teachers (in non-English speaking countries of course). I know there's plenty of black ladies that have gone anywhere ranging from Argentina to Japan (JET programme especially) through that route. Teaching experience isn't generally required, but a bachelor's degree is (but the subject field can be anything).

Eh, I would really second-guess this option. For one, by doing this, you are participating in the imperialist colonist system of western English speaking privilege. It's fucked up that English takes dominance in the world, and by helping people get ahead economically, you are enforcing a socially oppressive system.

Also, it's a reflection of that privilege in and of itself that the standards are ridiculously low. If I had a kid as an American, I would want my child's teacher to have a background in education and child development, or the very least in the subject that they are feigning to teach, not just any bachelor's degree.

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389029856.0,"I definitely wouldn't call it proto-communist. We tend to say that the Andes did not have a market-based economy and that is based on what we do know of the Inca, but the Inca conquered a very diverse landscape, and we can't extend Inca models much into the past (though everyone has), so it's entirely possible that there was some market-based economy prior. But it was not strongly market-based and the state or priestly class or someone probably always controlled a good portion of the economy. I can't imagine that there wasn't some individual and non-state driven trade, but I can't really prove that yet. At least not in my own region.

I'll also freely admit that I forget a lot of the specifics about the Inca models, so I'm not super strong on just how the *allyu* system worked.

It's also not proto-communist in that it isn't about ensuring that everyone stays at a relatively equal economic level. It is still very much top-down and hierarchical, but the state is harnessing people to do its work, and pays them in food and corn beer (*chicha*). But then people are free to do their own thing in their own time. The state extracts a labour tax, rather than a monetary tax. And the state also owns fields and part of the labour tax is spent working the state's fields, so it gains wealth that way.

And there's also reciprocity that is not state driven, where a family needs help doing something--say working their fields or re-roofing their house--and they rely on the aid of the community to help them do that. They are expected to feed and provide *chicha* for the people helping them, and they are expected to help those people when they need help. If you don't, then the next time you need help, you won't have any. So the economy is also community-driven, but still not a market; labour isn't bought and sold, it is traded. And that is really the key of the Andean reciprocity system.

I'm probably not explaining this very well. My go-to book is Michael Moseley's *The Incas and their ancestors,* and he does speak a fair bit about the Inca economic system, at least, and about reciprocity. And his perspective is for the Andes as a region. You could assign that chapter. I might come across some other works on Andean economy as I get further into the next two chapters of my dissertation and can send those along if you like."

Alternatively, buff up Shields and Sprint to be a lightning fast ninja, with Power Range mods to extend Bladestorm and Shuriken reach. 

I haven't played Ash for very long, but those are some ways I'd build him."

sockalicious,personalfinance,1389029908.0,"Here are some other tips I've learned about dealing with car dealers:

1)  Be a well-dressed affluent-looking white man.  If you cannot, then have a friend who looks as close as possible to that way, bring him with you, and have him do all the negotiating.  This is unfortunate but it is a fact of life.

2)  Be unfailingly cheerful and delightful in your interactions with the dealers.  They are human beings and often times they are full of insecurities and fear - if you're worried on the transaction, they're ten times as worried because they face incredible pressure not to ""blow it.""  If you can put them at ease, they can focus on closing, and that'll free their mind up to negotiate reasonably.

3)  Dealers unfailingly like to make the car buying process into a marathon.  Make sure you are well fed, well rested, and not upset when you visit the dealership, and always go in the morning.  If the negotiation drags out, make clear that if they can't get it done before the sun starts to set, they've lost the deal.

4)  Never, never buy a car in the dark.  Walk out of the dealership at 3PM.  The car will still be there tomorrow.

5)  If you want to buy a new car from a dealer, strongly consider certified pre-owned instead.  The service warranty is generally longer and the car price is generally much lower.  See if you can figure out an unpopular model and then wait to find one that pops up.  Try not to buy a car that was driven more than 10,000 miles per year after it was purchased; those will generally be in better shape for their price and age.  (If you consider that there are 200 driving days a year, a 15,000 mile per year car was driven 75 miles a day!)  2 and 3 year old vehicles often have just come off lease and can be in excellent shape.

6)  Most people should have their financing arranged before walking into the dealership.  If you want to kill an hour, sure, fill out their credit application and see if the dealer can do better than what you've already locked in; often they can.

7)  If you have time, do 5-8 test drives - different cars, different days, different makes, different dealers - and keep a little log or journal of your experiences, write down everything you liked and hated.  Last time I bought a car I did this and it made the eventual buying decision much easier, both for the car and the dealership I selected."

dunnoyabassa,relationship_advice,1389029926.0,"while you may not be seeking out married women, YOU are the common thread between these instances, which means you either offer up something uniquely to married women, or what you offer up is uniquely desirable to married women.

i know nothing about you beyond the details you have provided in this thread, so it's very difficult to know the specifics of what's going on.  as stated elsewhere, it's possible you could only be comfortable revealing your most attractive features when the pressure to be datable is off the table.

HOWEVER, your theme of ""hot young married women who like fifty shades of grey"" leads me to believe there is something about you that appeals to a more specific kind of woman.

By the sounds of it the women you attract are the type to commit before they are ready.  They were hungry for a ring, or for some kind of self-assurance that they were marriage-quality gals and ended up with permanent life partners at fairly early ages.  Then, still young and attractive, they discover they have a husband for life while all the other good-looking ladies under 35 are busy living the glorified sexy independent single-life.  So off they go to the bar on girls night out comparing themselves to their friends with high self-esteem, feeling trapped and tied down by a decision they made at a bad time for bad reasons.  Their high school sweethearts, or whoever they married probably aren't very good in bed yet, maybe because the two of them aren't very emotionally connected, maybe because they are still young and generally inexperienced, maybe because they only just started sleeping together what with the rules of humping and bible-thumping.

The point is women who know what they want out of life and who know how to go about getting it don't tend to end up in young unhappy marriages dreaming of some other guy coming to bang them all night or play out their romance novel fantasies.  To me, it sounds like you attract the following ""type"" of woman if you want to say such things exist:  you attract the pretty girl with low self-esteem.  now certainly there are plenty of pretty girls with low self-esteem who don't act the same ways, but for the sake of your question it's fair to observe a pattern in their behavior.  the problem for you is that certain pretty girls with low self-esteem act differently when single than they do when in serious relationships.

the women you seem to attract, when single, are the type of women who like douchebags.  they know they are a certain level of better looking (even if they still think they are ""ugly and fat""), but they believe their human worth to be inordinately tied to their beauty.  thus, they are drawn to men who seem the most superficial; the logic being: this good-looking asshole who doesn't take no for an answer can (and does) get any girl he wants, but he wants me, and that makes me feel extremely special!  when the guy who has treated her well for months wants to sleep with her, it feels obvious and she feels entitled to his advances, which makes her feel ordinary.  when the guy who is probably a date-rapist, who won't talk to her all week, who hides half his facebook from her wants to sleep with her, she feels unexpectedly attractive, and feels that she must be all the more desirable.

when in serious committed relationships, this kind of woman's worldview has shifted.  her worth as a person has been established as valid by her husband, so she is significantly more confident in herself.  now, she understands that she doesn't have to put up with douchey behavior to feel attractive.  self-assured, she goes out into the world wondering what kind of guy she could have snagged if only she had had this confidence when she were single.  thus she finds you: likely some idealized form of good-looking nice guy she might actually like sleeping with more than they guy she married.  

the thing about women like this is that they operate in fantasy mode based on inexperience.  their fears and anxieties about themselves and their inadequacies has prevented them from gaining a great deal of real world perspective.  not having lived out a great deal of experiences personally, they fantasize about nonexistent ideals of perfection, and suffer consistent disappointment at reality's inability to live up to their unrealistic expectations.  they operate in the mindset that if some magical guy were just a little bit better he'd finally complete her.  they imagine that there is a guy just a little bit nicer, smarter, better looking, more educated, more interesting, better at sex who will finally arrive to fix all their problems.  they imagine some unrealistically happy life that all their friends are busy having, and believe something lesser is evidence of some kind of shortcoming.

the reality that these women ignore is that the perfect man does not exist, nor does the perfect life.  this being the case, they are left with their fantasies about who you are (inevitably you will not be the perfect mate for anyone) and fantasies about what the two of you could have/be (inevitably your life together would have many imperfections).

which is where you come in.  again, i know nothing about you.  but if you did a little soul-searching do you think you could find anything about yourself that makes you a likely target for others' unrealistic hopes and dreams?  is it possible that you yourself have the same unrealistic idealist outlook that with enough kindness, beauty, and easy circumstance everything in life could be endlessly and permanently successful?  is it possible that you look at the world as a constant obstacle to your potentially perfect future, instead of a morally neutral set of circumstances you have the power to affect?  do you rarely consider the ways your own attitude about life determines what happens to you?  are you convinced you are something of the ideal partner?  are you prone to display yourself as the nice guy who will fix everything?"

True, but stealth isn't entirely reliant on radar cross-sections. Modern fighters use special coatings that absorb radio waves as well as angled surfaces that dissipate them. A drone coated in such a material with a specific geometry - and mind you, this would rather be a secret drone, giving the military motive to deny its existence - wouldn't show up on most military and civilian bandwidths."

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389030789.0,"I would say that the premise is flawed, yeah. We still aren't really sure why agriculture began, and there are several competing hypotheses. For a long time it was thought that population pressure meant that people had to figured out how to increase their food output, but we now find that agriculture usually began before populations exploded. And the idea that agriculture began in places of abundance is also flawed because, well, that's just not where agriculture began, and that is based on a very modern capitalistic idea of picking the ideal location and innovating from there.

When we look around the world, we see that agriculture usually began in marginal environments: coastal Andes (very dry desert, limited waterflow from the mountains), highland Mexico (semi-arid), Mesopotamia, northern Africa, the Indus Valley (all deserts). There are some places that are more favourable to agriculture, like the U.S. Southeast, where agriculture first developed, but generally speaking agriculture began in marginal places.

There are a few explanations for this, and none is really confirmed, but they are all based on the idea of necessity. People didn't sit around and think ""I wonder how I can increase my food yield,"" they simply had to, and over the course of a few millennia played around with local foods until eventually some of these became domesticated and true agriculture began; it wasn't a conscious effort, but rather a gradual development. And they were probably driven to experiment and develop agriculture *because* they were in marginal environments and were probably stuck there because people also lived in the places surrounding those environments, so they couldn't just go somewhere else to find food. That's the hypothesis I like, but there's a lot of debate about the different hypotheses."

Serae,Pathfinder_RPG,1389030799.0,"As a player and occasional DM I recognize that sometimes we play characters that are not like ourselves.  Sometimes we cannot help but react in ways that we, as players, would react even if it is not an honest representation of our character.  Sometimes we break character and may not really realize it.  

When moments like this occur I think it is great to start a discussion about the character reaction and their alignment.  I would mention to a player that their action could tip the card tower to another alignment and then talk about their current alignment and what that action means for it.  I think it keeps them accountable for the character they have created.  I have personally taken an alignment shift because I wanted to do the action and didn't mind a change in character play.

As for your player...I would have warned them before the action and given them a chance to rethink it.  If they did the action anyways I would consider whether it is a small shift or a large one.  Murder is...a large one.  As you don't mention this being a quest, the demise of this individual suiting any purpose, or even a personal vendetta...this was just murder for the sake of murder.

By working through these symbols we help ourselves see new sides to a situation. In this way, through my own experience, it definitely ""works"".

There's a phrase that needs to be on the forefront of more peoples' minds: Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

&gt; If you develop a parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy, and you do not have immunity, there is a one-in-three chance that you will pass the infection onto your unborn baby.
&gt; 
&gt; There is then a risk that your baby will develop severe anaemia. This can cause heart failure and an abnormal collection of fluid inside the baby’s tissues of your baby (hydrops fetalis) which can sometimes result in a miscarriage.
&gt; 
&gt; Due to this risk, it is likely that you will be given regular ultrasound scans so that the health of your baby can be carefully assessed. If your baby does show signs of severe anaemia, they may be treated with a blood transfusion.
&gt; 
&gt; The risk of miscarriage is highest in the first 20 weeks of your pregnancy, at around 1 in 10, but then drops sharply as the pregnancy progresses. "

jigsaw_this,xxfitness,1389030897.0,"I'm hoping I can get some guidance for this...

Stats: 5'4/125 lbs

Exercise: (heavy) weight training M-F for about 40 minutes (alternating leg/glutes and arm/back days) during my lunch break, and I do additional cardio (running) after work for an hour-ish. During my evening workouts AND on weekend mornings, I do some extra body weight (or light weight) exercises such as squats, bent row machine, etc in addition to cardio. 

Because of my frequency of attending the gym, I sometimes skip a weekend session or evening session, or just simply take it easy at the gym for a day or two during the week.

Current eating habits: I kind of skip breakfast and lunch during most days.

I think the TDEE calculator recommends that I eat over 2000 calories but I just don't know how I would fit that in. I'm very low maintenance: Peanut butter sandwiches, cold leftovers, heating up homemade soup, etc. I take protein after my lunch time workout (120 calories) but other than that, I have no idea how to eat 2000 calories. 

Questions:

1. How important is it to eat the recommended amount of calories? I guess I already know it's ""very important"", but can someone explain what effects this has on my body?

2. Any suggestions on what I can eat to achieve my recommended amount? Something convenient, quick, disposable wrapper (I don't want to carry Tupperware with me to work since I commute by bus 70+ minutes).

3. How do ""cheat days/weekends/weeks"" affect your progress? Do they severely impair me?

4. Is there a huge difference between eating your calories throughout the day, and eating them (or the majority of them) all at once?"

Cygnus_X,Libertarian,1389030921.0,"&gt; Obviously, it can't be inflated, but once that confidence starts to flounder you'll see it collapse.

I could say the same of the US dollar or Euro.  If confidence in those currencies collapses, like it did in Cyprus, you could see a collapse of fiat.  Though I don't personally see this happening.

&gt;The concept itself can be duplicated rather easily. Infrastructure is the key. You can bet that there will be companies, individuals, etc. that will create their own digital currencies.

There are hundreds of fiat currencies in circulation, each with various exchange rates against the USD.  Even if a dozen digital currencies 'take off', it will still be a fraction of the total fiat's in circulation.  Consider, the USD, the Euro, the Chinese Yaun, the Japanesse Yin, the India Rupee, the Russian Ruble, the Iraqi Dinar, the British Pound, the Egyptian Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Brazil Real, the Canadian dollar and that is just to name a few.  We don't blink an eye at the thought of multiple fiat currencies and then go crazy over the idea of a digital crypto competitor.  

&gt;You want $10,000 per coin? That is literally insane.

Is it?  That would bring the market cap of Bitcoin to $100B.  This would still be smaller than facebook and 1/5th the size of apple.  It would be 1/50th the market cap of Gold.  By comparison, the market cap of Twitter is ~$37 Billion, and it currently has negative earnings.  For me, Twitter's current price is more insane than BTC being at $10,000.  Also, there are currently [70](http://www.corporateinformation.com/Top-100.aspx?topcase=b) companies in the world with a market cap greater than $100B, but you don't see this being in the realm of possibility for a currency that has numerous advantageous in the way of security and mobility over all the world's fiat?  What about a $10B market cap?  Is this possible?  Because today, that's where we're at.

&gt;With what I just said, a cheaper digital currency that competes with bitcoin will attract more and more investors

Does cheaper stock attract more investors?  Bitcoin's value is in the perception and acceptance.  Right now, it has a lot of momentum, even over dogecoin.

&gt;The bigger problem is regulation.

Very true.  Governments could regulate Bitcoin to extinction.    But for my world view, there exists a prisoner's dilemma in which at least one major government will welcome Bitcoin with open arms.  For me, this provides a bit of a safety net in terms of adoption.

T3chnopsycho,AskScienceFiction,1389030923.0,"I'd support this. The Force IMO is only limited by the user which has to have the necessary training as well as predisposition to access and use a certain amount of the Force's potential (e.g. it has been stated that Anakin is very strong in the Force; Somewhat I'd call it a natural talent).

The now if you go from this point of view and look at all the feats that have been accomplished by using the Force as well as taking into account Obi Wan's description of the Force (an all surrounding and connecting .... (don't know the exact quote))  you can conclude that it is indeed limitless.

Now maybe some feats:

* Omniscience: As it connects every living being it would essentially have access to all knowledge which exists or at some point has existed.
Also it will probably have knowledge over all future events as we know some Force-users can see into the future meaning that knowledge is there. 
* Omnipresence: It is all surrounding. --&gt;everywhere. Period.
* Omnipotence: I think this one could be argued with. But again as it connects every living being we could conclude that you could do what you want given you have full access to the Force. 
We've already seen a lot of incredible feats which Force users have accomplished. Now they were always limited by their humanity and fixed connection to the Force. 
Maybe one example are the first hyperdrives. They used the force to rip a hole into the universe to enter hyperspace. 

In the end I would just say it is always limited by the user. If the force could manifest itself as a sort of force being it would be literally unstoppable (except if you fill every inch of the galaxy with [Ysalamiri](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ysalamari).

To OP's other question. Yes it is possible to use both light and dark side techniques. Although this is limited as it is a very thin line you are walking on."

TheDukesMistress,relationship_advice,1389030945.0,"Let her go, sweetie.

Just over a year ago I broke up with my then-boyfriend of 3 years. We lived together at the time as well, and had previously been engaged. 

We officially split up on the 20th of December, 2012. I moved out, and in with my brother and his wife/kids by Christmas. I had created an online dating profile by New Year's. I know it was hard on him, but it was what I needed. I needed to reassure myself that we had made the right decision. He and I were not meant to be, and if I stayed home and wept about it, I wouldn't begin to heal.

So I dated. I dated a stoner skater boy. I dated a 10-years-older-than-me smoker (on my absolutely no list). I went to gay bars and got black out drunk with my single friends. I did a lot of the things I couldn't do when I had a serious boyfriend.

And then, I went on a date that changed my life. I met a guy that was unlike anyone I'd ever met. We've been together since March and these last 10 months have been more fun than anything I have ever experienced. 

Will it last forever? I don't know. But I can absolutely tell you that he AND I are both much, much, much happier apart.

My ex was a good man. He was kind, and caring and sweet. And he will, someday, make a very lucky woman very happy. That woman just isn't me.

If she doesn't want to be with you, sweetheart, you need to realize that you deserve better. 

She may be a wonderful girl, but you deserve to be with someone who WANTS to share your bed. Someone who WANTS to come home to you. Someone who wants to spend their life with you.

In grad school, while dating my future hubby, I made out a couple if times publicly with my roomie. It was in a bar and we were with guy friends and just felt like having a little fun to get a rise out of the guys. Funniest part, the guys realized what we were doing and played it very calm and cool. When we went to the bathroom, some guys at the next table asked my SO, how they hooked up with girls like us.

For ME? Yes, it's absolutely 100% essential. I've dated guys who didn't kiss the way I liked to, and was with a guy for 4 years who didn't enjoy kissing at all... After that last experience I am never again settling for a guy who I don't LOVE kissing. Kissing is literally one of my favorite pastimes ever. I enjoy kissing my current boyfriend more than I have ever enjoyed any previous partners ever. It's absolutely amazing. I've finally recaptured that world-disappears-for-a-while feeling that I used to only get as a frustrated virgin new to kissing.

Also, I feel it's important to add that good kissing has less to do some abstract concept of ""skill"" and more to do with compatibility. Everyone has a different concept of what the ideal kiss should feel like. Like, I have a ""FWB""/secondary partner who also loves kissing as much as I do, and I *enjoy* kissing him, but he likes to use his tongue more than his lips, and I enjoy a more even 50/50 (or even 40/60) tongue to lips ratio. So, while I like kissing him, he's not my ideal, you know? This has nothing to do with whether or not he's ""good"" at kissing (in fact, one of my friends who has also slept with him agrees that he's very *skilled* at kissing), it's about our style compatibility."

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

WraithPDX,worldnews,1389031036.0,"2005 Resolution Conclusion
&gt; STRONGLY URGES the Government of Japan to withdraw its JARPA II proposal or to revise it so that any information needed to meet the stated objectives of the proposal is obtained using non-lethal means.

2007 Resolution Conclusion
&gt; CALLS UPON the Government of Japan to address the 31 recommendations listed in Appendix 4 of Annex O of the Scientific Committee report relating to the December 2006 review of the JARPA I programme to the satisfaction of the Scientific Committee; FURTHER CALLS UPON the Government of Japan to suspend indefinitely the lethal aspects of JARPA II conducted within the **Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.**

This brings up a problem. Under the [International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling](http://iwc.int/cache/downloads/1r2jdhu5xtuswws0ocw04wgcw/convention.pdf), it has been argued that Article V of the convention states that the very nature of this sanctuary is illegal, citing:

&gt;These amendments of the Schedule (a) shall be such as 
are necessary to carry out the objectives and purposes of 
this Convention and to provide for the conservation, 
development, and optimum utilization of the whale 
resources; (b) **shall be based on scientific findings**; (c) 
shall not involve restrictions on the number or 
nationality of factory ships or land stations, nor allocate 
specific quotas to any factory ship or land station or to 
any group of factory ships or land stations; and (d) **shall 
take into consideration the interests of the consumers of 
whale products and the whaling industry.**

Dude is very versatile for a FB. Also, losing those two DTs will leave our D line wide open for any newcomers to stake their claim.

4) Larger variety of items. I'd like to see stats that you'd never normally see mashed together before for a supremely diverse selection. Defense and attack speed, move speed and mp5, I dunno. Mix it up a little, throw some unique passives on all and you're golden

5) MOTD modes that are more than just 'here, play these gods with this cash'. Change it up a little: modify the gravity, add environmental hazards, change cooldowns on abilities, capture the flag/bombing run mechanics, cat &amp; mouse or something,  change the way the minions behave or the minimap vision works or reverse the left and right controls, have some FUN with them!"

So there are a *lot* of reasons on why this can happen. The bigger the website, the more complicated it is, and thus the more ways it can fail. 

The most common is an application bug. Just as when windows closes a program on your computer, a similar thing can happen on the software hosting a website. This is usually fixed by restarting the webservice -- or if it's particularly nasty, the whole server. It also tends to only last for 10 or 15 minutes -- unless the website isn't paying someone like me in which cases it lasts until someone notices it.

Another common problem is bad hardware, but this is largely going to be a thing of the past as VPS (aka: cloud servers) allow you to move the whole ""system"" to another hardware server.

Now, you said a very specific error: ""website cannot be found"". That error *usually* means that they forgot to renew their domain registration. You see, in order to get a SOMETHING.com or SOMETHING.org, you have to register it. You have to pay for that registration for at least a year or more. Sometimes, companies forget and it expires. When it expires, that domain is removed from the internet. Thus, ""Website cannot be found"". 

(Note: website cannot be found can also mean that their DNS server has failed -- this is much less common though)"

""Play"" with speculative stocks in a taxable account; the first $3000 of losses every year is tax-deductible, which means it shelters the first $3000 of short-term capital gains (should you choose to take any.)  The deduction lasts for 3 years.

What in heaven's name are you doing spending $6K a month on your CC?  I mean, it's your money, but that seems like a lot if it recurs every month.  Did you furnish your house in December or something?

Your income is too high to get a tax deduction for a traditional IRA contribution.  You can make a nondeductible contribution to a traditional IRA and immediately roll that over to a Roth IRA.  Might as well max your Roth 401(k) first.  If you are hoping to maintain a $6K/mo lifestyle in retirement, you had better max it :)

Consider diversifying out of your company stock purchased in the ESPP.  Your fortunes are already closely tied to those of your company; there is no reason to use a bigger rope.  In other words, most of your income stream comes from your company already; when your company does well, presumably you will do well.  When your company does poorly, you may get laid off; you can assume that's when the company stock will tank, too.

Gollygoshdarnscurvy,AskReddit,1389031296.0,"As a general, but not 100%, rule, predator species are not good food options.  This includes cats, dogs, wolves, eagles, etc.  Herbivore species are more nutritious and taste better (cattle, sheep, etc.).  You will also notice a distinct taste difference in a pig that is raised on vegetable matter vs. a pig that eats meat.  

 Beyond that, cultural issues come into play.  Again as a *general* rule, any animal that is more useful alive than dead is off the menu.  Cats control pests.  Dogs herd and protect.  Some people theorize that this is why Hinduism prohibits beef consumption.  For that area of the world, it is more economically viable to eat dairy products and use the manure than to slaughter the animal.  This can also explain how horse consumption can swing either way, depending on culture and food availability.  The more important horses are to plow fields and/or serve military purposes, the less likely they to be considered edible.  If you've got a ton of wild horses just running feral and getting into things, more likely.  There is a lot of room for discussion about horses, though.  "

For a few months now I have been working on scorpion and I have been taking progressive pictures about every other week. This [picture](http://imgur.com/25aXw2W) was taken four days ago and is my current state of ability in the scorpion pose. My question is what stretches can I do to get my feet to touch my head? I have slowly started to gain enough balance to arch my back more while in the pose,  but I fall short of touching my head. I should also add that I am unable to put my legs over my neck fully, but can stretch each leg close to my ear. 
    
Another thing I have been trying to improve on is flexibility. Yoga has shown me that my back is pretty flexible, but my hips not so much. I have been working towards the splits off and on throughout my whole life, yet have never gotten all the way to the ground. The closest I have come was about three inches from the ground..and that was after a summer of stretching and working towards that goal. My question is what stretches do you recommend to help me finally get a split down? I do a lot of sparrow, though I find it somewhat painful in my hips, yet when I breathe through the pain it is quite relieving. When we do butterfly legs during class I cannot get my legs close to the ground..they tend to bend upwards, and pushing them down is painful. I am also unable to stretch my arms outwards during this pose. So, I guess I need more hip flexor stretches overall.

I feel ya.  When my fiance was dragging his feet on proposing, I had to explain to him that him putting the ""element of surprise"" over my feelings of anxiety wasn't fair.  He didn't understand how stressful it was for me to feel like he had forgot, or was scared, or didn't want to marry me, when in reality he was just trying to make it extra special.

&gt;  At this point I'm not even looking forward to the engagement, since at this point there will be no ""magic"" to it. It's just another ""must do"" on the check off list.

Maybe talk to your fiance and explain that it's more important **to you** to be official and get official stuff rolling than it is to have a ring.  He may say, **to him** getting a ring and having a very special proposal is important, because for a lot of guys that's their time to shine in relation to weddings, and maybe he wants to really do this well.

Boots, button-fly jeans, flannel shirt.  
Look around at the local hardware store for a cheap hard hat and a tool belt.  
Yes this will make you look like one of the village people.  
What you need now is attitude, not like the village people.  Go and find a coffee shop that there is construction going on outside of.  Drink coffee, watch dudes.  Notice how they walk and stand.  Little things like how far apart their legs/feet are, where they put their hands when talking or standing.  

Now that you are dressed like a man, and you can carry yourself like a man.  You need a plan.  
Have him get all pretty in the bedroom.  When he is ready, walk in all dressed up with a clipboard like you just got finished fixing the ball-cock assembly in the guest bathroom.  Only call him ""Mam"" or ""Miss""  Blow him off, ask if the man of the house is around so you can explain the work that's been done.  
Leave on the flannel shirt and tool belt (don't attach it to the pants).  Roll up the sleeves.  When you are ready to take off your pants, rip open the button fly.  If you've never done this (or seen it), you grab the front flap with your left hand and the back flap with your right.  Pull hard, out and down with the left hand.  
If it's awkward getting the strap-on out... well welcome to having a cock.

&gt; Picture warnings work

&gt; Hard-hitting anti-tobacco advertisements and graphic pack warnings – especially those that include pictures – reduce the number of children who begin smoking and increase the number of smokers who quit.

&gt; Graphic warnings can persuade smokers to protect the health of non-smokers by smoking less inside the home and avoiding smoking near children. Studies carried out after the implementation of pictorial package warnings in Brazil, Canada, Singapore and Thailand consistently show that pictorial warnings significantly increase people's awareness of the harms of tobacco use.

Also, one difference I noticed was that when I had an exam at a local free clinic in college, it included STD testing and I had to pee in a cup before the exam. (The doctor also double-gloved so that she could take additional swabs for the testing and then go directly to her regular latex gloves for the normal exam.)  When I got my exam at a private clinic with my personal doctor (once I had health insurance), this was not part of the exam unless I asked specifically to be tested.

exgiexpcv,AskReddit,1389031975.0,"It started in basic training.  My training unit had experienced unacceptable numbers of trainee mortalities, so they were being investigated.  This being the army, the grape vine had already alerted the unit that there was a CID agent planted in our training cycle.

My scout master in Boy Scouts had been a Ranger in WW II, and he ran our scout troop like a military unit: uniform inspections, drill and ceremony, marksmanship, all those things and a whole lot more.  If we went to a jamboree and our tents weren't dress-right-dress, he'd make us pull them all down and put them up until he was satisfied.

So I got off the bus to all these angry men shouting at us, and when I heard commands being given, I thought to myself, ""Excellent!  I know all this stuff, I'm gonna do great!!!""

The drills saw me fall in at the position of attention, and decided that I was their planted agent.  My own platoon sergeant would later scream into my face that they knew they had an undercover agent, and that they knew who it was, and I was mystified why he was yelling all this at me, because I knew **I** wasn't the agent.

He did all kinds of horrible things to me; gave me the shittiest duties, KP, worst possible fire watch time (exactly in the middle of the night, so I couldn't three hours of sleep in a block), and even directed me to low crawl into a fire ant mound and called a ""freeze"" when I'd broken the mound's surface and the ants were attacking me.

I graduated all my schools, found myself at my first permanent duty station, and a guy from my basic / AIT cycle was at the same unit.  He apparently told people that I was a CID mole, so I started having ""accidents"" -- like a free-fall track ramp being dropped on me, or getting left behind on a training mission with temperatures below zero, and the soles of my feet turned black and rotted off (it smelled terrible and hurt like nothing you'd believe unless you went through it yourself).

Anyway, after all these ""accidents"" I ran into a buddy of mine who'd been selected to be a drill corporal in the next training cycle (each cycle, the training cadre would select two guys to stay behind to be drill corporals for the incoming cycle; it was considered a honor), and he was all surprised to see me.

He cheerfully explained that the cadre had decided that I was their plant, so they all went out of their way to make my life miserable, and it blew their minds when, after the cycle was completed and we'd all moved on, they found out who the real CID agent was -- our assistant platoon guide.

So all that crap in training, then my ""accidents"" at my unit, all because they thought I was CID when I was just a frigging Boy Scout with a Ranger for a scoutmaster."

sockalicious,personalfinance,1389032022.0,"The bottom line is that making this choice requires you to know your income and marginal tax rate in retirement.  Since tax law changes from time to time, it is very difficult to have total clarity on this question even if you know your own future perfectly (which most people can't.)

If you are maxing your IRA, it is true that you end up with more if you max a Roth.  This is because the amount of pre-tax income that you need to/are allowed to allot to max your Roth is greater than the amount of pretax income that you are allowed to allot in your trad. IRA.  You're allowed to put more of your income into a Roth, even though the contribution limits look the same, because a post-tax dollar is bigger than a pre-tax dollar.  If you look at it that way.

Another way of looking at it: I don't like to be Uncle Sam's investment advisor, doing work to grow money that will then be handed over to him; so I favor a Roth."

Serae,raisedbynarcissists,1389032059.0,"This is so awful and frustrating.

This year a learned a new tool.  I can't believe it took me 26 years to learn this tool but I finally am ok with it.  This tool is, ""Saying no and not trying to reason.""

I cannot reason with crazy.  Every reason I give will have an argument as to why I am wrong no matter how crazy it sounds.  I have discovered that without giving reasons or any additional information that the argument cannot go very far.  I just used this yesterday.

My mother lives off others and tried to extort money from me for things she does not need.  She spent three days heckling me over buying something for her in HSN (a special shampoo/conditioner/beauty set).  I told her no.  She wanted to know why.  I continued by just saying NO, I will not do this.  No I will not buy it for you.  No I don't want to be paid back with my grandmother's money.  No, she's not getting it.  No, I will not enable her to continue this.  No and no.

Her freak out lasted only a minute or two of, ""I didn't know moving away and getting married would mean you would stop treating me like family.  I have done everything for you and you can't do this one thing for me!""  And she hung up.  Otherwise, she's try to feed me her ""reasons"" why I am wrong until I felt horrible and guilty enough to say yes.

I hope in the future you can tell you family, ""No, my eggs, my choice.  No.""  When they ask why?  Just say, ""No, it's not up for discussion.""  And keep repeating it until they tire of it and move on.  If they don't move on then you at least have nothing to add to fuel their flame.  It will just be a broken record of, ""Give me X,"" and, ""No."""

RJ815,truegaming,1389032124.0,"&gt; The Government were the bad guys? Civilization was the bad guy?

Within the context of the game and Marston specifically, yes. Marston hated their guts, hated their unreliable cars, and thought the advancement of civilization / ridding of outlaw crime came with great hypocrisy (e.g. Ross illegally using extortion and military support to coerce Marston into action). Overall though, it difficult to say whether the government as a whole is meant to be seen as bad, but it certainly isn't painted in a nice light either since there are no real ""good guys"" in the game that are on the side of the government (this excludes stuff like the local marshalls and sheriffs because they didn't like federal government encroachment either as told through cutscenes and travel dialogue at times). I'd say the game's stance is that government is centralized crime and authority that simply overpowered the more decentralized crime and authority that cowboy gangs had. You also have to remember that unlocking the bureau outfit makes Jack untouchable by the law regardless of any crimes committed, which I'd say pretty clearly paints the FBI as being ""above the law"" and not something that should be seen in a positive light.

To me, it seems like Ross is merely a symptom of the system, merely one bad guy to be replaced by another later on down the line. If you expand your perspective to all Rockstar games, has the government ever been anything other than the bad guys? Sure, you play as criminals fairly often in Rockstar games, so that antagonism is natural for the setup, but even then I'd say most government characters in Rockstar games are portrayed as being basically the same as the criminals, just hiding behind a badge and the authority of the government while they do their rotten and corrupt deeds.

&gt; without the second ending

Had the game ended right with Marston's death as you prefer, I'd say you wouldn't really know what happened to Ross or Jack. Ross could be presumed alive and still kicking, but Jack only decides to become an outlaw to avenge his father's death after it happens. He didn't really seem to have it in him before that, instead hoping to be a writer. The game could've certainly still worked had the game actually ended at the first ending, but I think the second ending is there to highlight how pointless and tragic Jack's choices are, maybe even going further to mock how pointless the player's desire for revenge against Ross is since they have to actively seek that stranger mission out rather than it being automatically started afterward. (I also imagine a rather big practical factor was Rockstar thinking about how they could let the player continue playing after the final mission. IIRC, every Rockstar game, or at least most, let's you continue playing after the final mission. Ending at main protagonist death obviously could screw that up.) If we bring up other Rockstar games once again, we can see that revenge in stuff like GTA IV is not really satisfying for Niko or the player. Revenge may be what the player wants so ""the bad guys don't win"", but it's set up to be so unsatisfying that the cartharsis is more or less denied. Darko is tied up, drugged out, and helpless. Francis McReary can be easily killed while sitting calmly on a park bench. You never get the opportunity to do anything against Karen. You do get to kill Dimitri and/or Pegorino in fairly climatic ways eventually, but only after they've pretty seriously messed with you.

I'd also add that mocking the player might not be that out there as a design intention. It's speculation on my part of course, but I really feel like the late game ranch missions implicitly kind of criticize the player. ""Oh, you think this ranching is boring, don't you? Marston may want to live a quiet, peaceful rancher life, but you don't. You want the violence and action and excitement back. Here's a train being robbed, think you can reign in your violent desires?"""
Czar-Salesman,SubredditDrama,1389032124.0,"Its a principal rather than practical distinction.

To me it doesn't make a difference, I some what understand the principal of the argument but it seems petty to me.

From an engineering and construction perspective, it was a pretty impressive feat, especially considering that France was still recovering from the depression and managed to leverage as much as 3 billion Francs for the effort.

From a strategic perspective, it was an enormous waste of money and never used for it's intended purpose. The design, like many military fortifications, was based on a reactive strategy devised from previous engagements, in this case the static lines of WWI, and was woefully unprepared for a more mobile invasion force. When Germany did invade, their armor and infantry simply went around the Maginot Line, taking advantage of a gap on the Belgium border that was supposed to be guarded by treaty and neutrality. Even had that boarder been guarded, however, the design had not anticipated the swift advances in air warfare since WWI, and the Luftwaffe simply flew over the line."

Faithhandler,funny,1389032394.0,"&gt; This explains my personal outlook on what we're discussing pretty well. (important stuff starts at 3:50). I think cruelty comes into play when you maliciously direct jokes at someone who can't handle laughing at their problems. I might be wrong, but I don't think this falls under that category. I doubt a person who actually suffers from anorexia is going to see a guy wearing a shirt that says ""I beat anorexia"" and have a significant negative emotional reaction that really impacts their quality of life.

I'm anorexic. Recovered, largely, but like being an alcoholic or any other neurosis, is doesn't just go away. I still have the anxiety and the self loathing, I've just developed coping mechanisms and strategies. Don't think for a moment though that it's something that doesn't haunt every activity. Every bite of food, every small gesture of kindness offered up by people simply wanting to share food with me; it's a battle. I seriously have straight up panic attacks about food, and having to continually explain this, to justify my seeming rudeness at turning down another's gesture of kindness because it will just emotionally destroy me to accept it, that shit sucks man. Looking at a bowl of cereal or a piece of toast and feeling disgusted at the fact that I have to eat this, and doing this battle in my head to justify eating a small amount of even healthy foods is really fucking difficult. 

So, yeah, making light of that struggle. A struggle that has brought me to the brink of starvation and has pushed me into sorts of exhaustion you can't even begin to understand, it's pretty shitty. If you think making light of this struggle, this neurosis in this way isn't all that big a deal, it's just because you have the fucking privilege of not having to worry about it. You get to be callous and inconsiderate because you don't have any idea what it's like. 

Insisting that those who recognize their problems have recovered or are in recovery is silly. Again, even when you've ""recovered"" and developed healthier coping strategies, it's not just something that goes away. You don't get to shrug it off just because you don't or can't empathize. I mean, can you imagine if the opposite occurred? That someone who is in deep struggle with bulimia or anorexia would wear a t-shirt that says ""I beat binge eating"" or ""I beat obesity"". The thought alone is pretty cringe inducing and disgusting. That speaks volumes about the indecency of such a joke and the place of very real privilege it comes from. 

It's pretty disgusting to me that you can't simply respect someone who just can't ""buck up"" and take a joke at the expense of themselves, who can't make light about something that literally kills hundreds of people and is definitely one of the most exhausting fights with mental illness anyone could ever go through.

That's pretty shitty man, and to be frank, if you feel that way, you're a pretty shitty person. "

Skulder,badlinguistics,1389032555.0,"I came here for the same reason, and found this:

&gt; As a ready check in such sentences, simply substitute the personal pronoun “he/him” or “she/her” for “who/whom.” If he or she would be the correct form, the proper choice is who.” If  “him” or “her” would be correct, use “whom.” 

&gt;    This technique of substituting a personal pronoun for the relative pronoun works nicely whenever you have difficulty deciding whether to use “who” or “whom,” assuming that you have no difficulty using the proper form of personal pronouns. 

So, apparently because you can turn it into ""*him* can we turn to"" but not ""*He* can we turn to"", it should be **""whom""**.

The ""ending a sentence with a preposition"" is apparently a holdover from the days when people tried to apply rules for Latin grammar to English. Another one of those is ""never split the infinitive"" (infinitives are stuff that's uncountable, like ""water"" (because there's hardly ever two water - it's just water, and more water), so you shouldn't put anything in between ""the"" and ""water"".

In other words, we should all strive to be more like Colorado."
goocy,technology,1389032588.0,"Two major problems:

* Energy transmission

They're talking about ""microwaves and lasers"", which is somewhat bullshit. Lasers are the only option, because the energy needs to be focused on a small point on earth. They can output visible light (""Lasers"", which you can actually buy) or microwaves (""Masers"", which have only been prototyped recently, after 60 years of development). Neither of those devices can be built anywhere near the correct magnitude for this task.

Of course, you can build several thousands of single devices. After all, 
a typical 200W panel costs only ~$80. Scaling this up to a moon-sized ring seems feasible enough with enough money and determination.

But: a 200W laser (that can focus on a small spot on earth) costs more than $8000, needs a tracking device, regular maintenance, and a redundant cooling infrastructure. And, power-wise, you need one of those $8000 transmitters for *every single panel*.

* Orbital mechanics

The moon may always show the same side towards earth, but it travels over the visible sky. So, our lasers need to be focused on one point on earth. So, each device needs a mechanical focus device as well.

Large telescopes are a good example why these mechanical focus devices can still cost magnitudes more than the actual laser underneath.

You'd need an actual human workforce for each of those laser telescopes to keep them running, maintained and calibrated. And an effective supply infrastructure to keep them stocked: at the very least, a superhighway all around the moon. Oh, and the shuttle flights: it costs $25k to get 1kg of mass into orbit.

* Cost/Benefit calculation

It would be cheaper by a factor of ~200-2000 to put up solar panels on the ocean or any desert. The deserts alone are big enough to support an exponentially growing energy demand for the next 100-150 years. Until the space on earth has run out, we don't *need* to pay the price for solar panels on the moon yet."

dunnoyabassa,relationship_advice,1389032604.0,"Friendship isn't something that comes with rules about how often you talk, who contacts who, and whether or not you fall on a certain level of the personal priority hierarchy.  Sure pop culture and the media are filled with messages about how friendship (or any other kind of relationship) SHOULD be, but the fact of the matter is different people need different things out of their relationships with others and most of the time those differences are completely healthy, normal, moral, and ok.  Just because two buddies on TV assert 'bros before hoes,' that doesn't mean a guy in real life is actually making a bad choice if he starts spending less time with his friends in favor of his significant other.  But it also doesn't mean that this choice might not hurt his friendships.

It sounds like your buddy needs very different things out of friendships and relationships than you do, and that is completely ok.  It is absolutely his right as a person to prioritize you where he does.  You cannot attempt to change or control his behavior toward you by suggesting there are laws about what a good friend does.

However, as you observe:
&gt;it's really not healthy for me to have this absentee companion.

You are under no obligation to hold onto this friendship either.  If you do not care for the way a friend treats you, you have no need to maintain the friendship.  You should not hold onto a friendship (or any relationship really) with some expectant hope for improvement.  You need to decide whether you appreciate your friend as is, or whether his behavior does more harm than good."

small_havoc,todayilearned,1389032683.0,"It's a perfect answer (and it follows studies in Cognition and Culture to the letter) - when you act outside cultural norms, your behaviour is believed to be deviant in some way.

With a visible tatt, you'll apparently be turned away from most establishments and people will be wary of you.

Gnaedigefrau is correct. Just because abuse happens largely to one group does not mean it happens equally in another *in the same way*; factors are dependant on cultural, situational, familial, environmental, social, and a host of other factors which can all vary a lot, even from region to region - not just outside of wider cultural context. Generalising in this way doesn't really work, in my opinion.

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389032719.0,"Qhapaqocha already went over a couple of the big ones, but I want to emphasize these. Irrigation is huge. In the mountains there was some limited irrigation, and even some [aquaducts](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8375/8482890525_0eca009566_c.jpg) that all expanded the amount of land available to be planted. 

But the coast is where this is most dramatically seen. Valleys that would have originally looked like [this](http://www.zonu.com/images/500X0/2009-09-17-2120/Satellite-Image-Photo-of-Yauca-and-Acari-River-Canyons-Peru.jpg), small rivers flowing to the ocean from the mountains, bordered by maybe a few hundred metres of vegetation, became like [this](http://ponce.tv/first_project_report_google_earth_01.jpg), huge valleys with abundant agricultural land because of irrigation. Irrigation started small at first but by 2000 years ago most coastal valleys were probably irrigated as much as they could be without very modern engineering techniques (like the [Chavi-Mochic Project](http://www.chavimochic.gob.pe/portal/Imagenes//etapas.gif), built in the 90s, that carries water over mountains). The Chimú empire did try to build a canal between the Moche Valley, where their capital of Chan Chan was located, and the Chicama Valley to the north, but it probably never worked. Large-scale irrigation was huge on the coast, and between that and smaller-scale irrigation and terrace farming in the highlands, land reclamation and increasing the amount of arable land was the major agricultural technology in the Andes.

At least some Andean societies, including the Inca, used a [foot plough](http://cupp.mycology.cornell.edu/images/marked/Trad-Ag-1_24.jpg) that really sped up the process of planting, and there were also wooden and bronze hoes (the bronze ones were probably elite goods and more ceremonial than anything), so there was some technology for planting.

But the other big innovation for Andean agriculture was simply smart planning and organization of crops, in the highlands at least. You can't grow crops in the high puna zone, so that's where you craze your llamas and alpacas. Potatoes grow below this zone, but maize won't, so that's where you grow potatoes. Then you grow your maize at a lower elevation, fruits, peppers and squash lower still. This model is called the [vertical archipelago](http://bruceowen.com/andeanae/and8s22.htm) and while the idea that a single community ""owned"" land in all these different zones is probably a stretch, people definitely grew different things at different elevations, taking advantage of ideal conditions for each crop (and these conditions being similar to those crops' wild habitats) to increase yields.

And they may have used guano as fertilizer on the coast, but from what I last heard this isn't conclusive yet. There were certainly millions of birds living on small, rocky offshore islands, and these islands are covered with guano, and people visited them.

As for organization, it was probably community-based, with each community farming their own land, and the state or temple probably had their own land that was worked by people as part of a labour tax. "

McLarenF1God,worldnews,1389032791.0,"Extreme vegetarianism is not an epidemic. There is always going to be a one in a million whack job like Tre Arrow, setting fire to a truck stop or whatever. Extremism and religion operate on a grand scale, much larger and more organized than your next-door neighbor's extremist vegetarian daughter. If she wants to blow up the meat packing plant, her values and reasoning are unique, and exist only within the scope of her own head. She may try and rally up some like-minded extremist vegetarians, but will more than likely not find such people. She operates alone because her ideals are so unique and there is no preexisting divine structure to abide by. There is no other person that shares her extremist views in the community. She is a bad apple. Someone like her doesn't come around very often. 

With extremist religion, there is explicit documentation handed down by god, and many, many people within the community support this kind of violence. While I agree that extremism is just that, no matter how it is applied, religion opens up the floodgates when it comes to extremist behavior. They often have the support of the community, and the right to act on it under god. Imagine for a moment, that a thousand years ago, someone wrote a book about vegetarianism. In that book was a set of rules and moral codes, with various stories relating to these codes. Fast forward a thousand years and the book is still relevant, and there is a large population of vegetarian believers, who practice what this book preaches every day. That's what it takes to go from one extremist vegetarian who's beliefs and actions are personal, to a bunch of extremist vegetarians who's beliefs and actions are inspired by god. This is how you get organized terrorism. Now they have support in doing so, and explicit moral instruction from the Veggie Prince of Babylon to blow up Oscar Meyer meat packing plants. 

Religion is dangerous because it is extremism in numbers *and* there is valid instruction from god to act on their beliefs. An extremist religious person without the religion is just an extremist. Religion brings extremists together under the same framework, often with the support of a government or region (and god). Without it, you're left with a series of lone wolfs, with isolated beliefs, most of whom will not be independently motivated to express their views through violence. That's the one bad seed. That's the vegetarian who set the South wing of the Oscar Meyer wiener plant on fire at 4 o clock on a Wednesday. The sprinkler system worked as expected. No children were rigged with dynamite and sent into the building."

bermyWHAT,breakingmom,1389032798.0,"I'm just saying that no birth control method is 100%

Many people get pregnant while using contraception. If you have a birth control shot you may have no idea you're pregnant for several months. Or you could get spotting and think you're getting your period when you're pregnant. By the time you realise you're pregnant it's too late to use the morning after pill and abortion may be your only option. But it's not always an easy decision - abortions can hurt or you can be shit-scared of a new, unknown medical procedure...let alone all the scary protesters they have outside of clinics in the US. There could be a tonne of shame from your religious upbringing.

Being responsible doesn't mean that statistical anomalies don't happen. Being a parent doesn't mean that you now suddenly think in black and white. Why should having several kids make a difference in deciding whether or not you want an abortion? It has no difference than if you have no kids - you wonder will I resent this kid for changing your life? Will you be able to support this kid emotionally/financially? Are you ready for this child? Will you still be able to be a good partner, person, and parent with a new child?

I'm 41 weeks pregnant and I still wonder if this child is a good idea. It happens. I was never the chick that knew she was destined to be a Mum nor did this unexpected pregnancy come at a good time. It's caused a lot of stress in my life. Will I love this baby? Probably. Will there be times when I don't? Probably. I'm sure that when I'm ready and I decided I'd like to expand my family, that pregnancy will be a lot easier, but if I get my IUD and my husband uses condoms and we get pregnant before we intend then I'd have a lot to think about. I didn't realise I was pregnant for nearly 3 months the first time because I was spotting. We probably won't be financially stable but in my country getting an abortion is a *mission* so it would be a big decision (financially/emotionally) to wonder about for months. 

It's the opposite of irresponsible to weigh your options and to think them over carefully - as long as that takes - you're literally dealing with life altering decisions."

sockalicious,personalfinance,1389033009.0,"&gt; Is it dangerous to pay everything with credit; how often do people actually run having identity theft occur because of it?

It happens.  If you are careful about where you use your CC it happens a lot less.  Many cards have identity theft protection so if you keep an eye on your transactions - especially on your CC company's website - you won't be liable for fraudulent transactions.

&gt; Does your credit score prevent you from applying for loans in the future?

No.  It might prevent you from *getting* a loan; or it might cause you to get an unfavorable *interest rate* on a loan.

&gt; How much debt must you be in to be eligible to file for bankruptcy?

Depends on your circumstances, but generally, it's about your income level as much as it is about the amount and terms of your debt.  If you can't pay your debts as agreed with the income you have, you're bankrupt.

&gt; Once you apply for bankruptcy, does your debt go away or do you have to pay it in the future?

Depends on the terms of the bankruptcy agreement.  Usually debt is reduced, sometimes eliminated.

&gt; What kind of debt can bankruptcy not discharge? 

Student loans.  Back child support.  [A few others](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/nondischargeable-debts-chapter-7-bankruptcy.html).  I found that link by pasting your question into google, btw."

AJ Green and Megatron are just superior talents at WR. In this era of WR-centric rules, they are basically uncoverable. Which means their quarterbacks are going to get inflated stats. But at the end of the day, they aren't top-tier quarterbacks - their stats just say they are.

Heck, want a better example of this phenomenon? Look at how many different shitty quarterbacks threw touchdowns for Cleveland this year. Josh Gordon had this effect on the QB by committee in Cleveland this year.

If we look at the Browns QB situation as an accumulation of all their pass throwers, here's their line this year:
379/681 (55.7%) 4372 Yds, 26 TD 20 Int

Here's Dalton:
363/586 (61.9%) 4296 Yds, 33 TD 20 Int

I completely agree with you about seasonal food. We should also be growing things in our communities. Food production is becoming increasingly efficient and high tech, extending growing seasons, reducing need for imports, producing better quality varierties - all of which is great, and I think that trend could revolutionise local produce in a few years. Gardens and allotments could be enormously productive with a little tweaking and some incentives. 

The problem with education, has been, as I see it, a failure to reward individual contribution. Learning must be in a positive, rewarding environment, a place of inspiration, discovery and wonder. If the goal is to create citizens who will contribute to society, surely we must reward our children for taking the initiative and working hard towards their own goals, instead of homogenizing everyone within the same dull curriculum and then expecting them to suddenly map out their individual paths at 17. I'm 24 now and feel like a maladjusted adult with no transferable skills or, more worryingly, personal ambition. Academies are a good idea, I think they will be vindicated in a few years. Primary education is also moving in the right direction, although there is still far too much assessment and not enough emphasis on experiences and fostering good behaviour, work ethic and individual curiosity. And again, the reason why our children find it hard adjusting to adult life is because they are protected from it rather than trusted to thrive and adapt early. It's about experiencing and overcoming challenges - and failures - at a young age. We talk about robbing children of their childhood - but the best childhood is one where the child has the freedom to impersonate an adult and actually learn some important lessons. The coming of age has been compressed into too few years when it should be started earlier.

I think it is an important point in general, but when you are trying to demonstrate evidence that Jesus existed, relying on an appeal to authority rings a little false."

Fast-forward to when I got home (in the States), was looking for the towel in the laundry before a shower, and shouted to my dad (who had done the laundry), ""Did you see my Diddl towel?""  Add in some poor inflection on the German name and the fact that I was in a rush to find it, and it basically sounded like I asked my dad for my ""diddle towel,"" which seems oddly masturbatory.  I realize this and so then try to explain to him that that's the name of the character, saying like, ""No, look, the mouse, on the towel!"" and he's all sure, whatever, ""I don't need to see your personal towel..."""

I've had it sort of sitting my my PS3 for a while clogging up any future gameplaying choices but it's so long and I was at the end and I was like WELL I SHOULD DO ALL THESE THOUSANDS OF IMPORTANT FULLY VOICE ACTED SIDEQUESTS but thenI decided to just go ahead and beat it and do the sidequests when I play it through next with Grade options.

After beating it, I went back to **Final Fantasy XIII-2** which I am now trying to beat before **Lightning Returns** comes out soon, which I am sort of embarrassingly excited for. I really like 13-2 a lot!! But I put it on hold about 75% of the way through TWO YEARS AGO when Tales of Graces f came out and I've sort of been playing other stuff since then -- I'm reaaally slow at console games, sigh. It's a really good game and I'm really enjoying being playing it again. I wish the PS3 had the stream to Vita option, though ... I just don't enjoy playing games on TV that much. I'd be digging this way more if I could play it in bed.

Speaking of playing in bed, I am on the last lag of **Rune Factory 4**! I have gotten to the last boss in Sharance maze a few times without beating him and almost have level 10 golden potato seeds. I also have at least 10 hearts with every villager and and on my 44th monster taming! So I'm so close to finishing all of Eliza's requests and being done with the game! I'm married (Doug) and have a kid (the boy) and everything too. What a great game, absolutely my 2013 GOTY. Which is silly but. WOOP.

I've also picked up my unfinished game of **Persona 4 Golden** which is like the third playthrough I've had of this game. I hate leaving playthroughs unfinished though. Quit it about a year ago after blasting through the first 80 hours. I'm at Magatsu Inaba which is near the end of the p;d game but not so close with the new one. The Hardcore Risette Fan trophy is impossible. some bullshit. Anyways, flawed as shit game that's way overrated, especially compared to the infinitely better **P3P**, but I enjoy playing it!

On PC, I grabbed **The Wolf Among Us** and **Walking Dead Season 2** during the Steam Sale and gah they're both AMAZING, WD especially. Actually playing as Clem, and having her two years older and so much more strong and jaded, it's amazing. My heart is still broken from what happened to Christa. [](/s ""Her pregnancy was one of the only bright spots of WD, the thought that new life could exist in this lifeless expanse. I'm not a big pregnancy person and babies sort of freak me out, but I still started crying when it came in and she wasn't pregnant anymore and there was no baby in sight. Whatever happened, there was no bright spot, here."") A friend also gave me **Long Live the Queen** for Christmas and dudes, anyone who hasn't played it, please, please play it. It's so good. It's basically a social roguelike, or maybe more like the social Dark Souls, where you go in expecting to die and see how far you can get and what you have to do to get past certain obstacles only to them get punked by a later obstacle. Masocore simulation game. It's really fun. Get it. Play it. Have your life changed. Also been plyaing some **Path of Exile** (fun fucking game with some really, really huge SJ issues and a really, really terrible community) and **Risk of Rain** (not fun at all alone, SUPER FUCKING FUN with friends) with some buddies.

WOW THAT'S MORE GAMES THAN I PLAYED ALL LAST YEAR.

-----

**DISCUSSION QUESTION**

Oh god, so many games.

**Bravely Default: Flying Fairy**: this looks amazing. My favourite character designer, FF5 style gameplay without FF5's hillllariously bad story, so excited.

**Lightning Returns**: You think I care what people say about this series? I don't care SHIT. I love it. I think the controversy over Lightning's boob job is way overwrought when we should be focusing more on how sexualized some of her costumes are, but none of it will change that Lightning is just a cool fucking character who is really strong and has a lot of agency in her story and this game looks great.

**Final Fantasy X HD Vita**: Wow that's a lot of Final Fantasy but for real I hate this game's story and characters more than words can express but fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck the gameplay is so much fun guys it's so fun. the sphere grid. the battle system. How OP you can make characters by knowing how to manipulate both. Literally my least favourite FF storywise but by god it's fun and everything is better if I can play it in bed.

**Tales of Symphonia HD**: This game's story is kinda bad and silly but it has Kratos in it and Kratos is just the best most manpainy pandering character I love ever. All hail Kratos, take my money.

**Stardew Valley**: MULTIPLAYER HARVEST MOON YOU SAY?? I THINK YOU MEAN ""THE GAME I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE!""

dakboy,Rochester,1389033463.0,"In the US at least, you have no reasonable expectation of privacy outdoors in plain view of the public.

But let's say you prohibit flying over private property. You've now created restricted airpsace over 75% (or more) of the state/country. But you still have to get your aircraft to the 25% you're allowed to fly in - by flying over private land, most likely. And don't forget that from that 25% of the airspace, you can still see into private property - there aren't magic curtains around your house.

Your house has been photographed numerous times from the air and space, by both the government and private organizations. The photos taken by the government are public domain and anyone can download them if they know the right grid square. They're used for disaster prep/relief, agricultural planning, city planning, and a host of other legitimate purposes.

Have you submitted a request to Google to have your house obscured from Street View &amp; their aerial imagery?"
beefcakez,naturalbodybuilding,1389033471.0,"Just a comparison of the two and some potential benefits you may reap by doing one or the other. Studies have shown there are some benefits of increased recovery from doing Active Recovery versus Passive. Take a read for yourself. 

tl;dr - 

**Defining Terms**

* Passive Rest: Basically, doing nothing. 

* Active Rest: A workout done at a reduced intensity and volume of loading 

**Desired Goals/Benefits of Active Recovery** - Just some views on what it 'could' do. 

* Stimulate the metabolic pathways of recovery *without* contributing fatigue

* Repair damage from high-intensity days

* Pumps some blood through the tissues to help remove waste products

* Active recovery can essentially double as a technical workout - i.e. train form on movements

**Cons of Active Recovery**

* The light-day turns into an actual workout and is no longer a 'light/rest day', therefore the benefits listed above are dismissed. 

 **Benefits of Passive Recovery**

* For people with low self-control in the gym, taking a day off is better than going in. 

**The Rules of Active Rest**


1. Volume should be 1/2-2/3 of a normal workout.

2. Intensity should be perhaps 60% maximum heart rate for endurance athletes and up to 75% of 1RM for weight trainers.

3. You should finish the workout feeling better than you started.

**Final Thoughts*

""Done properly, active recovery is better than passive recovery under most circumstances.  But if you can’t do active recovery right, passive recovery is better."" 

Pretty long article, and I'm sure I missed some things, but it's good to know. Hope it helps. 

Good luck. "

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389033560.0,"Qhapaqocha's answers are all good, I just want to add a bit about iconography (your question #4).

I would say that a lot of Andean art and iconography falls somewhere between your two possibilities. It probably wasn't just art for art's sake and most of it seems to tell some sort of story, and much of it is probably religious in nature, but it isn't hieroglyphs and doesn't tell a story that we can translate. A good example of this is [Moche pottery](http://seco.glendale.edu/~rkibler/gif%20resource%20file/mochefinelinevase955.jpg), which has complex scenes, characters that can be identified across different pots, and common motifs. These seem to tell a story, but you can only understand the story if you know it, and these serve to sort of remind you of certain points in the story. I like to relate them to the stained glass windows of an old Catholic cathedral. These windows have scenes, with various characters, and if you know your bible stories then you can recognize those characters, and maybe you identify with some of the scenes (like you worship the saint depicted in that scene or something). So if you couldn't read, you could still walk around a cathedral and learn the story by pictures, but you would have to have an idea of the story to begin with.

Now, that's more for iconography, which isn't really what you asked about, but I think is more what you were getting at. [Inlaid](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQqOeSxmcEjTLP2G_DDVnzXqX2SEEWbZhh7bZrSPlWoxEnpn27P) ear spools and other things like that are more body ornamentation, and they don't tell the story in the same way that pots do, but they certainly would have had some significance to the wearer and to the people who saw them. Not hieroglyphs, but also not just pretty art. Well for body decoration it might have been closer to being pretty art, but what you choose to wear says a ton about who you are and how you identify yourself, and that is as true in modern society today as it was 1500 years ago in Peru."

I think my problems with it shouldn't necessarily influence your decision to try it because I'm weird about lip makeup.

I have never really worn any lip products other than clear chapstick because it never stays where it should, my lips seem weird shaped, and I guess I have bad lip habits? My cupid's bow is really small, almost not noticeable at all, but I feel like darker lip colors look strange without a dip in the upper lip so I try to make one but it looks weird. Also my lower lip is larger than my top and I have a habit of pressing my lips together all the time to smooth out my lip balm... if I have a dark color on I end up with smudges outside of my upper lip line that look really clownish. So pretty much I just stick to really sheer lip colors like Clinique chubby sticks or Revlon lip butters. I guess I don't mind the continuous re-application because I'm already used to that from my chapstick and I don't need a mirror because the sheer color doesn't demand perfection. 

TL:DR - my lips are weird, so you should try the Stila stuff regardless of what I say. "

decidarius,sex,1389033599.0,"Hopefully everyone will give each other lots of attention. I advise two things in general. One, let your wife do lots of the hitting on, flirting with, etc. This will let your prospective third know that you're not just ""testing you leash"" so to speak. It really does communicate a very different thing to the lady you're hitting on. Second thing, no penetration, at least for the first time. There's a huge difference between the idea of this stuff and the reality. Going without penetration gives a little bit of psychological space if it turns out anyone's boundaries are more sensitive than they thought, which might not turn up until afterwards. Plus it just works better from a longevity and balance point of view. Oh, and have fun! Smile and be generous in your sentiments while in the act. Sex is psychological, and a gentle, generous mindset goes a long way towards giving people the right space to enjoy themselves.

I guess that's more than two things, but I promise you, they're all worth it. Good luck, and report back with stories!

screenmagnet,sex,1389033741.0,"I love large dicks, but average is sufficient to give me the full feeling, especially if we ensure lots of friction (make sure both him and me are totally dry during insertion), do lots of foreplay, and employ certain positions (e.g. I feel fullest in doggy, or on my back if I'm teased with 'just the tip' for a while). Marijuana also makes me tighter so the penis feels much bigger inside me.

I have only been with guys with average or above average dicks, and have had satisfying sex with all of them (six guys). I did prefer the larger guys. I haven't been with anyone smaller than average, but I doubt I would find it satisfying enough to stay in the relationship.

Btw, my vagina is normally of average to better than average tightness according to my partners (on weed it is much tighter than average....tighter even than my ass, which is super tight). I did buy a set of Ben Wa balls recently so I could start a good kegel exercise program, which I believe will help me fulfill my craving for being filled and stretched. 

I am one of those girls that likes to be fucked as hard and fast for as long as a guy can do it. I like the guy to fuck me like a pile driver. I like it to hurt, and I want to be sore the next day.

For a man to satisfy me in bed, he needs more than a decent dick size though. He also must have absolute control over his orgasm (be able to delay it indefinitely without stopping or slowing down the thrusting), he must be able to maintain his erection (the harder he is the better it feels, and I like my guys to take cialis for all night sex sessions), and he must be very physically fit in order to have the necessary stamina to fuck me hard and fast continuously for a very long time. The men I have been with could all do this, and they enthusiastically worked on any weaknesses in these areas in order to please me.

J_E_L_L_O,AdviceAnimals,1389033970.0,"&gt; I think it's an admirable quality to only ""eat what you would kill.""

I think it's pathetic in most cases because it's often based on superficial qualities and not on the actual degree of cruelty or suffering involved in killing a specific animal. It's an emotional response rather than a rational one. For example, you mentioned fish: Fish are impaled, dragged against their will for several minutes while they struggle for their lives, and then they slowly suffocate while gasping for air. Sometimes, they're skinned alive before they suffocate. I struggle to think of a worse fate for any animal. The only benefit of being a pescatarian is the false feeling of moral superiority they gain through sheer ignorance and/or stupidity.

We all get sad when we see living things suffer and die. That's called being human. Refusing to eat something because of that is called being a pussy. Feeling superior because you're a pussy is called being a douche.

Btw, this isn't directed at you... just a general message to those types of people."

A quick jump over the the [Institute for Cetacean Research](http://www.icrwhale.org/scJARPA.html), the organization behind JARPA I/II, describe the following:

&gt; JARPA II started with two feasibility surveys in the seasons 2005/06 and 2006/07. The first full survey started in the 2007/08 season. The objectives of the JARPA II are the following: **a) monitoring the Antarctic ecosystem (whale abundance trends and biological parameters; krill abundance and the feeding ecology of whales; effects of contaminants on cetaceans; cetacean habitat);** b) modeling competition among whale species and future management objectives (constructing a model of competition among whale species; new management objectives including the restoration of the cetacean ecosystem); c) elucidation of temporal and spatial changes in stock structure; and d) improving the management procedure for Antarctic minke whale stocks.

Dismantlement,LetsTalkMusic,1389034248.0,"""My Girls"" was a little catchy, mostly for its syncopated two-voice pop hook. Otherwise I'm not too enamored by the album. The singers seem emotionally detached from the songs, the music lacks narrative development and fluid changes in tone or dynamics, the whole album overuses the Phyrgian mode making it a somewhat frustrating and unsatisfying experience, which could be excused if they did anything interesting with the electronics rhythmically--which they don't. It's a noisy and busy album which creates almost a dreamlike listening state, only it's like one of those claustrophobic dreams you feel like you have no escape from. On top of all of this, the lyrics are nearly all unintelligible. There are a few standout moments when they juxtapose truly novel combinations of electronic instruments but for me, it's not enough to make the album listenable. "

It got to a point where we would hang out, and I would just feel sad. And because my attitude changed, our friendship suffered. So recently (a month ago), after consulting with another female friend, I stopped being friends with her.

I would also definitely choose macrobid over cipro. Cipro is a very powerful, very broad spectrum antibiotic, which means it will kill everything -- even good bacteria, leaving you vulnerable to diarrhea and yeast infections. Also, you want to 'save' cipro for kidney infections or for antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria you might get infected with in the future.

Have you ever un-invited someone from working out with you because they weren't ""competitive enough?""

I workout with a group of about 4 guys every Sunday. This week would have made 20 weeks in a row where we workout on Sunday.

Yesterday, one of the guys texted me. Out of the blue, he says, ""Workout hard today."" I told him, I had already hit it pretty hard 3 times this week and was very sore. He replid, ""That was then, this is now."" 

Now, we've been having a nice string of weather here in Florida, so I told him ""I just want to work out for fun today, hang out with friends and enjoy the weather."" He responded by telling me ""You may not want to come out anymore because we have a competitive environment.""

Now, keep in mind, this is a group of stoners, who before EVERY workout, they get ripped. That doesn't bother me, but what does bother me, is who exactly are we competing against? I wasn't aware you had to compete just to get in shape.

Do you guys think I should I try to salvage what's left of my workout group? Or just let these dumbasses go on their merry way?

TL:DR If you're not competitive, should you even work out?"

* Anything **Telltale Games**, those people are fantastic, they put in every effort to make their stories compelling. The game play is ""meh"" a best, but those stories are so good you won't care. **The Walking Dead** by Telltale is probably the best story driven videogame I've ever played.

* **Journey** it's a PS3 exclusive (although it might be getting a PS4 release with their online thing, I don't know for sure) anyway, it's the exemplification of the Hero's Journey, the classic outline of any epic. I can't decide if this game is in it's own right an epic, or something satirical, or an accident. Anyway, it's brilliant. I recommend it.

* I don't see any **Assassin's Creed** on your list. It's kinda set up with each character having a story, and then an over arcing story. The over arcing story isn't great. But the individual stories of some of the assassins are pretty fantastic. Altair (AC 1 and AC Revelations) and Ezio (AC 2, AC Brotherhood, and AC Revelations) in particular.

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389034870.0,"• There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of varieties of potato in Peru, so yes, there is a huge variety. I don't know that they were really managed, just probably many different wild varieties were cultivated, and people just grew what they had always grown. I've heard that argument too about Ireland, but the same argument lies behind many famines (not to mention general ideas about evolution favouring diversity) that mono-cropping is the main cause of the famine because something will evolve to attack a certain type of organism, and if all you are growing is that organism, it will spread quickly and attack all of them. And then you have no food. More diverse crops mean either that the disease can't spread so well in the first place, because it is cut off by other organisms that it doesn't affect, or if it does spread and kill all of a certain type of potato, that's ok because you have dozens of other types. So it is a plausible argument.

• In another question we both talked extensively about agricultural technology, so you can check that out for the specifics, but I'd say that the main change in cultivation over time was just the massive growth of arable land through the expansion of irrigation or terracing, and I would say that this is less about technological innovation than it is about administration and controlling land and people.

As for status, maize is the main ingredient of two high-status foods, *chicha* beer and *sanko*, a type of porridge, and these foods were served during festivals, during rituals, etc., and were hugely important. The coca leaf is the same way, in that it had ritual undertones, but it was still used by everyone. So these are high-status in that they are important and imbued with ritual undertones, but I wouldn't say that they were cut-off from certain parts of society, or that people eating other things were looked down on. But we also just don't (and can't) know that many specifics like that. And my area of expertise is the coast, where maize was the staple and I don't think potatoes were eaten much.

• There's no real consensus, but the arguments now are more nuanced than in the past. The model that I like best essentially argues that the mid-valleys of the four Norte Chico valleys (the mid-valleys are narrower and have better water than the lower valleys, so they can be farmed with no or only small-scale irrigation) grew squash and cotton (used for making and floating fishing nets), hot peppers, and fruit, and traded these up and down the coast where autonomous communities were bringing in huge amounts of fish and seafood. So it developed through the trade between maritime and agricultural resources."

Gingersmack,relationships,1389034893.0,"First, I just want to say that you're a thoughtful husband for posting and wanting to actively help and support your wife. Therapy is a good place for her to get and practice coping and life skills to help her get through this and future issues. You may want to look into Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). I grew up with childhood trauma and abuse and then married an abusive man and was a hard drug addict for years. Finally got divorced and clean but was left as an adult with PTSD and severe anxiety as well as fighting depression. I have been in and out of various types of therapy for my whole adult life but nothing (medication included) seemed to have more than a minimal impact on my life. Several years ago, I began DBT and it has far and away had the most impact and effect on my overall life of any sort of therapy I've been engaged in. I'm only briefly telling you my story as an anecdote- whatever works for your wife is what is right for her. DBT works for me because it is very practical- the focus is not on reliving trauma or talking about and dissecting the past. DBT focuses on: Mindfulness, Interpersonal Relationships, Emotion Regulation, and Distress Tolerance. Daily mindfulness, meditation, eating, sleeping, exercise etc are also important in DBT. Just my 2 cents. Best of luck!"

sharshenka,literature,1389034943.0,"I may be letting the film color my reading, but I think that the idea that the main characters are the same person is pretty well established by the book, too. 

**Spoilers!**

Outside of Louisa's story, where it is the most explicit, Somni remembers being driven off the bridge when she is in the car accident during her escape, which she wouldn't have heard mentioned in The Ghastly Ordeal, because I believe Tim only finished part 1 of the manuscript after his stroke. Also, I would argue that Robert spotting Dr. Goose's intentions right off the bat indicates a similar connection to Adam Ewing. Finally, the Old Georgie character and the true prophesies in Zachary's story seem to me to pretty firmly establish that a spiritual world exists in the world of the book.

**End Spoilers**

I find it interesting that you read Timbo's Turd as being the same birth mark. I thought it was both a different shape and in a different place (below the armpit instead of on the shoulder). That's why I said he explicitly didn't have the comet birth mark, but I might be wrong.

Either way, what is your take on Louisa being a fictional character for him? Are we supposed to assume Hilary V Hush knew her, or is ghostwriting for her? If she is fictional, is Sixsmith also fictional? 

I think RF was the character we got to know the best, and he was the most real for me. I might have to go with Louisa for my favorite, though. I grew up on Nancy Drew, so I have a soft spot in my heart for plucky female detectives. Some of my favorite descriptions were in that part, too, especially in the final action sequence.

madhjsp,nfl,1389035210.0,"We aren't as bereft of talent as many people seem to think. We have strong groups of players on both lines, a pair of excellent corners, great depth at WR and true playmakers in Wright and Hunter, a capable stable of running backs, athletic linebackers, and reasonably good safeties. It's not a perfect roster, obviously, but it's one without many major flaws. Without Locker, we did have a gaping hole at QB, and that obviously had much to do with how the season played out, but given the rest of the talent on the roster, I think it's safe to say that this team underachieved, and in the usual fashion under Munchak: 

* Poor performance in division games, including two inexcusable losses to bad Jacksonville and Houston teams, and blown leads in two very winnable games versus the Colts.  

* Failure to beat good opponents - we did not win a single game this year against a team that finished with a winning record. 

Again, Losing Locker certainly played a big part in this, as Ryan Fitzpatrick was mostly a poor replacement QB despite brief flashes of good play. But time and again, we saw this team get outcoached in critical games and situations. As impressive that it is that we were competitive in virtually all of our losses, there are factors you can point to in each of them that fall at the feet of the coaches: game planning, play calling, clock/timeout management, etc. Munchak isn't totally to blame for all of that - coordinators Loggains and Gray both deserve their share as well - but if he was unwilling to make the changes necessary to try and prevent these kinds of things from happening again, it is probably best to move on from him.

Tell me **how** it's impossible to accept science while believing in a pandeistic God. I've tried to think of a reason, but couldn't. Seeing as you're the one making the claim, it's up to you to demonstrate it."

It got to the point where we were having minor hallucinations because we weren't getting any sleep.  A bit after he turned six months, his doctor said we needed to let him CIO, which we had previously been opposed to.  But parents who are that sleep-deprived are not good for taking care of a baby, not to mention the anxiety it was causing in me.  At first, we'd go into his room to tell him we loved him and we'd see him in the morning, and then we didn't have to.  Within five days, he mostly slept through the night.  He usually wakes up to nurse at 11 or 1, and I usually let him, and then he's asleep until 5 or 6 but will fall back asleep after being nursed.  Not only was this good for mine and my husband's health, but it made our normally cranky son turn into a lively, happy child because *he* needed the sleep as much as we did.  Whenever people ask for sleep help, I always suggest trying this after six months, and I'm always downvoted, but I'll take a happy, healthy baby over an unhappy baby with bags under his eyes any day!

Doctor put it this way: try eating a snack every hour or two at night, then suddenly stop.  Of course you're going to be hungry because you're used to it.  But if you stop eating every hour or two, after a few days, you won't want or feel that you need it anymore.  It's the same with babies.

* Info on how the warping/jumping engines will work.
* Info on boarding, and how to prevent it.
* Info on activities. Wars and battles duh, but what about Transport, Mining, Data  Acquisition(and theft), Recon, Racing, Exploration, etc.
* Info on In-atmosphere activities, both in-ship and on foot.

First things first, try to talk your way out of it. Violence should be the last resort.

If violence is a requirement, here's some pointers:

* Most non-professional fighters throw punches in an arcing motion, in an attempt to strike across a jaw. Lean back to avoid this punch or take a step backwards if your balance is off.
* Never strike a person in the nose, nuts, or choke them from the front - 9/10 times this will enrage them, then you're in real trouble (fight or flight).
* Use the heel of your dominant foot to strike as hard as you can on the bridge of his foot, where you tie your laces, or where the ""tongue"" of the boot meets the side leather. This incapacitates most men, giving you time to escape to safety.
* Use your elbows, not your fists. Extend your dominant arm straight out front, parallel to the ground and make a fist. Bending your elbow, take the top of your fist (where your thumb is) and place it slightly above your opposite side nipple, above the breast if you're a girl, just below the collarbone. Take the other hand and brace your fist. Lean slightly forward. This is the position you'll be in when  making contacting, striking someone with an elbow. Practise on a pillow or similar. Throw all your weight into it without losing balance.
* If you can master the above, add in a step forward behind his feet, so that when you strike, he trips over your foot backwards."

I'll repeat what I said earlier to another redditor: This is obviously an imperfect analogy, but something to consider as an example: If white people suffer more from skin cancer than non-white people, there should be **more** resources available for white people (e.g. sunscreen specifically designed to give higher protection for fair skinned people, affordable sunglasses and hats, more trees to give shade). It's not about blocking non-whites from skin cancer prevention, just providing more support to a group who is disproportionately affected by skin cancer.

I'm from the US and can't speak for China. From what I understand, there's already a law that says ""it's illegal to abuse people"". Breaking this law incurs certain consequences. Adding another law that says ""it's illegal to abuse women"" incurs other consequences. So, if someone abuses a woman, they're faced with two charges instead of one. Adding this additional law and consequence may discourage people from abusing women (since they suffer disproportionately).
It's not that adding one thing subtracts from the other. Of course, if the law that says ""it's illegal abuse women"" **replaces** the law that says ""it's illegal to abuse people"", then we have a problem."

Lees: The stuff that drops out of a mead during and after fermentation - dead yeast, by-products, live yeast, etc.

rack - (verb) to remove the lees from wine/mead/etc. This is usually done by moving the product (in our case mead) off of the lees, into another containment vessel. Conical fermenters allow you to dump the lees from beneath the product - and it's still called racking.

[racking cane](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/siphoning-equipment/racking-canes) - a part of a siphon setup that goes down into your product. Often people (including me) say racking cane when they mean [auto siphon](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/siphoning-equipment/racking-canes/auto-siphon-1-2.html), a simple manual pump that allows one to siphon liquid without sucking on the tubing.

audreyshake,AskReddit,1389035774.0,"When I was in middle school, I figured out how to brew wine. I wasn’t particularly interested in drinking it or getting drunk; I just thought it was fun. Now, I wasn’t about to go tell my parents that their fourteen-year-old was going to be whipping up a few bottles of booze, so I kept it to myself. I didn’t have the proper equipment and knew my mom would get curious if I asked her to drive me to the hardware store for supplies, so I used what I had: Quart mason jars, a turkey baster, Saran wrap, Welch’s grape juice, and bread yeast. I actually had a pretty good setup going, and had sipped my way through a few batches before I let my guard slip. 

Early one evening, while my parents were still awake, I decided that it was time to rack my wine. *Racking* is where one siphons the fermenting juice off of the settled yeast. Normally, it’s done with a narrow tube, but I didn’t have one, so I used a turkey baster. So there I am, siphoning it with my turkey baster and everything’s going fine; I’m not at all concerned about the loud slurping noises it’s making. I thought I heard a noise at my door, but nobody knocked, so I kept going. Suddenly, my mom was asking me something.

“W—what, Mom?”

“Audrey?”

“I’m—I’m really busy right now! Can you come back later?”

“Honey, what are you doing in there?”

“I’m—I’m cleaning!”

“Oh. Well, I need to use the phone. Can you get off the Internet for a little bit?”

Shit. I’d left my computer online. “Oh, sorry!” I yanked my modem cable. “There you go!”

Later that evening, she sat me down at her desk and had a painfully-long chat—without making any accusations—about the dangers of online pornography, and how predators can use porn to lure teenagers. (I have no idea why that would work: When I’m looking for porn, I want to see juicy facials and sexxy lesbians, not have awkward cyber sex with strangers!) It wasn’t until later that I realized that no, she hadn’t thought I was watching porn because I was online: She thought that horrible slurping noise was me doing myself to porn! *Cringe.*"

halfwaythere88,loseit,1389035792.0,"This is what I try and really hit home to people. You. Must. Count. Everything. If you count your meals, but take a handfull of M&amp;M's here, a few chips there, a few crackers here, a few bits of extra butter there, you are eliminating your caloric deficit! So many people have told me ""Why am I not losing weight!?"" and it almost always comes down to this ""sneak a bite or two here and there, off the books"" behavior. 

I also have told a lot of people over the years about my ""One extra piece of toast"" example. The average piece of toast is 100 calories or so. If you eat one extra piece of toast a day, and it puts you over your daily burn by 100 calories, in 5 years, you will have put on 50 lbs. In 10 years, you will be 100 lbs overweight. So I started getting fat at the age of 7. I'm 25 now. So I had 18 years and I put on 120 or so lbs of excess weight. In 18 years, one extra piece of bread a day would have put me at 180 lbs overweight (AKA 320 lbs). So I got to 270 lbs by eating LESS than 1 extra piece of bread a day. If I had eaten one, I COULD have been 320 lbs by age 25. Is that not STAGGERING?! "

The chicha I'm talking about (often called *chicha jorada* or *chicha blanca*) is a fermented beer, and you'll never find it in a supermarket. Even in Peru you won't find it in stores, you generally have to buy it from the person brewing it directly, at their house.

What could possibly be better? 

Sleep. You have to make a choice: either sleeping well or watching movies as comfortably as you can.   If your brain gets the idea that the bed is for watching television, that's what it will expect when you lay down in bed.  You're thinking, ""why can't I get to sleep?"" and your scumbag brain is thinking, ""where's the movie?  I was told when we do this there would be movies.  Maybe if we stay awake a movie will eventually happen.""

Once you're used to the bedroom being only for sleeping you can make *exceptions*.  Tonight you'll watch a movie on the laptop while lying in bed. Or read a book. Browse reddit.  But it can't be a *habit* or *routine*.  Don't bring that television back in, because it will start as ""once in a while"" and then it's ""one night a week"" and suddenly a ""few nights"" turns into ""every night"". 

But I'll let you in on a secret. Once you do this, your scumbag brain won't let you watch that movie or read that book.  You'll lie down and now it says ""I was told there would be sleep. You are going to sleep *now* motherfucker, whether you like it or not."""

Without a doubt work on the 100, which is far far closer to a record.  Especially as a junior.  Now of course, sprinting requires strong arms and I don't want to discourage you from throwing. So lift weights and throw on the side but focus on the 100.  After you break the record, which you probably will, then focus on the the discus.  Having thrown the discus on a the side a little bit, you'll be not-too out of practice for when you get back into it.  Of course you might instead set your sights on something like the 200 in which case I'd say go for it."

I fully agree with the spirit of the opinion which is that too much abstraction from your diet means you lose touch with the ethical implications of your diet. But that's a stupid way to say it. That's like saying:

&gt;    ""You must be able to build a microwave in order to use it""

The entirety of human society is based on specialization. Even if we were all willing to kill our own cow to make a hamburger it's incredibly inefficient from a number of perspectives.

Therefore, they need a picture of you inside the intersection when it is red as well as behind the line of the intersection when it is red to have 100% proof that you entered on a red light.

They do this by monitoring incoming speeds when the light turns red. If you're driving 20-30mph about 20 ft from the intersection it trips the camera to take multiple pictures.

MusicMagi,todayilearned,1389036166.0,"Shin Dong-hyuk gave testimony of human rights abuses inflicted on him or witnessed by him as prisoner in Kaechon camp:

When he told the guards his mother and brother attempted to escape, Shin was thrown into a small underground cell, where it is impossible to either stand or lie down, and was kept there and tortured for eight months.

Shin described how, at the age of 14, he was completely stripped, his legs cuffed and hands tied, and suspended from the ceiling of his cell. His torturers then lit up a charcoal fire under his back and forced a hook into his skin so that he could not struggle.

He still has a number of large scars from the burned flesh and from many other abuses.

Later Shin was forced to watch the execution of his mother Chang Hye-kyong by hanging and his brother Shin Ha-kun by firing squad.

When Shin worked in the garment factory and accidentally dropped a sewing machine, the foreman hacked off his right middle finger just above the first knuckle as punishment.

Shin witnessed dozens of public executions each year. 

Another prisoner Kim Yong witnessed around 25 executions in his section of the camp within less than two years.

Shin saw a six-year-old girl in his school being beaten to death for hoarding 5 kernels of corn.

When Shin was 12 years old, he was separated from his mother and was rarely allowed to see her. Instead of attending school, the children had to do all kinds of physical work including weeding, harvesting, and carrying dung.

Between the ages of 13 and 16, Shin was forced to do dangerous construction work and saw many children killed in work. Sometimes, four to five children were killed in a day. On one occasion, he saw eight people killed by an accident.

Shin’s cousin was raped by prison guards and died later and when his cousin’s mother wailed, she disappeared and was never seen again.

Shin saw how twelve fellow prisoners were given toxic water for washing by the guards and got seriously ill within a week and then disappeared.

When Shin escaped through the high-voltage electric fence surrounding the camp, his friend Park Yong-chul got electrocuted and died because of it.

Massive human rights violations, and we're still shooting people in Afghanistan."

ctesibius,motorcycles,1389036607.0,"Firstly, put in a budget for luggage. If you have hard panniers and a top box locked to the bike, it will handle better, be more comfortable for the pillion, and you will be less worried about leaving the bike parked when you go to look at something. If you get something like the Givi Monokey system, you can move it between bikes.

Any of the bikes you mention would be fine, but I'd suggest that lighter (e.g. the Sprint) would be easier to handle and more fun. Make sure you can get both feet flat on the ground, as you will have a lot of weight on the bike and not much experience at this stage. It would be a bit embarrassing to fall at a junction. Unless your wife is very tall and muscular, I'd cautiously suggest that she doesn't attempt to ride the bike herself with you and the luggage on it.

A couple of other ideas: firstly, have you thought about a Bonneville? I really like mine for touring. I've added a screen, satnav, hard luggage and a gel flat seat intended for the Triumph Scrambler. It's more basic than the models you are considering, but that makes it easier to modify.

The other ideas is more of an economy suggestion, thrown in for interest rather than because I think you will go for it. Have a look at the early (90's) modern Triumphs, particularly the Trophy and the Sprint. They are very cheap these days, and have engines that were built for reliability above all else. My current Daytona 1200 (which has a higher-tuned version of the engine) has just shy of 70,000 miles and is still running sweetly. They tend to be fast, heavy (possibly a problem), comfortable, and rather plain in appearance. "

Serae,childfree,1389036686.0,"I read through other comments so I could get a better idea of your situation.

Since you have a guest right now and can't seem to find privacy I would suggest going out to a coffee shop with a lab top or phone.  Bring a notebook to take comes notes.  Enjoy a light meal or something together.  This is a time to be very close and honest with each other.  Write out pros and cons and make sure that you both did everything you could to prevent this (which is doesn't seem like you had before).  Make a list of options, planned parenthoods, clinics and have the list ready.  Also discuss other forms of BC with one another.

I have had a crazy time with BC of all sorts, but I am still on one even if it's hell.  If your wife refuses to seek alternatives or try something new (which she hasn't really) then you need to look into something else yourself.  You mentioned you want a vasectomy...so why hasn't it been done yet?  Make appoints at a half dozen different specialists.  Keep going until one says yes, and then have it done.

Pick up a pregnancy test together.  I am on the pill, have one ovary and a health condition that would make it very unlikely I'd ever get pregnant.  I still have a batch of tests in my closest that I use if I am a few days off.  It's better to know then wait around asking if you should even check.  Have her pee on it first thing in the morning.  

If it is positive contact your local planned parenthood.  They could do a blood test to additionally confirm and can give you proper advice on where to go in your area.  I have never had an abortion but have looked at it in case it is every something I need to do.  I have heard prices anywhere from $300-700.  Don't just balk at the price, it is still cheaper than a child, the fees for giving birth even if you adopt out, and the general care of pregnancy.

If an abortion is go: be there for your wife.  Find out if you can hold her hand during the procedure.  Let her decide (if the timing is right) whether she wants surgical or non-surgical.  She will be informed of this at the clinic you choose (or should be). Take a few days off of work, rent, DL or whatever some movies or tv shows.  Be supportive and be there for her.  As scary as it is for you, it's probably going to be much more scary for her, especially after her own personal trauma.

Best of luck!"

With a more scientific approach, if we take out the three outliers on each end of the spectrum, (Louisiana, Alabama, &amp; Oklahoma on the high end, Maine, Minnesota, &amp; Massachusetts on the low end), I get the U.S. state average at 404 p/P.

Either way, yes, the U.S. rate is so high mostly because of Louisiana's rate.

Edit: I'll be honest, none of the numbers seem to agree. [On Wikipedia,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_incarceration_rate) it *says* the U.S. has 506 p/P in the chart, but later on down it says 754 p/P.

Glistening body parts and flushed cheeks? Sweaty, saliva-soaked semen spurts. And that's exponentially multiplied if you ride the red tide or take the dirt road home.

danhakimi,Android,1389036897.0,"But this effect holds no more for videos than it does for articles. But you're not suggesting that we turn /r/android into self-post-only. Reddit is meant to work by links.

Links are more convenient to deal with in a few ways, whether you're using RES or not. Mainly, when you click the link, you expect to get what's being posted, not a page that links to what's being posted -- that's an extra step of annoying. With RES, the extra page becomes an extra click to show the self post, and then the video content. Again, more annoying.

This policy prevents reddit's repeat-thread-protection-system. You might see an MKBHD video posted twelve times because nobody was allowed to post it directly, but rather write a self post that was just a link to it.

What's more, this policy really encourages linking to ""blogspam"" (a term I think is almost always misused), just to get karma. All you have to do to earn points for a video find an article that is nothing but an embedded video. I feel like I see a lot of  those. How is it not infinitely better to just link straight to the damn video?

I get that people like videos, that they're easier to deal with than articles, and that they'll get a disproportionately large number of upvotes. But they're going to get those upvotes anyway. It's really silly to try to ban a type of content to arbiter karma in a way you think is fair."

Obviously there's a chance that this could lead to health problems later on down the road for you. But only a few of the strands of HPV cause any problems. (Unknown to a lot of people is that roughly 95% of things that can be classified as STD's are totally harmless. So we don't really talk about them.) So the odds are in your favor here. But even if you are unlucky here there are preventative measures. You can be screened for the issues and find them before they become serious. "

The problem was that usually when we brought someone from the alliance in a run (not limited to SNOW), they ended up being absolutely terrible..

I was always a nice guy, and very patient, don't worry, I also rarely raged at people. The only reason I would ever get mad is when I would tell someone to do something, or not do something, explain why they should or shouldn't do that specific thing, and they ended up doing the opposite of the thing I explained a minute earlier. Other than that, people fuck up, mistakes happen, no big deal.

The thing I liked about Zraw though was that no one cared about who you were, what your personality was etc, as long as you were a competent player. There were a lot of nice people in there too though.

I don't have any builds for UW and I never did YUMway, because it looked like absolute shit to me. I still have some active friends in the game though, but I don't really have time to log on and check them out for you, unfortunately."

Escarole_Soup,loseit,1389037120.0,"Most foods can fit into a ""diet"" as long as you control the *portion*.  Portion is key.  It helps to cut out particularly calorie-dense foods, but I look at calorie counting like this:  You have a calorie budget of, let's say 1500 calories.  It's your choice how you want to spend them.  You can blow all 1500 calories on a ridiculously large piece of cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory and a side salad if you want, if you feel like you'll be okay with that for the day.  You can also spend a few hundred calories at a time throughout the day with some grilled chicken here, a handful of almonds there, a piece of fruit, etc...

It's also going to naturally be easier for people with a higher calorie budget.  I'm a 5'3"" girl, and my budget given to me by MFP and other apps is never more than 1200-1300 calories.  I've seen some people be given more like 1800, or even over 2000.

It could mean anything. I had some close lady friends in college and we talked about all kinds of stuff, including sex.

If she has a bf, I'm not wasting time asking her out.

No. He did not. [What you are seeing is the erosion of fair use.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz_v._Universal_Music_Corp.) You see, big media companies hate fair-use; they often try to get it removed. Their perfect world is on in which there exists no fair-use at all, as it's more profitable. 

So, what happens on YouTube? YouTube has an automated system to make things easier on Big Media to remove content that Big Media deems as infringing. Big Media, however, uses programs to determine this, which are often wrong. In fact, this scenario has happened a few times: 

* User creates content somewhere
* BigMedia uses content without permission (which for the record is illegal)
* User decides to post content on YouTube
* BigMedia claims it's their content, and gets it removed

Most of these abuses are done under the DMCA -- Digital Millennium Copyright Act. You can read more about how awful it is [here](https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-under-dmca).

Those people are a minority. Look at the numbers of the population that are muslim or christian or anything. Look at how many people there are that practice those religions. How many of them are REALLY insane? there are probably quite a few but they are a tiny group of people in comparison. Just like there are quite a few insane atheists but they dont represent all of them.

The problem is you hear about the terrible shit. 

Even now I have seen some disparaging of this thread about Islam. This dude is a psychopath and so was his wife. Does that make Islam a violent and crazy religion? No it makes these two human beings terrible people. 

So many atheists here on reddit spend so much of their time trying to convince everybody that you can be a good person without being religious. Yet all I hear from atheists on here is hate and religious bashing. As an atheist I'm embarrassed by the comments here.

Lionstrong,explainlikeimfive,1389037603.0,"There you go. That is a more accurate answer. The simple reality is that once America committed to using military force, that was it. America cannot just disengage. It's not like someone can say ""oops"" and immediately reverse course. This is warfare. It's international politics and power. It's about perception. It's about commitments. It's about resources. These are **all** taken into account. There are pros and cons. If the pros outweighs the cons, war is more likely. 

Look at it logically: Iraq was a dictatorship where Saddam Hussein was one of the few leaders of the world to respond *positively* to the 9/11 attacks. There was faulty intellignece that said not only was Saddam sympathetic to the terrorists, but having had the previous capability to construct chemical weapons be proven due to his gassing of the Kurds, there was a high likely-hood that he would pass those weapons along. Intelligence overestimated his military capability but post 9/11 America was looking for people to kill. We couldn't get Bin Laden. One invaded country wasn't enough. Afghanistan was spoken about as **literally not having enough targets to hit**. 

If there was ever a perfect storm of opportunity, will, and coincidence to invade Iraq, liberate it's people, and secure Saddam's weapons that was it. Hindsight is 20/20 but the reality is the America was attacked. Heavily and overtly. It was decided that America needed an disproportionate response to the attacks. Saddam should have not have sandbagged the Bush administration. He should have allowed immediate access to inspectors. 

Saddam was trying to preserve his power by standing up to America, which is entirely understandable in international politics because he thought there would be sanctions, there would be cajoling, etc. Exactly what happens with North Korea **which is the norm when dealing with rouge states and dictatorships**. This is an extremely common way of interacting internationally between nations that are at odds. 

The problem is that immediate post 9/11 America was *spoiling* for a fight. Leadership was looking to take a swing at anybody who would be stupid enough to blatantly tell America to ""fuck off"". Saddam was interacting with America thinking that we were operating under a similar level of understanding but he completely misread the American mentality at the time. "

I saw you here in Charlotte at a comedy show a few years before Seinfeld, after I saw you on The Tonight Show, and that remains one of my favorite comedy shows ever. I got into Seinfeld in syndication when my son was born in 1992. I hadn't watched much TV as an adult before that, then he needed to be held just about every minute, even while he slept, so I would sit holding him, and watch Seinfeld. There is something so wonderful about that time, about discovering your show and really relating to it, and being with my newborn... I started watching every Thursday, too, actually scheduling my time around your show. 

I won't go into all the challenges we've had as a family, so I'll just say, laughter is so, so healing; I'm so appreciative of what you do &amp; what you've brought us. My kids have seen Seinfeld here &amp; there and always enjoy it.

You've got it 100% wrong.

Reddit's opinion on mods is laissez faire.  Whoever creates the sub is the owner, period. it's nothing to do with ""want"" anything. it's essentially ""almost anarchy""

the only way people are demodded is:

1) they become so inactive that someone makes a /r/redditrequest request to take over the sub and they grant it due to inactivity.

2) they break some rule of reddit as a whole and get banned from the site

 FWIW, if you're riding a motorcycle with no helmet and crash, odds are you're not going to require medical attention. You'll end up in the morgue, not in a hospital room.

Moreover, we have no National Health Care system, so it's really a burden on the local hospital inasmuch as they have to keep you from dying if possible. 

Seatbelt laws are everywhere except for New Hampshire. Everywhere else they're mandatory. 

Helmet laws vary by state, and it's roughly a 50%/50% split. As mentioned above, crashing without a helmet is a real easy way to die.

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389037798.0,"Well, they had pack animals, llamas. Llamas can only carry about 60 pounds of weight on their back, so you can't ride them (well, kids can), but they used trains of llamas for trade. And no, there were no wheels, but most of the Andes (even the relatively flat coast areas) are very hilly and most roads would have needed steps, so wheels don't make a lot of sense anyway. They could have been useful in parts of the coastal valleys, but there's no evidence that they were used. Llama trains and just walking were perfectly effective, and there was probably some trade using small boats up and down the coast itself.

As for how they built things like Machu Picchu (or [Sacsayhuaman](http://www.world-mysteries.com/mpl_9_giant_stones_Sacsayhuaman.jpg) is even more impressive), don't forget that these things are built *on* mountains. They don't have to haul the stone up from anywhere, the mountain is stone, and the quarries are right there. They probably used log rollers to move the larger stones (and most stones at Machu Picchu aren't very large. Most stones could be carried by one or two people), and they also cut a lot of things just out of the rock, like the [Intihuatana](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTdq9vG9y7ptlefJOIhP_6NFKTOxUoe8HJsc7zJ6uwzhmyOWZvM).

Summary: Lending standards are getting stricter. They're now taking into account or requiring proof for more things (income validation, child support payments, etc). Stricter debt to income ratio - if your total debt *payments* would exceed 38% income it would be denied. Stricter checking of credit scores.

Generally, if you were well qualified for a mortgage before, you should remain so; but if you were borderline it may be problematic.

Many others have mentioned it, but writing is always the best catharsis for me. No one has to read it but you, and if you do ever find yourself in a difficult conversation, having written your feelings down can really help you express yourself in the moment. 

Personally, the way I've tackled this (and other things) is knowledge. I've found a good balance between asking Dr. Google and finding credible sources. Things like temping and charting, seeing an RE (and the validation), taking prescriptions, etc help me feel like I have some sort of agency in what would otherwise be a process that's totally out of my control. 

I make a conscious effort to see the silver lining when I can. It's hard, but I force myself. I let myself feel all the bad stuff, then literally tell myself, okay that's enough, what's the bright side here?

I think it's perfectly healthy and normal to have some trepidation over giving birth.  If you didn't--that's great for you, but you'd be the first person I've ever heard express this opinion.

I also don't think that being afraid of giving birth and finding birth to be empowering are mutually exclusive.  A person can both be afraid of giving birth and enjoy it or look forward to doing it again.  I had a traumatic, high risk birth experience that could easily happen again if I have another child, but I still plan on having one more (but I can't say I'm not afraid to do it again).  I see giving birth as basically a means to an end; I enjoyed pregnancy much more than labor (and I had hypermesis twice, ended up in the hospital three times, and had two kidney stones during pregnancy).  A friend of mine, though, said giving birth was one of the easiest things she ever did.  It's so different for everyone, that a second baby could cause so many different feelings in different people.

plusoneeffpee,AskMen,1389038231.0,"One example I saw was right out of college. My finace and I had the same degree from the same institution with pretty much the same GPA (difference of about 0.1). We applied for and got very similar jobs in the same institution within about 3 months of each other. I was offered a salary ~15% higher than she was. Same job title, same duties, same institution.

That was almost 20 years ago, though. Things have changed a *lot*. There are still certainly inequality issues, and the pay gap is still very real. But now discrimination goes both ways. For example, our son and daughter are two years apart in school. They have had many of the same teachers. 

Behavior that was accepted with very minor correction (as in quite literally ""don't do that again, OK?"") in my daughter got my son parent teacher conferences; he was even sent to the guidance counselor a few times. In both cases infractions included things like shouting match disagreements on the playground, stories or pictures drawn for an assignment that had a violent component, not paying attention in class, etc. 

He has picked up on it, and it really bothers him. My daughter really does have a problem with resorting to physical confrontation when it comes to settling problems, but my wife and I are the only authority figures that discipline her for it. My son is terrified of getting engaged in a fight; not because he's afraid of the fight, but he's afraid of the trouble he'll get into. 

Don't get me wrong, I like it that he'd rather not fight. He's really good at ending conflicts diplomatically....but he got that way because he didn't get away with it at school *or* at home. My daughter got away with it at school, just not at home.

Girls are discouraged from engaging in certain sports, boys are discouraged from maths. Really; most of my son's friends feel that teachers consider math to be a ""girl thing"". I don't know why it is, but they have given me examples. I can see why they'd think that. 

I work with youth and I'm always looking for adult help with things; most men flatly refuse to help because of very legitimate fears of accusations of sexual impropriety. It is real; I have to take precautions my female colleagues don't. In fact, many of them aren't even aware of the fact that I have to take the precautions. 

So yes, I've seen a lot of it going both ways.....it's just that it is not as simple as women getting discriminated against and men getting whatever they want.

ursei,Frugal,1389038259.0,"It's not because of a dream of home ownership or anything, but you do bring up some questions I have. I bought it mostly because my parents insisted that it was the time to buy, that it was a great investment, that I should get into the housing market while it's low, and that this condo was a little fixer upper in a really good neighborhood that would be worth way more in a few years. So we did it. And it has gone up quite a lot in value already.

My question for you though is, why would it be better to rent something, regardless of it being cheaper or not, because of the fact that you're literally throwing money into someone else's equity, when you could be putting that money into your own equity? Equity is just like a savings account, really, isn't it? I mean of course rents and mortgages will differ and sometimes you could rent a great place that you couldn't afford to buy, but the idea of putting so much money into someone else's equity - over time - seems to me a worse long term choice than to just build your own equity instead. I didn't buy it so much because it's a cute place but because of that growth in value.

Granted I'm super new at this and I should probably read a few books about it. I just take my parents word on it, but in my defense, my parents are really good with money."

meanttolive,todayilearned,1389038276.0,"So I checked out your article and a couple of the sources. 

From your article:

&gt; LOS ANGELES/EWORLDWIRE/Sep. 24, 2007 --- October is domestic violence awareness month. In May 2007, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published its latest study which found almost one-fourth of relationships had violence, about half of which was reciprocal, and the researchers were ""surprised"" to find that ""in nonreciprocally violent relationships, women were the perpetrators in more than 70 percent of the cases,"" and men incurred significant injuries ('http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/42/15/31-a') ('http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/97/5/941').

The first link was moved and the second link was to a 2006 study by people who worked for the CDC at the time and specified that ""The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."" They found, like you said, 70% of domestic violence was committed by women. 

So I looked into some more recent stats from the CDC. I found [this report] (http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf#page=47) from 2010 giving detail into the stats. It found that ~24% of women experienced serious violence from a partner during their lifetime (~29mil). It also found that ~14% of men experienced serious violence from a partner during their lifetime (~15.5mil). Almost twice as many women suffer from serious violence from a partner than men during their lifetime. 

[Here's](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/2010_report.html) the web page where I looked for my sources. So, it looks like women still suffer more from violence than men do. This isn't the oppression Olympics, just statistics. Since women suffer more, I don't see why we shouldn't give them more protection. "

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389038289.0,"By the time the Spanish arrived, the Inca had conquered all of Ecuador and were pretty much at what is now the Ecuador-Colombia border, but they had trouble moving further north. And although they had conquered all of that, it was done very quickly (there was only about 80 years from when the Inca began to expand until the Spanish arrived) and there's no guarantee that it would have held up for long. There were already rifts in the empire and a civil war going on when the Spanish arrived, so societies in Ecuador may well have become independent again and the incursion into Colombia stopped, but who knows what might have happened?

The empire never managed to expand much into the Amazon, and never got anywhere into what is now Brazil, but they conquered huge areas of the mountains and coast. The northwest part of Argentina was conquered, as was northern Chile. Southern Peru and Bolivia can sort of be seen as the Inca heartland (the true Inca heartland was just the Cuzco basin, but societies in southern Peru and Bolivia were fairly similar to each other, and the Inca saw themselves as descendants of Tiwanaku in Bolivia), for reference."

Sighohbahn,Austin,1389038488.0,"You know upon further reflection on this (fucking awesome) comment, it seems like what it really is is the commodification of hip.  It just costs so much fucking money, nowadays, to do anything.   When I was a mere youth living in Austin (many years ago, imagine when the Zendik Farm people still wandered the drag), nothing was too expensive.  Rent was cheap, we got all our fun clothes from thrift stores that weren't completely picked over by vintage stores selling ironic t-shirts for $50.  We saw shows for free, and bought cheap pitchers at Showdown, and it was great. 

We weren't trying to be part of a prescribed ""scene"" and I can't help but think that all of us, the young weirdos from 20 years ago, helped create the scene that is now merely a credit-card swipe away. 

I am guilty of going out to some of the douchey places to eat, and I have myself gotten beers on Rainey, but I am also 35, with a good job, and nowadays, thoroughly uncool.  The problem is when the young people started believing that the older people with money were the ones who were doing the cool shit, instead of the way it should be, which is them saying ""fuck you, you're old, we're gonna do what we want.""  

And thus, the days of the crazy house share on Monroe when that place on Congress was still a porn theater are gone - that great 40s Craftsman-style house is gone, and in its place, another modern ""loft"" area, and in the meantime we idolize people like Liz Lambert who has never been anything but part of the problem. 

Fuck, I mean, I'm part of the problem, and I guess maybe part of it is mourning my lost youth and my lost coolness that seem intrinsically linked to this town.   But the SXSW analogy stands perfectly, and it doesn't matter because people don't care, and we're never going to get either our youth or the city that we lived it in back. "

My main suggestion would be to drop the new creature types, like AesSedai, WhiteCloak, WiseOne, et cetera.

VGiselleH,Supernatural,1389038587.0,"It's more than stubbornness, it's the lack of free will it implies if Dean says yes. Because then it would prove that humanity/the world has no free will and everything has been planned out and will occur as such without deviation. The apocalypse would have been destined from the start where millions or billions would die, and nobody can stop it. Dean refuses to believe that's true, so he doesn't want to say yes. Also, Sam would also need to say yes and then one would need to kill the other, which is kind of not something they would want, lol.

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389038599.0,"Go anywhere in Peru and you see people chewing coca. Coca tea is everywhere. Coca is legal in Peru (it's only illegal to possess massive quantities of it, because you need something like an entire field of coca to make a kilo of cocaine, so they assume if you have huge holdings of coca that you are making cocaine, or farming it to sell to the cocaine producers. But it isn't illegal to grow or possess, so I think they just destroy large coca fields, not arrest the farmers). So yeah, attitudes towards coca are pretty well intact, it has a very similar role as an everyday, important stimulant that is sort of imbued with sacred value. It's meaning has changed, but it's still important. And the coca leaf is nothing like cocaine. I've never tried cocaine, but the coca leaf or tea has very little effect on me.

Spikemaw,MensRights,1389038631.0,"I think the real issue is that men don't have that bodily autonomy yet. Right now women can choose whether or not they want to become mothers, but a man can only choose whether he wants to have a sex life (since no male birth control is 100 percent effective, no female birth control is 100 percent effective, and men have no rights in family court). Men are essentially in the place women were in 60 years ago: if you have sex, you're risking a lifetime of servitude. Women (as long as they are willing to abort a foetus) don't have that risk.

All of these discussions eventually come back to the fact that modern family and child support law harkens back to a time when women didn't work, or were not expected to work. That's changed, but laws have kept the same focus: making sure the woman has the means to care for the children. But women can work. Women don't have to be the primary childcare-giver. Women don't even have to have children!

I'll always support women's right to an abortion, but I think that female bodily autonomy needs to be balanced with male bodily autonomy. And male bodily autonomy is a more complex issue in some ways, it includes more than just sexual autonomy; for example the draft, workplace injury and death. Women have achieved autonomy (or have been gifted it by society, in the case of the draft and workplace death, they just aren't expected to kill themselves with dangerous work or to fight wars), though I certainly don't expect (or would want) them to stop fighting to keep that autonomy."

I own my board but I also ride a lot. 30+ times a season. Which means in one season I could have easily paid off my board, nevermind the fact I'll ride it for several. So how much do you ride? 

Quality; I find that rental boards tend to have a little bit shittier quality. I found the board I wanted with the right technology in it and size and I love it. 

Every board is different; Switching boards every time to me would mean that I'd have to get used to the way it handles every time. 

Time; the amount of time wasted in a rental shop every single time I went out would drive me up the wall.

To me, at least, I can't imagine renting every single time I wanted to go out. Sure I spent a great big chunk of money all at once to get my gear but I would have spent way more in time, energy, and money if I was renting."

Basically you can think of it as a liquid that has gone below (or just to) its freezing point, but hasn't actually frozen solid, yet. This can happen if there's not a seed crystal to start the solidifying transition off. When you dropped the bottle either the impact lining up a few water moelcules, or a small particulate in the water caused the whole thing to begin freezing around that point. Due to the already cold enough temperature of the water, the whole thing freezes very quickly.

There's a lot of videos around about this, it's quite a cool trick to see! Veritassium on youtube has a great video on this (as well as LOTS of other very well made and very interesting science videos).

Other feats that come to my mind:
* [Force Storm (Wormhole)](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Force_storm_%28wormhole%29): Basically a storm created using the Force which opens wormholes (i.e. rips a hole into the space / time continuum of the universe).
* [Force Travel](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Force_travel): Something similar to the above mentioned (don't know how cannon that is though ;) ) Let's the user travel far distances using something like a wormhole.

* [Rakata](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rakata#): I'd also place some of their tech to these feats as they created technology which worked by using the Force.

3. You mean, how to get her to be okay with touching you? See if she closes the distance. Do a very, very non-threatening touch like plucking fuzz off her shirt or jostling her shoulder with yours, and see if she touches you back. Or let her touch first.

4. They don't. Again, it's chemistry. It could be the exact same conversation, but with casual touches, lots of flirty smiles and eye contact, and a difference in tone. There's no set phrases that make things sexually charged that aren't clumsy.

5. If they don't appear, then go about your life like everyone else. I can guarantee if you have varied interests, it will be impossible to only have male friends in your life.

I am appalled at the way you were treated. I have worked with urologists before and honestly many of them are exactly as you described -- impatient, don't give a shit, just want to see as many patients as possible for the money (many docs go into urology mostly for the money).

Try to get your ultrasound ASAP. Call the clinic and ask if there are any cancellations. Explain your situation, and beg the receptionist to fit you in earlier. You could also try going to the ER -- they usually set you up with an ultrasound the same day. Since the divets are only noticeable when you are erect, I suggest you take a picture of your erect penis to show to the docs you see. Also, tell them exactly what the size difference is now -- how you measured before and how you measure now.

Finally, I highly suggest you request your medical records from all the doctors you have seen about this, and document everything that is going on in writing and with pictures. Ask for the ultrasound report too, right away. I have a feeling you may end up filing a complaint with the medical board and/or suing over this.

OctavianRex,nba,1389038900.0,"For all Non-Bulls fans this isn't really surprising, and doesn't signal the move to full rebuild people think it does. 

Bulls brass has pretty much scheduled in Boozer to be amnestied prior to the 2014 season since they picked Mirotic in the 2011 draft. They would have definitely preferred to trade him for assets or expirings this year, but lacking that they had no reason to amnesty him until now. The money tied up in Boozers contract was not going to get them a player of even Boozers quality on the FA market due to cap positioning, and they had no way to replace Boozer 20 pts or incessant yelling. 

As for Deng, it was pretty known at the beginning of the season that Deng values his worth about 5mil greater than the Bulls were willing to pay. Deng feels he is worth Iggy money, while the Bulls feels he is worth around 9mil a year, especially with Butler and now Snell playing well. I feel Deng is closer to correct, but I think that's his value to Thib's Bulls not any random team. Pretty much if a deal wasn't reached by All Star the Bulls were going to move to trade Deng for assets unless the Bulls looked like a legitimate contender (similar to how they treated Asik his final year). With Rose out they look like anything but a legitimate contender. 

So why shouldn't everyone freak out? Well because this are not the panic trades of a GM on the verge of losing his job or even a rebuild move. These are planned moves by a front office that has shown ability to build competitive teams with middling players in the past. Boozer should be replaced by Mirotic, who looks fantastic and I believe would be a top 5 pick this year if eligible and consensus number 1 last year. Deng's role will be filled by Butler and Snell who are both promising developing players. Deng should bring some sort of asset for the future while also probably negatively effecting the team short term allowing a better draft pick. Finally the Bulls should be under the cap for the first time in years, allowing them more freedom to pick up players.  "

runningsalami,sweden,1389039106.0,"Det är inte alls skillnad på en ökad respekt eller högre respekt, skillnaden ligger i när man har en ökad respekt mot någon som man inte respekterat särskilt mycket innan eller en högre respekt gentemot någon än en annan. Ett exempel skulle vara att man har högre respekt mot män än kvinnor, ett ojämlikt förhållande helt enkelt.

Jag har aldrig hört att någon säger att de hellre ser en kvinna, HBTQ-person eller icke-vit på posten än låt säga Löfven. Det jag däremot hört är att man säger att det hade varit roligt med mer variation, särskilt eftersom inget riksdagsparti haft en partiledare med utomsvensk bakgrund eller en öppet homosexuell sådan. Riksdagen är till för att representera det svenska folket – den högsta beslutande makten i Sverige – varför vi bör ha större variation, inte bara ett jämt förhållande mellan män och kvinnor utan mellan andra subgrupper också."

MenWhoStareAtG0ATSE,AskReddit,1389039120.0,"Okay I know I'm late to the party, but I hope somebody reads this. Cue Wednesday morning. While I'm at work, my brother sends me a text message asking if its alright for him to borrow my car and vice versa. He's low on money, basically out of gas and needs to get to work. My father and I work at the same law firm and carpooled there, so I told him to leave his car at my house and pick up mine.

Flash forward to Wednesday night. My housemate is throwing a party to herald his impending graduation from college. Two of the girls who show up I've met once before at a bar. We had like a 30 minute conversation, and both expressed to my housemate that they found me attractive. We'll call them A and B. A is a girl of mediocre but passable looks and a very sexual (see: slutty) disposition. B is gorgeous, seems sweet, flirty but decidedly less alarmingly so. We party, everyone has had several drinks. A has been throwing herself at me all night. Sitting on my lap and rubbing on me every time I sit down. Seeking me out and grabbing my arms. Giving me the fuck me eyes. Blah blah. Occasionally B joins along in this sort of behavior, which is totally cool, but only makes A try all the harder. Eventually the entire house is vying for B's favor, hitting on her, complimenting her, so I figure talking to her at all is kind of a moot point until she's no longer the center of the fucking universe. 

I pretty much throw the towel on the whole night. A won't leave me alone, B is like a pinball in a machine from the rebound action of running away from one overly enthusiastic suitor and bumping into the next. Except it turns out A and B are bi, or at least are on this occasion, and she's most interested in flirting with A. I head upstairs, trying to shadybounce up to my room so I don't have to deal with drunk dudes trying to pressure me to keep partying and drunken A following me around like a lost kitten. Except she does, only she brings B with her. She asks where I'm going, I say to bed. She declares that she's coming with me. I was about to gainsay her when I noticed a glimmer in B's eye, so instead I said, ""and what about you? Did you come along to join?"" 

She said, ""where A goes, I go.""

Okay so this just went from a really mediocre night to potentially the coolest of my lifetime's sexual exploits. I go to my room. Five minutes later A follows me up, with no B. Five minutes after that, B follows her up. Except A grabs B by the wrist and they go downstairs together. Then A comes back up. Alone. Fucking alone. This hoe has pulled the bait and switch on me. At this point I'm annoyed, but we've already been hooking up a bit and I kind of just want to get my rocks off, which is unfortunate because this she is kind of a wack lover and really selfish to boot. She wants to dry hump all night. That's not doing anything for me. After a couple rounds of trying to advance the foreplay past basic rubbing our clothed genitals against one another and being foiled, I decide its time to say fuck it and roll over. That wasn't what she had in mind. What you need to understand is dry humping can be painful for uncircumcised guys. I don't know how it works for our cut counterparts, but too much pull and friction, and not enough slip and slide, and you've just practically torn my frenulum. Which is what was happening, and left me sore for the following two days. She wants to go again twenty minutes later, and I allow it because I think maybe she'll do something differently this time. Nope, only difference is we removed our clothes this time, so I got stubble burn in the bargain. She gets off a few times. I never do. My dick is still sore.

Now I've seen enough and just want to sleep. I work the next morning at 8. At a fucking law firm. I need to be able to think. But she won't get out of my bed, I don't have the nerve to kick her out, and every time I move to reposition myself she starts rubbing up on me for more. I tell her I need to sleep. Nothing changes. When about 5AM hits, I decide I'll just get out of bed, shower, dress, and sneak off to my parents' house for an hour or two of sleep. I have nothing valuable to steal. My room is full of men's clothes and books, neither of which should interest her, so I wasn't worried about leaving her there. I turn on my brother's car to warm it up (this was a few weeks ago. It's cold here.) and go inside to make a cup of coffee. I shit you not, the timing could not have been better in a comedy flick; I come outside and reach for the door handle of my now warmed up car, and the fucking thing *dies on me for lack of gas*. I went on to get no sleep and have a miserable day at work, fiercely cranky the entire time.

**tl;dr: Chick baited me with a threesome and pulled a switch at the last second, dry humped all night, almost tore my dick skin. Tried to escape, getaway car took a shit on me.**"

I used it pretty much non-stop for the first month I had it and it was great. Being able to quickly check if a notification from my phone is important or not from my wrist really is useful, it's probably a bit more so for me as I work in a lab so can't check my phone, but can easily take a glance at my watch. Also being able to control music is a nice feature, and can be quite convenient when driving as I use my phone to play through the car's stereo.

However for some reason I just don't seem to use it all that often, and have gone back to wearing my normal watch. It's a little bukly compared to what I usually wear (I've fairly small wrists though...), and charging it can be annoying, as it's just another device to worry about!

I still feel that holding off on a smart watch might be the best idea at the moment. I absolutely love the concept of them, and can't wait until a company gets it right, but I don't think we're quite there yet. Maybe you could set the money aside and wait until the real breakthrough comes?"

TwirlySocrates,changemyview,1389039272.0,"If you look at brainSize:bodySize ratios, you'll find humans come out on top, with dolphins close behind.

But you're probably right that brain proportions isn't all there is to it.  The relationships between neurons is important too - should we call it our ""hard-coding""? Whatever it is, it allows us to educate one another in ways that squirrels simply cannot function.

I see the difference between squirrels and humans to be analogous to pocket calculators and modern desktop computers. They both run by electrically processing binary information, but the computer has many layers of interpretation between the elementary processes and the output- heck, we even invented the term programming ""languages"". Maybe this analogy is a little extreme, maybe not. I don't understand enough to know - but I think it does illustrate how a human mind and a squirrel mind can be understood as a qualitatively and therefore categorically different thing.

&gt; Furthermore, the behaviour of particles differs completely between quantum scales and macro scales. The language of behaviour in psychology though can be and often is applied the same to humans as it is to other animals.

I agree with you. I only take issue when people try to describe humans exclusively in terms of animal psychology. For example, a description of art or science in terms of animal behavior would severely restrict the understanding and scope of the discussion."

Plenty of couples have disagreements on faith and belief and are fine with disagreement, but in a lot of cases it creates a rift between the couple that just can't be overcome easily.

I'm a nonbeliever, and I'd be okay with dating a Christian, provided that she is okay with me being critical, disagreeing, and is open to philosophical debate and arguments. In fact, I would find that incredibly attractive provided that, at the end of the argument, we can let the discussion go and not take it personally. I expect somebody to challenge me and push me back on what I think and I expect to do the same for somebody else. I know what I believe and I'll stand up for it, but I don't know everything. My opinion doesn't make me superior to anybody else.

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389039403.0,"This is a somewhat tough question because there were only about 40,000 Inca and they conquered a very large and diverse area and spread their own customs, language, and economic systems (and these were perpetuated by the Spanish somewhat who showed up to areas that the Inca had conquered within the previous few decades and were in the process of consolidating and assumed that these were just the way the entire area was. And archaeologists have long relied on Spanish and Spanish-Inca documents to interpret the archaeological record, sometimes pushing Inca models back thousands of years, but this isn't really appropriate and it has served to obscure and taint our understanding of the Andes, somewhat.

But there are some things archaeologically that are common all over the Andean region and for a very long time. For one, the Inca Empire was only the last of three separate times when the entire region seemed to be influenced by the same style and apparently interacted heavily, periods that we refer to as horizons (the Early Horizon was about 1000-600 B.C. and is associated with Chavín de Huantar, the Middle Horizon is about A.D. 800-1100 and is associated with Huari and Tiwanaku, and the Late Horizon is Inca from about A.d. 1450-1532). Between these horizons there was a lot more regional diversity and development, but some things are common everywhere.

So a list of things that I can think of that are common to most societies in the Andean region. 

• Ancestor worship
• Monumental temples and palace structures
• U-shaped temples
• The Andean cross (more typical of highland societies)
• *Chicha* corn beer
• Coca
• Llamas for meat and as pack animals, alpacas for their fleece, cotton for other clothing (cotton is maybe more coastal)
• Similar foods overall
• Very long-distance trade
• Comparable pottery forms for fancy, elite pottery

Those are the main ones I can think of right now, but I'm sure there's more. There's a ton of diversity in the Andean region, but also a shared sense of what it means to be Andean. I compare it to pre-modern Europe: there were many languages, independent societies, much artistic diversity, some religious diversity, etc., but there was still a shared continental style so that you could pick out something as characteristically European and differentiate it from something that was, say, Chinese. Same sort of thing happening in the Andes, shared style but also a lot of diversity."

While this is impressive it is kind of dumb at the same time since he decides where the ball ends up at all times no matter where they are instead of having an ultimate goal of either making a pass or actual goal.

No, Redpillschool was dodging the question. It is common knowledge he doesn't believe in spousal rape, but he refuses to admit it outside of his safehouses. 

2) Because in /r/asktrp, most people are met with ""read the sidebar."" Not, ""Read what people may have said about this article."" They want you to take it to heart. 

3) Did I say they were? No. I think you're assuming I feel the same way about red pill as other people you've heard talking about it? Most of them aren't rapists or assailants, but I believe many of them would be if there were no negative consequences except for the hurt feelings of women.

4) Hey, I don't disagree with you. You asked me to point out how red pill is focused on casual sex and I told you.

5) Actually no, men have innate value according to the article I linked:

&gt; Men are taught from a very early age that in order to be valued in society, they need to bring value to the table. Men focus and hone crafts, trade skills, personality for sales, strength for labor, and a myriad of other value-adding traits.

Do you suppose you should deserve an equal amount of value in the eyes of all if you do not provide something valuable? Or are you making the very simple mistake of believing that having a vagina has somehow equated you to these things?

Basically saying that women who value themselves are only doing so because they have a vagina, not because they have a useful trade or skill. Which is silly, most women do.

&gt; Ask any psychologist. They'll tell you unconditional love is only healthy in the context of a parent-to-child relationship. NOT in a LTR. It's very dangerous in the latter.

I didn't say if it was good for you, I said it was possible. The Red Pill disagrees.

&gt; TRP also recongizes that men can cheat as well, and anybody posting that they wilfully cheated in a monogamous relationship is downvoted or called out on their shit.

In your contouring post, people really need a series of pictures for contour CCW in my opinion.

One I remember was WIST - Women in Sport Touring. I couldn't find it quickly, so I'm not sure if that one is still running, but I'll try to find out. There are usually a few bikes that work well - for instance the XV535 used to be popular about 15 years back and might be worth a look. Before that, the Moto Guzzi V50 and the Honda CB400F were rated. These are long in the tooth now, but if you can find one of these mailing lists they will be able to advise on what is good now. Grey market imports from Japan are worth a look - these are generally 400's, about 3 years old, and tend to be be lower built than the official exports.

In part it's a question of experience. The Bandit will always be large for you, but eventually you will be comfortable with only getting one foot securely on the ground. This is partly about planning ahead. For instance when you stop, you can make the bike lean to the left by turning the bars very slightly to the right as you stop. This means that you only need to get the left foot on the ground. You may also find that wearing riding books with spiky heels helps to give you a couple more inches of reach."

I know, a parent working christmas blew me away too.

 Guess what? Taking one for the team and helping out even though he was in the first place to bitch got him first dibs on vacation for the rest of the year. The whole team unanimously agreed to let him schedule his first and we would work around it.

None of this ""waah what about the children i'm a parent"" bullshit like we're just supposed to give people what they want because they made the choice to pop out kids.  No, my coworker earned his vacay. That is the type of parent that i am willing to fuck with my vacation over. Not one who thinks they are entitled to days off just for breeding."

I cried one night convinced I was to fat and awkward for someone as cool as he was. Older more attractive girls thought he was just as cute and would hang on him. This past year my mother and brother ran into him at the beach with his girlfriend. They told me she was identical to me. My brother spoke with him some to catch up on life. He told him I was his first love and he really missed me when I stopped going to the rink. At the time I made a friend who hated it there so for her sake we found something else to do.

citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1389039794.0,"&gt;&gt; but it doesn't necessarily provide the emotional/intellectual tools that the average, nonscientific person needs to ""live in reality"". 

&gt;I think you doing the average, nonscientific person a disservice. We have examples of modern societies where virtually no one is religious. How do you explain this?

Really?! Which ones?

&gt;Also, religion in Western countries (even the US) is on a sharp decline. Again, how do you explain this?

They have found tools other than religion. Notice how I never said it was the only tool?

&gt;&gt; but it does provide a lot of people with the tools they need to live in reality.

&gt;What tools? Ignorance? Hatred? Jealousy? Intolerance? What tools does religion provide that one cannot simply think of for themselves?

A social support structure, for one. That cannot generally be had on one's own. Name one religion whose central tenets are ignorance, hatred, jealousy, and intolerance. Just because you don't find any tools for living in religion, doesn't mean nobody else does. They **obviously** do.

On the other side of the coin, how many people get their emotional tools for living from science? I'd hazard a guess it's insignificant compared to religion. The average Joe and Jane couldn't give two shits about science and are horribly misinformed about it (how often do we hear scientists bemoaning the abysmal state of science journalism). 

Sure, science describes reality well, but for the average person, science is rarely the mentor that helps them face the emotional or intellectual challenges they face in life. The only people I can imagine science doing this for are atheists and scientists themselves."

Well it is true we don't get to take home ammunition although it is (as far as I know) fairly easy to buy ammunition. 

It is only difficult to get a weapon because we have strict laws about who can get one and you also have to have a license (which requires you to not have committed any offenses, especially concerning violence and other crimes, in the past).

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,getdisciplined,1389040236.0,"Very good advice! I use pain killers and opiates in order to treat a chronic pain condition and my doctor gave me very similar advice when I started. I asked about tolerance and he told me that only happens with the ""buzz"" of narcotics. If you use them to decrease pain, that property won't diminish. But the buzz will wear off so I should view the medicine in terms of absence of pain, not how ""great"" I'm feeling.

Using this mindset I have been able to take many narcotics and not increase my dosage in 10 years. In fact, they have allowed me to keep up a exercise schedule that has then helped relieve the pain and thus take less medication.

Mr_Clovis,AdviceAnimals,1389040242.0,"I was spanked and slapped as a child and I would like to never do the same to my own children.

Maybe it's because I never, ever felt like I actually deserved the punishment. I don't think it taught me anything except to become more closed and introverted. My father was rather abusive and I was always so fearful of doing anything wrong that I literally never did anything bad or even risky. I never disobeyed, I never talked back, I never even cursed at my father before I was 18. Any time he hit me was out of his misguided sense of justice and I basically lived my childhood constantly resenting him for how unfair he was.

So I'll be avoiding hitting my children. I'm sure there are effective ways to educate them without resorting to that."

alk3v,truegaming,1389040263.0,"Reading through all the comments here I see that this is really, really subjective. There's ultimately a trade off here, and good games can come from either path. It is rare to see a game with both. 

On one side: forced branching makes dev studios expend resources on assets, storylines and gameplay that not all players will play. You can end up seeing very solidly made titles, but completely linear experiences. Insert your Half-life 2, Last of Us, Bioshock references here.  


On the other: games are an interactive medium and ""shouldn't"" be a linear (shouldn't in quotation marks). Choices can matter, and when done correctly is a whole new experience than your cookie cutter linear and scripted gameplay path. This can be done to great effect for cinematic experiences.


Honestly I see both as valid, but I have to go with the fact that a well branched out game can seem more complete. There was that sense of regret and anxiety in The Walking Dead where I felt like every decision I made counted and by the end of it, I felt like each mistake came back to haunt me. I racked my brain over the ending, could I have changed it with better choices? Now that was a completely new feeling and it was amazing. Then I read the wiki and it was gone. Convergence which saves dev resources ended up destroying that precious feeling. Nothing I did mattered. Playing Renegade Shepherd or Dark Side Revan had minimal effect on storyline. Replayable but no consequence. 


And finally, what happens when choices can be made with consequence? IMO the only examples this has happened for me have been select visual novels (including other 'point and click' branching adventures) or one or two higher budget exceptions. The latter is such an expensive and risky endeavor I'm not surprised many meet this criteria nowadays. You sacrifice gameplay for this branching, thus many of these are visual novels as opposed to fully fledged, heavily interactive games.  


TL;DR: Both linear and branching have their merits. There's 3 options: polished linear, branching with no consequence and branching with consequence. The third is awesome, but so dev intensive it is almost a fantasy as it seems impossible to fund. The middleground that we end up settling for is branch convergence, and upon replay the curtain falls when you realize it is a shallower experience than it appeared to be. "

ProffieThrowaway,AskReddit,1389040268.0,"I have a related question for flight attendants.....

On a flight from Cleveland to Pittsburgh earlier this year I was in a tiny plane (one column of single seats and one column of two seats) and the fellow on the opposite side and one row back had two seats to himself. I believe he used them to masturbate. 

There was a lot of turbulence so drink service was stopped and never happened. During that time (when the flight attendant wasn't walking around for her own safety) he was arching his back and moaning loudly--and it seemed sexual. I tried not to look. He stopped. We landed....

And I honestly had no idea what to do. Pass a note to the flight attendant and be like ""I think that guy may have been masturbating? Can you make sure he doesn't follow me or any other woman here immediately into the terminal?"" I mean.... wtf do you do in that sort of situation? Suggest they burn the blanket he was under? "

Natural minerals you only really have Sapphires, Rubies, Peridot (Gem grade Olivine however over a period of many lifetimes this will weather to clay and iron oxides). These are all rarer than diamonds in a geological sense. Then there's Topaz. As a general rule whatever your looking at I would google the minerals Mohs scale of hardness number and wouldn't go below an 8.

Lab made: Moissanite generally is your best bet as a lot of the people in the thread have said it's hard and shinier than almost anything else out there.

The likes of Opal, Pearl, Amethyst, Emerald are all amazing for people who don't wear a wedding ring every day and only at fancy occasions. I would however say the risk at having anything 7.5-8 on the Mohs scale isn't that big so look as your not looking for it to be an heirloom 4-5 generations on."

incogito_ergo,leangains,1389040419.0,"Subjects did not have to comply 100% (10% variance was considered 'acceptable' compliance, and this was based on self-reported consumption, which is notoriously inaccurate in the 'obese people with metabolic syndrome' population, as seen in 'I eat 500 calories/day but don't lose weight' syndrome).  Ostensibly diets were isocaloric and identical macros, but this was in no way guaranteed.  2.5x weight-loss in the breakfast group indicates with certainty that diets were not identical in terms of calories and macros (weight loss is very predictable in a controlled environment).

This would have been interesting if:

1) Subjects diets were strictly controller

or

2) Subjects showed identical weight loss, but differing ratios of LBM/body fat loss and/or different results in terms of markers of health/hormone levels.

3) Numbers were 'restarted' after 12 weeks to allow for the body to adapt to changes in feeding times.

Is it possible that this is significant for obese women with metabolic syndrome? Yes, as that group tends to have severely disrupted hormone levels/insulin/leptin resistance, and circadian signalling plays a major role in leptin regulation.

OTOH, none of that accounts for ~3500 calories/week in magical weight loss for the breakfast group.  What DOES easily account for that is if the dinner group was eating more.

Sorry, I was wrong to cite them. I thought they were city-funded, but they aren't.

&gt; Not a city run service. I would not use it as an example either. There is no enforcement anywhere except small parts of the city, like center city. Just drive north or south on Broad street.

PPA is run by the city, but staffed, mostly by the state. The enforcement area for the PPA is huge. I see PPA vehicles/staff pretty much everywhere that has zoned and/or metered parking. 

Parking in the middle lane on Broad Street annoys the shit out of me, but given the lack of parking in the areas where people pull that shit, it doesn't bother me that it's not enforced. "
michaellicious,AskReddit,1389040460.0,"I feel that in the porn industry white is the preferred color for pornstars. What I've noticed is that most of the time they only cast black pornstars for their dick size because you know the stereotype (even though it's mostly true.) Personally it would be nice if they didn't use black people for fantasy and get them more involved in the main porn scene, you know have them act as a couple or fwb, whatever. I hate that the only types of black gay pornstars are portrayed as barbaric, a thug or a transgender. Oh and thanks for the reblogs, pulled in lots of new followers.

bbrianagnar,AskWomen,1389040691.0,"As one of these women with this fear and anxiety issue, I feel a duty to respond to this question.


It isn't, for me, just a fear of being hurt or things ending badly, it's a large assortment of many other things as well. For one, if I'm really interested in someone, then I'd like to bring them around my friends. My friends are nosy, so when this person stops being brought around by me I will have to answer to them about why it happened and all that. To me, that brings on more than just the hurt of the actual break up or whatever because now I feel embarrassed that I thought enough of this guy to bring him around and it didn't even work out. Then, there's the expectation of getting intimate. The act itself is not what my problem with this is. I'm very wary of opening up enough to people to even get to that point. I've only been with a few men in my time and I would like to keep that number low because of the stigma of having had a lot of partners. It might be irrational, but I fear that someone I would potentially be interested in would have a problem with a girl who's ""been around."" 

Another experience I've had is that I've been dating someone and realize that I've spent time and effort on this person and all they wanted was sex. So, in a way, another reason for my fear would be the fear that a man would be afraid of commitment as well. 

Maybe my fear or anxiety about this isn't really a fear, but a hesitation because I would actually really rather be in a committed relationship, I just want to be sure I've found someone as committed."

I'm not sure why you would show gratitude to institutions that corrupt and obstruct a message, even if they did serve a libraries that preserved documents. 


Besides the fact that I said ""any"" and not ""every"", this is more or less true. Look at Jesus. He was either a free-loving hippie socialist or an doctrine-proclaiming conservative, depending on who you ask.

The author's ""republic"" alludes to the Roman model that American democracy is based on (among others).

Your cultural bias really shows with your last accusation. *Thank Buddha* for us enlightened westerners, coming 2500 years later showing those *false* Buddhists what the *real* dharma is.

Hubris abounds.

Buddy had a CPS issue where his ex was accusing him of molesting the kids. Funny thing, these always happened a week before his birthday and a week before Christmas - according to the ex. 

CPS figured it out after 18 - 20 months of these shenanigans, built up a good case that the mother was not fit for custody, full custody granted to my buddy.  

Once the cash creek dried up, the Mother went elsewhere. She's either dead in a gutter or making some other poor bastard miserable.

ctesibius,motorcycles,1389040784.0,"Yes, 800cc is fine two-up. There will be faster bikes, but do you care? I generally cruise at 80 on the motorway, on the basis of wind noise and fuel consumption, but it will hold 100 one-up with luggage with some power to spare. For the actual touring bit rather than using the motorway to get there, you're probably going to do 40-70. I find it's more difficult to get a bike that is comfortable to ride at low speed than to find one that's comfortable on the motorway. The Bonnie is particularly good at this.

Screens - personally I prefer to have a handlebar screen, and I have a Triumph screen fitted. It doesn't give as much protection as a fairing mounted to the bike, but I've never found that to be a problem. It will have an adverse effect on stability, which is one reason I don't usually exceed the ton on that bike. The advantages are that you are more ""out in the scenery"", and of course it's cheaper and less vulnerable to damage if you drop the bike. BTW, on that point - you're most likely to drop it at walking pace in a town, not lob it into the scenery at high speed. Embarrassing, but if you have black unpainted panniers they will take most of the impact and won't show damage, and you will probably have a scrape on the end of the brake or clutch lever. Faired bikes will be a bit more expensive as you'll probably scratch the fairing. It's worth bearing in mind as missing your footing while parking could add quite a bit to the cost of a holiday.

Coming back to screens - no, they are not necessary for motorways. They are convenient, but I rode for about 15 years without them. You will find that there is a bit of pressure on your neck on the motorway, and less protection from rain, but it's really not a big deal."

'WBG' feels right, in my opinion.  Adding red keeps it relatively cheap, but a much harder casting cost.  I think just adding additional colorless mana to the cost waters down the impact and makes it a less-impactful card.

Dreadbore and Terminate each cost BR, and destroy a creature (or Planeswalker in Dreadbore's case).  Red has plenty of artifact and land destruction, but quite a few creature destruction spells (examples:  Aftershock and Fissure are mono-red, Wrecking Ball is black/red)."

That being said I honestly cant think of any electronic cigarette company I would want sponsoring any sport. Mostly because 1. Most companies by themselves don't have enough money to sponsor. 2. Any company that *is* big enough to sponsor a formula 1 car would generally be owned by big tobacco and **will not** have  electronic cigarette smokers' best interests at heart. 3. By that same point, any company big enough to have the money will usually sell crap disposables or ""cig-a-like"" kits, as opposed to better, cheaper devices.

 I know one indy car is sponsored by BLU cigs, these are notoriously bad to anyone who does it more than occasionally, and the ""SMOKE ANYWHERE!!!!"" mentality that is pushed by many of the bigger companies is actually frowned upon by most electronic cigarette vapers."

Or does he get turned on by being humiliated and dominated? If it's the second /r/femdom and /r/sissies **(BOTH NSFW)** would be good places to ask, if it's the first they still might have some good suggestions on dressing him.

As for other suggestions, have/help him shave or wax his body if he's willing to make a bit of a commitment. Maybe he doesn't want to do that because it would be a noticable difference for a while, but it's hard to look pretty when you're hairy. Even if he doesn't want to shave, make him shower and use female shampoos and body washes and stuff, and afterwards make him use women's deodorant and/or a little perfume so he smells pretty as well."

mr_mooses,spain,1389041266.0,"As a foreigner from the us living in Spain for a year for studies, I whole heartedly dislike the descano lunch break type of working schedule. 

I'm living in Zaragoza which has an amazing erasmus program, and since my classes don't start until 12 or later I usually find myself going out during the week to the discotecas. Unfortunately, Spaniards don't go out until the wee hours of the morning, the clubs are absolutely dead until at least 1:30 and most don't hit their prime for another hour.

I wake up for my class, and after class I'd like to go buy some groceries, or print a buss pass, or do some light shopping. Nope. The majority of the city besides the bars and the bigger stores are closed until 4, and sometimes the smaller ones don't even open back up. This is extremely difficult to work around when I have classes during the morning hours and don't want to miss class to go to a shop. 

I love the idea of having a 2 hour lunch break, working in the morning, break for the afternoon and then continue on later into the night. But I don't like how it's so inconvenient for someone who wants to take advantage of the afternoon to run errands. It's not a big deal that I have to leave my house again later in the evening to try to catch stores for the evening times, but it's certainly something that I don't understand as a foreigner and makes me wonder of it's productiveness.

I prefer QBs who can rush and throw on the run over QBs who are deadly accurate and strong, so I picked up Blaine Gabbert when he had a rating of 80 and I replaced him with my team's QB who had a rating of 85 and eventually Gabbert became unstoppable because I can play him really well. If you're in franchise mode, then the player's potential means much more than the rating. A guy who has an A potential but a rating of 74 should replace a guy who had a C potential and a rating of 79.

Some of the overall ratings are really misleading too. I had a rookie HB rated 78 or something like that and I looked through his stats and his stiff arm, spin move, and ball carrier vision ratings were off the charts. The stiff arm was maxed at 99 and the spin was 95. But he had a speed of like 80 and that's what was bogging him down. I said screw it, put him #1 in the depth chart, and he was an absolute tank."

RJ815,truegaming,1389041402.0,"&gt; more along the lines of skepticism to me

Fair enough, but still, the government and federalism can still be construed as relatively antagonistic towards Marston's traditional way of life. It can be the ""designated villain"" of his story even if civilization and modernization has benefits over the old wild west and may be seen by most as a good thing.

&gt; rather than the Government as a whole

I kind of disagree because it's the argument of ""Is it the dictator's fault or is it the fault of the soldiers and officers who obeyed them unquestionably?"" Sure, Ross personally hounds Marston and is the face of the antagonistic force in the game, but he's helped by federal agents and army personnel in his schemes, meaning they hold at least partial responsibility for their actions even if they were ""ordered to do so"". Furthermore, though it's very speculative, it's possible that it wasn't actually Ross' decision to ultimately kill Marston. The evidence for this theory is that Ross absolutely could've shot Marston dead without anyone knowing right after Dutch commits suicide (even possibly spinning it as Dutch and Marston fatally wounding each other), but he didn't. He honors his word about letting Marston be with his family. It's quite possible that someone higher in the chain of command later ordered him to kill Marston to finally eliminate Dutch's gang for good. It's very uncertain, of course, but the look Ross gives Marston after killing him seems to suggest that he isn't quite happy with what he had to do, like he was coerced into doing it and feels bad about not letting Marston live peacefully (though he at least doesn't kill his family afterward). A little bit more evidence comes from the fact that the FBI still wants Ross to do things even after he's retired, suggesting they put a lot of pressure on him and may be ultimately responsible for putting forth the Marston kill order.

&gt; they could have still had you resume the game with Adult jack without the second ending

While the personality change would be apparent that way, I feel it wouldn't make sense to not have Jack seek vengeance. The *whole reason* Jack became an outlaw is to train himself for one day hopefully meeting and killing the man responsible for his father's death. Simply letting the player be Jack without that part wouldn't make sense, the player would ask themselves why Jack is doing these outlaw things after having no real interest in it before. The duel is the answer, as Jack himself can randomly imply that it's pretty much the only reason for his existence. He looks empty or at least unsatisfied after the duel.

What stands out most is the lack of communication between these two. Despite feeling totally overwhelmed by the situation, OP has strongly implied that she does not like confrontation and that they have never had serious conversation about this problem, even after five months. I would bet he doesn't even know how upset she is.

OP, you're totally justified in being upset about this, but you need to find a way to express it to him. Sit him down and clearly explain why you're disappointed with his behavior. Reassure him that you care about maintaining the relationship but that he is letting you both down. Get him to a doctor to see if he is depressed.

Even if he wants a non-clinical job, there is no reason he cannot work in a clinic or as part of a practice for a year while he looks.

The point is, he finished med school and completed his residency, which is not something you can breeze through regardless of how smart you are. He knows how to put his nose to the grindstone; he just needs a wake-up call. If he doesn't respond to that, then yeah, you should probably start going over your options.

I was bored one night and did some DoA runs a couple of months ago, after 1 run as a spiker, observing the new tactics, I was able to tank on my own (although rusty as well), I tanked so much (over 4 million LB points on tanks alone across accounts) it's all muscle memory by now.

Also, all I'll be able to teach you is DoA, I hardly ever did UW or FoW. But I'm a damn DoA pro though, so I got that going.

But, like I said, I fear that it's going to have to wait until mid february, when my finals are over and I'm back from my holiday.

If you wanna do froggies, an old friend of mine (Revrac, chances are you'll know him) used to do quadruple account froggy runs, where him and his friend would load up 4 accounts each and do froggies all day. He made like 1,500 ecto/week and often got double or triple froggies in runs. He used to have a lot of team builds for speed running dungeons.

karhall,talesfromtamriel,1389041770.0,"* I picked up a copy of Oblivion last spring, having only borrowed my friend's in the past, and I made a new character named ""Julien,"" as that sounded a little less Roman than ""Iulius."" He was an Imperial, had light armor, and used block/blade. As I was adventuring around, I just thought, *I should give this guy a story.* So the story takes place in Cyrodiil because a) my Oblivion character was my inspiration and b) I personally feel that too many of the tales here on /r/talesfromtamriel are based on Skyrim, so I hoped to break the mold a bit and give everyone an alternative to story after story about the Dragonborn.

* I planned the plot extensively as I wrote the first few parts; I think I had formulated the entire storyline (past the end of the pensio and through the ultimate end of the series) by the time I posted pensio XII. Most of the planning happened on my own while I was at work or while I was in bed trying to fall asleep, always in my head, and I never really sat down and set aside time to plan the plot. In terms of hard research for lore and things, I actually did very little if any; most of the lore I have intertwined with the plot is purely drawn from what I remember from reading and playing the games.

Premise 2: healthcare is absolutely essential to modern life.

If I understand correctly, it is the combination of these two premises that is the basis of the argument that everyone should have equal access to healthcare, regardless of means.

However, if I may introduce a third premise:

Premise 3: there are many other such commodities meeting both (1) and (2), including food, water, clothing, energy, and housing.

If single-payer healthcare is the only morally justifiable system, do the same arguments apply to other resources? Are single-payer universal clothing, housing, food, water, and energy the only morally defensible means of distributing those commodities?"

* Inventory Bags 4 and 5 unlocked  


Those are permanent to the character and will remain active after you drop VIP. Benefits that exist only while VIP remains are:  

* All non-Expansion zones, instances and skirmishes unlocked   
* Simple level 20 quest to unlock the Riding Skill for free  
* Enter Ettenmoors (PvP) with normal characters  
* All Monster Classes (PvP) unlocked  
* 500 TP per month   
* Spend Destiny Points  
* Generate Rest XP bonus  
* Wardrobe open to 20 slots

Personally, I'm tired of being flip-flopped on whether or not I should talk about this subject to my partner. I want to get married, and he knows it. He himself tells me that he's tired of me not asking for what I want and then getting resentful when he doesn't figure it out (perfectly fair.)

If you tell him you want to get married, you're just going to freak him out and piss him off! Eheu! Just wait for him to propose; I'm sure he'll do it eventually.* But ""eventually"" isn't a satisfactory answer when it comes to questions of this kind of importance, and I'd like to at least discuss it. No ultimatums, no demands; I'd just like to know if we're on the same page about the subject and that it's going to happen sometime in the near-ish future, not in the anomalous Maybe Someday Possibly future. I'm not trying to be a bad guy here, but marriage matters to me and I don't want to be in a relationship where the possibility is dangled in front of me when he actually has zero intentions of following through.

Back when I used to have the casual sex box checked I would get tons of messages from guys that made it sound like they thought that being male and attractive was enough for me to want to sleep with them. Just because I'm attracted to someone doesn't mean we would have good sex... I need to like someone, and there needs to be decent chemistry. And all that *still* doesn't guarantee good sex!

GreenGemsOmally,AskReddit,1389042004.0,"Your belief, while I disagree on the details, is your belief. I think it's important that you make sure your belief systems are on the same page with somebody that you're choosing to spend your life with.

As for the intellectual disagreement, I just meant that I personally could date somebody with whom I differ on views of the afterlife, provided that we can come to an agreement about our differences. It wouldn't bother me personally if she believed that she was going to Heaven and I was not, as long as it didn't mean she considered me less worthwhile in this life. Not everybody can make that separation, and many don't want to. That's okay, as long as everybody is honest about what they want and believe. I was just stating my personal stance. :)

For you, it's something you believe strongly and that is important to you. I think it's vital to any healthy relationship that you indicate those preferences up front, and I don't think you're wrong for knowing and expressing what you want in a partner and for wanting their belief to match yours. It's not what I would want, but that doesn't mean you're wrong in wanting it, if that makes sense.

Not sure if you quite see where I'm coming from, but I'm paying you a compliment. You know your belief and believe it strongly, and I think you should continue to be honest with what you want. Just know that some of us who disagree aren't awful people, nor do we all think you're clinically crazy or something like that. We just see the world differently and I think we all want to get along in the world peacefully. :)

Lastly, there might be a tiny possibility that the game you are playing cannot be captured in full screen, although I think that might be fixed on OBS (still an issue in Xsplit as far as I know).

We were deeply in love where we had to be together all the time, mushy, cutsie, etc up until 4 years together. 

We split temporarily because he wasn't sure he was ""in love"" anymore though he loved me. One night away and his dad explaining that it comes and goes made him realize waking up without me there was the just the worst and that he did not want to lose me. It made him sick that he was mistaken. 

Then it turned into we love each other, their goals, support their aspirations, love the personality, enjoy each other's company, want happiness for each other, and the above type of love comes and goes. 

I still think he is handsome, when he smirks it makes me weak, when he treats me right I still feel lucky, I love being his date, I'm still proud of him, he is my best friend, I cannot sleep without him, and I still miss him when he is away. 

The feelings you have are natural and happen in every relationship. 

What helped after we got comfortable was date nights (Friday) to give us a reason to dress up and date day (Sunday) where we spend the day together without distractions and enjoying each other's company.

We both agree that now 10.5 years later our relationship is better than it ever was. We have learned so much about each other, been through so much, loved each other so much, learned to communicate better, has better sex, and we have grown individually in ways we both enjoy.

pigeonburger,wiiu,1389042087.0,"It's old school survival horror; you shouldn't be expecting much else. If you like the challenge of trying to move forward while keeping as much of the scarce ressources you get, you'll like it. Just don't expect it to be an action shooter. The environments are well made, but a tad repetitive, yes. It is set in a real world city, so obviously there is only so much they can do for variety. The gameplay mostly comes down to this: ""Can you juggle the zombies coming at you with your cricket bat? If not, how little ammo can you use to make it manageable?"" 

As for scariness... Well, that depends on how you define scary. It's not a psychological horror game; don't expect a Silent Hill or Siren game here. It's a zombie game: it's great for jump-scares. The way the motion detector is used is great; it's reliable enough that you *will* rely on it and not be surprised *most* of the times, which makes it all the more unsettling when something *does* take you by surprise despite it. But the game won't be keeping you awake at night.

The replay value is pretty low. It's fairly straightforward, and while you can go back to places to get some more of your crucial supplies, it doesn't really add more content to the game. The multiplayer is a stroke of genius that was unfortunately crippled by being limited to 2 local players.

Despite it's flaws, I liked it. It's a good example of how the gamepad could improve ""normal"" game genres. It's a pity no one but Nintendo and Ubisoft seem to have interest in figuring out how to use the gamepad effectively."

She brought this point up immediately and said it was because her past fuck buddy blew her up with snapchats recently, but she and I both knew that was a shaky leg to stand on seeing as how she could easily dissuade my suspicions by showing me her snapchat history.


She ended up showing me because there was no other way to prove her innocence, and I saw that she had been reciprocating when she literally told me not two seconds earlier she hadn't; lie #1 busted. This led to her argument ""Well it's only stupid things like pics of food and stuff...."" which led to me asking to see her texts, which all led downhill.

Applied to OP's situation, he's already aware she's committed relationship ending offenses, all he needs is a way to bring it up without looking like the bad guy.

mrcleanup,rpg,1389042365.0,"If you know this is going to happen, roll random encounters up in advance. Then work them into your world in a more meaningful way. So instead of just running into some orcs, you can set the scene... A wagon on the road, a dead horse, a missing horse, bloodstains and no survivors... then the orc band camped by the road a ways ahead, fighting over the spoils and dead flesh. Maybe someone is still barely alive and if you rescue them it becomes an escort quest to get them home (maybe the same way the PCs are going and maybe not).

Try and set the scene and turn it into a meaningful part of the environment and not just a random battle.

Wolves may steal a pack in the night that contains food and the PCs may be delayed tracking the remains down once the wolves are done with it, or catching them in the act and scaring them off. It doesn't always have to be combat to the death. Just because it is wolves in this case doesn't mean it is wolves that want to fight.

Roll for random encounters, reroll if you get a result that doesn't make sense, don't roll at all if you know you want to put something in that is story related, and whatever you do, think about what the encounter participants would be doing if the PCs weren't around and use that to give the world depth. So they shouldn't necessarily just find (don't just tell them if it isn't clear), they should spot their camp ahead, or all fail their spot checks and suddenly find themselves right in the middle of it, the sleeping forms sprawled around them (are they bandits? A hunting party? Royal guardsmen? Make it unclear if that can be done fairly and reasonably), and a rustling in the bushes that is the sentry coming back from taking a piss. Don't make it a forgone conclusion what should be done if at all possible.

TL:DR Roll for random encounters in advance, and then design them into the story making them interesting and meaningful, not random."

Basically its like the guy you know who thinks he is a genius because he keeps comparing himself to an obvious idiot. yet he is completely unaware that actually in the full spectrum of people, they are still well below average and the world as a whole is more intelligent and professional , its just they are not exposed to it.

Also, you need to ask her about her sex drive -- has she always had a low sex drive, or is this a recent development? Does she have any ideas for how to increase her sex drive or get more enjoyment out of sex?

Either I--and I think I'm not alone in this--feel like having sex with them that day, or I don't. As for being a jerk versus not being a jerk, that entirely depends on where you are.

1. Cheap bar scene. Being a jerk is advantageous. I can assume you'll be easy to bag and tag and that you'll try too hard in bed because you want to feel like a stud. Excellent. If you want to go home with a girl, that's how you do it.

2. Meet-ups, clubs, dungeons, friend groups in general and conventions. Being a jerk is the fastest way to get you blacklisted. No one cares if you're sexy. Some might still have sex with you, but you'll be ousted before too long and you'll have to find a new hang-out for your hobby. Being a decent guy, making friends and being personable is the way to go if you want to stick around and keep fishing. Also it doesn't matter if you're just nice, a group can sniff out the ""women are inherently inferior"" vibe on you."

* Any Ground Forces in the system with the Van Hauge flagship may act as Fighters for the duration of any Space Combat that takes place in that system. During Space Combat, these Ground Forces are considered Fighters in regards to Action Cards, Anti-Fighter Barrage, and relevant Technology Advances. This means that Ground Forces with the Van Hauge will benefit from Cybernetics but not Gen Synthesis, and may targeted by Anti-Fighter Barrage.

The complaint is that intervention from outside sources, large companies, or governments prevents the usual automatic correction inherent in a capitalist system (ex bailouts, and market collusion). The perfection I believe they are talking about for socialism is a level of incorruptibility unlikely to ever be found amongst flawed humans.

VoxMeretricis,AskReddit,1389042671.0,"Ok, so this is one from my youth:

I was around sixteen when this happened: a few nights a week, I would stay at my mom's house where she lived with her long-term boyfriend, and the rest of the time I'd be at my dad's. She lived in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, and there was never anything to do at her house, so one night I bring my weed and bowl with me. Go outside for a ""walk"", get high, come back, and realize I need somewhere to hide my weed. My room was actually in the finished basement of the house, and the ceiling had those foam tiles that can easily be lifted up. I decide that I'll hide my stash in the ceiling, and proceed to do so.

The next morning, I'm getting ready to leave for school and I remember I need to grab my weed/bowl since I'm not coming back to my mom's house that night. I grab a chair, drag it to the middle of the room, climb up, push aside the ceiling tile and reach over and grab my weed - and then look down to see my mom standing in the doorway. She can't see what's in my hand, since it's still in the ceiling, but I look suspicious as fuck. 

""What,"" she demanded ""the hell are you doing?""

I hesitated, then somehow blurted out: ""This is where I hide my diary when I'm here."" 

She seemed to believe me. I still had a problem, though - what's clutched in my hand is about an 1/8th and a well-used bowl, not a teenage girl's diary. I fix her with my best hormonal teenager look and demand, ""Well, aren't you going to give me some *privacy*? God, mom. *You're like the Gestapo*."" She rolled her eyes, left, and I was able to safely hide my illegals in my bookbag and escape. 

Tl;dr - Compared mother to Nazis in order to hide drugs. "

mmp31,politics,1389042777.0,"There's a reason that engineers make X amount of times the amount of money that minimum wage workers make. It's because that's what the market has determined their labor is worth relative to each other, using our pricing structure to describe the labor values in absolute terms. The same goes for any job relative to another.

No amount of raising the minimum wage is EVER going to change the real relative labor values. What it does do, however, is distort the pricing structure until it (somewhat) recovers from government abuse. Eventually the wages of higher earners will go up and minimum wage earners will be making the same amount of money compared to the higher income groups as they were before.

Anybody who supports raising minimum wage is just jerking off because they don't want to address the real problem, which is inflation. Since the minimum wage increase in 2009, prices have gone up 9%, which means that the poor have seen a decrease in their income of 9%. For people who can barely feed themselves, that is SIGNIFICANT.

Locking minimum wage to inflation is a non-solution, because it will not change the fact that the poor's wages will be devalued until minimum wage goes up again. If one really cares about the poor, they would demand that the government immediately abolish inflation, which is controlled entirely by the Federal Reserve. Then we won't have to worry about rising prices harming the poor.

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1389042790.0,"I was unemployed, worked on call at a flower shop struggling to find work that would get me more than minimum wage and more that 15 hours a week when my boss at said flower shop said he knew a guy that needed help and would be willing to give me a job. IT was manual labor, but I thought it'd be good for me to work outside and I would work 4 days a week, get 40 hours. I interviewed with the guy, he said I could start the next day, and out of desperation I said sure. 

It was a scrap yard and after the 1st day I was pretty much toast. Instead of the 10 hour day I was told I'd get, I worked 12 hours solid. I had to move mass amounts of metal, chop up old hard wood flooring, shovel soot, and had to deal with this ASSHOLE who ran the whole shit show.  

This guy was in his 70's, overweight, thought women were property, called me a pansy because I couldn't drive a standard and because I drove my mother's Camry. Which was apparently a ""rice burning piece of shit built by slant eyed fascists."" I was also called a pansy because I had trouble lifting 100lbs totes full of scrap metal. I'm 5'5"", 225 pounds. GOOD LUCK, WITH THAT. I also learned that he didn't believe people needed restrooms, our ""Bathroom"" was a hole in the ground behind a rotted out Econoline growing into the weeds. He also got pissed at me when I brought up the fact we never discussed what I would get paid or if I was even filing taxes.  

I came home that night, sun burnt, exhausted to the point I couldn't eat, in excruciating amounts of pain from the labor, emotionally warn from his verbal threats and abuse, and I had to do it all again the next day. 

What I remember most about that night was I immediately went into to bathe myself, and I took a bath to soothe my achy muscles... and the water turned an extremely dark color, almost like coffee. I ended up having to shower after that I was still so filthy. 

The next day, I went in, did the same thing, this time I drove in my dads Chevrolet van which still didn't make him happy because ""Self respecting men drive *Fords*"" and did the same thing all over again. For another 12 hours. Lifting heavy metals, choping up old hardwood flooring with dull axes, lugging around concrete. It was AWFUL. 

At the end of that shift boss-man drove in with a vintage water tanker and looked at me, my only other coworker (Who had been there for years) and said it was going to be my job to climb into the tank, and shovel out all the sludge. 

I looked at him and said I would not be coming back for my 3rd day and left. 

I spent a week calling him asking when I Was going to get paid only to get ""I'll think about it"" or to be ignored. I reported him to the state, to which he then panicked, called me to ""Discuss matters"" and I ignored him. A few weeks later I got a check for my labor equal to 24 hours at $7.25 an hour. 

**TL;DR - Worked two days at a scrap yard ran by a schmuck. Quit after he wanted to shovel sludge out from a truck, and had to report him to get paid. I quit after two days.

Other people have firmer breasts that are more set in their shape, and are usually incompatible with moulded cup bras.

Of course, the Jana could just be the wrong shape for you, moulded or not.  It's hard to compare the moulded version of Bra A with the unlined version of Bra B.  The padding level and cup material is only one factor out of many that determine how bras fit.

Other than gapping at the top, are there any other fit issues?  Wrinkling, loose spaces, folded fabric, the wire not sitting directly in the inframammary fold, etc?  When you say gapping, do you mean that the top edge of the cup is not resting against your skin?

This is a common misconception, but it isn't true. Tylenol is bad to take if you drink chronically especially if you are not currently drinking. Acute alcohol use actually lessens the likelihood of liver damage while consuming tylenol. This is why it says on the label ""Do not use if you consume more than 3 alcoholic drinks per day on average."" not ""Do not use with alcohol."" This is because the damaging pathway for metabolizing tylenol is the same for metabolizing alcohol. There was a really good ""Explain Like I'm Five"" on it a while back."

The lower transaction costs make it rational for merchants to accept BTC payments.  Afaik, there is zero reason for merchants not to hop on board here.

The only group that doesn't currently benefit are those who first have to buy BTC in order to pay in BTC.  But, with wider BTC adoption, merchants who accept BTC may find it beneficial to pay their employees in BTC.  I don't know what the legality here is yet.

Also, dogs will make stealth nearly impossible since dogs are noisy and everyone will know they are coming a mile away.

It went so far that I ran into her with my car because she apruptly stopped her car in front of me. I am telling you that regardless of what you guys feel for eachother that you need to learn that conflict is part of every relationship.

You need to learn however that conflict if not resolved properly and without resolution is extremely destructive. You guys were mostly arguing over things that were long in the past. For him it was probably rather recent events because guys try to move on from things rather quickly and just want to be at ease, women in return are very emotional beings for you it is not about what happends always but rather how it made you feel. So once you feel that same feeling again and he is feeding into it unintentionally you may think he is doing ""that"" thing again and does not care about you. I am really going on a limb here but I really do have made a lot experience in that area. 

You guys will both need counseling, there is no way around it, and do not see that as a bad thing. Trust me lots of couples need counceling. It all comes down to as to how loyal and commited you guys are to eachother and this relationship. You both need to cool off for now, but you are right you will need closure, there will be lots of crying.

Thank you!!! I try to explain this to people and they look at me like I have three heads. Even eating 200 calories more than you burn per day, which is SUPER easy to do, adds up to an over 20 pound weight gain over the course of a year. If you exercise every other day, you'd have to add in an extra 30 minutes to an hour of cardio at every workout just to compensate.

It's like wanting to design bridges but forgetting about all the bolts and little pieces actually needed to make it work right.

Turns out you don't know what Reductio ad Absurdum means.  What you made is a slippery slope argument (the idea that games tackling sexual violence will lead to mario games where the princess is raped by bowser).  

Reductio ad absurdum is an argument technique in which you look at the consequences of an argument in a way that shows those consequences lead to something absurd, false, or untenable.  

You just chose an absurd hypothetical situation ""for comic effect"" that wouldn't necessarily or logically follow from the argument made by the person you replied to.

Passing is probably the toughest concept to grasp, so here are a few tips which I didn't learn until I accidentally discovered them: 
 
* The longer you hold down the button determines how hard the ball will be thrown. If you just tap the button then you'll throw a real high pass, and if you hold down the button as long as possible then you'll throw a dart.

*  The advantage to throwing a fast pass is that it quickly reaches your target, but the disadvantage is that it is low to the ground (can easily be intercepted if anyone is between you and your receiver) and is a little tougher for your receivers to catch. The advantage to throwing a softer pass is that it gets plenty height, but the disadvantage is that it arrives more slowly, so if your receiver is running towards a guy on the other team then the guy on the other team will have plenty of time to set up and intercept it.

* If you hold the left stick in any direction, then the ball will be thrown more in that direction. [Here's the best way I can explain it (link)](http://i.imgur.com/fl8fWFK.png). Suppose your passer is the black star and one of your wide receivers is the red star and he's running that direction. The green line represents where the ball would be thrown if you held the left stick to the left while throwing the pass. The blue line represents where the ball would be thrown if you held the left stick to the right. The black line represents where the ball would be thrown if you don't touch the left stick. Holding the left stick up also makes the pass a little higher (your guy will probably have to jump for it), and holding it down throws it near his knees. You'll figure out over time through trial and error which type to use in different scenarios.

* When in doubt, throw it to the guy running the red route. 

* If you see two or three opponent guys on defense who are all cluttered around one guy, then the odds are good that one of your other guys is open. It's the same thing in most other sports like euro football or basketball. If three guys are busy with one of your players, then one of your other players is probably open.

* Screen passes are scary at first. I avoided them for a long time. Once the play starts, you want to immediately run backwards and soon after throw the ball to your halfback (he'll have the red route) when you get the chance. It's best used when you think there will be a blitz.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about then that's okay. Just play lots of games and watch them on TV. I never seriously followed football until the start of the 2012 season and I picked up on how it works quick. It's not that tough of a game once you learn the basic rules. "

Yet this statistic includes women who have been forcibly kissed -- which, while something we don't want, is probably not something we should align with rape. Some feminists do view it as rape as promote it as such without properly explaining the statistic, misleading people to believe that 1 in 4 women are forcibly (PIV) raped.

Every time I hear a statistic that includes something like forcible kissing, the term ""sexually assaulted"" is used rather than ""raped.""

I can't explain it too well but when I saw it standing in the sawgrass.. there was a mixture of overwhelming reverence, admiration, fear, and insignificance. Like I was standing in front of something bigger than me. More beautiful than I can put to words. It sounds silly, I know, which is why I haven't mentioned that story to anyone because I'd get funny looks and no one would believe me. 

The giraffe reminds me of my boyfriend and they're both very adorable. Not to mention, both are tall and have a gentle demeanor. About the otters, I'd replace my t.v. for an otter exhibit if it were possible - where everyone could watch them frolic around and have fun. 

A few months after I was done struggling to pull myself out of depression, and was getting better, I found comfort in a dream I had where hundreds of hot air balloons were rising above a sunset. I woke up feeling content with myself, with my life, and where I was headed.  Hot air balloon rides are also fun so that's another reason hahaha. "

WraithPDX,worldnews,1389043405.0,"I'm not sure why you directed these comments at me when I'm not arguing for or against whaling. I'm merely citing facts and showing the sources, which show that Sea Shepherd are not being honest about the situation. I didn't bring up the biological properties of whales and I don't see any relevance to to what I pointed out in the slightest.

&gt; Fact: Japan is lying about their reason for killing these whales, which is the only reason their 'research' isn't being objected to. They just sell the meat. The 'research' is miniscule, if any is done at all, and is not published regularly. Nor does it ever benefit cetaceans in any measurable way, as most of the 'research' has been into how to kill them. Meanwhile, thousands die each year for this 'research'.

You are mistaken. They are not lying, and they are producing research, though I cannot comment on how useful it may be. Research from whaling is being published regularly, as statistics from the ICR show. [Source 1](http://www.icrwhale.org/scJARPA.html) [Source 2](http://www.icrwhale.org/Othersurveylist.html) That being said, the ICR is selling the remaining carcasses for commercial use and circumventing the moratorium through this loophole. They aren't lying, but their intentions are pretty obvious.

&gt; Fact: In Japan, there are tens of thousands of pounds of whale meat which is never purchased, which then just sits until it goes bad and is trashed. Nobody wants to eat what they're selling, not even in their homeland of Japan. Last estimates I saw were around 50,000lbs of meat unsold and going bad.

Yes and no. [As of 2008, it was being sold regularly.](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/03/08/news/greenpeace-stores-eateries-less-inclined-to-offer-whale/#.UssaPtJDtAI) It cites a Greenpeace survey which states that supermarkets are reluctant to carry it, but that one chain is reporting that whale meat totals ¥100 million in sales. It also says that over 5,000 tons of whale meat is sold as of 2006.

There is a link from [The Telegraph from 2012](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/9330828/Seventy-five-per-cent-of-Japanese-whale-meat-unsold.html) that says 75% from their recent 2012 catch went unsold at auction. It cites the ICR saying that 1200 tons of meat was unsold. Keep in mind that the same agency reported 5000 tons being sold in 2006, and now it's down to 1000 tons in 2012. Your claim is basing it off of *one* year against multiple. Though I would like to see the annual whale meat sales for each year from 2004 onwards, I likely won't be seeing it anytime soon.

[This source] suggests that Iceland may be responsible for the poor sales of Japan's whale meat and shows that there is a profitable market for it.

&gt; Fact: The Japanese ICR fleet is more often than not the aggressor in these confrontations between ICR and Sea Shepherds, and has gone so far as to intentionally ram and sink ships doing nothing but floating 'in their way', while broadcasting ""stop your aggressive action"" over their speakers. They have employed actual, real weapons against the SS which would be banned under maritime regulation, if not for the government-sanctioned 'coast guard' security on the ICR ships.

Again, sources please. Also, keep in mind that the Japanese ships are there to do a job, while a group goes there with the sole intention to instigate. That strikes me as pretty aggressive, and Sea Shepherd has a known history of aggressive actions against ships, such as ramming the Norwegian Coast Guard ship in the 90's to [sabotaging ships](http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bn8UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TAMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5646,8585614&amp;dq=sea-shepherd) or [Trying to disable them](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10363013).

Tabs in vim are really about window layout.  If you want one view of things that involves 3 windows on a vertical split, and another view of things that involves 2 windows in a horizontal split, then you want 2 tabs for that.  If you just want multiple files open, then you want buffers.

One part of my workflow where your solution would really fail is using the quickfix window.  Do you use that?  I use the ack plugin, which displays results in the quickfix window.  Hitting enter on a result brings up the right buffer, opening a new one if necessary.  But the focus remains on the quickfix window.  Now, I believe you can force vim to open new buffers in a new tab, but if I did that, then what I think would happen (haven't tried) is that I'd lose the quickfix window when I switched to the tab with the file I selected.  Definitely not what I want!

What I think might serve you well is another plugin I use, MiniBufExplorer.  This gives me a display at the top of the screen of open buffers, and supports fuzzy matching by buffer name to switch between them.  So I am constantly typing &lt;leader&gt;b and then 2 or 3 characters of the filename I want to switch to, and that's generally how I move around.  I don't know how you are switching tabs, but if it involves :tabn and :tabp or something, that would drive me a little bonkers.

In summary, there are many things you might end up incorporating in your workflow in which trying to force everything to its own tab would be annoying, even if you don't do any of those things now.  Even if you never do and the only practical difference is how you switch tabs/buffers, MiniBufExplorer (or similar) probably does a better job than your current method and probably gives you the workflow you want, using a more vimmish way (buffers instead of tabs)."
dbaker102194,RWBY,1389043586.0,"It's not already dark? Sure nothing's been directly displayed on screen, but the dialoge reveals a lot of pretty nasty stuff. Professor Port talked about the time he slayed a monster that *had destroyed the whole town before he was able to track it down*. That's certainly not good. 

Violent crime is running rampant as exemplified by the conversation between the two cops in episode 15. 

Then there's the whole ""almost genocide"" and the victims of that quasi genocide forming a terrorist organization that has no problem with killing people. (If Adam Tarus is any example of them.)

ObturateYourForamen,AskReddit,1389043609.0,"Not an obnoxious passenger story, but a story about some awesome flight attendants.

Just last week I flew from DC to Copenhagen on Scandinavian Airlines, but while we were taxiing to the runway the defroster for the planes broke and we ended up sitting in line for almost 6 hours.  At one point the captain turned off the air so the aerosolized alcohol solution they used to defrost the planes wouldn't get in the ventilation system, so it got rather toasty inside the cabin.  En route to the bathroom, I make it to the back of the plane and it is significantly cooler, so I walk a little further towards the galley and saw three of the Danish flight attendants with a battery powered fan chilling with a couple passengers.  I join them, and immediately the attendants offer me anything I want from the refreshments available.  They even let me have some of the little bottles of alcohol.  Afterwards, we just sat and chatted until it was time to go.  All in all, made my pre-flight experience much better."

screenmagnet,sex,1389043629.0,"So how many days has it been since you reinserted it? The longer it has been since your week off, the less likely you are to get pregnant if it falls out, because the hormones have had a longer time to build up in your system.

The most risky mistake you can make with birth control is to extend your placebo week past 7 days, or to miss a pill/have the ring fall out during the first week back on. This is because during that 5-7 days without the ring, the hormone levels decline (this is why you have a 'period' -- the hormone levels fall enough for the uterine lining to shed). Then they gradually build back up again with every day that you have the new ring inside you. So if your ring falls out early on in the new cycle, while your hormone levels are already at their lowest, the levels can fall low enough to cause you to ovulate. Did that make sense?

Regardless, I wouldn't worry. You took plan B right away, so it should be highly effective.

syberphunk,secretsanta,1389043663.0,"In a general term, yes there can be delays with shipping, yes when it snows or floods, etc.

My main gripe is when scenarios such as those are discredited. For example in the UK it hasn't been snowing, only more recently has it been flooding.

While putting a requirement on tracking numbers may not be realistic to everyone globally, at the very least there's no reason why the Secret Santa can't communicate any problems or get in touch with their giftee.

I've seen people on here post that they intentionally don't send a message to their giftee, which I think can cause undue stress on people. Especially when it's near deadline time or after it.

I think if RedditGifts actually produced the statistics for how many people claimed to have shipped, but their giftees marked it as not received then we would all get a better picture of how this is faring and I feel that they're hiding a lot of the facts.

When I first got shafted in 2011 a lot of people were stating how low of a chance it was to be so and that I couldn't possibly have been.

I think it's a higher chance than a lot of people realise.

My intention of the suggestions I make is to attempt to reduce this chance, at least by some margin.

While people say to have faith, that faith easily dwindles once it goes past a reasonable time. That you yourself have agreed, in a logical sense. It's possibly easy to say that in the statistics of this Secret Santa 10,000 people, at least, have signed up, got a present/gift and sat back happily not doing anything about it.

If anything, that's not in the spirit of Christmas and there are possible methods to at least reduce it.

Regardless, I keep signing up and encouraging people to do so. My friend was even a re-matcher. It's just unfortunate that they're having a sour experience, but they're making sure that others aren't.

At the end of the day it's voluntary; but I can see more people (as you say the ones preaching to the choir) spending money next year to be an Elf with perhaps a hope that they won't be shafted because there's then some investment in it.

abeyante,sex,1389043723.0,"My initial, honest reaction to this post: niiiiiiiiiiiiiiice

I LOVE precum. It's way saltier than cum, and less basic (so always less soapy tasting), and thinner (less snotty). Absolutely delicious. I could drink it from a bowl. Plus, there's nothing hotter than a guy who's so turned on he's not only hard, he's leaking precum/twitching/moaning/whatever. Any additional outward signals of arousal are always a good thing.

That gal who comment that you were wetter than she was in a weird tone? She was probably honestly surprised because she'd never been with a guy like that. I'd compare it to how new guys sometimes react to how quickly I'm physically turned on/wet compared to other girls they've been with--it's sometimes literally instantaneous, and I'll get the ""holy shit you're so wet wtf?!?!"" reactions sometimes. It's not so much a bad thing (though for one squeamish ex, it was) as it's a novelty. A surprise. But don't let that make you feel self conscious. Most girls love precum even more than cum itself!

balathustrius,mead,1389043783.0,"There probably isn't enough to it to make a real write-up.

Backsweetening is simple.

You take a mead and ferment it dry. Give it a couple of weeks for the yeast to clean up their mess. Basically wait at least until it begins to go translucent. Or you can wait until it's completely clear. Hell, you can backsweeten years after pitch. Stabilize it with Potassium Sorbate and Potassium Metabisulfite. Then add honey until it's as sweet as you like.

Figuring out how much honey to add is the hardest part. The easy way is to gently stir in honey 1/4th cup at a time (assuming a 5 gallon batch) until it's as sweet as you like. If you have a one gallon batch, you probably want to use tablespoon instead of 1/4th cup increments.

If you know your own palette pretty well, you can go by the rule of thumb that 1 lb of honey per gallon adds about .035 to the specific gravity.

Example: 

You have 5 gallons of stable dry mead (1.000). You like your mead to be around 1.020. So you need to raise the mead's SG by .020.

.020 / .035 = .57, so you need to add around .57 lb of honey per gallon. 

.57 lb of honey * 5 gallons = 2.85 lbs (46.6 oz)

If you don't have a scale (*get a scale!*), you can estimate weight by volume if you consider that 1 gallon of honey is roughly 12 lbs and there are 16 cups to a gallon.

12 pounds divided by 16 cups: .75 lb. Each cup of honey is about 3/4 lb. So add 3.8 cups of honey. That's 3 cups, + 3/4 cup, + a tablespoon.

After backsweetening you'll probably find that you need to let it sit and clear up again, and you'll need to rack it at least once more before bottling, depending upon when you sweetened. You also want to give it a couple of weeks while you monitor the gravity to make sure fermentation hasn't kicked back up. No bottle bombs!"

I had to have the same conversation with my FIL. He trapped my husband the first night they were in town to spew a bunch of crap at him and offer to buy us a family bible. Some of my friends suggested letting him do this and putting it on the bookshelf when they came to visit, but this rubbed me the WRONG way because I'm not interested in catering to their shit in my own house. The next night I was home from work and my FIL did the same thing, but with me.

The first thing I said was, ""It's not appropriate for you to come into our house and do this to us. We would never do this to you, and you would be furious if someone of another faith came into your house and tried to make you pray like them to their gods. It's rude.""

FIL didn't listen and continued on telling us that we're all going to hell and that we ""didn't come from monkeys"" and such; we ended up talking for about an hour while I made it very clear that I think that his religion, and all the other religions, are equal amounts of nonsense. 

BUT.

We didn't have to deal with any churchy gifts since then. Their Christmas card was much more toned-down this year (small bible quote on the inside left, the rest was just sentimental).

Lion_on_the_floor,AskReddit,1389043876.0,"My family is Jewish. I attended a preschool program that was also an Early Childhood education class for High Schoolers, who were our ""buddies"" and helped teach us. When I was 3 years old, for the holidays my preschool had someone dress up as Santa and he had a bag of presents. He called all the kids up one at a time by name and gave them a present. I had no real opinion of Santa by then, but this was my first time meeting him and getting a present from him. When my name was called, I was too scared to sit on his lap but I accepted my gift. I unwrapped it and OH MY GOD I was so excited it was EXACTLY what I wanted but never thought I'd get. I used to covet toys from commercials but I never got them. This one was one of those mermaids that changes color in the water. I thought this Santa was amazing for knowing, thought I never believed in ""the Santa""


Flash forward 11 years and as a 14 year old Freshman in High School, I take that Early Childhood education class (fun fact the same Teacher who taught me in Preschool was still teaching it so I had her as a Preschool &amp; High School teacher). For the Holidays we sent a note home in the kids backpack that the parents should send in a wrapped present under $10 or so to surprise their kid when Santa visits the holiday party. I had to confront my mom who hid this fact from me and apparently was shocked that I thought it really came from ""Santa"". "

But. **BUT** we're going to have to win big games to the Super Bowl. There's no easy path to the Super Bowl.

I think some of you are selling our team very short. This Saints team the last 3 weeks is not the same Saints team that went up to the Clink on December 2nd. We have found a left tackle that looks like he actually wants to play!! We have found a one two punch at running back that will run and fight and scratch for every yard they get. We have found a way to stop the run (which was our defenses weakest area). We held Lesean McCoy (the leagues leading rusher) to 77 yards on his home turf behind one of the best offensive lines in the NFL. Also, at the same time, we held one of the hottest QBs in the league to very pedestrian numbers even without having Keenan Lewis for a quarter. We found a kicker that went 4/4 in the clutch with the game on the line!!

Basically, what I'm trying to say is this: WE ARE A DAMNED GOOD FOOTBALL TEAM!!! We have just as good a chance to win this game as Seattle does. Yes they have homefield advantage, and they have the cold weather factor on their side. Guess what, so did Philly..."

Abuse fundamentally changed how multiplayer PvE RPGs worked. Now Torchlight 2 and Diablo 3 have separate loot for each player because of the crap like pick-it. I'm not saying bots and 3rd party illegitimate add-ons in D2 directly caused this as a sole factor, but I think it played a huge part. 

Maphacks in D2 are frequent ban reasons due to item farming. Bots also ruined the pace of the game with Baal run and cow run bots, you could get a lvl 80 character in a week easily. Bots could farm items faster than anyone, and crashed the market with real money pay to win. PVP arguably was ruined by it. D3 tried to legitimize this and remove pay2win, but failed due to a variety of reasons (who knows if the expansion will fix it?).

That's where I draw the line. When devs shape future game designs to minimize impact of a particular activity because of the perceived abuse.

Tall_LA_Bull,AskMen,1389044025.0,"Good advice in this thread. This girl is quite likely not into you. However, a general piece of advice:

It comes off as much stronger and sexier if, when inviting a woman to do something, you have a plan and just say what you're doing, then ask if she'd like to join you. So say ""I'm gonna go see Movie X on Friday. Do you want to come?""

If she likes you, one of two things will happen. Either she will agree, or she will say ""Oh, I'm busy on Friday, but I really want to see that movie,"" at which point you can say ""I guess I could wait for another day. When are you free?""

If you make 2-3 specific invitations to a woman and she declines all without making a big effort to reschedule, she doesn't like you. Period. Move on.

SmartMonkey002,AskReddit,1389044042.0,"I am just a passenger but I have been on around 23-25 flights in the past 4-5 years and I have seen hundreds of entittled assclowns. The one that stands out the most was a grown man (around 36), around 5'4"" and 275 lbs. On this flight (Boston to Chicago) he sits in the row right in front of me.

The flight attendant comes around offering drinks to everyone and she gets to him... She asks him nicely to which he asks for a weird concoction of something He probably makes at home (included cranberry juice, club soda, white wine, a jello shot, and a cup of coffee all mixed together). The attendant says she doesn't have the things to make this drink in which he becomes infuriated. He starts shoutting about how he paid $385 for this flight and hiw he ""should get to fly like a king if I am forced to pay like one"". 

The flight attendant then appologizes and starts to move on as she will have none of it, he grabs her wrist and demands this shitty drink and says he will not accept this crappy service and will get her fired.  I stand up (I am about 6'7"", 240 lbs and am a brown belt in bjj) and I grab his arm demanding he release the nice lady. He insists that I should be arrested for assaulting him and continues shouting that he did not pay to be harrassed.  I calmy say that I didn't pay to watch a immature man assault and belittle a woman who is only doing her job. The flight attendant (now free from assclown's sweaty grip) gets the pilot who is also a larger gentleman. They walk up to him and simply tell him that if he continues to belittle the crew or passengers that he will be ""escorted out in a shiny new pair of bracelets"".

Sweaty assclown than snears a look at myself and the two members of the crew and sits back down. He remained silent for the rest of the flight and he repeatedly tried to slam his seat into my knees (there is literaly no room between my legs and the seat to begin with) to which I reach around to him and say ""No No No, Not Today"".

steve496,49ers,1389044127.0,"I don't see the argument that Hunter's regressed; his average YPC through his first two seasons was 4.6, the same as it is this year.  Admittedly comparing 2012 to 2013 has him down .6 YPC (5.2 to 4.6), but then, so is Gore (4.7 to 4.1) - I don't think our OLine is as dominant this year as it was last year, and that's hurt all of our RBs.

James, admittedly, hasn't done much this season, but then, he only got 14 touches on offense - he didn't have much opportunity.  And the fact that his yards per return on both kickoffs and punts are in the top 10 of the league says good things about his speed and elusiveness.  I don't think he's necessarily a superstar in the making or the next Darren Sproles... but I'd be willing to give him 5 touches a game on offense and see what happens.

Don't get me wrong: there probably would be some dropoff (in pass blocking, if nowhere else) if we split Gore's carries between Hunter, James, and Lattimore - unless Lattimore immediately steps up and becomes an absolute stud.  But $6.45 million is a lot, and if it winds up being the difference between re-signing Crabtree or Iupati and not, I think the 49ers have to give the possibility some serious thought."

I think your breasts are shallow (or at least, they're not projected).

Based on how the Jana and the Totally Tartan fit, I'm going to disagree with all of the bras that /u/noys recommended (sorry!).  If you're not shallow, then you may simply be too Full on Top for the Jana and the Sexy Plunge.

I recommend giving the Cleo Marcie a try.  It's a bra that's not too projected, and is a bit fuller on top.  Since you're in the market for a t-shirt bra, I recommend the Freya Deco Plunge and/or the Freya Deco Half Cup (note that the Deco Half Cup is *not* the same cut/style as the Totally Tartan Half Cup, lol).

Another good diagnostic bra is the Cleo Lucy.  It's very similar to the Marcie, but is more full on bottom.

I think any one of those four bras will help pin down what shape you are - because that's what I think is going on here, a shape issue."

turnipsoup,linuxadmin,1389044184.0,"For starters it's missing a sort so the uniq won't work.  Each IP will be added once per log entry.  There's also no checking if it's present already.

Also no whitelist for that time you accidentally typo'd your username, fires at a single failed login, etc.

Also rather than writing out the file, you could have represented your code as:

    done &lt; &lt;(some command to take input from)

But yes; this is one way of getting iptables rules in place based off logfile entries.  Here's a one-liner I use myself to do a similar job, changed to your auth task:

    unset count ; while read -r ip ; do if ! iptables-save | grep -q $ip ; then iptables -A INPUT -s ""${ip}"" -j DROP ; echo ""$ip dropped"" ; ((count++)) ; fi ; done &lt; &lt;(awk '/Failed password for invalid/ { print $13 }' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{ if ($1&gt;10) print $2 }')

And expanded for ease of reading: 

    unset count
    while read -r ip
    	do
    	if ! iptables-save | grep -q $ip
    		then
    		iptables -A INPUT -s ""${ip}"" -j DROP
    		echo ""$ip dropped""
    		((count++))
    	fi
    done &lt; &lt;(awk '/Failed password for invalid/ { print $13 }' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{ if ($1&gt;10) print $2 }')
    echo $count dropped

The final bit with awk - you can do a sort | uniq -c ; then use awk to only pull values &gt; X - in this case 10 results.  i.e; '{ (if $1&gt;X) print $2 }' so it only blocks them after X failed attempts.

There are many applications for this kind of log grepping and sorting those results into iptables, especially with webservers."

This is a silly argument.  It seems to stem from the idea that addressing women's issues means the world is better for everyone, but that isn't the case.  

In many ways feminism has made the world much worse for men.  Many of feminisms aims are directed in areas where it actually is a zero sum game, and making it better for women in those areas means necessarily taking from men.  

A simple example is things like hiring quotas.  Whether or not you believe that it is right that companies are forced to or implement quotas which ensure a proportion of women, it necessarily means that there are fewer spaces available for men, which is impossible to spin as making the world better for men as well.  

The idea that feminism improves anything for men is not based on anything analytical but mere an emotional argument that making things better for women will indirectly help men.  "

I would support full legalization of marijuana because you're only hurting yourself and it's no worse than smoking or drinking with the dangers being associated with prolonged abuse.

However, I do think there are some drugs destructive enough that they should be outright banned.  If you're taking alligator then you have no personal responsibility and won't have a life for people to stay out of for long.  The act of taking it should be enough by itself to classify you as legally insane and strip you of the right to make such decisions for yourself.

If you want to criticize Kap, say that he can't be a pocket passer against the Hawks or teams with great DBs since they can take away one of his 3 target, but simply saying that he's below average in the pocket is untrue. He passed well last year in the playoff against the Flacons, he torched you guys in week 1, he marched on the Cards week 17, etc. 

It's interesting though, you knock Manning 4th, probably because of his post-season trouble (regular season he's probably first on everyone's list), but you don't factor that in for the young QBs.

I'm sure you can think of other examples.

We also need to separate ourselves in order to understand how we function. If I were to ask you any of the following - What is a gigue? What is the internet? What is French? What is communism? What is a sewage system? - your answer will likely state or imply that they are ""man-made"" objects or concepts. Nobody would be satisfied in saying that they're ""animal-made"". Why?

My point is that these people do have money.  Every time they get money they manage to spend it.  They're never going to have money because they're too stupid to hold onto it.

Banks don't make most of their money off of poor people. This couple doesn't mention how much they screwed their creditors out of when they filed for bankruptcy.

What you're describing is a peculiarity of insurance due to the effect of having a very large risk pool, not anything having to do with the effects of competition on pricing. Additionally, there's no reason socialized housing, food, clothing, etc couldn't benefit from huge economies of scale just as much as healthcare does, also resulting in lower average prices to the consumer than a market-based system, especially since it could be free from advertising/marketing overhead costs and have zero profit motive.

It's also a case of very poor spending priorities. The fact that our system will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on cutting-edge care for terminal cancer patients which does extremely little to extend their life expectancy, but not spend $1 to give a homeless man some free penicillin, which leads him to show up in the emergency room later with a life-threatening abscess, which the ER is legally obligated to treat, costing tens of thousands."

drewgriz,CFB,1389044680.0,"**TL;DR: Can we not make this the default response to EVERY proposal in the drinking game threads?**

If I proposed a moratorium on the ""jeez, you trying to kill everybody?"" responses in the drinking thread, would that make me a dick? It happens every damn thread, even (especially?) on sets of rules that are pretty damn reasonable. Keep in mind, ""Drink"" means drink a sip of beer (generally). The above is a really solid set of rules that has the potential to make someone drink anywhere from 5-10 beers depending on your sip size, the game, and ESPN's production, which is really not much over the course of a 3-hour game, unless you're some punk-ass bitch who can't hold his liquor or a girl. 

Point is, a really well-balanced set of drinking game rules is an art form, I think this is a modest masterpiece in this medium, and responses that paint the whole enterprise as an exercise in hyperbole hold us all back from appreciating its value and (more importantly) actually putting it into practice. And even if it were a rule set that would result in certain death, this is not a funny or original response to it.

IAmTehRhino,FinalFantasy,1389044806.0,"I still like the idea I had of everyone being able to learn every skill and every spell, but there not being enough skill points to completely maximize every character.

So, say it would cost 15,000 AP to learn everything, but there's only 10,000 AP available for each character. The player would have to make some tough choices about what skills or spells to focus on, knowing that each character can only ever achieve a fraction of the full skill/spell tree. If you wanted to make things more restrictive, you could have the most powerful things lock to only one character (that is, anyone can learn Ultima or dual-wield, but once it's learned no one else can have it).

In fact, (and I've only had this thought after I started typing so that's my excuse if it sucks) you could also design the skill tree so that the abilities a character learns guide the player toward similar abilities by lowering the cost of later abilities. For example, after you've learned Cover you can get Provoke for a lower price, but it'll still cost full price to give your Black Mage dual-wield. That system would guide players toward the traditional class/job setup, but still allow experienced players the freedom to make highly customized parties.

Of course, the obvious drawback is that a game with that kind of system would have to be VERY carefully balanced to avoid massively overpowered or underpowered builds, while also being, you know, fun."

zakificus,starcitizen,1389044815.0,"I think this is all kind of planned.

Like obviously every ship is going to have it's Pros and Cons. Some turn better, some accelerate better, some can manage power better, etc.

But it all depends on the stuff you have in your ship. An avenger with base thrusters won't maneuver or accelerate as well as the avenger with top of the line thrusters installed.

Similarly, you can overclock many components, but that won't always work out. You may just push your powerplant too far and have it explode on you, or maybe those awesome thrusters start to burn out one by one if you keep them going to hot for too long because you messed with them.

We were down to HU in a 12 player SNG, BI was $1.50 or $3.50 I think. I was the marginal chip leader on the Button. I raise pre, he calls. Flop was QJTr, I bet 1/2 pot he calls. Turn is a 7. I bet 1/2 pot, he calls again. River was a K. I think for 5 seconds and decide that I can very credibly rep an ace and that anything less than an ace is probably folding. Also, he is usually 3-betting with an ace preflop, so it is pretty unlikely that he has an ace here. I was really really new to poker at this point, so this level of thinking about a villain's range was a bit of a eureka moment. I jam for about 2x pot. 


Russian villain thinks. After about 3 seconds I know he doesn't have the ace which is good. He timebanks and after over a minute of thinking he folds and shows me a 9, for the K high straight. 

I show him 63o.

It works if you give it time. It's a lot slower than clippers, because you have to repeatedly bang it against your head so the hair gets drawn in, but you can get a longer cut than clippers with guards allow.

No appointment, no mess because it vacuums up after itself, and I don't have to have a beauty school dropout screw up a basic cut because a good taper is not something she knows how to do.

If you have someone to even up the back, it's all copacetic. It only looks bad if you rush it, especially with long hair.

duffmanhb,SubredditDrama,1389045112.0,". The industry is changing with the digital age and there really isn't much you can do about it. I mean, does she really think she's going to see any noticeable hit on her bottom line with what she said? It's never going to change. So she basically just upset her base for now good reason. It's like when bands complained about piracy. They enjoyed all the new fans that came with it, and liked all the additional cash they were making there, but then complained when one revenue stream went down, even though at the day they are making more than before. Their greed upset a lot of people. But nowadays bands are actively encouraging piracy because they know how beneficial it is to their business. 

 It's my understanding that pornstars at her level are paid very well, just not directly through the content. Being a star is the same way being a MMA star is. Those guys get paid crap. But they too make a lot of money. Why they keep doing it is like what one commenter said, 99% of your fans know you because of free content. They are making money off the brand, not the content. With MMA it's all the endorsements and appearances. With porn, it's the endorsements and appearances as well. They also act as extremely expensive call girls making a nice sum of change. 

So if she would magically figure out how to stop all her fans from stealing her content, she'd be forgotten over night and make far less money than before. The tube sites is why she is making so much money. She wouldn't be popular without it. She wouldn't have the product endorsement nor the events where she gets paid to show up. She'd be a nobody. 

She is being paid for her work, but just through different avenues. "

ankylosaurus_rex,ABraThatFits,1389045147.0,"A 32E sounds like a good starting point to me - though it's *very* uncommon for a standing measurement to be larger than the leaning measurement.

I also wanted to mention that 2.5"" (the difference between the snug and tight underbust) is a bit more squish than many people have in that size range.  Anyways, that's a roundabout way of saying the following: If 33"" is an overestimate for her snug underbust, a 32E sounds like a good starting point.  If 33"" is indeed her snug underbust measurement, then 32DD may be a slightly better starting point.

Of course, all of that is still within margin of error.  No matter what size she starts with, there's a good chance she'll end up finding that a different size is better for her, lol.

Anyways, with those measurements and that shape, I recommend starting with a b.tempt'd Ciao Bella, a Lepel Fiore Padded Plunge, a Betsey Johnson Eyelet Lace Demi, and/or a Natori Feathers."

Belichick is Darth Vader... not the emperor.  Vader actually makes the deciding play for the good guys in the end.

You just have to hope Apple change their mind in a later update. Or you jailbreak and do it yourself, but then Apple don't want you doing that either.

That's the fundamental difference in philosophy that I enjoy so much now I've moved to my Nexus 4 around September last year. Don't like the launcher? Change it. Don't want labels on the icons? Fine, get rid of them from the launcher settings. Don't want the menubar when you're on the launcher? Fine, again you can get rid of that. Don't like the default keyboard? Fine, install another one like Swype. Don't like the default widgets? Fine, install ones that suit you from the Play Store. Don't like the default Play Music app? Fine, install a new one, open it, and then tap 'Always' to set it to your default music application. Don't like Chrome? Fine, install something like Firefox or Dolphin, open it and tap 'Always' to set it as your default browser. Don't want it at all? Fine, hold the icon, tap Uninstall.

These are just some of the examples of what I consider to be *basic*, *essential* functionality of a phone. It **boggles my mind** that in 2013 people are paying £599 for a phone that *doesn't let you change your default web browser.*

The iPad is a fine piece of hardware, but god damn I wish I could install Android on this thing. The frustration I feel every time I find something about iOS that I don't like, but that *I can't change* **on a device I paid money for and own** is enough to drive me up the wall"

Capetorial,AdviceAnimals,1389045407.0,"Pescatarian. Most of them do this for health purposes, although it makes sense morally, too.

A pig, which will represent mammals, is a high form of life. It is on the same level as dogs. It is understandable why someone might say ""this animal is too sentient to be eaten when we have alternatives."" A chicken, honestly, is not a very high form of life, but the *way* we treat them in captivity (and I don't mean PETA propoganda, I mean how we actually treat them which is still decently bad, worse than cows/pigs - which is not great). So chicken gains immunity because though it's not very sentient, we torture them a bit too much when farming, one moral set may declare. Fish, however, fish have it pretty good. One, they're often given some level of freedom. See, we don't hunt mammals or birds for eating (well, hunters do, but most hunters don't get their regular food from hunting) they're actually given some sort of 'chance' (there's no fucking chance but you know what I mean) at life then *we* go out in the wild and ""hunt"" them even in industrial catch. Life forms below mammal, bird and fish are all so low that they can be eaten with this moralset without thinking about it.

I would say I was an Arminian, absolutely, even having never heard the term.  I thought I was responsible for my own salvation and continuing spiritual walk.  Not that I paid the price for my own sin, of course, but that it had been my decision and that was the difference between me and all the lost people.

I've never before thought through the reasons that I like professional sports so much, but a few come to mind when I think about my team.

The first is that I'm cheering for an organization that represents my geographic area, even if all the players aren't from here.

The second is that I'm cheering for a team that represents a long and storied history. From the name of the team itself, to the highs and lows of past seasons, even to the moments I remember from the 20 years I've been a fan, all are reasons I support the team.

The last major reason that I cheer for professional sports teams is that they represent excellence, and since I was raised to love my team it stirs a competitive fire in me to out-cheer other fans from other teams. I not only want to be louder than the fan from the rival team sitting next to me but also I want to be more informed and ready to discuss the subject.

So for me personally at least there are multiple reasons that I support my professional teams of choice. I know that a significant portion of the sub's population here won't like or follow pro sports and that's totally fine.

Look, it's got nothing to do with the weight, it's all about the mass. If you can compress a lump of Plutonium the size of a piece of rice as much as you can, you'll also get a nuclear explosion (albeit very small). It has nothing to do with weight.

If you're implying that the 80 tons of fuel collapsing onto additional fuel will spark a detonation, then you're also misguided. That assumes a few things:

1) The fuel is one cohesive mass (which it likely isn't).

2) That the fuel will A) reach terminal velocity during the fall and B) assuming terminal velocity is sufficient to compress said mass into a super-critical state.

3) Assuming it falls at all.

As we know it, the fuel is all together in a single location *which is good*. As long as we know where that crap is, it's easier to deal with. You only get serious problems when it's being dispersed by something (like fire or an explosion). 

EDIT:

Worst case scenario, the fuel collapses into the containment structure and reaches critical but not super critical state. In that event, the solution is to throw more water and sand at the thing, and possibly try to dump concrete into the building from above. "
Montuckian,NeutralPolitics,1389045521.0,"This will become the norm in my opinion (as I sit just outside Boulder, CO).

The logistics of an illegal operation coupled with the profit margins will push the legal prices lower than the black market prices as long as the local authorities can keep the locally grown supply regulated.  

In illegal operations, the product has to be shipped from somewhere else or grown piecemeal in clandestine grow houses.  Because of those limiting factors, product has to be brought in from out of state or out of country necessitating multiple middle men between supplier and seller.  Each of these handlers has to be compensated according to their risk, which is the driving force behind the current prices.

On the other hand, the current price hike in CO is largely (IMO) due to the unprecedented demand and the recent outlay of capital that these businesses had to make.  Even if a producer was already producing marijuana for medical, the commercial operations must be completely separate.

Once this capital is recouped, demand levels steady, and businesses establish themselves, prices will go back down to levels where it is undesirable to operate in the black market in CO.  This was the case in MT when medical was passed there and the registration system was porous enough to allow for people to have doctor's approval with little effort."

AnyelevNokova,relationships,1389045645.0,"You want to know something really sad?

I proposed to him the night of Christmas Day. He *completely ignored* it. Now don't get me wrong; he liked the ring. He told me it one upped what he got me for Christmas (not really, but w/e), that it was nice, commented on how we needed to get it resized. But he completely ignored the fact that I handed him a ring. Admittedly, I didn't explicitly do the whole ""will you marry me"" song and dance, but I'd also told him months ago that I was going to propose if he didn't, and he told me to go ahead. We're not the mushy kind of couple, so I figured, heck, he wouldn't want a cheesy proposal anyways. He's not dumb: he knows what being handed a ring means, right? Nope. No dice. He liked the ring, but completely missed (or knowingly ignored) the meaning behind it. It's like if a guy handed you a bunch of flowers and you responded with, ""oh, how sweet! You're a really good friend!"" 

A couple days later we spoke and I told him now I needed to get a ring. His response was ""why?"" Yeah... That was when I realized what had happened. He followed up by asking me (jokingly) if I wanted a ""fourty-two thousand dollar rock."" Either he was oblivious as a boulder, or he dodged the situation by not acknowledging what I was trying to do. Neither answer is a good one. I spoke to his mother on the subject (I'm closer to her than my own mother) and that's what she told me: ""don't pressure him, it'll just piss him off. I'm sure he'll do it eventually."" Honey, we've been together for five years, lived together for 3 years, and have a kid. I'm trying to be patient here, but I'm honestly offended at this point that it hasn't come up. I don't want to get married right this second, but christ man, at least let me know that we're moving forward. Long engagement is fine, but give me something, *anything*. He has no reservations telling me that things are great and he's very happy, but when it comes to marriage, suddenly he turns into a muted clam. It's eating away at me and turning me into this nervous, insecure trainwreck. People -- including friends and family -- are starting to comment on our lack of engagement, and it's digging into my self-esteem and making me feel like I'm doing something wrong.

The problem is that his older brother just got engaged, and his girlfriend DID pressure him. As in, ""you better get me a ring for Christmas"" and telling anyone and everyone that that's what she wanted and if she didn't get a proposal for Christmas she would throw a massive fit. They'd been together for 2 years. He didn't want to do it, but she's also a *massive bitch* capable of making his life miserable, so he did it just to shut her up. So now everyone in the family expects me to be better than her and just twiddle my thumbs because my boyfriend is romantically slow and, well, we wouldn't want to pressure him, now would we? You're better than Massive Bitch Girlfriend, aren't you? And it pisses me off because no, I'm not. She's an awful person, but she got what she wanted because she demanded it. I take the high road, and what do I get? Maybe Someday Possibly answers and jokes meant to end the conversation. I hate that girl: she's snobby, rude, controlling, and ungrateful. But god damn if I'm not bitter and secretly jealous of her because, at the end of the day, she gets what she wants."

He is acting according to that understanding.

potato1,changemyview,1389045884.0,"I don't agree that the availability and cost of water, energy, food, and clothing depend largely on where you live, or that moving to another location is necessarily an option for increasing one's income. While the costs of those resources does vary with geographic location, in the aggregate, I think the variations are small relative to their total cost. Additionally, in high-income areas (the areas to which one might move in order to increase one's income), to the extent that those resources do vary in cost with location, those resources are at their most costly.

I agree completely with what you said about how illnesses, and the exact quantity of a person's need for medical care, are primarily independent of personal choice. However, I think my logic remains sound, because my argument is based on the universal need for medical care (and the indisputably universal needs for water, food, clothing, housing, and energy). 

Furthermore, speaking of consequences of not receiving medical intervention is irrelevant. The consequence of not receiving water or food is death. The consequence of not receiving energy, housing, or clothing is a complete inability to participate in society. If the necessity of medical care is an argument in favor of socialized medicine, then the necessity of food, water, housing, clothing, and energy is an equally strong argument in favor of socialized food, water, housing, clothing, and energy."

thebanditredpanda,ffxiv,1389045938.0,"No. Sorry. I don't buy it. Prior to CM, there is no dungeon where the idea that players should skip even comes up. A new player has no reason to think ""oh I should skip this"" when a cutscene comes up automatically at that point. The only way they might know already is if they happen to browse forums like this where it's a daily slog of threads about jerks, or if they happen to already be in an FC, LS, or have friends kind enough to warn them.

On top of that, you only get to experience your first CM &amp; Prae one time, and there are spoilers in the fights. If you care about the story, asking a fresh CM or Prae runner to skip is actually completely selfish. These players are simply playing the game the way it's OBVIOUSLY intended to be played, watching cutscenes where they come.

If other players skip and lock them out of boss fights or yell at them for ""inconveniencing"" them, that pretty much makes them asshats. (And I've actually never seen ANYONE politely request a new person skip cutscenes, not ever.)

A fresh 50 is less likely to understand or use party finder for it to find a group specifically for story mode/cutscene watching. Up to CM, they've likely used Duty Finder for story many times with no jerks yelling at them about watching cutscenes. 

A fresh 50 is less likely to have an FC at all, probably doesn't have any linkshells, might not have any friends playing, and as such has a MUCH lower chance of building a story mode party than you have of building a speedrun party.

josebolt,nfl,1389045968.0,"Adding more teams to the playoffs isn't necessarily a bad thing. If fact the NFL is probably better suited for ""half"" the league making the playoffs when compared to other sports. Parity and Popularity in the NFL is what sets it apart from other sports. Any two teams can play in the superbowl and people will still watch. MLB, NBA, even my beloved NHL cant say that(not enough Canadains). That being said expanding the playoffs might be pointless. With only 16 games in a season the whole season can be seen as an expanded playoff where most games have value. 

Of course all of this is just my personal opinion. I also believe the NHL playoffs to be the most exciting in sports where tops seeds are guaranteed nothing. Over the years it has become less and less likely for teams with losing records to make the playoffs as the divide between 3rd and 8th seeds has gotten smaller. The NBA on the other hand has only 3 teams with winning records in playoff position in the Eastern Conference. Sometimes the playoff format may matter less than the actual quality of play, but thats a whole other issue. Then of course there is baseball which I think would benefit from the NBA/NHL format. From a business perspective you want as many fans as possible to have the playoff experience. You can have a winning team in baseball every year and never make the playoffs, this would never happen in the NFL. Call me crazy but 162 games is a long time if your team sucks. It might be better to end the misery and start the postseason. 

I also wonder if it was Robert Kraft who brought this up instead of Jerry Jones would there be as big of a backlash. Its hard not to think that this is some kind of ploy for a mediocre Cowboys team to make the playoffs more often and a ploy just to have more games to make more money. The problem is that pro sports often rely on casual and fair weather fans to fill seats. How many people here who attend games see the stands filled with people that you might wonder why there are even there? "

It's like LSU lives in the neighborhood with a big bully that everyone is afraid to confront except LSU. And Bama respects LSU because we've given them a few shiners just like they've given us. But, this bully also gets the hottest girl every year. Then, everyone else in the school doesn't care how many times you've beaten the bully or how close your fights were because he has the girl.""

-momoyome-,AskReddit,1389046146.0,"My 25th birthday (this past November).

It started the day before. Some idiot plowed into me on the freeway. It's now looking like it'll go into arbitration even though there was a police report and It's very clear I wasn't at fault. 

Then my boyfriend gets very sick and can't make my party. I bring him soup and make sure he's okay, I don't blame him at all, but the party would have been better with him there.

All my ""friends"" come down. They're pretty nasty and snippy to me at dinner. I order modestly (a hamburger and a margarita at TGIF). THE check comes and it gets passed around and people put down their money. As per custom in my group the birthday person never pays. Except this time. One girl, K, says we're $70 ish short. Looks at me. I make a very very modest wage with not many hours. $70 is *two weeks* worth of pay for me. 

So I throw down my card because I don't want to make a scene.

We walked over to Dave and Busters and K continues to make trouble by being passive aggressive. When we were done cashing in tickets she threw a basketball at my face. Hit me on the nose (which I've broken a number of times) and almost made me cry. 

We left and I had enough. She was pissed that I wanted to go home (it was around 11:30) and tormented me that I just wanted to leave to see my boyfriend (nope, he was I'll in bed and I wasn't gonna bother him). 

I haven't spoken to her since. She's sent me 3 cards since but none apologizing. I'm actually still really bummed about it because money is so sensitive with me and I felt so unloved and in cared for by my whole group of friends. I've hardly spoken to anyone from my group since and I don't have much intention to..."
alwayssunnyinvt,survivor,1389046147.0,"Eh, I see what you're saying but I would disagree to an extent. For me to love hating someone, I need to enjoy watching them on screen and/or (but mostly and) be impressed with the game they're playing. Parvati is a good example of that.... I dislike the ""flirt"" game and her personality type in general (I know too many people like her in real life), but she is goddamn brilliant at what she does you have to respect that. 

There was nothing enjoyable (to me) about watching Natalie preen and fawn over what a badass she is while getting dragged through the game by Parv/Cirie/Amanda. I know that manipulation is part of the game but I was really put off by the way she drew Jason and Erik in as ""friends"" and then utterly trashed them in confessionals. I know that if I were either of those guys I wouldn't feel the need to associate with that woman in real life, that's just an unnecessary level of mean. There's more to being a good villain than being obnoxious, self-absorbed and rude. 

And good god, that FTC question. Could it be the worst of all time? I think it's up there, just for how absurdly irrelevant and painfully awkward it was.

BrockN,deaf,1389046190.0,"&gt;I'm doing a project at University about redesigning the hearing aid to change the way people view those who wear hearing aids and hopefully remove the stigma associated with doing so. 

I'm curious, what stigma is there associated with wearing hearing aids?

Honestly this seems to be a little extravaganza. I don't think people who looks at hearing aids are concerned about how it looks but rather how well it works. I had a chat with my audiologist about why hearing aids are not as widespread as it should be and one of the reason is that most people who lose their hearing isn't too happy with the quality of the sound.

What you're describing isn't a redesign, its just a rehash of the same technology and design, except with a Apple or Calvin Klein logo on it. It's not a fashion item, it's a tool. If you want to add something to make it look pretty, why not consider an addon or clipon, something that wouldn't change the overrall design.

With that said, a good QB can make a bad coach look alot better, no doubt.

But I think Locker can be good. He showed that the first couple of games where he was healthy. The question all comes down to his health though. If he shows he can stay on the field next year (and performs to a good level), then he deserves to stay as our QB. Unlike Alex Smith was, he's still young and has plenty of time, so there's no reason to throw young blood in (not to mention we likely won't have anyone that young who can compete at the same level). If he doesn't show that, then his contract ends and we move on in the draft."

potato1,changemyview,1389046266.0,"Your first paragraph describes our current system, which is not an argument that competition in health care is impossible, only a statement that our current system isn't very effective at allowing competition to affect health care pricing.

[Another factor contributing to that problem is the complete opacity regarding and often arbitrary nature of drug pricing.](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec13/costlygenrics_11-02.html)

Neither of these things mean that it is impossible to have a competitive health care market, just that the current health care market isn't very efficient.

HaydenTheFox,funny,1389046332.0,"I feel like you guys are looking at it the wrong way. The focus of these films is less to tell the story of the Hobbit than it is to tell the story of Middle-Earth during that time period. You have to remember, The Hobbit is the story of a hobbit, and his view of the world. I feel like Jackson is trying to take a step back and flesh out the history of Middle-Earth through the lens of The Hobbit.

The Hobbit is my favorite book. Ever. I've read through it close to 30 times over my 21 years and it still catches me every time. But I'm okay with Jackson's interpretations. I like that he's fleshing it out. Every time I see posts like this, it's nothing but hate for the changes made, but I see it as sort of a refreshing take on it. I know how the story of The Hobbit goes - I want to see expansion, I want to see what else was going on.

**Blalock's Indie Rock Playlist** is my secret for cool hip music. Please check it out. BIRP.fm

**Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin - Tape Club**

This is a compilation of some of their demos, b-sides, etc. They're a really great band with an infectious sound. Listen to ""Pershing"" first.

**Big K.R.I.T. - King Remembered in Time**

This is by far my favorite K.R.I.T. project. If you've been sleeping on him, consider this a wake-up call. Fuck with this shit right here.

**Childish Gambino - Because the Internet**

It's growing on me.

**Nick Drake - Pink Moon**

This was my album of autumn 2013. Nick Drake is an extremely influential artist and this album is one of his most memorable.

**BIRP**

Fuck with it.

**R.L. Kelly**

R.L. Kelly seems kinda generic at first, but after a few listens she really grows on you. Download some stuff for free [here](http://rlkelly.bandcamp.com/).

**Beach Fossils - Clash the Truth**

The more I listen to it, the more I like it. Beach Fossils is a neat band to get into.

**Kendrick Lamar - Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City**

Yes, I'm still listening to it.

**Alex G (I think)**

Alex G did a split with R.L. Kelly so that's why I have it. It's not bad. I wouldn't go too far out of my way for it, either.

**of Montreal - Lousy with Sylvianbriar**

This album is a complete 180 from Paralytic stalks. Accesible, articulate, and infectious, this album may actually be my favorite release of 2013. S/o to Maxine for the limited ed. seafoam green vinyl.

**King Tuff - King Tuff**

I guess it's not wrong to call it punk. But it's more than that. It's endearing. It's pleasant. It's just rock 'n' roll, I guess. Give it a listen if you're into that sort of thing.

**Django Reinhardt - Djangology**

If you're into gypsy jazz or jazz guitar in general, you already know Django. If you're not, move along.

**I Have No Idea What This Is**

**Frank Ocean - Channel Orange**

It's cold here. This album makes it feel like summer, you know?

**Big Joe Turner - Jumpin with Joe**

It takes a while to get into the blues.

When only the outermost layer of a grain of rice (the husk) is removed, brown rice is produced. To produce white rice, the next layers underneath the husk (the bran layer and the germ) are removed, leaving mostly the starchy endosperm.

Several vitamins and dietary minerals are lost in this removal and the subsequent polishing process. A part of these missing nutrients, such as vitamin B1, vitamin B3, and iron are sometimes added back into the white rice making it ""enriched"", as food suppliers in the US are required to do by the Food and Drug Administration.

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389046686.0,"There's a lot of variation, and I'm not entirely sure how land is organized in many places. I'm more familiar with the coast (no terracing anyway, and even in the northern highlands of Peru there's not much terracing), and the situation on the coast is probably not unlike the situation anywhere. There's a mix of small land-holdings farmed by a family, moderate-sized landowners who have several fields, and massive corporate farms. During the Spanish *reduccion* (reduction) people were consolidated from diverse communities into large haciendas (basically a ranch), where the hacienda owners built towns and were responsible for their workers, and people worked the land owned by the hacienda owners. It was an indentured farmer kind of situation, and sort of feudal. After popular reform in the 1970s this system was disbanded and everyone was given a piece of land, as I understand it. But this meant that there were lots of poor families with tiny pieces of land, often not enough to even really make much income from, and there was a major push to move to cities too. So large agribusinesses began to snap up this land, and you now have it where corporate farms own huge tracts of land.

The coast is mostly cash crops. The valley I work in is fairly diverse, but maize and sugarcane (recent import) are the main crops. I've also seen artichokes (recent import), marigold (recent import?), various fruits I've never heard of outside of Peru, and a few other things. That's in the older part of the valley that is still fed by older canals (and some newish ones). In the area where I work there was a huge irrigation project in the 90s that allowed parts of the desert to be farmed for the first time, and there are now massive modern fields. The fields on the north entrance to the valley I work in (Virú) are all asparagus (recent import), and chances are if you buy out-of-season asparagus in North America, it comes from either those fields or Mexico. There's a large grove of avocado tees on the south margin of the valley. But in the older parts of the north coast valleys I would say that sugarcane is the main crop, and that's the only thing I've seen in the Chicama Valley, which is very large. Some valleys have rice fields in the wetter middle parts of the valley, too. People have chickens everywhere and I think there are large industrial chicken farms. Goat and duck are also common food on the north coast. I'm just kind of going on and on here as I remember things, but basically the agricultural economy of Peru today is a diverse mix of cash crops and subsistence/food crops (some indigenous, some not), and a mix of corporate farms and small land holdings. I think the highlands has less corporate farms and more individual holdings because there tends to be smaller pockets of land available for farming."

All that aside, I really hate how the logo across the bottom of the new Pebble unbalances the whole thing.  It might actually be decent looking if the display took up the whole face.  And yes, I understand the technical limitations of the display connections, but they should have figured out how to do what LG did with the G2 and split the connections to the top and bottom to balance the face.  Not sure if that's possible with e-ink (G2 is IPS), but it would have made a huge difference visually to not have the logo across the bottom."

LydiasBits,AskWomen,1389046763.0,"Given she has done it before, and it sounds like you are larger, my main suggestion beyond all of the usual ones would be to take some time with her and build up to your circumference.  Use some vibrators or butt plugs to build up. Especially, if she is willing to wear a plug for a while before you enter her (maybe an hour or so) for a few days while she relaxes. 

I had one SO back in college who was the largest I had ever had. We tried anal a couple of times but it was just a no go until I used a plug over the course of a couple of weeks to be comfortable with his girth. It was still a bit uncomfortable for a couple of minutes BUT I agreed to keep going if he would just keep it in me for a few minutes with very limited movement - just enough, slowly, to keep him hard. It ended up being fine. I didn't have any pain but had a definite feeling of being full and like my hole was stretched way open. 

I did this to prep for ass play with him a few times. Butt plug, warm bath, masturbation. Let him work my rabbit vibe which is pretty sizable in my ass (with a condom) for foreplay. 

We enjoyed anal a few times but it wasn't as enjoyable for me (or him) as I have enjoyed with smaller partners.  He kept his movements fairly slow and easy - no jackhammer!  

Also, I preferred to be in a missionary position only for this with him. Used a very flat pillow under my ass to prop it up a bit.

Spishal_K,explainlikeimfive,1389046791.0,"Bitcoins are a currency that are created and signed by users on the network, basically every time one is created or transmitted the transaction has to be verified by a fair number of users to be valid. Once a transaction is deemed valid it goes through and money changes hands.

The value of bitcoins fluctuate for the same reasons regular currencies do, supply/demand, value compared to goods, etc etc. When bitcoin became popular as an underground currency that's when the price started to actually become worth something. After that the spikes you see are from ""block difficulty increases"" which basically means every time the global amount of bitcoins hits a certain amount, the amount of processing power needed to generate another ""block"" and reward the generator with 50 bitcoins.

Username_of_Sean,AskMen,1389046800.0,"My girl is collared to me. She obeys me, giving me power over what she does, but I also have a responsibility to ensure her needs are taken care of, which means making sure she eats and sleeps, feels safe and secure, etc... Some of her needs are basic physical needs and some are kink needs. Without regular spankings, she will actually start to have a harder time concentrating on everyday things, for example.

With power comes responsibility. This is why it's a power *exchange*. She gives me power, but it's exchanged for another kind of power, my responsibility to her. It's an exchange of trust, one being trusted to obey and the other being trusted to take care of the other. It's a very intimate bond that ties the two together."

s54b32dd,bootroom,1389046808.0,"Your free kick style looks very similar to Beckham's, in the sense that you appear to mostly be striking with your instep, and looking for a top curve on the ball. It sounds like a lot of people here are telling you to use standard striking form, knee over the ball, etc., but in my experience, you're not trying to strike the ball dead on/without spin, which makes a laces strike far from ideal.

If you watch Beckham's run-up/follow through on his penalties, you can see that he nearly always approaches the kick from nearly a 90-degree angle to the goal, places his plant foot so the toe is even with the ball, and strikes the ball with an inside-out motion, coming across the ball with his instep, and finishing on the striking leg, using his follow through to provide a bit of top spin on the ball.

I have a similar style place kick that I use mainly for corners, to arc the ball over the near post defenders and drop it just in front of the goalkeeper at the 6 yard box; it's something I've developed over years of practice, and involves, more than anything, repetition. I'll attempt to describe my technique.

In my experience, you should be attempting to strike the ball in the middle, just below the dead center of the ball. Your plant foot should be placed with the tip of your toe about even with where the ball contacts the ground, and about 8-12"" to the left (assuming you're planting with your left foot). From there, you want to keep your striking foot and knee slightly flexed/bent, turning your striking toe slightly out and down. From there, you're looking to contact the ball somewhere between the big toe joint and the top of your arch; on my foot, there is a flat bone connecting the toe joint and arch on my instep. Use that portion of your foot, contacting the ball while your foot moves through the ball, from the center to just right of the center (on the follow through).

I learned this after a couple days studying youtube vids of Beckham's form and then replicating it over years of competitive play. Don't expect it to be an instant change. Study your player of choice, note their body position (including arms and torso) in their run-up, at the moment of contact, and on follow through. Then try to emulate it.

Good luck!

edit to add:
**IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THE DIRECTION THE TOE ON YOUR PLANT FOOT IS FACING**, as this will decide the ultimate angle your striking foot contacts the ball at, and as a result, the direction of your shot. In general, you want the toe of your plant foot to be aimed at the spot you're trying to hit. To put the ball higher in the air, move your plant foot back little by little. To put the ball lower, move your plant foot forward in relation to the ball. Also play around with your angle of attack on your shot. Your run-up doesn't have to come from immediately behind the ball; rather, in many cases, you're approaching the ball at a slight angle to the direction you ultimately plan to hit it. This helps your contact to come across the ball, allowing you to put the desired spin that allows it to curve around/over the top of walls/defenders.

**In looking at your technique**, you are not approaching the ball at enough of an angle; your run-up is too straight, which means you are not in the proper body position to strike the ball with the inside of your foot, create the spin you're looking for, and put any power behind it. move further left, and run up from more of an angle, instead trusting the angle of your plant foot to guide the ball where you are trying to place it. This will allow you to strike the ball solidly with your instep and still allow for the power you're looking for. If you watch Beckham/tutorials on his form, he approaches the ball somewhere between 60 and 90 degrees to the left of the direction he plans to kick it (when he is taking the kick with his right foot). Give that adjusted run-up a try for a bit, and see how that affects your form/follow through/consistency."

madhjsp,CFB,1389047014.0,"I actually went the unorthodox route and transitioned from snare to bass during my 4th year, rather than the reverse direction (it was the only drum I hadn't played during my combined high school &amp; college drumline careers, and there was an open spot on the line, so I gave it a go and got the spot). The biggest difference that stood out to me was that you *must* be able to count and keep time perfectly on your own, since you are playing fewer notes (compared to, say, a snare or tenor) and you are the only person on the drumline playing your part. Runs up and down the bassline don't work if each individual drummer doesn't count their rests precisely. It's also very important to have a strong internal metronome, especially when playing charts that have changes in tempos, meters, or both. The low frequencies of the bass drums project more than any other instrument on the line, so everyone else in the band will be listening to them to help keep time. If they are off, the whole band sounds off, and everyone in the stadium will be able to tell.

Not that having a good internal sense of timing and tempo aren't important for the other drums (obviously, they are), but I'd say that they are absolutely paramount for bass. I'm sure other people who had more experience playing bass can offer more advice, but hopefully that helps!"

It was an independent society that developed during the Early Intermediate Period, a time when there was a lot of local, regional development and not so much pan-Andean interaction. And the Huamachuco basin is geographically separate from the basins to the north and south, and each of those basins developed independently. I will try to dig up a few of my old supervisor's papers to see if I can add anything. It's been a while since I looked at them.

As for quinoa, I'm really not sure. I also haven't seen it being eaten very much, though maybe it is more common in the south and I haven't spent much time there."

Privilege in that sense exists - where people go wrong about it is that they equate this ""privilege"" with something akin to original sin that means somebody who benefits from some kind of privilege isn't allowed to have an opinion on a policy position or have their own preferences on any number of topics.  

So, ""privileged"" people aren't allowed to have opinions w/r/t affirmative action, because less-privileged people's opinions are somehow more worthwhile, regardless of the empirical evidence on offer.  The end goal is to push their own policy and political preferences on others with a rhetorical/discursive tactic that silences any opposition. In short, ""check your privilege"" is synonymous with ""[g]ive me my affirmative action/sinicural *-studies tenured position/huge grant to my non-profit to not do very much."" 

Note that it is that bourgeosie class of people who benefit the most from large programs to remediate ""privilege"" and therefore talk the loudest on these issues.  The direct beneficiaries of redistributive programs and policies, who tend to think (broad brush here) a lot more in terms of individual responsibility and in old-left terms of economic redistribution and racial equality than modern/pomo notions of structural, implicit racism that can only be uprooted if we keep paying the middle-men to expiate the sin of privilege."

gerusz,fatpeoplestories,1389047377.0,"The scooter has a maximal performance, P_max.

Performance is the product of force and velocity.

The force the engine has to counter is the friction of the wheels which is directly proportional to the total weight (the coefficient is mu).

At the speeds a mobility scooter can achieve air drag is negligible.

There's also usually a maximal speed that the engine can achieve, despite it not being strained to the maximum.

There is another important limit, the maximal torque (tau_max) of the engine, the gear ratio (gr) and the wheel radius (r_w). If (tau_max \* gr / r_w) is smaller than the rolling friction, the scooter will stop. If it's smaller than the stationary friction, it won't start.

Hence:

* F_friction = mu \* g \* (w_scooter + w_ham);
* v_max = min(v_max_scooter, Pmax / F_friction) if tau_max \* gr / r_w &gt; F_friction;
* v_ max = 0 otherwise. (And if the ham tries too much, the engine will give up)

Of course, this assumes that the bottleneck is the engine. For some scooters the structural components will give up first. Or the bearings.

Also, this assumes spherical hams in vacuum, of which only the first one is usually true."

Geohump,AskReddit,1389047418.0,"Her breast fell off:

From this article:  http://www.atlantamagazine.com/features/2012/02/01/dr-otis-brawley/page/2

An excerpt from ""How We Do Harm: A Doctor Breaks Ranks About Being Sick in America"" by Otis Webb Brawley, M.D., with Paul Goldberg

She walks through the emergency-room doors sometime in the early morning. In a plastic bag, she carries an object wrapped in a moist towel.

She is not bleeding. She is not in shock. Her vital signs are okay. There is no reason to think that she will collapse on the spot. Since she is not truly an emergency patient, she is triaged to the back of the line, and other folks, those in immediate distress, get in for treatment ahead of her. She waits on a gurney in a cavernous green hallway.

The “chief complaint” on her chart at Grady Memorial Hospital, in Downtown Atlanta, might have set off a wave of nausea in a hospital at a white suburb or almost any place in the civilized world. It reads, “**My breast has fallen off. Can you reattach it?”**

She waits for at least four hours—likely, five or six. The triage nurse doesn’t seek to determine the whereabouts of the breast.   Obviously, the breast is in the bag.

I am making rounds on the tenth floor when I get a page from Tammie Quest in the ER.

At Grady, we take care of patients who can’t pay, patients no one wants. They come to us with their bleeding wounds, their run-amok diabetes, their end-stage tumors, their drama. You deal with this wreckage for a while and you develop a coping mechanism. You detach. That’s why many doctors, nurses, and social workers here can come off as if they have departed for a less turbulent planet.

Tammie is not like that. She emotes, and I like having her as the queen of ER—an experienced black woman who gives a shit. When Dr. Quest pages me, I know it isn’t because she needs a social interaction. It has to be something serious.

Holy Shit,” I say to Bill Bernstein and, more so, to myself.

[portions deleted]

I introduce myself to a trim, middle-aged black woman, not unattractive, wearing a blue examination gown conspicuously stamped “Grady.” (At Grady, things like gowns, infusion pumps, and money have a tendency to vanish.)

From the moment Tammie paged me, I knew that the situation had to be more than a run-of-the-mill emergency. This patient clearly is not about to die on the examination table. She doesn’t need emergency treatment. Before anything, she needs somebody to talk to. She needs attention, both medical and human.

The patient, Edna Riggs, is fifty-three. She works for the phone company and lives on the southeast side of Atlanta.

Sitting on an exam table, she looks placid. When she extends her hand, it feels limp. She makes fleeting eye contact. This is depression, maybe. Shame does the same thing, as does a sense of doom. ""Fatalism"" is the word doctors have repurposed to describe this last form of alienation.

In medicine, we speak a language of our own, and Edna’s physical problem has a name in doctorese: automastectomy. It’s a fancy way of saying that the patient’s breast has fallen off by itself.

An automastectomy can occur when a tumor grows so big and so deep that it cuts off the blood supply from the chest to the breast. Denied oxygen, breast tissue dies and the breast starts to detach from the chest wall. At places such as Grady, automastectomies are seen a couple of times a year, often enough to be taken in stride.

I cringe at the thought that Edna has kept that package next to her on the gurney in the ER for hours.

I ask how long has she had a “breast problem.”

She first felt something in her breast when her son was in second grade, she replies. It has grown over the years. She speaks correct English, not the language of the streets. She sounds like someone who has had schooling, a person who reads. Her hair is clean and combed, she is dressed neatly.

What grade is her son in now?

Eleventh.

I don’t react, not visibly. She has known she had a problem for nine years—why did she do nothing?

I ask Edna’s permission to examine her. She nods. I ask her to lie down, my entourage gathering around.

I help her remove her right arm from the gown, trying to respect her modesty and preserve as much dignity as possible. I undrape the right breast, or the place where the right breast had been. The chest wall is now rugged. I see yellowish fibrous tissue and dry blood. There is the unforgettable smell of anaerobic bacteria. The wound is infected.

I reach for examination gloves. I palpate her chest wall and feel under her armpit, looking for evidence of enlarged nodes. After examining the breast wall, I look in the towel. Her amputated breast could fit on her chest as if it were a puzzle piece.

I am not looking forward to Edna’s repeating her request to reattach the breast. If she asks directly, I will have to say that this is not possible and explain why not. My preference is to move slowly, to let her adjust, to make her comfortable with me, with receiving medical care for her condition. I fear that she will get up, leave, and never return. Fortunately, Edna doesn’t repeat her request. Perhaps the magnitude of the problem confronting her is starting to sink in.

Edna’s breast cancer has been growing for at least nine years. It’s unheard of that cancer such as this would be anything but metastatic. The disease has to have disseminated to her bones, lungs, brain, liver. I feel a wave of frustration and anger.

Another day at Grady. Here I sit, talking with a patient whom we probably would have cured nine years earlier, and today I will have to tell her that she has a terminal disease.

The rest is logistics. I arrange for the pathology and radiology to get confirmation. I ask Bill Bernstein to talk with Edna, to take a full history, to perform a full examination. The objective is to rule out neurologic problems from spread of the disease to the brain or spine, to look for other evidence of problems caused by the disease.

If you take me aside and ask why I’m withdrawing from the scene, I will say that I am trying to awaken Bill’s compassion. But it is something else as well, something about me. I am afraid of growing callous. I acknowledge this readily, as a means of staving it off. I am trying to avoid accepting the unnecessary loss of yet another life. In the case of Edna Riggs, the abstract, scholarly term ""health disparities"" acquires a very real smell of a rotting breast.

I and the resident, start arranging to confirm the diagnosis and get Edna ready for treatment. We will fight, and we will lose. Metastatic breast cancer always wins. We have drugs to decrease pain and even make most people live longer, but we can beat breast cancer only when it’s caught early.

We admit Edna Riggs into the hospital, to get the tests done and to start antibiotic treatment of the infected wound. We could have done the workup without admitting her, but I fear that she will leave the system as abruptly as she entered. Psychological and emotional support are legitimate reasons for admittance, though most insurance companies and Medicaid would disagree.

As she starts to trust me, Edna tells me how frightened she was when she found a lump in her breast. Right away, she knew it was breast cancer, and in her experience, everyone who got breast cancer died quickly, painfully. Insurance problems kept her away from the doctor, as did the fear of dying. She knew she would die after going to the doctor. Several of her friends had.

**Early on, Edna had some insurance, which didn’t do her any good. Her employer wouldn’t let her take just two or three hours of sick leave to go to the doctor. If she needed to take sick leave, she had to take it in increments of one day. This guaranteed that an employee would exhaust all the leave quickly. If Edna had been fired for taking time off after exhausting her sick leave, her three kids, too, would have lost support and insurance**

Acknowledging the physical problem and facing the consequences became increasingly difficult. Edna tells me that she feared the disease, but she also feared the system. Would the doctors scold her? Would they experiment on her? Would they give her drugs that caused nausea, vomiting, hair loss? Would the hospital kill her?

Edna’s decision to stay out of the medical system was about fear: fear of breast cancer, fear of the medical profession, fear of losing the roof over her kids’ heads. Fear intensified after her employer started to require copayments from workers who wanted to be insured. This extra $3,000 a year made health insurance too expensive to keep.

Payment for medical services and sick-leave policies determine the quality of service we receive. Several years ago, my research team at the American Cancer Society published data showing that people diagnosed with cancer who had no insurance or were insured through Medicaid were 1.6 times more likely to die in five years as those with private insurance.

In breast cancer, patients with private insurance were more likely to be diagnosed with Stage I breast cancer than those who had no insurance or were receiving Medicaid.

**I have seen poor breast cancer patients choose mastectomy (surgical removal of the entire breast) over a lumpectomy (removal of the tumor) because of employer sick-leave policies. A woman who chooses a lumpectomy must also receive radiation, which has to be given daily, Monday through Friday, for six to eight weeks. The treatment requires fifteen minutes in the clinic, but it’s done only during business hours. Unfortunately, this less disfiguring treatment is hardly an option for a woman who knows that longer postoperative treatment will cause her to lose her job.**

Much of the problem is that poor people don’t get care that would be likely to help them. The reasons for this are complex. Perhaps they can’t get care, or don’t know where care is available, or haven’t been offered insurance or steady access to care by their job or social services."

stampepk,YAwriters,1389047470.0,"Oh wow, that's incredibly similar to my life. Just, I wasn't a jock in high school. :)

Ohio's still a very big industrial area, so a lot of his friends (and their parents) probably opted to go to [trade school](http://www.mvctc.com/home) for the last two years of HS and started working in factories after graduation. Nearly all of my high school friends work in factories, though a few became teachers. Where I'm from, no one really sees an office job as desirable. 

It kind of sounds like Troy or Piqua, Ohio, which are two neighboring suburbs of Dayton. The population is around 20k for each, and it's surrounded by farmland. It's a reasonable drive to Cinci and Columbus airports, but really close to Dayton international, though it's only considered international because of its flights to Canada.

leeceia,AskWomen,1389047721.0,"I quite agree with your assessment. 

I think that have pursued and traditionally pursue are often confused. 

I think there's confusion as to the terms; with women it seems like they go for what they want, but they have to really be interested in the guy, where as guys seem to define it more in terms of casual relationships and serious relationships - hitting on people in clubs and bars through to asking for long term relationships. Not always obviously, but there definitely is that misinterpretation. 

I think also what that process consists of is often defined differently. I don't really feel I can claim to be the pursuer, but I do feel like I am forward. I may not ask anyone out directly, because that often leads to the guy backing off more, but I will drop hints, close space, flirt hardcore etc. Socially, that's as aggressive as I feel I can be - again, I'm not counting that as pursuing. But for a lot of women, it's similar. There's a lot of back and forth, the ball is almost always back in their court. With men, it's a lot easier to be more direct. The classic tropes of grand gestures and even going so far as to beg are seen as normal for guys. I get the feeling that a lot of women are getting braver, but we kind of forget how borderline stalking is acceptable for men, and that's what it's called when women do it. "
The66Ripper,dayz,1389047726.0,"it's only based upon distance, not side to side. The zeroing on the long range scope goes from 100m to 800m. If you shoot at a zombie/player's head 100m away with your zero on 200, it will go a few inches above it. If it is at 200 and the player/zombie is 100 away it will hit mid torso/stomach. You have to eyeball range, no rangefinders in game yet. 

The easiest way to figure it out is to go to a secluded town and snipe all of the zombies you see from a hill.

Here's the thing, you have to be who you are.  You have to be what you want to be.  There's already serious damage done to you by changing and now wondering if you should change back.  You're a human being, not a paper doll with different outfits.

I think what you should tell her is that you're having a problem with your own identity and you need time and likely some help figuring it out.  Don't think of it as changing back, or changing at all.  Think of it as discovering what makes you happy, what makes you work, what you like and don't like.  Work from that platform first, compromise as best as you can later.

And you know what, if suddenly she doesn't fit into what makes you happy, then so be it.  At least you'll know.  But good grief, don't put yourself through that yo-yo of pleasing someone else.  You'll be left adrift and emotionally homeless, and then she'll have more reason to dislike you because you'll be so confused you won't be able to react to anything.

See a therapist, find out who you are first."

the_lemon_outlaw,AskWomen,1389047795.0,"I once dreamt that I had to fly back to Italy because I had forgotten all my stuff there after a holiday. In the plane, I was watching a documentary on wombats when the narrator said something like: ""wombats are very intelligent animals, sometimes it almost seems as if they understand humans"". At that moment, the wombat turned his head to the camera and said: ""I believe I left something in the lobby"" in a Flemish accent (I am Dutch, Flemish is sort of a dialect of our language). I laughed myself awake.  
  
It's a bit far-fetched because I could never fly back to a country if I had forgotten all my stuff, including my wallet. Also, wombats cannot talk. Nor would they know the word 'lobby'.

Aldairion,aww,1389047900.0,"Agree for the most part, just that they weren't bred ""for aggression"" so much as for high drive, high intelligence, tenacity and resiliency (like all terriers) and just like any animal, a need for mental stimulation.
-Which of course, under certain circumstances, can more easily manifest as neuroticism or aggression. In the same way, highly intelligent children are far more likely to be neurotic than their more average counterparts).

Otherwise, I'm totally on board. A car, a gun, or even a steak knife can be dangerous if they are used improperly, but excellent and useful when kept by those who are educated and responsible- and know how to think.

Unfortunately, pit bulls are far and away the most highly abused and mistreated breed. The wrong people often get them for the wrong reasons. But it's super hasty and irresponsible to generalize and say that the breed is *inherently* bad. If border collies were so highly abused, we would probably see a lot of vicious border collies. Many people want them for the wrong reasons, and *that* is what makes a dangerous dog. 

If in doubt, read the stance of the AVMA on the issue- it has less to do with inherent breed traits, and MUCH more to do with what we do with them. It just baffles me how people want to point fingers at a breed instead of looking to OURSELVES and what we've done to make the worst of something awesome!

In terms of being treated differently, most women I met were surprised and applauded me for being so ""health-conscious"". Most guys I've met are like, ""dude...so you can't even have like...an In'n'Out burger every so often?  That sucks.""

Questions regarding my masculinity were never brought up, though in fairness, I'm a fairly fit 5'11"" 190 lbs so my physicality generally trumps those questions.

&gt;“[We] are absolutely confident that 25 megs is going to be enough, more than enough, for the average household.”

One more thing that might be worth bearing in mind. The bike doesn't have helmet locks (which I find a bit annoying). Some of the largest top boxes can take two helmets, but of course your luggage will be full. [This guy](http://www.ebay.com/usr/simonchantw_gmail) sells locks on eBay which fasten under the upper mounting of the rear shocks. They are rather nicely made. You would need one for the right and one for the left if you go down this route. An alternative is to chain your helmets to the bike, but I found this more convenient."

Sea Shepherd was in Norwegian territorial waters and rammed the K/V *Andenes*. I linked sources showing that Sea Shepherd has used ramming as a tactic before. They have sabotaged and scuttled ships in the past as well. The warning shots were fired before the collision as the *Andenes* is off in the distance. I don't see them dropping anything off nor is there any mention anywhere of the *Whales Forever* suffering explosive damage. They clearly have damage to the bow while the *Andenes* has a gash on her port side, showing the *Whales Forever* did the ramming. That video is extremely edited in a way that paints SS as victims. The ""You're going to fire a shot into our ship"" quote when they were clearly firing warning shots is pretty obvious.

I've also already handled a few simple things like a [crappy](http://i.imgur.com/Ito1cyf.jpeg) job done by a previous owner in my basement workroom.  That light fixture was the only thing on that entire circuit.  The adjacent laundry room had the ceiling light wired with the wire run through the [air return](http://www.imgur.com/4itqITF.jpeg).  I rewired them both from box to fixtures and eliminated that piece of wiring through the air return.  Supported through the joists, stapled within 12"" of the junction box, used NM clamps in the knockouts.  I want there to be no question that I'm doing this right.

Right here, I'm just trying to eliminate the need for five solid wires to be twisted together or multiple connections.

It is sad you feel so little respect towards men and women who do this as a profession that you feel entitled to see their performances without paying.

No, it does not ""boggle the mind."" In your words, she

&gt;totally makes legitimate points

Piracy is making the industry suffer. That is a fact. It is no stretch of the imagination to see the adult industry collapse in the future if this happens.

Siri, and other people in the industry, are fully entitled to be angry that people are stealing their work without paying. If you are incapable of understanding that, then you are a sad, sad person.

The internet *does* owe her and other performers something. We *are* stealing from the industry. That is a fact.

&gt;It's like getting Lars Ulrich to do an AMA and you wanna ask him about awesome groupie stories, how he came up with that one drum solo and how he got started in Metallica, and he wants to shame you for pirating his material.

I don't know how much Metallica is pirated these days off of the top of my head. But, first off, there is something wrong with your analogy. Siri has brought up these points when asked what her favorite tube site was. She was literally asked ""Hey Siri, what is your favorite website that facilitates stealing from you?"" and she answered that she does not like them.

If Lars was asked in an AMA, ""Hey Lars, what is your favorite music stealing site?"", then he would have every right to complain about music piracy.

Hell, he would have every right to complain even if not asked.

As for car shopping... $10k to $20k is a very wide range. 

That said you can get a really nice and only a few years old Impreza for $15k-ish in most markets, though in your area they might command higher prices because they're so popular.

$20k will get you a Grand Cherokee about 5 years old. That'd be the previous body style Grand Cherokee, and the build quality on them is pretty awful. Horrible gas mileage, unreliable, high repair costs.

At range, PDW's are out of the question. Simple as that. From 100hrs of play so far, even in CQB, I have NEVER had a situation where I thought ""Damn, I totally would have killed that guy if I had a PDW instead of this stupid carbine."" 

If you really want to be effective at range, use a DMR. They are a bit underpowered at the moment, especially in CQB, but you will be much more successful at range with a DMR than a carbine. I haven't done too much with the DMRs, so I couldn't tell you which one is better at what task, but I believe they all have similar damage and drop-off, so pretty much any of them would be useful at range."

I sit down to pee and I see that the person in the next stall is standing up facing the toilet. Er... okay. We have some transwomen so it's not that weird. 

Anyway, I'm peeing and a big ass spider runs under the door. HUGE. So I stomp on it. And then I realize that wasn't a spider, because I am peeling hair off the bottom of my shoe, not dead spider. 

And so I look at the space under the stall wall a little more closely. The woman in the next stall is trimming her pubes. At this point she must notice the noise I'm making shaking my foot and trying to get her pubes off my shoe. She says, ""Oh I'm sorry about that! This guy I've been trying to hook up with since third week just asked me out after class so I borrowed the Learning Center's scissors to give myself a quick trim!""

3. And you missed my point that piracy *is* illegal. Something that is illegal *should not* come with the territory.

And, while it is true that I have no doubt that 

&gt;SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME HAVE BEEN COPIED, REVISED, EDITED or PIRATED, hell even STOLEN in one way or another

that argument in no way, shape, or form justifies piracy. Saying crimes have always happened does not mean that they should continue happening.

Additionally, the invention of the internet has increased the volume of piracy. Therefore, it is truly a new criminal frontier. Comparing internet piracy to pre-internet piracy is invalid because of the sheer volume that happens today, and the fact that the technologies are different.

Piracy is stealing, bro. That is a simple fact. It boggles my mind that you do not understand that.

That just adds to the sadness of the situation for him, in my opinion. It's way worse being in the unrequited love person's shoes. You feel a intimacy and closeness to that person that they don't feel for you. Everything they say and do will impact you. If I was the loved girl in this situation, I would stay far away from him after this, to minimize the damage.

I actually lost a mutual friend because of this situation when I was the person who had feelings for the other person. That still breaks my heart. I really wanted to keep that friendship, but they were very close friends and it just couldn't work. 

I hate unrequited love so much. It's not even love, but this stupid fantasy that keeps going on in your head. I don't believe it's real love. It comes from such a lonely place.

If this guy was able to shake it off, we probably still wouldn't be friends because the guy would have changed immeasurably. Friendships are delicate and a shift in someone's personality can change the dynamic to the point that a relationship is no longer possible. 

Bottom line - people come and go. Try not to overdramatize it. I feel as I get older, I am much quicker to act with compassion and not drag out a bad situation - regardless of who is the one getting hurt.

Either you're using different scales (which are all calibrated different and therefore are all wrong) or something more serious is going on.  I'd go to a doctor if my weight was jumping up and down like that.

It took me ~6 months to go from 141 to 174 and then another 2 months to cut down to 157.  If you're gaining and losing nearly the same amount in one month, something is seriously wrong."

It should be used to inform political decision-making. What science is currently indicating to us is that we are rapidly tarnishing our ecosystem in a whole host of ways, and that the consequences of this are unknown in detail but are likely catastrophic. 

There is a movement to obfuscate this picture that scientific research is resolving for us. This movement comes from the right. This movement should be attacked.

I don't care about any political party, but Republicans are the problem on this issue. I could give a shit if it helps Democrats to combat the anti-science campaign, but if it helps politicians of whatever stripe take meaningful action, that's a good thing.

My advice would be to read books or short stories written in that time period and set in said period. That's likely to have the smallest possible amount of anachronistic language use.

[This](http://revolution-computing.typepad.com/.a/6a010534b1db25970b0168e8d65922970c-pi) image post shows anachronism in works set during WWI. The bottom left was written in 1919 and hence held to be essentially true to the time, as a work written in 2009 set in 2004 would be. Really this ties to what I said above, read contemporary literature like *The Great Gatsby*, [*Manhattan Transfer*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Transfer_(novel\)), or [*The Age of Innocence*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Innocence).

I stopped playing when school politics got in the way. I played for the rival club before high school, and was a regional representative wicketkeeper while the captain never kept before and just wanted to for fun, so he dropped me from the team.

The current pornography industry is unfairly priced. I will admit that. But, that is *because piracy is killing it*. Heavily pricing it like that is how they survive.

Fetish paysites are Netflix's pornography equivalent. Granted, the selection each individual site offers pales in comparison to the behemoth that is Netflix. But that does not change the fact that pay pornography sites are necessary to support the industry.

Do you expect pornographers to work for next to nothing?

jarwes,raisedbynarcissists,1389050322.0,"ndad used to come home drunk and beat the hell out of nmom.  I would try to stop/distract him and he would chase me out of the house and into the woods or cornfield (we lived in a rural area).  He always would assume I was running to my grandparents house (his parents) who were just 1/4 of a mile away.  He'd hope in his car and go racing down the road to get there before I did.  

I usually didn't go there as it didn't do any good, they never stopped him, so I would just hide in the woods or cornfield.  He would stop every so often and threaten me with various assorted punishments (up to and including 'taking me out of this world') until he got tired and eventually went back in the house to pass out.  If it was warm I'd just sleep in the yard by the edge of the woods/cornfield so I could run if need be, during winter I'd crawl in the car and wait a bit until I felt it was 'safe' to sneak back in the house.  

Usually the next morning he would have calmed down and pretty much act like nothing happened, so I'm not so sure how real these threats where, but as a young teenager they felt pretty real at the time.  This usually happened several times a year,  I really can't remember how many times.  It's all kinda foggy now."

For instance in France, ~~Jews make up less than 1% of the population but are victims to 70% of Frances hate crimes~~. Can't find a source on that atm but antisemitic hate crimes are a common occurrence in France and are [on the rise](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3275519.stm).

If you are in college, sit in on a meeting by its BDS chapter and talk with the people there. Antisemitism has infected the left, and it is still alive and thriving. History shows us that times when it seems antisemitism is gone, it's really a barrel of gunpowder.

For the record, cold weather is not like hot weather; I've lived in Las Vegas, Tampa Bay, and Albuquerque. I know heat. I live in Minnesota now, and cold is not like heat, because cold takes a totally different attitude to conquer.

You have to treat cold almost like Bane treats darkness in the Dark Knight Rises. At a certain point, how you react to the cold defines you. It molds you, you learn to cope with it, to overcome it, and even to enjoy it. It becomes a part of you in a way that coping with heat never does.

Faithhandler,funny,1389050689.0,"I expressed my disgust at the poor joke. I also attacked the character of those who would make such a joke. I never stated you can't make such jokes. I mostly just found it amusing that you're so bothered that I think the joke is terrible and offensive, and that you felt the need to get on some pedestal and bother me as a result of it. I don't think it's funny to make jokes about victims of severe neurosis. I don't think it's funny to make light of something so heavy. Dark humor can be great, but the thing about dark humor is that it never makes light of the problem, if it did, it just becomes shock humor at best, which is totally different. The problem is that few people, yourself included, seem to be able to differentiate between the two. 

And uh, I don't think anorexia is funny. I'm not a comedian, but, I imagine it's possible to make a joke about anorexia that is funny, but doesn't actually make fun of anorexics. I'd imagine so, anyway. It seems feasible, I can just say that this isn't it. This just ridicules anorexics. "

But as someone with a lot of friends and family and even a prior SO who are cops... They're just as sickened, and more. I've talked to them about this, about what it means, and the best they could do was assure me that it wouldn't be at their hands, on their watch.

... and I take it with a grain of salt. Cops are very akin to soldiers, and so are surgeons, for that matter. We all respect the chain-of-command, and go as far as our leash allows us. 

My 'leash' is 'First do no harm.' The soldiers' is 'Take that next hill, whatever the cost.' The cops'... Well, it used to be 'protect &amp; serve.' Now it's 'come home safe tonight.'

See that shift? Happened in one generation. I've witnessed it personally in the difference between my retired police chief uncle, one of the bravest and most selfless people I've ever met... And my slightly older cousin, the soldier-turned-Boston-PD-cop. 

Both brave. Both with good intention. My uncle--if the thing that happened in the article happened under him, all hell would've followed.
My cousin--if his name was in this article, I would've nodded... Puked first, then nodded and said 'yep. He'd think that was okay.'

None of my residents, but in other programs, surg and non-surg alike, I've met people who'd cave to the littlest bit of authority a cop threw out, agree to all kinds of atrocious shit...

The lesson here is that if you, as a physician, run up against a cop wanting to pull ANY kind of BS... Put your foot down. You will be shocked how high they jump when you say 'Boo!' They are more scared of you, I promise... Proved it today when I had a GSW in my ER and I told a detective twice my age to GTFO my trauma bay and I'll bring you the bullet when I'm ready, bitch!

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389050704.0,"Hrm, there's a few things to take out of this here. First, the Inca were just one society in the Andes (which we generally define as the highlands and coastal region, from about Ecuador to northern Chile) and the Andes were incredibly diverse. And the Amazon was diverse too but we don't talk about Amazonian societies much, and they aren't well studied. There were only about 40,000 Inca, and what we can call Inca began around A.D. 1200 in the Cuzco basin, with the city of Cuzco being their capital. Around A.D. 1450 they began to build an empire and expanded rapidly. 

So to answer that part of your question, there independent societies and states and at least one empire (the Chimú) all around the Inca, and the Inca conquered some by war, some by negotiation and convincing them that it was best to just let themselves be conquered either because the Inca were rich and powerful so it can be beneficial to join them, or because the Inca were rich and powerful so they would crush them if they didn't. But there was certainly a lot of warfare, too, and the Inca and Chimú fought a long war that the Chimú lost around A.D. 1470. There was no ""empty"" or virgin land when the Inca began to expand, and the region had been populated for at least 10,000 years by the time the Inca began to develop.

I don't like the term ""civilization"" because it implies bounded, unchanging political and cultural entities based on our modern idea of nation-states, so I generally refer to groups as societies. And yes, there were societies living all around the Inca, and others in the places beyond where the Inca captured. To the north, in Ecuador and Colombia, there were major societies, but they aren't very well studied. South of the Inca heartland they conquered some small kingdoms, and then there were hunter-gatherers (the Mapuche) in southern Chile and Argentina, and the Inca didn't conquer them. The Amazon, like I said before, is not well studied, but there were both hunter-gatherers and sedentary societies there.

And just to clear up, the Andes are not the hub of Mesoamerica; Mesoamerica is central America, and there were several major societies there, like the Olmec, the Maya, the Teotihuacanos, the Zapotec, and the Aztec. 

As for why, well, there's always a variety of reasons, and we still don't have a well-accepted model for why certain places developed into large, complex societies and others didn't. There are abundant gold and silver resources in the Andes, as well as copper, semi-precious stones, shell, etc. and Andean societies used those fully, and displayed wealth that way. But these things don't really create wealth, they are symbolic displays that show that you have the power to have well-trained artisans and specialists who can collect these raw materials and turn them into art or whatever. They become wealth that way, but you still need food and life-necessity resources to back them. I've talked about how agriculture started in the Andes in one or two of my other posts here."

einTier,IWantToLearn,1389050919.0,"The idea is that you want to subconsciously convey the idea that laying down in bed equals sleep.  The more you can reinforce this, the better off you'll be.  

I say making the bedroom a place solely for sleeping for two reasons.  One, it makes it very difficult to slip up and use that room for any other purpose.  Two, it creates a full environment that your brain recognizes as ""the sleeping place"" and prepares you to go sleep.  The more exceptions you make to this, the easier it will be to slip and the harder it will be to subconsciously tell yourself it's time to sleep. 

I understand your exceptions are out of necessity.  You don't have the luxury of having enough room for the bed to have exclusive rights to a space.   You'll have to be very diligent that you don't decide to lay down while watching television or flick it on because you're in bed and can't sleep.  It will be easy to make mistakes, but every mistake takes you further from your goal of being able to sleep well. "

SlickKat88,todayilearned,1389050998.0,"&gt; Either way I agree, capitalism affects blacks and whites, but it exacerbates already disadvantageous positions; that's the point of capitalism, you dolt.  
  
First, I don't know exactly how old you are or where you got your overwhelming confidence in debate, but you, my friend, need to learn the simple lesson that *insults do not win you praise.* It's immediately discrediting to yourself and painfully pretentious.  
  
Now, where exactly do you believe we will be in 10-20 years when we allow ""blacks"" to exacerbate the disadvantageous positions the ""whites"" are in given most recent events (e.g. Treyvon Martin). There is no way the Whites, of whom were ultimately targeted despite G. Zimmerman's obvious hispanic descent and the family's request to halt racial focus, will ever be able to recover from the drama (and yes, *drama*) that has surmounted the actual lesson/message behind the entire thing. There were very many issues arising within the goverment that were either prior issues now made clear, or new ones that took the nation by storm, and that only aided in the efficiency of the media overthrow of the case and the reactions to it.  
  
&gt; If you are born hanging off the edge of a cliff, you need to ask yourself: Why wasn't I just born with muscles strong enough to lift myself out of this situation? All it takes is hard work, why am I such a degenerate?  
  
This question is more philosophical than it is psychological and not one that everyone will come upon in their life. There are many anomalies in history that have proven what was once fact to be fallacy. You're implying that the person born hanging on the edge of the cliff has inherited the neural ability to know what hard work and slack work is, what it is to live off of the cliffside, what a degenerate is or isn't... these things are taught to the cliff-hanger or learned through external influence which influences the way a person would think. The degenerate society you speak of applies to many different races and those societies need to be reformed in brighter light of what the American Dream used to be. Our nations may have been built on colonialization, but we were a people that figured out the algorithm and put it to work. We used to fight for our freedom, now we fight for our followers? And through media, of all things.  
  
&gt; All social ills can be boiled down to the moral shortcomings of a single ethnic group, and society has to choose between wage slavery or communism.  
  
Know why? You allow yourself to end your resolution on a note of submissiveness. You have allowed the government (whether you call it ours or the world's) to limit your plane of thought ""outside of the box"". They have given you limits and you follow suit, posting openly that there are only two routes when there may be a collective who will one day change your entire perception of race and nation with that crumb that fell out of the bag.

Often teams that played in the super bowl won't even make the playoffs the next year, many times not even losing any major players. 

I'd say parity is also much stronger in the NHL. Look at how many different teams win championships or come from low seeds to win the cup.

Meanwhile, in the NBA you can predict what the top 5 teams in each conference will be pretty easily, and probably have a 50/50 shot at guessing who will be in the finals."

alc6379,guns,1389051308.0,"I'm 6'5"". Being so tall, I have big hands and long fingers. But, I want a pocket pistol. I've already got a Glock 30SF that I carry IWB. It's just slightly too large to fit in a pocket. However, there are times where IWB isn't possible, and I don't want to open carry. 

I owned an LC9, and the long trigger pull made my trigger finger hit my support hand. I have shot a Glock 26, and it... just didn't feel right. I held a Nano, and I just all-around didn't like it. I didn't like the grip, the trigger, and I didn't like the lack of a slide catch. I also didn't like the trigger on a Kahr CW9, but I wasn't sure if that trigger was going to be common to all of the models. Some other thoughts were the Glock 42 when it comes out, but I wasn't sure I'd dig it, given I didn't like the 26. Also in consideration was the Remington R51, but I wanted to get my hands on it before I added it to the list for consideration. 

So this brings me to some other options: 

* S&amp;W M&amp;P Shield
* Springfield XD-s (9mm or .45)
* Ruger LCR

Pros/cons of any of these? Are there any others I should look at? I was trying to keep in the $500-ish range new. Ideally the gun I'm looking for has no manual safety (or one that's easily left disabled) and a somewhat short trigger pull so I don't hit my own hand.

Kopfi,leagueoflegends,1389051310.0," - TSM probably didn't pay NiP too much for Bjergsen if his contract expired. Bjergsen probably will have better pay at TSM+Gain of fans+stream income so it is a smart move from his side.

- Do you mean how much their salary is/How expensive the 3 players are for the lemon dogs?

- A LCS spot guarantees you 150k$. Depending on the organization the players get % of that. Management/house/etc. has to be payed too and probably will be taken away from that money. I guess if you want to buy a spot you'll have to pay around that area. (Could be more if you say: the publicity, possible price winning, and showing off the sponsors is worth XX amount of money)

- A LCS-Promotion spot is probably a lot cheaper than the LCS Spot since, no money is guaranteed (the 150k)

Hope this helps

VibrantPotato,sex,1389051351.0,"I wash with vinegar using one of these two techniques. 

1. Smell super bad: put towels in to washer, select the 20 minute soak option (or start the normal wash cycle and then stop the machine and let the towels soak), and pour 1/3cup to 1/2cup of white vinegar into the water (huge full load of extra stinky towels, I use almost 3/4 to 1 cup). No soap. Soak for 20 minutes or so, rinse and spin (or continue the original cycle). Now, wash towels as normal (with soap this time). Smell them after the regular cycle when they are wet. If they dont smell better, you can repeat the process. I don't believe that letting them sit in vinegar longer (like over night) is going to yield better results.  I've never tried it though. 

2. Pour vinegar into the wash cycle with the soap, wash like normal. 

If they smell BAD, you'll likely have to get new towels and be diligent about hanging them to dry and not letting them sit wet in a pile, in a bag or on anything that will transfer a smell to them (carpet, couch, etc...)

My boyfriends towels smelled horribly, I tried it and I couldn't get enough of the smell out to warrens even washing my hands with the towels. I threw them out and asked him to buy new ones. 

I have also washed my clothing after a beach bonfire (my clothes always smell like smoke) and they came out smelling fantastic. Same with instances where i was hanging out with people who were smoking cigarettes. I've also washed pillows this way, using the soak method, decent results. 

I've read online that people believe white vinegar will eat the pipes of your washer. I don't personally believe this. There are lots of claims and beliefs online. YMMV. "

So, obviously it's important to train *weapon* defenses, but it's also important to make an appropriate focus on which weapons to defend against. If I can't spend enough time training defenses against any one weapon to be certain I'll be safe against it, I certainly don't want to dilute the time I spend dealing with it by wasting time on a weapon I don't even have to worry about. Stabbing and slashing makes up the most deaths, so I'm going to work on defense against knives and improvised stabbing weapons rather than trying to figure out how to handle a single action semi-automatic and a revolver differently."

Also, the majority of what they seem to be used for are small products, like pens and knives, and they are primarily done in vacuum chambers.  It's cool, but the piece I need to do is a little too large for one of the pre-made vacuum chambers (roughly 2 feet in diameter, and about 4 inches thick) and I want it to be a wood table when I'm done, with the grain and some roughness, not a highly polished piece of work.

I'm going to assume you currently live in the house. I would really recommend doing the service upgrade first. The reason being, that you can power up the new circuits as you run them. If your current panel is out of space, it could be problematic keeping your house up and running during this process.

You need to reduce this project down to areas where you want to start with minimal down time on circuits. I usually start on the far side of projects. In your case, it is the furthest point from your main panel. The reason for this is once you make your way to the other end of the house, you will already have a pathway for closer areas.

I know you said that you have a tight attic space, but is that the only access? An unfinished basement, or one with a drop ceiling is definitely a huge help. Even if it is only in certain areas. It is allowed by code to ""fish"" NM wire through your already finished walls. You really should have someone to help you catch the snake at the other end. This advice alone could save you countless hours. So, if you are at, just say, the far end of your house, ready to rewire outlet plugs. I would find the circuit that powers them, turn it off, and see what else goes out. This would be a good time to mention you should have a plug tester, a non-contact voltage tester, and maybe even a wiggy. This way you can be to be sure of what you are killing. I then demo all the wire I possibly can, making sure that it can never be powered again. You want to check for hazards such as back feeding, before you go crazy cutting. Next time is to see if your outlet boxes need replacing. You need to check for box fill, proper clamps, if too many knock outs are hit and can't be filled, if they are metal, can the take a ground screw? Things like this should really be decided by someone who knows what they are doing. Most times I have to replace them.

I am going to stop here for now and will edit with more later."

If you're in a destructive relationship, fighting every night, and sticking through it because ""relationships are hard"", don't. It's not worth the time, effort, or heartbreak.

* For the youngin's: Don't text 24/7. There is no space, it's suffocating, and any flame will be extinguished.

* If you don't have compatible sex drives or beliefs about sex, it's not going to work.

* If you're not happy, talk about it. Don't string an unhappy relationship along. If you feel guilty about leaving the person, think how much more guilty you'll feel when you're with them for even longer and they learn you weren't infatuated with them.

* Try to surprise one another, in a positive way. Little massages, gifts, notes, sweet texts, etc. keep your love fresh and communicate your feelings after a honeymoon phase may have ended.

* Just because your parents' marriage may not have worked doesn't mean you cannot have a successful relationship. You are not ever doomed to their fate.

When they returned, they found that the wheat had gone stale, but being on a strict budget, they decided to continue to process it by forcing it through rollers, hoping to obtain long sheets of the dough. To their surprise, what they found instead were flakes, which they toasted and served to their patients. This event occurred on August 8, 1894, and a patent for ""Flaked Cereals and Process of Preparing Same"" was filed on May 31, 1895, and issued on April 14, 1896.[1][3][4]

Remember that the purpose of these meetings is to make sure your research stays on track and to make connections with and get feedback from other PIs in your field. In my program we're also given an opportunity to discuss issues with the committee while our mentors leave the room, so if there are any problems between the student and mentor they don't go unnoticed.

In my program, we submit a brief written report a week prior to the meeting, and then use a powerpoint presentation to guide discussion at the meeting itself. My program provides some guidelines for the report and presentation, so you might want to check whether yours does too.

My own reports and presentations have gone through the rationale, aims, and experiments of my thesis. For the first meeting, I focused more on the rationale. I presented a lot of background work that set up my questions, and then laid out the aims and the experiments I planned to do. Where I had some preliminary data, I put that in. For later meetings, I focused more on the experiments. I barely mentioned any background, and we jumped straight to the progress I'd made on experiments since the previous meeting.

Children cost money to raise. If the caretaker doesn't have that money, the child has a difficult start, and is disadvantaged for their entire life. So if it's a choice between hurting the child and hurting the father, the logical conclusion is to have the father pay, because the child is not at fault for what happened: he/she had no choice about being born to that set of parents. But the father did have a choice as to whether or not to have sex, and was aware of the possible consequences. (This is why you should always have the abortion discussion with a regular sexual partner before one of you gets pregnant). 

Now, if there was some scheme where a father's contribution was replaced with money from elsewhere, I would be more in favour of that. But there's no point punishing a child for the parents' disagreements. "

So, the utility is shares per minute.  The work utility is number of difficulty 1 shares solved per minute.  This is because the pool doesn't give you difficulty 1 shares.  It gives you harder shares to solve but this is actually a good thing.

Why do you see your utility drop?
This is because the difficulty on the server is getting harder.  They adjust it to make it harder for you.  But you're still getting the same amount of work done.  You get paid on how much work you get done.  They just use VARDIFF because it has many benefits.

Benefits
-less bandwith
-You client doesn't need to keep getting new shares
-reduce server load
-allows pool to scale to support higher hashrates

EDIT: My recommendation to you
This is totally normal, utility does not mean how much money you make.  You want to maximize work utility to make the most profits.  So focus on maximizing work utility.  The utility will always fluctuate because your pool utilizes a VARiable DIFFiculty for workers."

Cassiuz,askscience,1389051938.0,"It's often referred to (and is a good phrase to use if you want to google the subject further) as the wagon-wheel effect.

It's most commonly observed in videos, due to the way they're shot and displayed, and is caused by the amount the wheel rotates and the speed at which the camera takes each frame of a video. I've copied the text below from the Wikipedia article linked below, as it's an explanation I quite like:

&gt;Imagine that the true rotation of a four-spoke wheel is clockwise.[2] The first instance of visibility of the wheel may occur when one spoke is at 12 o'clock. If by the time the next instance of visibility occurs, the spoke previously at 9 o'clock has moved into the 12-o'clock position, then a viewer will perceive the wheel to be stationary. If at the second instance of visibility, the next spoke has moved to the 11:30 position, then a viewer will perceive the wheel to be rotating backwards. If at the second instance of visibility, the next spoke has moved to the 12:30 position, then a viewer will perceive the wheel to be rotating forwards, however more slowly than the wheel is actually rotating. The effect relies on a motion perception property called beta movement: motion is seen between two objects in different positions in the visual field at different times providing the objects are similar (which is true of spoked wheels—each spoke is essentially identical to the others) and providing the objects are close (which is true of the originally 9-o'clock spoke in the second instant—it is closer to 12 o'clock than the originally 12-o'clock spoke).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon-wheel_effect

It's not just seen in car tires obviously, but pretty much any rotating object."

chriswen,litecoinmining,1389051963.0,"more info on VARDIFF
https://www.wemineltc.com/vardiff

&gt;What exactly is VARDIFF?
Many users have inquired about what VARDIFF means. VARDIFF stands for Variable Difficulty. Simply put the pool monitors the power of your mining rig and adjusts the difficulty of work sent to it to optimize the work done. Currently the pool is set to variable difficulty of 16 to 600. This means that if you have a slower rig, you will most likely always get 128 difficulty shares, but if you have a faster rig (7950 or even 3x 7950 for example) you are likely to see higher difficulties, all the way up to 600. This reduces the times your client needs to get new work from the server reducing load and reducing the time it takes to get more work. This is also good for the pool as it reduces the amount of requests being done to the pool, this allows the pool to scale to over 3GH/s on current hardware.

&gt;My difficulty jumps around, is this normal?
Yes, it is completely normal. The mining server monitors the work you are sending to the pool and if it feels you are sending work too fast or too slow it will ""Retarget"" your difficulty to best server your client at that time. This process is continual. 

&gt;My share count has gone way up or down! Will I get paid less/more?
No! Every single share submitted is recorded on our system with the difficulty of that share. That share is then weighted for the difficulty done. When a block is found and the system pays out for that block, your shares are paid based on the difficulty of each one. We will be adding more stats and reports to the site soon to better help users understand what is going on. 

&gt;But I thought Litecoin Difficulty was 505? (at time of this writting)
Yes but that is difficulty of current work on the network. The pool difficulty that is sent to your client is completely different. "

The first few months after having a baby are a period of complete and utter exhaustion for most people...especially as weeks of minimal sleep stretch into months.  Adding recovery from a C-section on top of that seems particularly daunting to me.  

I'd also like to add that I had considered a C-section up until I actually got pregnant when it seemed like a switch was flipped and it felt imperative that I only do what seemed best for the baby.  I wanted to be ready and in the best shape possible to start being a mom and that simply didn't allow the recovery time demanded by a C-section.  My fears ended up taking a backseat to what I felt was best for my child.

Metal is a subgenre of rock that, traditionally, features a much more prominent lower end and rhythm section. However, metal is much more than that. Metal generally follows darker themes both musically and lyrically than themes found in much popular music (sex, parties, etc.) Many subgenres of metal emphasize technical ability and fast tempos, though it is in no way required. If I were to overgeneralize metal, I would say that a band that plays with distorted, low guitars, prominent drums, and follows darker musical and lyrical themes is probably a metal band."

Drop_,CrohnsDisease,1389052161.0,"1. Lots of things are possible.  It is possible that there is some cause of the flare, either in your diet, or lifestyle, for example.  If you can figure it out and stop it, then there is a chance you will reduce the severity or avoid the flare altogether.  

2. Flares aren't always the same, across people or even a single person.  It's possible to have more or less severe flares.  

3. Too hard to say.  Often flares are triggered by something (food, medication, stress).  Like #1 if it is something triggering it and you can stop it, you can probably reduce the severity of the flare.  

For example, there was a recent study and post about NSAID pain relievers and UC or Chrons patients (I forget which).  A significant % of people would have a flare 2-9 days after taking certain NSAIDs.  But it's likely that the flares weren't the same.  e.g. someone taking 2 aleve per day for 5 days is likely to have a worse flare than someone who only takes 1 one day and doesn't take any more.  I don't have any data to back this up, though.  It's mostly from personal experience (not with NSAIDs but other things which cause flares for me).  "

&gt;Earthquake caused a big wave that damaged the plant, making it melt down, leak radiation, and put the world in danger because of a whole huge pile of fuel rods that only need another strong earthquake or tsunami to be unleashed on the world and likely killing a whole bunch of people and leaving a large chunk of Japan heavily radioactive for decades. The ocean leak probably isn't immediately something you need to worry about unless you're eating fish from near Japan, but as time goes on the chances of radiation building up in the sea life will make it hard for us to eat them, and for them to survive long enough for us to eat them.

evilbrent,australia,1389052205.0,"The trouble with that is that it gives men a simple get out of jail free card. If they have a fight with their pregnant partner and break up, they can just say ""oh look, we're within the window where I can still back out. I'm leaving you. I changed my mind about this baby. I've already signed the papers declaring my wish for you to have an abortion.""

Pretty much you wouldn't have to carry condoms anymore, you'd just have to print out the forms from the internet, and carry a few in your car, so if you ever did get someone pregnant you'd just have to go out to your car, fill in the details, and say ""really more your problem than mine. Just note here and here where it says that I asked for an abortion and that I don't have to pay any child support.""

Which is what it always boils down to: the rights of the future child. As much as it sucks for individual men to be fucked over by pregnancies they never wanted (the old steal-the-used-condom trick) it would suck worse for the children of men who had no legal obligations to the pregnancies they started."

SillyNonsense,movies,1389052362.0,"*To a point* it is true. The public has a general idea of ""trekkies"" in their head as a group of overweight awkward people who talk in made-up languages. 

It's not an especially appealing image and discourages them from wanting to get involved in anything Star Trek.

However the new movies have made a lot of progress in that area, luring many more casual fans in and making the series more accessible. Replacing that old image of a scary nerd with a more normal person. 

A friend of mine was intimidated by the long history of Star Trek and the ""trekkies"" and therefore had never watched it. He recently (like, last week) saw the two new movies and is now actually interested in watching more Trek. *Now* he realizes that *normal people* can enjoy Trek, too. It's not a private club. 

The biggest difficulty is just getting them to watch it in the first place. Most people like what they see once they are in. If anything, they should have made it a clearer point in the marketing of the first new film that it didnt require any prior knowledge of Trek to enjoy. Sure, *we* knew that, because we read all about the movie online. People I talk to dont seem to realize that they could go in blind and still have a good time.

People (like a dude in this very thread) like to pretend that it's all Orci's fault because [obscure reference to plot detail that the average person doesnt give a shit about], but when was the last time I heard an average movie-goer complaining like that? That's the shit you hear on the internet on trek forums or in actual reviews, not from people like my previously mentioned friend, or my mother, or the neighbor. That's just internet nerds taking every excuse they can get to use as a soap box for their personal vendettas. It has little to do with the actual discussion at hand.

(*That isnt to say that I dont have issues with the new movies*)

Why is Bob bringing it up in that thread? No idea, the guy says a lot of strange things on the internet. That is definitely not the place to say anything negative about Trek fans. Trek fans take things personally. I get the impression that he isn't too bright sometimes and likes to stir up a little trouble every now and then. "

People got scared away from the company when they got a huge influx of people asking for Dayton Service Boots a few years ago and it resulted in a bunch of rushed boots with lots of quality issues.

I sent them an email a while ago asking them why they raised the price of the Service Boot to $500 and part of the response was:

&gt;""In the past the Dayton quality has dipped but I can assure you that we are building super solid footwear that is worth $499. With in the last year the components and leather and workmanship has been upgraded. I am sure that if you bought a pair of our Service boots you would be very happy with the quality, durability and craftsmanship. 

&gt;As for the wait time we are not the fastest manufacturers but we are a small factory in Canada. We only have 4 guys building boots. The kind of boots and shoe construction we are using is not the same as most shoes these days and it requires time and patience to build a solid pair of boots. If we were to speed up much more it would mean cutting corners and we would be threatening to compromise the quality of Dayton boots and we just cant do that. If you look around at other small shoe factories you will see that many have long waits for their shoes as well. """

I still hear music from composers I've never heard of before and I always learn something new about music or a composer's history whenever I tune in (for example, the Composer of the Week specials). They also commission new compositions, which I've not seen other radio stations do. 

And lastly, how did we decide what music is and is not considered watered down crap, or ""the musical equivalent of Ice Road Truckers""? Is that not kind of elitist?

ARRO-gant,AskMen,1389052755.0,"I think I'd be pretty uncomfortable too. It's pretty understandable, but I think at the end of the day you need to move past the discomfort.

Probably you masturbate to images/videos of women who are more attractive to yourself than she is, or women who do things she's uncomfortable with. You might not even really want to be with those women, if given the option, it's just a fantasy which appeals to you at the time.

If the 8+ inch dick is more attractive to her, then shouldn't she have some outlet for that as well? Just because she wants a giant dong sometimes(or all the time) doesn't mean she isn't satisfied with/by you, just as if you wanted to do a facial sometimes(or all the time) that she won't do doesn't necessarily mean you aren't satisfied with/by her. All it means is that you can't do/be everything she wants at all times, and while it hurts to accept that and acknowledge that, accepting and acknowledging that fact is part of being an adult in an adult relationship.

It *may* be that you just don't satisfy her sexually, but even then the best thing is probably for her to be honest about it ASAP and either to compromise somehow or end the relationship.

Anyway, my ultimate recommendation would be to just be honest with her. You feel insecure about it, and you just need some reassurance. If she's a person worth dating, the very worst that can happen is that she admits you're sexually incompatible, which would have become a problem regardless of this speed-bump."

I guess when it went above her head they weren't into it and I didn't get the job :( Sorry you went through the same thing.

betona,gif,1389052762.0,"Years ago ('87?) we stayed at the [Banff Springs hotel](http://www.fairmont.com/banff-springs/) in the winter, supposedly the first time it was kept open in winter.  It got down to about -40F while we were there and we left some cokes in the window sill which was about a foot deep - and they froze and burst.  In our room.  It had curtains, so the room wasn't that cold, but the space in the window sill apparently was.  Yes, we skied in those temps, too."
mrpoopistan,funny,1389052762.0,"I get the pride thing, but . . . it's such a weird choice.

I just don't get the Aztec thing at all. They were complete assholes to their neighbors, and the vast majority of Mexicans are not descended from Aztec bloodlines. With the exception of food, the Aztecs had no redeeming features at all.

Nowhere in the Western Hemisphere did a single Indian civilization fall as rapidly to the Spanish as Mexico. Not even close. Even the Incans -- who the Spaniards had the good fortune of catching in the middle of a civil war -- held out longer.

There's no precendent for it in any culture that I've ever seen. The Aztecs were a bunch of arrogant pricks who absolutely got what they had coming to them. They enslaved a series of tributary states into providing them tens of thousands of human sacrifices every year. Not surprisingly, those tributaries when they heard the word of Jesus Christ, what was their first question? ""Sure, salvation, gotcha. Now tell me about these nice men with horses, guns, and steel who brought this nifty book to us and plan to murder those heathen bastards who Jesus totes wouldn't like?""

I don't know. It baffles me. I get the need for an ancestral identity, but picking the guys who constructed their entire empire around the necessity of human slaughter seems a bit extreme.

Keep in mind, I'm northern white trash. We have no ancestral identity to speak of."

The organization takes care of everything so that the players can focus on playing.

Luckily I have a scholarship covering college expenses so I don't feel as bad paying Verizon's exorbitant prices.

Still I don't think it's a good idea to piss money down the drain so I might actually look into AT&amp;T then. This might sound like a stupid question but what exactly is Straight Talk? It doesn't look to be directly affiliated with AT&amp;T based on some cursory Googling. And is it that much cheaper than a family plan on Verizon? I don't think my parents plan on switching plans anyways, so is being the fourth line on Verizon's family plan that much more expensive than a solo line on Straight Talk?"
