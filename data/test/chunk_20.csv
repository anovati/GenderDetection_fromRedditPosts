Since these didn't fit my tiny teenage body at all, I did the best I could to shorten the band with safety pins. I took up as much band as I could, crinkled it together, and then safety pinned them together. This left the back of my bra looking like a pile of wadded up paper, but I guess it did the trick. These bras basically dangled off my body and sometimes fell off in gym class. Ugh, it was horrible."

In a world with finite resources available for scientific research, a laudable goal like this tends to be overlooked.  Journals don't really publish as many redos anymore more so that they want novel findings.  It's the big problem we're facing right there.

So, that question, how much money do you want to dedicate to replication versus novel research, is a real important consideration."

Ocrasorm,ireland,1389246912.0,"In the Q and A from the presentation about this I found this interesting.


""Q:Given payments of 10% for referrals and 90% for outcomes, the sector is being asked
to take a big risk. Is there any provision being madeforcash flow for providers?

A:There is risk involved.However, it is important to note that while for an individual, it is envisaged 
the payment model will be approximately 10% for referrals and 90% for outcomes; the aggregate of
all referrals will mean that 30%-50% of provider income will be in respect of referrals and 50%-70%
in respect of outcomes (as not all referrals will
get jobs). It is up to the providers to work out what they believe to be a plausible level of job outcomes and from that, to bid accordingly""

So they get money for referring someone. If they have 50-100 thousand people on their books that could be a helluva lot of referrals. 

I really do not know much about it though. That just jumped out at me as interesting. If it works though then happy days."

Just when time was right I came in with a dedicated posting and marketing task force and firebombed it to get the submission rate and subscriber count way up :-D

Being sincere here: all along I've had loose plans about what the 'quality level' should be before we cross link back 'home' to ancap, how many 'inside jokes' or memes are necessary to make people feel compelled to read up, for fear of being left outside the loop. 

________________________________

And if you are inclined to continue to be part of online revolutionary history and see what the future could hold... WWBTR will grow beyond being a subset of r/ancap but come into it's own right. It already has really, but it's not manifestly clear to all yet. It will always be an ancap sub, but the focus will be on the satire not the politics, on the humor not the sanctity of the philosophy.

As I have seen from interviews, this is how Matt Stone and Trey Parker view South Park, it's about the show first and any 'message' later. :-)

I think many, but not all, divorced people have a more solid grasp on what they want from a person as a partner. They know that it takes a hell of a lot of work to make a relationship work and they see the failures of the previous marriage as lessons to improve upon. For a lot of people, it seems like their values and goals are more realistic. Its kind of hard to actually explain all the nuances in what changes, but something inside a lot of people just seems to switch into something different.

Your dad is right that tattoos can be professionally limiting, but it sounds like you're already being smart about that.  Succeed professionally, be a good person, be a good daughter, and get as many damned tattoos as you want because it's your body and *you* are the one that decides what happens with it.  He'll get over it."

You continue to net a significant number of downvotes that sometimes are without reason, and I like to assume those unreasonable downvotes are residual from people recognizing your name from that particular situation. I disagree with that sort of thing.

However, you're not helping anyone by being sarcastic about the common put-downs people here are faced with. Especially not yourself. And I think you know that.

This only leads me to conclude that you're trying to stir the pot to ensure you get the reaction you ascribe to short people. Namely, that they are easily angered hot-heads that are working themselves up over nothing.

&gt;I so far have failed to grasp what I am supposed to do to fight this discrimination then I already do.

You can start by being a reasonable person dedicated to rational discussion that doesn't resort to put-downs or heavy sarcasm during conversations, *especially when the other person is*. This conversation shows you are capable of it.

&gt;Believe me, I haven't always been this cynical. This place can bring it out sometimes.

Yes. It can. But even if you want to tell someone they are being an ignorant fuckface that needs to go die a slow, lonely death, it doesn't help change anything.

I guess that's my point - this place is what **we** make of it. If we do not act and react civilly, then this place becomes somewhere that is not civil. If **we** act and react with sarcasm, then this place becomes somewhere that is sarcastic. If **we** act and react with hostility, how can we possibly expect this to be anything other than a hostile place?"

mundabit,birthcontrol,1389247289.0,"I had mine in on august 12th, I had about 2-3 months of heavy bleeding like a period, then it started to lighten up to what I consider to be spotting. I also got mine for help with PCOS/Endo like symptoms (no official diagnoses of either, but a lot of similar symptoms) and so far its been useless at that. The only good thing about it is that I have had no other side effects apart from bleeding, and its a really great contraceptive. But as I have a lot of pelvic pain and bleeding and migraines due to this never ending 'period' I don't really feel like having sex.

Because I'm 'spotting' rather than having real periods my GYN considers it an improvement, she is eager to keep me on the implanon to help shrink any adhesions, then after a full year I can come off and if I still have pain I can review my options.

My only suggestion is to try some evening primrose oil to help with any other PMS side effects, and perhaps ask your doctor on an emmenagogue can be used to produce a regular cycle. That's what I used when I wasn't on any BC to still give myself regular cycles. I can't take it anymore due to an unrelated bruising issue."

RJ815,truegaming,1389247301.0,"&gt; Why are developers so hesitant to space out the digits of prices and money?

I imagine the answer is simple. Though I don't know for sure, I'm guessing that most developers simply store currency as an integer. And a default ""print to screen"" or ""print to text"" function on that integer would just return the number with no spaces, commas, or periods in between. I'm sure developers could put in extra code to correctly parse currency, but most just don't bother and worry more about not having enough time to solve game-breaking issues and whatnot before the publishers wants to ship the game."

I'd like to say that 19xx is a massive piece of shit, but that I got all the items. I also got all the items in chapter 20, and Eliwood totally accidentally killed that one subboss who doesn't have a memorable name or personality turn 1 with the rapier.

Chapter 21 I arena-abused, and decided to ditch Fiora.

Chapter 22 was awesome because all the enemies have reaver weapons. I imagine it would have been better if I had a more physically based party, but with a lot of mages and a good rebecca the gimmick is lost a bit.

Chapter 23 is the desert chapter. I took Ninian from level 10 to level 17 to make sure I got the gaiden.

23x was just my units rolling around the map, taking names and wasting weapon usages on the walls. Hawkeye didn't enter combat once.

24 I had Florina gain a shit ton of levels taking on the pirates and Wyverns (who would really fuck her up when they hit, she had to be resupplied with health quite often) while Dart, Heath, and Rath took on the arena challenge. Rath was a little strength screwed but perfectly usable. Dart turned out pretty much average, which is really good. Heath had the afa's drops and fucking wasted them. In 8 levels he gained 1 point of speed off a 50% growth. He did not make it up to me by gaining 5 points of speed in his remaining 5 levels. He's ahead in strength and defense, but behind in everything else. This is not how the afa's drops are supposed to work. I'm not wasting the earth seal on him.

I set up Raven's supports and have him solo the boss, complete with an unnecessary crit to finish.

If we can see movie A or movie B and I want to go to A, I will state that. I can't read your mind; for all I know, you also want to see A and hate B.

My roommate, meanwhile, would try to meet people halfway before saying anything. So if there's movie A and B and he'd rather go to B but thinks I'd rather go to A, he'll say, ""Either is fine.""

I hear ""either is fine"" and assume that he likes both equally, because the only reason I would have said ""either is fine"" is if that were the case. So we go to movie A.

Now repeat this across every joint decision for six months until he flips out at me because I'm a demanding bitch who always has to get what I want. And meanwhile I thought he was fine with all our choices the entire time. 

I'm not unreasonable - if I wanted A and he *said* he wanted B, we'd do A half the time and B the other half. But I am not a goddamn mindreader!

At first glance it may look like a bunch of scribbles that children often do but if you really look at the details it appears quite professional. The way the noses and the eyes are drawn, such as how the bridge is drawn all the way above the eyes, the presence of eyelids, the distinguished pupil of the eyes, or how the nose covers one eye to show depth. The way the way the heads are drawn, where there are indention where the eyes meets at the side of the face. The construction of the lips how the style of the drawing is consistent but each lip differs quite greatly from one to the other. The fact that each individual person actually look quite individual is a huge statement in itself. There are differences in head shape, head size, hair, gender, facial expression, clothing, and even that drawing of a parrot that I know I'd have a hard time drawing. The faces are also drawn in many different angles that many adults would have a hard time working with.

When I was told this, I took it as a way to look at why I was getting angry. I got angry over small things as well. So, when I did this, I talked to myself like a child. Asked myself, why am I doing this? Do I need to act this way? Does my anger solve anything?

mundabit,birthcontrol,1389247688.0,"The early period is known as ""breakthrough bleeding"" this means your period 'breaks through' the active pills, it arrives when its not supposed to. This is a really common occurrence when you first start using your birth control to skip periods entirely. Sometimes you just need a few months of skipping every other period to adjust, sometimes you might need a higher dose brand of pill to avoid this. 

Breakthrough bleeding doesn't effect the contraceptive power of the pill. But taking the pill at odd times does increase the risk of breakthrough bleeding, and over a long period of time can reduce the pills effectiveness.

Now, onto this late-pill business. you were only off by 2-3 hours each day, while this isn't good, its still within the margin of safe,  but I highly recommend avoiding it in future as the more you do it, the more unsafe it becomes. consider changing your pill time to 13 permanently.

The speed at which your period ended is also common considering you skipped a period and changed the intake of hormones, your body is confused and your period has changed. its just like when you first start taking birth control ever, things can get whacky."

Well, you can view it as a second trimester abortion, arguably. And, as such, the family (husband) should have the say as to how it proceeds, given that his wife is dead.  

You could also ask about the cost of keeping a woman on life support for months to give birth to a child that may not be healthy to a family that doesn't want it. Who pays for it, and is it fair to make them pay for it? The cost of human life is a philosophical question, but here there's a bit of real world edge.  

Finally, I would not say suffocate. You're putting a visceral feeling to the termination of the fetus, and thus making the decision more emotional (which isn't entirely unfair, although I do disagree with your choice of words).

mundabit,birthcontrol,1389247971.0,"If the hormones in pills mess with your meds they should not of put you on the patch, it contains the exact same hormones a most pills.

The rash is concerning, irritation can lead to infection and scarring, and if the skin scars over it wont absorb the hormones in the patch properly. You should see the doctor, Perhaps something can be arranged with your insurance company explaining that the patch is not an option so they should try and cover an IUD (not sure how insurance works in the US, sorry, birth control is free/cheaper than a bottle of coke where I live)

If this is your first month on the patch its normal for your period to be off. 

I would also recommend Implanon NXT/Nexplanon, It will seem pricey at first but make sure you divide that cost by 36 to get an idea of how much it costs month by month. But that is still going to contain hormone that might upset your meds."

AnimusHerb240,occult,1389248060.0,"Ahh but what you describe as ""simply our brain using memory and connecting the dots"" is actually quite an amazing, miraculous explosion of activity, it's like sex!

There is no such thing as supernatural forces, because there is no such thing as supernatural, because there is no such thing as natural. There is no such thing as anything, really. I realize that might seem to make little sense. What I mean is there are colloquial, basic understandings of these words, and when we dig deeper they lend themselves to more intricate understandings, and when we dig even deeper, the words themselves kinda dissolve, until we are just left nodding and winking at one another.

I'm very glad to see you are skeptical about belief and blind faith. I sincerely hope you don't believe a thing anyone tells you in this thread, but if you read something that piques your curiosity, I also hope you follow your curiosity and feel this is a good place to keep asking questions.

I would like to point out that at the root of your understanding of how the brain works is a set of ""beliefs"", and though it is common to separate these ideas from what most consider ""irrational"" or ""religious"" beliefs, I assure you the distinction is illusory. **A belief is a belief.** If you **believe** it is wrong to murder someone, you are exactly equally as silly and mistaken as someone who **believes** there are invisible ghost chickens everywhere conspiring to untie people's shoelaces, or someone who **believes** that they will be punished in the afterlife for certain deeds.

Some of them have depth in terms of battlefiled tactics, items to use, magic and techniques, etc etc, but a lot of the ones that aren't turn-based tend to be pretty simplistic, or at least have a low barrier of entry for success even if there is depth there.

He told me that the first time we went out. I was honestly in shock, but for some reason I liked him a lot. Apparently two years ago he changed and hasn't done that anymore, I wasn't sure about that but two of his close friends have told me that he has definitely changed and he's an awesome guy, so there's that.

I have also told him about the guy who was with other 4 girls while he would tell me that he wanted to be with me, and that I would appreciate it if he wouldn't flirt with other girls because of what happened. We had a huge argument and his conclusion was that it was all pointless and he wouldn't change, I couldn't say anything else because I didn't want to lose him cause I was already falling for him.

I don't want to mention it again, I honestly feel like he's about to break up with me if I tell him about my issues so I'll just fix it somehow unless I have a reason to mention it to him, like you said.

kyrostolar,DebateAnAtheist,1389248618.0,"I'm an atheist and an artist, I have no divine inspiration. Art is a form of communication, it's a language all on its own.

We found a way to communicate and express ourselves with markings on the wall, and whatever else there may be, and then we learned how to interpret and imagine through experience. Even without a necessarily scientific explanation, we can do without a supernatural one. We see, feel, experience our surroundings, we remember patterns.

We see a strange cloud in the sky that shares a similar pattern with something else we've seen, and our mind puts them into the same category momentarily. Our imagination draws on this... a cloud might look like a serpent, the serpent is in the sky like a bird, rather than on the ground, the serpent is flying, birds fly, does the serpent have wings? I saw a flying serpent cloud, how do I explain that to my neighbour? Only things with wings can fly, it must have wings. How do we mark our experience on the wall so others can appreciate it? Draw a picture of a dragon.

Sorry, might have been a little science-y if you think about it, but I don't believe art is some divine gift; it's a language, just another means of communication that we've learned to exaggerate to countless levels through practice, interpretation, misinterpretation, and the like. Patterns and community, not God. (And the human addiction to patterns can be explained through science, so I'd call it a win.)"

So it may increase your chances with at sex with a woman you already had a shot with because she's physically attracted to (and/or a relationship if you have the other qualities she's looking for there -- but beware because relationships with no sexual attraction are with few exceptions the man just being used) but if you don't have it, you don't have it.

The origins of what we call ""Game"" has too many elements of pop positivism bullshit, and of course there's a good reason for that because it started out as some people trying to sell books, seminars, boot camps and so on to really desperate guys.

bombeater,OkCupid,1389248819.0,"Language is holding us back. ""Success"" and ""failure"" are absurdly dualistic words, and their usage inarguably retards our ability to process situations at a realistic level of detail.

I mean, yes, sure, you're correct. It was a failure. Okay.

But you're coming at this logically.

That's illogical. 

Dating and sex are incredibly emotional experiences for most people. Look at the top comments on pretty much any story in /r/relationships... they all have the same answers. Go to therapy. Talk it out. Break up already.

If the answers are always the same, why do people keep asking?

Because they're not showing up for the answers. They're showing up for the *support*. For the emotional support provided by other human beings validating your emotions, respecting your beliefs, and acknowledging your humanity.

That's why people are responding positively to this failure: OP found a way to *feel good* about his failure, and that's *amazing*, because if you can feel good about your failures, you can keep going forever. He came here to share this with us, which was very nice of him, and there's mutual benefit: we get to see an example of someone feeling good about their failures, which makes us feel more comfortable with the idea that it might be something we are also capable of, and OP gets to feel the warm fuzzies that come from being supported by his peers."

In retrospect, I doubt my mother let my brother write that on all of his thank you cards, and perhaps wanted to avoid a pointless and potentially arduous vetting process for a somewhat immature joke. Still, even if that was so, she relied on our gendered conditioning to do so."

the_glass_gecko,AskWomen,1389249326.0,"I totally know where you're coming from and hope my advice or at least common experience can help.

After years of dating a very fit handsome guy (he did rock climbing, jiu jitsu, yoga, surfing, and more) and within those years trying many different exercise programs (Zumba, P90X, P90, Jillian Michaels videos, Couch to 5k, and more), I ended up just an insecure self-conscious still unhealthy and unfit gal.  My boyfriend regularly made it clear that he wanted me to be fit because it was so attractive to him and that he wanted me to share that lifestyle with him, but not being able to do so just made me feel guilty.  It contributed to a really ugly cycle that lead to our breakup.

Since then, I've been able to back off and give myself the necessary patience and compassion you need to become more fit.  I've gotten rid of his judgmental voice in my ear telling me what I should or shouldn't be doing.  I've thought more about what kind of guy I'd like to be with as well, for the sake of this topic, in a physical sense.

I always enjoyed the weightlifting parts of my past workout routines, and I started noticing that something all the guys I was attracted to had one thing in common - heavy barbell training.  So, after some research, I downloaded The New Rules of Lifting for Women and I liked it so much I bought it.  I am almost done with Phase 2 of the program and am seeing results.

More importantly, I am feeling results, and MOST importantly, I feel I have discovered a type of fitness I truly enjoy.  For the first time in my life, I really enjoy working out - not just because it's fun for me, but because it WORKS.  Zumba was fun, but, Zumba was not ever going to give me results like I'm getting from this.

It definitely has made me more attractive to guys that also barbell train - they like that I have that in common with them, and they appreciate the tightness of my body, and it gives us something to talk about.  Also, it has given me the confidence to talk to guys that do this since I feel more informed and like I have some experience under my belt.

My advice for you: Doing it for a guy won't last, and just might make you hate yourself a little.  Try some different things and see what you like and allow yourself to really enjoy something.  Even if it's not the same thing the guys you want are doing, when you're a strong awesome independent woman, the men will come.  You don't specifically talk about what form of exercise you're going to do, so I can tell you're new to all this.  I'm happy to talk to you more about it if you want to PM me.  "

An inexperienced coder might need to sit down with the documentation for a few hours to figure out how to a.) construct the diagram they want and b.) then interface with Unity to render it.

On the other hand, my plugin supports native Unity types, makes it easy to get stuff rendering in your scene and provides two demo scenes with example scripts on how to accomplish 2D/3D mesh generation.

If you're going to be doing a lot of triangulation of complex shapes, Triangle.NET would probably be a better choice. If you just want to explore the design/aesthetic/gameplay space of voronoi diagrams, I think mine is a more accessible choice for the average Unity developer."

I'll probably do something with Germany and colonization too, simply because I need to prevent the U.S. from becoming a major power, but not making any one country too powerful, as making Spain control most of the Americas would be. Considering that Spain won't be a large part of my story, I think I need to revise that somewhat. Perhaps Spain pulls out of the Americas to defend against France. That happens very shortly before Britain frees its colonies in the Americas. This would leave it in a situation where none of the nations would feel united, because they wouldn't have a cause to rally behind, like a war for independence. The Americas could become sort of what they were pre-Columbian, but with more advanced technology. Groups of tribes and warlords inhabiting various areas. This ensures that they don't have enough time to develop into a world superpower by 1880."

One thing I've gotta say is that you need to be *cautiously* optimistic here.

Usually it's within a week, and I suspect it has to do with either reading up on the subject or freaking out because they wonder how it will reflect upon themselves.  People you are close to are especially susceptible to this.

Anyway there's no reason not to trust their reactions!  Just be cautious and prepared, just in case things are not as rosy as they seem."

In the first world, with a combination of liberated women, self control, birth control, etc., people are generally having fewer kids and having them later in life. A lot of countries have their populations declining actually, and the only reason the US is in the positive is because of a large amount of immigrants. 

Barring that, I think we may see a negative trend too.

Also, I think there are much less intrusive ways to deal with population anyway. I think on this subject, adults should get one lump sum, if you have kids, that's on you. No telling people not to have kids, just make clear that the money they get is what they get and that they're not gonna get more for having kids they can't afford."

javatimes,CriticalGender,1389249964.0,"I hate this line of thinking for a lot of reasons, but one major reason is precisely because it tries to justify irrational hatred.  The fact is that even other trans people can be hella transphobic/cissexist, and it's valorizing cissexism and transphobia that is the problem and associating it with radical feminism.  I feel like I've made these points a lot already, not even just here but like for the past ten years. 
And just for practical reasons--a shit ton of trans+misogyny comes from TRANS MEN. It's not like trans men are magical creatures free of patriarchal bullshit.
We can advocate for trans people right under TERF noses. If any of them decide to explore transition, they are welcome to the same clinics and doctors and therapists we use. The way to subvert TERFism is to add to trans advocacy and culture--not to repeatedly ask faux-searching questions about whether TERFs have thought about testosterone.  
Honestly these posts aren't fair to either gender non conforming cis women or trans men, either. It's hardly thrilling to see one's ""group"" held up as some sort of ""example"" for what some other people could be. I mean, maybe I should troll some MRAs and suggest they might be repressed trans women."

Al_Simmons,pcmasterrace,1389250293.0,"I'd still say it's a constraint, for example you have 6v6 on a map of about 800m^2. Increasing the number to 12v12 in an 800m^2 area will probably make it a cluster fuck like you said. But increase the area to 1600m^2 with 12v12 titans and you don't really have a problem in the gameplay aspect, but you do in the hardware aspect. 12v12 titans in a 1600m^2 environment would probably use high console resources and increase the heat severely. Yet a pc could handle that no problem.

So I still consider it's a constraint not a design choice. Developers would rather create games for consoles and port them to pc. That said, there's still a slight chance they will do this for the pc version."

Vahingonilo,politics,1389250513.0,"Surgeries in the Canadian healthcare system are scheduled according to urgency.  If you're wondering what ""government involvement"" is driving healthcare costs up, it's things like George W. Bush's Medicare Part D provision that prevents Medicare from negotiating on drug pricing.  The VA, for example, pays about half because it is allowed to negotiate.

There are other problems with the healthcare market, namely that it isn't a free market.  In order for a free market to exist, both parties in the sale need to be privy to the pricing.  Most hospitals will not reveal their pricing on demand, and only reveal their chargemaster if required by law.

Another problem with healthcare as a free market is as regards elasticity of demand.  You frequently have no choice as to which ambulance picks you up, which hospital performs your surgeries, and so forth.  When you have a medical emergency, you often do not even have the capacity to make informed purchasing decisions.

-- and even if Canada is not your ideal, perhaps you should compare the U.S. with the countries with the best healthcare in the world and model your ideal system on theirs.  It certainly isn't the United States."

czarkasm,bipolar,1389250917.0,"I could imagine that this was very difficult to hear, and probably caused you some great emotional pain. I can remember how I felt after my diagnosis and I needed all of the support I could get from people in my life.

Problem is that everyone has their own prejudgments, and maybe they'll take the time to understand where you're coming from and maybe they won't. What I always remind myself is that being bipolar is part of *who I am.*  It is really difficult sometimes, but I get through by being true to myself, by being self aware, and by not ignoring how things are making me *feel.*

My parents do not understand that my medicine is crucial to my well being.  That if I do not take it I very well risk another suicide attempt.  They do not understand the difference between being legitimately upset and hypo manic/depressed.  They think that I should just use a natural method (they both practice homeopathy) to ""cure myself."" They judge me. And it all frickin sucks because they are my parents and I would really like them to support me.

But when it comes down to it only I know how I'm feeling.  Only I can decided when I want to get the help I want and what kind of help that is.  Only my own judgments matter.  Not theirs or anyone else because **they do not understand what I am going through.** I have this community, I have a couple friends I can talk to and sometimes when I need to reach out I go to either.  I'm glad you realized that we are all here for you no matter what and we all believe you.  I believe you.  But most importantly: believe in yourself!"

Sorry he got picked on - but so did I.

Guess what? I'm **female.**

*Gasp!*

I grew up in braces, glasses, horrid acne and kept myself buried in computers (working on them, taking them apart, rebuilding them, and games) and video games. Luckily, my father supported me and always made sure I got whatever the most recent gen console was that I wanted on Xmas. Usually once the prices dropped, but that was fine because I had the previous one. I literally had no friends until I hit my second year of 6th grade. Even with that, I didn't make *true* friends until I hit high school.

I got picked on so bad that even in elementary school, I often wondered if I should just run in front of a car. I never understood why boys thought I was lame, ugly, and weird for being into the same shit they were. I never understood why girls thought I was stupid and ""gay"" for being into stuff they weren't. Hell, even in my second year of 6th grade - I was thought to have been a ""dyke"" even though I was pretty much straight at that age.

*Everyone* who is into nerdy shit has gotten picked on. Boys think it's tough because girls don't like them. Try having *no one* understand you for 16 years. At least guys can make friends with other guys. Even if there were more nerdy girls as I grew up, they hid it. I met quite a few that hid it because they knew they would be like me with no friends.

You know what? It's no ones fault. I'm so sick of guys bitching because girls didn't talk to them growing up - therefore *every single girl* is the enemy when it comes to ""guy interests."" It's the same stupid fucks that claim to be ""gentlemen"" and shit talk men that degrade women.

Telling a woman she's not a real ""nerd/geek/gamer"" or whatever **is exactly the fucking same** as some jerk telling us that we can't be into football, or guns, or hunting or whatever.

Stop blaming entire groups/races/genders for your problems. Just because some people suck, it doesn't mean we all do. Everyone has their own shit in life, and everyone goes through different shit - gender (or whatever) doesn't always have to be a fucking factor."
Stryc9,Anarchism,1389251297.0,"&gt; You do have to know every juggalo when you call ALL of them the same thing and treat them as some homogenous group.

Absolutely not. That is a simply absurd standard. No one is talking about treating them as a homogeneous group. We are saying *generally* when dealing with Juggalos you are going to find people that are often sexists and misogynistic with cruel and callous attitudes towards the suffering of other. This is repeatedly established via the music that they listen to and by the behaviors that they repeatedly display.

In regards to the Nazi thing, I never claimed that they were comparable in scale of magnitude, only in method and format. I am not now nor was ever trying to say that Juggalos are as bad as Nazis, only trying to establish that groups that are compromised of members who voluntarily join can in fact be judged based on the actions of its members, the group's response to those actions, and by the statements that they release (in this case this refers to the messages in the music they make). Perhaps another analogy here is apt. The Catholic Church has had a huge problem with pedophile priests. They compounded this problem by hiding the perpetrators and allowing them to continue. Does this mean that every Catholic priest is a pedophile or a pedophilia enabler? Absolutely not, but every Catholic priest is starting at a negative with me and they are going to have to work to prove that they are not a shit stain like so many of the other priests."

TheLittleGoodWolf,AskMen,1389251739.0,"If this was me it would probably be due to insecurity about my desires and a lack of understanding about sexuality itself.
Could be that he can't really handle his porn correctly and/or that he feels bad about it and thus doesn't really feel worthy of sex with you. It is stated now and again ad infinitem how porn is degrading to women. Receiving a ""naughty pic"" thus becomes porn (in a way) and enjoying that becomes degrading of someone he loves. It's not logical in the least but emotions rarely are, and you can understand how that would make someone feel bad.

This is only something I went through myself and not necessarily what is up with your bf though. When you are ashamed of your sexuality and your sexual desires porn makes you feel better for a while. But since porn is so stigmatized you are even more ashamed afterwards and so the vicious cycle begins.

He's showed me examples with his own work to apply this theory. He specialises in acoustic finger style guitar and showed me an incredibly beautiful song he wrote when he was 18 and said ""I have no idea how I thought to write something so lush sounding"". I don't think this applies to everyone as bands like Radiohead have gone on to release one of their best albums 24 years after their debut with In Rainbows. I also think a lot of bands find themselves too old to be playing a certain intensity of music or want to release something that can give them a better source of income if they have a family. For example Biffy Clyro who have gone from recording music like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkMzMoah5X4) to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZGXRkvQpDE)."

The fact is that the idea is great in theory, but in practice it basically drifts into an Orwellian autocracy.

*Who does the jobs that nobody wants to do?*

Without market incentives, nobody wants to be the garbage man.  
If I get paid the same to work a 16 hour shift as a dockworker as I do to paint for 2 hours a day, why would I become a dockworker?  Do you force people to do certain jobs for certain amounts of time?

*What do you do when people don't want to work?*

With no wages, overtime, or other incentives, why would I put in anything more than the minimum amount of effort?

*What do you do when people try to cheat the system?*

If people receive goods based on their needs, what stops someone from making themselves seem more needy.  Rather than corruption just being in the political leadership, the socialization of the economy also socializes corruption. 

*What do you do when people don't want to be communist?*

steve496,nfl,1389252664.0,"Believe me, I require no convincing.  My observation was in no way intended as a knock on the Rams, merely a reflection on how far the division has come over the past 3 years. QB or no QB, this years Rams probably could have won 10 games in the 2010 NFC West, and in a different division this year they'd be solidly in contention for a playoff spot.

That said, I'm probably not quite as high on Bradford as you are.  I'm of the opinion that the reason that the Rams are going to be scary next year has a lot to do with having an absurdly high pick in a strong draft class despite already being good as much as the return of Bradford.  And if you manage to parley the 2nd overall pick into another ridiculous bounty of future picks, the rest of the division - good as it is - is going to have a serious problem on its hands."

I have no problem whatsoever with people wanting to identify as pansexual, and I see it as perfectly valid. However, I have met a lot of pansexuals who seem to feel quite superior about it, and they seem to try to thrust bisexuality into this very rigid confinement. They claim that it always upholds the gender binary or excludes trans* people, but I really don't think that it does or has to. ""Bi-"" doesn't mean ""men and women"" -- it just means ""two,"" referring to genders the same and different. People can have their own definitions, of course, but nowhere in the word does it reference ""men and women."" Societal understanding of bisexuality might push the ""men and women"" thing, but that's because of overall society's adherence to the gender binary.

Surely there are plenty of bisexuals who stick to the gender binary or are exclusive in some way, but I too have yet to meet any. Pretty much all of the bisexual people I've met have no qualms about dating trans* people or genderqueer/non-binary people.

In the end, people should feel free to identify however they want, and I personally would never judge. But I don't really appreciate the smug superiority I've gotten from some pansexuals in the past. Not all pansexuals are like this, of course, but I have run into it more than a few times and it sort of brings me down."

[Article on how to motivate yourself into productivity](http://www.dumblittleman.com/2013/09/how-to-motivate-yourself-and-improve.html)

Keep in mind that you will never be successful if you expect extreme results.  Don't expect to be doing all of your homework as soon as you get home next week.  Take the small steps and be lenient on yourself.  Most people struggle with productivity, but not everyone seeks out ways to become more productive.

For example: When you get home from school do **one** thing before you allow yourself to look at your cell phone/the internet.  Even if this this is just working out/reading/playing the piano it is *still* productive.  It even has the possibility of inspiring some perpetual productivity.  Then take a look at the internet, play with your phone.  Next week try getting **two** things done before you look at your phone.  Keep moving towards the productivity goals you have.  If you don't know what these goals are, make them and write them down! Reward yourself for being productive to encourage it, and don't beat yourself up when you aren't!

One last thought to cheer you up.  Say you do nothing productive for the next week.  The next month.  The next *year.*  Even if this extreme happened, your value as a person would not decrease.  You would still be who you are, your self worth is not measured by how productive you are.  Become productive because *you* want to and *you* have decided to make this change in your life to affect it in a positive way.  Don't do it for anyone else."

What do you do about boardwipe? I feel like verdict is probably GG for you.

What are you going to use your extra mana kn? Prophet and mana ramp means you'll have a LOT of extra mana. What can you spend it on?

Against aggro, fog effects are good.

Psychic spiral is horrible. You don't have enough card draw to get close to decking yourself, and milling them won't be enough for you to win, and is kinda useless. If you REALLY need anti mill, use elixir (the life gain can help some vs aggro).

I just really feel like you could benefit from somewhere to put your mana (something like vitu gazi guildmage could be good, but it's out of your colors).

4 counter spells may be too few for you to do much with. It's very unlikely for you to see them in a generic game.

noname725,ForeverAlone,1389254078.0,"I have stopped seeing my ""virginity"" as some pure, beautiful thing that will be ""lost"" in a magical setting with the ""perfect"" person. I used to have those little fantasies when I was younger, and I think that a lot of people do too, but ultimately I've learned to stop putting so much pressure on it. Putting it up on a pedestal doesn't do anyone any good. It just leads to a host of problems (slut-shaming, virgin-shaming, frustrations, disappointment, etc.). Our sex lives (or lack thereof) are our own, and we all go about them differently. 

Anyway, personally? I actually might be pretty comfortable with having my first time during a one night stand or something similar. Since I'm a little older (22), it might be nice to just get it over with and gain some experience.

However, my viewpoint doesn't go for everyone else, of course. Lots of people might want their first time to be with someone they know or trust or like or love, and that's all perfectly valid too! You just have to decide for yourself what it is that *you* want. If you just want sex, then just have sex. If you want something more emotionally intimate, then maybe you should wait until you find someone you connect with. It's totally up to you.

I would not want to have sex with someone who's in a relationship with someone else. I would feel guilty even though I technically don't 'owe' anything to the person who'd be cheated on. I'd just feel bad."

Try the drug store shit first or go to your doctor, if you have health insurance get an appointment, tell them its for skin problems, and your doctor can proscribe a few different things. The drug store shit works too, usually... the ingredient that most say works best is the benzoyl peroxide one.

ThirdShiftStocker,nintendo,1389254347.0,"""Five years later, Miyamoto expressed his thoughts on the GameCube, and considered it a very sad time when the general public ignored Nintendo’s software.""

Very heartbreaking to read that line. I remember those times very well. You were most likely laughed at if you even mentioned you owned a Gamecube. I stood by my Gamecube. It did hurt to see all the games get cut by all the third party developers but I never did find out the real reason till recently. I VERY fondly remember Driver 3 being cancelled for Gamecube as the console was not 'powerful' enough for the visuals, when that was complete and utter bullcrap. The amount of research I did that night on that subject led me to finding out the Gamecube was the middle ground between the Playstation 2 and Xbox in terms of performance, so that excuse was quickly debunked.

I could never abandon Nintendo after years of gaming with them. My entire gaming career began with Nintendo, so I've always had the soft spot for them. Great company with well-made games."

That being said, I don't think piracy is too big of an issue. If I'm not mistaken, comic sales are doing pretty good and even small publishers are making a lot of money; something that didn't start being possible until relatively recently. 

My philosophy on piracy (and this expands beyond comics) is that I have no moral objectification to it so long as I don't pirate anything I would have paid for, had piracy not been an option. I buy every title, and many more, that I bought before I started pirating. Now, I'm just able to read more titles, but I'm not actually taking away any opportunity costs. There have even been titles I've convinced others to buy based on my positive opinion on them derived from reading them through piracy -- similar to how Neil Gaiman (among many others) is in support of pirating what you can't afford, saying that your positive word of mouth will create new customers. 

I know this is off topic, but it's just my two cents. I've personally met Matt Hawkins, and he's a great guy, but I gotta disagree with him on this.

Just_Observational,AskReddit,1389254632.0,"Hmm, this is tricky. Another post made a good point that anytime you have position over a peer it's going to be inherently condescending to them. But I think there is a way to minimize such an effect as well.

But this also extends to not only teaching but advising. You're saying that your opinion is more founded on fact, or more believable than theirs. To assist in advising someone without condescending them you must first be asked to advise.

ELI5? It won't be short but I'll be as straightforward as possible. And will go ahead and say I'm no expert. Just_Observational ;)

If you're teaching someone you've got to be careful of their ego. Once they feel that you've belittled them they turn from a student to an enemy.

Use as little technical terminology as you can without cutting out anything vital. Explain anything technical that is required right before or right after you mention, and maybe suggest they write it down. This helps them keep their ideas straight and stops them from being distracted and making you repeat yourself excessively.

Don't assume anyone you're teaching is versed in what you're teaching. If they confront you on it, tell them you think it's better to assume those learning are learning from the ground up with no background than the other way around.

If someone is objecting to you covering the basics, they are not well educated enough to know that it's never a bad idea to cover the basics during an explaination. But if they do, skip the basics and if you go over their head it's on them then. You're not being condescending they're being stupid.

(That should get you through most explainations without much trouble!)

If anyone gets stuck do not cut them down and for your and their sanity do not say anything along the lines of 'this is easy.' It may be simple once you understand it but until that point it may boarder on learning rocket science to some.

This kind of speaking to people, one that speaks to others how you would like to be spoken to is how to come off as not condescending as possible.

Also there is no way you'll not be condescending to anyone. It happens, but just be able to try and adapt to their needs and still fulfill what they've asked of you.

And that's my ELI5..

I'm not good at talking to 5 year olds but I think that should be understandable!

If anyone can suggest I could have said I'm quite tired and am falling asleep trying to piece together this idea, so I may have stated things incorrectly, or misspelled words, or even used wrong words!

herp_von_derp,cfs,1389254661.0,"I've done a lot of those things (put the DVD cases in the crawl space, but close enough). I am in the process of changing my knitting and crafting books to digital. I realized that I need to make a tablet a bigger priority. I play Pathfinder with some friends, and carrying just the Core Rulebook is *murder* on my joints. 

One of my friends would be a paragon or /r/minimalism, but he's healthy and has hobbies that require very few tools or materials (isometric exercises, running, training dogs and sometimes he plays games like Minecraft). My grandmother is paring down her life too, but she doesn't even read or watch many movies, she just cares for the local church and herself. I an envious of these minimalistic lifestyles, but I can't achieve the same without giving up my hobbies. I knit, crochet, embroider, sew, weave, play video games, etc. They are the only thing that keep me going. Any time I can't get any knitting done, I am just miserable. Knitting shows that my time is not wasted. I make things to show how much I love and appreciate the people around me, and I make things to give myself a kind of love too. (Working with quality materials is never to be underestimated.)

I've been looking at all these beautiful bedrooms on places like pinterest and tumblr, and sometimes they have room for books, but not much else. This appeals to me on a deep level, possibly because I can't achieve it without making myself miserable. I don't know, it's hard to describe. But after I made my main post, I packed most of the yarn in my room into fewer containers than I expected and moved them to the basement. I feel a lot better. I've also been organizing the piles of stuff on my desk, which also helped.

When there are bogus ""victim advocacy groups"" organizations whose very livelihoods depend on keeping the lies going. When there are other interests like court-appointed psychologists and bullshit ""sensitivity training"" and other courses where livelihoods are again at stake and this is all linked together in a chain of perverse incentives.

It's a lot like what's happening right now with America and privatized prisons. There are perverse incentives to keep complete bullshit like ""The War on Drugs"" going and locking up mostly poor young men for non-serious, non-violent recreational drug possession and usage. These men can then be worked like slaves to produce things for sweatshop-like wages in order to make someone money. It's de facto slavery in modernity but of course there's no real political force trying to end it, because too many powerful hands are in the cookie jar."

TryUsingScience,Norse,1389254775.0,"There are three sets of symbols that get referred to as Norse runes: the Elder Futhark, the Younger Futhark, and the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. Nearly everyone who uses the runes for any kind of magic or divination uses the Elder Futhark. That's also a lot of what you'll see people writing with and carving into things that they want to make look Norse. 

Occasionally you'll see the other ones used. We actually have more archaeological examples of Younger and Anglo-Saxon because they're more recent, and I believe Anglo-Saxon also spread quite a bit farther geographically as well.

If you want to learn about the Elder Futhark for divination and magical purposes, Diana Paxson's book Taking Up the Runes is excellent. (At least the first half; ignore the group ritual stuff.) She also has quite a bit of historical stuff in there, but if your interest is primarily history-focused there may be a better source. No idea where to go for the other two."

* Use smaller plates. You'll eat less.

* Drink lots of water! It fills you up and is generally good for you.

* Drink cold water rather than room temperature - your body uses more energy raising the water up to your body temperature. 

* Have a slice of lemon in your water, or some lemon juice. Apparently that can speed up your metabolism (but I have no idea how/why)

* When you're hungry and feel like an unhealthy snack, ask yourself if you're hungry enough to eat an apple/something healthy. If the answer is yes, have that apple/healthy snack. If the answer is no, you're bored rather than hungry, so have a glass of water or something. "

BUT, if you speak to the fullest of your vocabulary's limits you chance making people need to learn the words to understand the message.

A lot of people's social interactions are already learning about a person or topic so if you're making them learn language as well as what you said, then one or both points will probably be lost. Best case is that they're able to ascertain the meaning by context. :(

That and you'll likely look like an ass. In everyday situations you'd be extremely hard pressed to find me using any kind of technical terms or speaking eloquently with large vocabulary, it just makes interactions with others more difficult.

Edit to explain - I used to speak in a manner that utilized my vocabulary too, but I've trained myself in 'simple speach' and got used to it. I have absolutely no problems switching modes though, but I rarely do. Maybe once a month with other people will I and usually then due to my technical knowledge on subjects.

I quickly have to revert and remember that not all are knowledgable in the same fasion I am, they each have their own areas of knowledge and their own passions. :)

They're still really good though...and a few of them are widely misunderstood by fans (much like the treatment Skyler White from Breaking Bad gets). Still, it takes place in the 1960s, so the overt sexism can get old. It's also not a great show as far as race is concerned. "

Here's a highlight reel:


[3:25](http://youtu.be/HQ0ePjNscrg?t=3m25s) Man describes alterations to suit to make it more life-like, specifically adding hair clippings around the fake vulva, and also the process of getting in the suit and becoming 'a very exciting female.'

[5:49](http://youtu.be/HQ0ePjNscrg?t=5m49s) Same man describes how the women he dates have trouble competing with himself in the suit. 

[9:48](http://youtu.be/HQ0ePjNscrg?t=9m48s) The son of the family owned ""femskin"" business states that ""Not all of them even want to be hot. Some of them want to be a nasty hag."" 

part 2 [2:17](http://youtu.be/0STOyADssZQ?t=2m17s) White man exclaims, ""I love women, I used to collect pictures of swimsuit models."" And explains how he used cross-dressing in his teenage years to create the 'sexy female' that he felt was otherwise out of reach. Wait a little longer to hear him explain how he uses it to connect with his daughters.

[5:07](http://youtu.be/0STOyADssZQ?t=5m7s) Masker: 'When I'm in my male mode (as a man), I go out into public, and I just blend in, and when I walk down the street, people don't pay any attention to me. But when I dress up and I put this mask on and the wig, you know, look very nice-- It's like a beautiful woman walking down the street'

[10:32 - 13:00](http://youtu.be/0STOyADssZQ?t=10m32s) Masker introduces his dollsona to his friends. Note the difference in the man's and woman's reaction. 

Part 4[:44-2:01](http://youtu.be/XrErthQbjWY?t=44s) Argument outside the bar and discussion.

[6:07](http://youtu.be/XrErthQbjWY?t=6m7s) 'Sherry' gets cat-called while a little girl with the catcaller watches

Most of these men appear to be simple transvestites: i.e., they enjoy creating this fetishized fantasy of womanhood and wearing a rubber suit, but they don't consider themselves female or have any interest in changing their bodies beyond clothes and prosthetics.

NoseFetish,creepyPMs,1389256089.0,"**Should I douche to clean inside my vagina?**

Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that women **don't douche.** Douching can change the delicate balance of vaginal flora (organisms that live in the vagina) and acidity in a healthy vagina. One way to look at it is in a healthy vagina there are both good and bad bacteria. The balance of the good and bad bacteria help maintain an acidic environment. Any changes can cause an over growth of bad bacteria which can lead to a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis. Plus, if you have a vaginal infection, douching can push the bacteria causing the infection up into the uterus, fallopian (fuh-LOH-pee-uhn) tubes, and ovaries.


**Should I douche to get rid of vaginal odor, discharge, pain, itching, or burning?**

No. You should never douche to try to get rid of vaginal odor, discharge, pain, itching, or burning. Douching will only cover up odor and make other problems worse. It's very important to call your doctor right away if you have:

* Vaginal discharge that smells bad

* Thick, white, or yellowish-green discharge with or without an odor

* Burning, redness, and swelling in or around the vagina

* Pain when urinating

* Pain or discomfort during sex

These may be signs of an infection, especially one that may be sexually transmitted. Do not douche before seeing your doctor. This can make it hard for the doctor to figure out what's wrong.**

**What is the best way to clean my vagina?**

Most doctors say it's best to let your vagina clean itself. The vagina cleans itself naturally by making mucous. The mucous washes away blood, semen, and vaginal discharge. You should know that even healthy, clean vaginas may have a mild odor.

Keep the outside of your vagina clean and healthy by washing regularly with warm water and mild soap when you bathe. You should also avoid scented types of: tampons, pads, powders, and sprays. These products may increase your chances of getting a vaginal infection.

But to answer bluntly about what desensitized means in this context, you have a part of your body rubbing against something it was never meant to day after day and slowly it becomes dried out, hardened.  Similar to how your fingers would build up a callous after playing guitar.  Compare a calloused finger to a normal one when you need someone to perform very fine movements and control their touch very finely.  The calloused person misses a lot of the feedback.

Now, the other example.  Compare the difference between touching your eyeball through your eyelid and pulling your eyelid back and rubbing your eye.  Feel free to assume you can eventually get used to the lack of eyelids, and if you had no eyelids you may consider your eyes to feel normal and they work just fine so what's the problem.  The problem is you never knew what they were supposed to do and how they should feel.  (Also like figuring out you need glasses as a kid - ""Oh, you mean trees aren't green blobs?"")."

SublethalDose,socialskills,1389256714.0,"I don't think it's a good idea to entirely suppress anger.  Anger is natural in some situations, and people might find it weird if you don't show any sign of it, especially if you're explaining why you have every right to be angry.  They might think you're repressed, that you don't care about them, that you're unfeeling in general, or even that you're a snob and look down on them too much to be angry at them.  (If you should be angry at somebody, but instead you feel nothing towards them, that's a powerful way of denying their relevance to you.  ""If I were a dog, I would stop and scratch my fleas, but I'm a man and prefer my dignity."" — some famous person talking about his enemies.)  Or they might think that you're ice cold because you've gone beyond anger into hatred.

All of those are negative assumptions.  Nobody likes a sociopath, nobody likes to be hated, and nobody likes someone who is emotionally checked out of the situation, either.  It's important not to overwhelm people or to use expressions of emotion in a coercive, terroristic way, but it's also not good to flatten your affect and discuss the situation like Data from Star Trek.  It's better to show an appropriate amount of anger so people can see that you're human and that you respect them enough that you expect to have good relations with them.  

One valid reason for not expressing anger is if you have a hard time moving on from it.  For example, suppose I inconvenience a friend in some minor way, and they get their jimmies ruffled, and they say something a bit sharp to me.  I apologize, my friend accepts my apology, and a minute later, we've reestablished a good mood and are laughing and joking about something else, with no hangover.  That's fine!  No problem!  But not everybody is that emotionally nimble.  Some people, once they acknowledge a negative mood, take a while to get over it.  If my friend got pissed over something trivial and let that put a damper on our time together, I'd hold that against him.  So if you're slow to let go of anger, you shouldn't get angry over small things.

Bryn013,FanTheories,1389256716.0,"While he did fake his own death, I don't think he did it intentionally at first nor was it pre-planned. For one thing, there was no way in hell he could have foreseen and planned for all the madness that occurred in the film's opening sequence. There are easier ways to fake your own death than riding a motorcycle on the Grand Bazaar and having a fist fight on top of a moving train and falling off of said train into a river.

Second, He was willing to stay behind to look after Ronson until the paramedics arrived. If he was planning to fake his death from the get go and was on a strict time limit, he wouldn't have been so adamant about staying behind. While, I think M's disregard for Ronson's life during the moment probably didn't win her any brownie points from Bond, he probably didn't connect the dots until after he survived the fall and was declared dead.

And on that note, Bond was fairly pissed off (to put it mildly) that M gave the order to Eve to take the shot even though Bond's life was at risk. This, along with the incident with Ronson mention above, gave M the image of the ""evil queen of numbers"" (Yay for Goldeneye references) that didn't care for the lives of Bond or anyone else in the field So long as the job got done. So Bond, now being declared dead by MI6, decided to stay dead and live his life rather than be seen as an expendable asset by MI6 and M and have a shorter life expectancy.

""Lower risk of STDs.""  Never proven.  Regardless, if you're in a position to have sex with someone who has an STD you really should be considering why you're also not using a condom.

""No chance of phimosis.""  Oh, you mean that problem that affects 9/1000 men and 8/9 of those can be cured without circumcision?  Let's take all body parts that have at least a 1/1000 chance of being removed and get rid of them too.  Brain?  Ehh, might get cancer later on, let's just remove it.

On that topic, ""Penile cancer rate is reduced.""  Again, look into the rate.  It's very low and makes no sense to prevent against something that rare.

1.  Removes 20,000 nerve endings (2.5x as much as the clitoris)

I think I explained how to teach someone in a non-condescending manner. But to not be condescending is a lot more.

The main idea behind it is to be humble in your approach and not to overestimate others and put them in embarassing circumstances. But don't underestimate them so much that they're embarassed they asked.

It's like reaching confidence without falling either into poor self esteem or arrogance. It's a fine line that will be crossed occasionally on accident.

I think this is a better ELI5 than my long winded post. :)

Edit - I bet when you're tutoring people and err on the side of underestimating you'll find that they'll have points of 'Ahah!' and then things will start coming quicker to them. Generally it's a small piece of the basic idea that's missing that holds people back and most tutors opt to overestimate rather than the other option. Best of luck with your future!"

edit: Another interesting comment: about Miesha's flailing kicks near the beginning of Round 2 (which looked a little silly, but did the job of getting Ronda off her and letting Miesha stand up again): Rousey says she found those so ridiculous that she reacted badly by throwing a (fairly ineffective) kick of her own in an emotional reaction. Perhaps she means that she could have kept Miesha on her back if she'd reacted better."

I found it difficult to masturbate - at the time I relied on it as a way to induce sleep, and even when I did climax, there was no pleasure in it. My previously passionate sex life felt hollow and the time I had sex with my partner (I quit taking it after 10 days because I couldn't handle it anymore) I ended up in tears because I felt... wrong.

I can't even picture an incorrect grip for farmer's walk. You literally just hold the weights.

I don't think the gloves affect your grip mechanics in farmer's walk. In other exercises, they certainly do, because your grip affects the way the weight is distributed along your body in deadlifts or squats, for example.

DenryM,comicbooks,1389257394.0,"Lol really? I didn't say comics are innately bigoted, please don't put words in my mouth. 

Also, calling it ""sequential art"" is laughable. Comics are a respected art form because they are comics; using unnecessary synonyms like that makes it sounds like you think comics need to be justified by big and pseudo-academic words, when really comics are just fucking awesome and can stand on their own merit. 

Back to my point- comics aren't innately anything. But the American comic book industry has been (especially at the start) dominated by straight white men, targeting other straight white men. although, obviously, the main character of a series doesn't have to look exactly like you in order to relate and enjoy a series. But when in the entire industry, no characters look or act like you or your friends, except in cases of stereotypes and tokens, it's a bit alienating and pushes many potential fans away. After all, if minorities are expected to relate to white heroes, what is it that makes it impossible for white people to relate to minority heroes every once in a while? 

The industry has gotten much, much better lately. That much is obvious. this character is a great example of progress!! :) there's still a ways to go, though, unfortunately.

I'm so sick of guys bitching because girls didn't talk to them growing up - therefore *every single girl* is the enemy when it comes to ""guy interests."" It's the same stupid fucks that claim to be ""gentlemen"" and shit talk men that degrade women.

&gt;Telling a woman she's not a real ""nerd/geek/gamer"" or whatever **is exactly the fucking same** as some jerk telling us that we can't be into football, or guns, or hunting or whatever.

&gt;Stop blaming entire groups/races/genders for your problems. Just because some people suck, it doesn't mean we all do. Everyone has their own shit in life, and everyone goes through different shit - gender (or whatever) doesn't always have to be a fucking factor.

Did you really even read any of this part? I said that is as bad as guys saying women can't be *into* football. Not as in, having a whole fucking league. **INTERESTED** in. I also mentioned guns and hunting, except you ignored it.

That *entire* last paragraph says ""everyone's"" fault. It pretty much says that *everyone* who was legit into nerdy stuff got picked on. I'm not sure how the hell you got that I have a vendetta against men when I clearly stated that I feel we are all equals and that I feel *everyone* should be treated as just that - equals.

Also, I was simply replying to the image. The guy posting is the one comparing his life experiences against an image of someone he's never met. I simply used mine to display that, again, *everyone* has it bad and that I'm sick of gender being used as an excuse to complain when it's just people in general who are assholes.

And I agree that the girl looks like she's faking it - that's just one girl. That's a small group of girls who act fake like that. I've literally never ran into one girl who acts like that in real life. It's mostly just guys posting pictures and spreading them around and bitching. That just gives them attention. It just brings gender to the table when it's useless and irrelevant to anything. Ignore it. There's no reason for any guy to bitch about a girl like her other than to blame girls for something.

violet_kitten,AskReddit,1389258129.0,"I had a friend in grade school Girl Scouts who was scared of wild animals. Including squirrels. We were on a summer camping trip. Canvas tents with four beds to a tent, wooden floors, and a port-a-potty toilet out in the woods. Fancy camping from what I knew.

Usually we had to use the buddy system if we were going anywhere, but she got up to go to the bathroom at night and went by herself. Not long after, half the camp was woken up by her shrieks coming from off in the woods.

Pretty quickly, I heard the quick rustle of leaves as the counselor for our area ran out there. I didn't get out of bed but she told me the next morning that just as she had sat down on the toilet, a squirrel jumped out of the uh... storage underneath - completely freaked, was jumping and scratching around everything trying to get out. She stumbles out the door, pants at her ankles, screaming, and the squirrel made its escape.

The way she described what the squirrel looked like though was just... fantastic. Like some sort of slimy glistening angry beast monster with glowing red eyes and tiny sharp claws ready to attack.

**TL;DR** Night time port-a-potty ass-brushing by a terrified squirrel terrifies Girl Scout."

MightySasquatch,pics,1389258958.0,"I'd also like to add that the US weapons of war were really quite outstanding and the majority of them were better than their German counterparts. 

The primary one that gets a lot of flak is the Sherman battle tank, but there are mitigating factors here. First of all the Sherman was very mechanically sound, it didn't break down often. It also was very easy to mass produce, which is why the US was able to build 50,000 of them. Meanwhile German tanks, especially Tigers, broke down all the fucking time.

Likewise the US also had:
The Corsair, basically the best air superiority fighter of the war (except I guess the ME-262).
The Mustang, which had enormous ranges and was also a very effective dog fighter. 
The first country to fully mechanize their armed forces, so that all infantry were carried in trucks. Also had mobile artillery contingents which were both great in number and effectiveness, which was one of the main advantages the US army had against the Germans other than pure numbers. These were also fully mechanized (all self propelled artillery). Compare this with the Germans who had primarily horse-drawn artillery. And most of their infantry was on foot as well (except the infantry divisions that were part of Panzer Corps).

The Germans may have pioneered the Blitzkrieg tactics but the US ended up being the most effective country at it."

We have several varieties of Woodpecker, including a pair of Pileated- they're gigantic! We have a bunch of standing dead trees, and three of the largest Oaks in Westmoreland County.

Even more so with the highest elo player, the first pick is usually to claim a top pick that hasn't been banned, regardless of the role, so it can be swapped out later to the relevant team member.

Basically, if you do it without conferring with the team mate in question and don't ask if they're comfortable in another role first,  it's the effective equivalent of instalocking. And I'm sure I don't have to point out how much of a pain instalockers are."

Its not well fitted in terms of darts, but its a soft cotton blend so its not boxy. No one sees me in my apron anyway, and its always covered in shit, Doesn't have to look good, just has to cover my good clothes.

Toby-one,pics,1389259706.0,"We learned after one of the NATO bombing campaings in the balkans that the only thing that can stop a bunker buster is a good layer of hard mountain. Which has been part of Swedish defensive thinking since the year 1900 when we decided to start building our fortresses into the mountain.

So it wouldn't really do much. The thinking when it came to the Swedish navy was that these bases would act as a peace time base and the reason why we have it so well protected is because we didn't expect to get a declaration of war before they tried taking out our Navy and Airforce. After the war started the plan was to disperse the aircraft to small bases around Sweden and the ships to [temporary warbases in the archipelago](http://www.bildrum.se/jsc/halland02.JPG).

The idea was to be dispersed so that no one bombstrike could knock everything out and to move between bases so no one would know where the ships were at any given point. When our reconnaissance resources (planes, submarines, etc.) found a suitable enemy to attack the orders would be passed down and the entire fleet was to dash out of the archipelago through ""impassable"" channels fire their entire load at the enemy. Then they would fire decoys and turn back and disappear into the archipelago to reload, repair, and refuel."

nathanpaulyoung,malehairadvice,1389259844.0,"First off, let's look at your assets. You've got a good jawline, high cheekbones, and a square face. That's good shit. Leverage it. On the other hand, you're young and incapable of a full beard. That limits your choices a bit.

You said you want to stick with something medium length. I think you should at least consider something short. You've got a fairly square face, so doing something that sits a bit higher on top of your head might look good.

* If you want something simple and straightforward, easy to maintain even, try something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/Bhg7rg0.jpg).

* If you can put up with using a little bit of matte product on the reg, but still want to keep it simple in case you feel like being lazy, try something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/SYTgTK5.jpg) maybe even working up to something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/uE8pvRb.jpg).

* Okay, so short isn't your thing you say. You want something long because it's familiar. Been there, done that. So try a compromise with something that still looks professional, [like this](http://i.imgur.com/MfxvWvt.jpg) or maybe [like this](http://i.imgur.com/wXu5L2x.jpg).

Keep in mind, balancing the top and bottom of your face is important. It's the entire reason that ""long hair"" is so *very* associated with unprofessionalism. There's nothing ""wrong"" with long hair, but it's so VERY easy to not balance your face out. Long hair is easy to be lazy with, albeit in a very different way than with short hair. The more hair you have on the SIDE of your head, the more you need facial hair to make your head not look like an inverted pear or triangle. It just kind of works out that way for someone with a very square face.

Also a word on ""gel"". Don't go for ""gel"". You should be looking for a matte wax or fiber. Basically, [this stuff](http://www.americancrew.com/products/style/fiber). Most hair places have this on hand. Use as little as possible to get your hair into the shape desired. Less is more."

Analog265,MMA,1389259869.0,"He really didn't, only Silva fans cling to the idea that there are still questions. Over two fights, Weidman seemed to shut him down completely. On the ground, on the feet, in the clinch, Weidman did serious damage while Silva never really threatened. In the first fight, Silva's leg kicks were the only effective weapons Silva had and in the second that was made redundant. Even though he cracked his leg earlier, he persisted with those leg kicks until it eventually broke, it wasn't an accident. With the first fight, his psychological warfare didn't work, Silva kept his hands low (maybe to defend takedowns) and Weidman figured out the answer to deal with his striking defence (the way he rolls with punches) and knocked him out.

&gt;Look at Silva Sonnen 1,everyone knows Silva got beat up for 5 rounds and only just won that fight.

LWdkw,changemyview,1389259954.0,"That's exactly how it works everywhere else. An example:

A store prices an item at 80 cents. The taxes are 25% (another 20 cents). At the end of the day, the customer owns 1 dollar less after buying it, the store has 80 cents more, and the government has 20 cents more.

This is the exact same case everywhere. The ONLY difference between the USA and the rest of the world is that in the USA the price tag reads ""80 cents"", and in the rest of the world the price tag reads ""1 dollar"".

In my opinion, the second is more informative to the consumer, as they are generally more interested in how money they actually have to pay, then in how that money gets split.

The receipt will still also tell you what amount went to the store and what amount went to taxes, so you still have that information - but while deciding whether you think this item is worth it's price, you already know what price you should actually be thinking about."

DragonFireKai,magicTCG,1389260012.0,"I've run a mono white heroic deck fairly successfully at FNM for the past few months. What you need to do to utilize heroic in constructed is to utilize speed to limit the opportunities that opponents have to use spot removal to get rid of your creature, and supplementing it with cheap defense to screen out any removal that might get through. My mono white deck uses four gods willing and four brave the elements to guard against doom blades and other forms of targeted removal. With U/W, you give up a little speed, but you can use mizzium skin in a similar manner, along with some cheap counterspells. Then it's just a matter of having the right creatures, the right triggers, and a means of reach, four favored hoplites, four hopeful eidolons, and four ethereal armors are mandatory. Beyond that the means of reach, pump, and defense vary based upon the color splashed.

Fabled hero is kind of a trap. You shouldn't run more than two. The doublestrike is sexy, but because it costs three mana, you can't cast it defensibly until turn 4, which means that sweepers are beginning to show up, which you have no means to defend against aside from the much more expensive rootborn defenses, or splashing red for boros charm. A lot of people like to pair up the fabled hero with expensive flashy enchants like holy mantle or gift of orzhov, and either do it on curve and die to removal, or wait a turn to keep it defensible, and allow the opponent a much wider range of options to stop it. In contrast, by sticking to a lower curve, you can dump two ethereal armors and a divine favor on a favored hoplite and be swinging for 11 on turn three with a mana open to protect against spot removal.

Fabled hero can work well in G/W heroic, as with shock lands you can ramp into it on turn two, and two giant growths and a gods willing makes an 11/11 double striker with protection from whatever's needed swinging on turn three. But it's still vulnerable for a turn, and they're more likely to commit to a one for one trade against a 2/2 double striker than they would against a one drop 1/2. 

In U/W, I'd recommend focusing on the battlewise hoplite, rather than the fabled hero, it comes in a turn earlier, and when it triggers you get to scry in addition to putting on a counter, which makes it easier to ensure you have the cards you need to keep it alive, or force the early kill."

Edit: Also, I think you might have a slight anger issue here. The anger you seem to be putting forth is much more than is warranted by an issue of this magnitude.

Edit 2: Upon reevaluation, I will posit this: The next step here is him cheating on you. If you won't/can't have sex and he doesn't complain at all and then you get on him constantly about something as small as moving some pillows to masturbate in private and not bringing it up with you, it won't be very long before he tries to seek comfort elsewhere.

it is like paper chase (that is translated, it is Schnitzeljagd in German, a game you play on children's birthday parties, when you search a treasure based on marks on the ground or clues).  
You look up GPS coordinates and then you go out to look for treasures, called ""caches"" (small boxes or something like that), since GPS is not 100% accurate, you have to search when you arrive at the spot. Then you put your geocaching nickname in the log of the cache when you've found it.  
There is a variety of different sorts of caches, multi caches where you will get the clues for the next cache in the first one, or caches you can only find at certain times or under certain circumstances.
There are caches all around the world.    
Since many people do have a smartphone, there are apps and you don't need another GPS device. It is fun if you do it in a group but can be interesing on your own as well. And it is outdoor, often in the nature, so that is a plus (at least for me).

Evlwolf,newtothenavy,1389260842.0,"I went in as AV. I'm now an AE3.

AV splits into three distinct ratings: AE, ATI, and ATO. You will not find out which one you will be until probably the last week of boot when your orders are posted on Bupers (you'll find out what that is soon enough). Then, you'll ship to Pensacola, Florida for A school. It's humid. There are nice beaches. Barracks life sucks, but you *can* have cell phones, laptops, tablets, whatever (something to remember if you want your electronics mailed to your A school).

You'll wait a bit (months) to class up, and then you'll class up for ATT (aviation technical training), which is a basic electrical engineering class that all three rates take. It's about a month long, and it's not very difficult. But prepare for a timewarp back to the 90s (the ATT computers have windows 98 because the training software is so old). 

Then, when that class is over, you'll wait anywhere from a couple days to a couple months to class up for your ""strand"" class. This is the core of your training for your rate. Schematics, math (for ATs), etc. This is 2 months long for AEs, and longer for ATIs and ATOs. During your strand class, you'll get to pick orders. Top students get first pick, so it's a high motivation to apply yourself. You'll finish your strand, graduate, and then, most likely, ship off to C school for whatever you're working on. From there, you'll go to your command and learn about the wonderful world of Aviation, which your year+ of time in school has done little to prepare you for. But it's okay, that's how it is for everyone. 

A summary of the three rates themselves (edited from a [different post I commented on](http://www.reddit.com/r/newtothenavy/comments/1lfd74/just_enlisted_with_a_rating_of_aviation/)): 

AEs (we're awesome): Electrical systems. We're wire chasers. If something that is connected to a wire isn't working, we have to troubleshoot. Our main systems are power distribution, flight control electronics, lighting, some displays, air data, and of course, the wiring system.

ATs: Communications, Navigation, and Weapons. Radios, jammers, radar, GPS and navigation, and other electronic weapon/weapon control systems. ATOs mainly repair the aircraft itself. ATIs repair the computers themselves that are removed from the aircraft (They'll usually be at places like FRC, which is a center that repairs and supplies parts and components for the fleet). How I remembered it was AT(O) = OUTSIDE. AT(I) = INSIDE.

Good luck!"

Analog265,MMA,1389260885.0,"They both ended oddly, but not in a way that leaves questions if you examine the situation. 

Silva's clowning had little to do with it, he's frequently done that and not gotten knocked out, he'd just use his head movement and roll with the punches. The reason he got knocked out was because Weidman figured it out and caught him with a smart punching combination, theres a Jack Slack article that explains it pretty well. Second fight he tries to make more use of the leg kicks but Weidman checks them, then even though he cracks his own leg, he keeps throwing kicks onto Weidman's knee until his own leg breaks. Combined with the fact that they fought in every position and Weidman had the upper hand, i don't think there are still questions at all.

&gt;My guess is more people believe that than those fans who go on and on about Silva having a bad rib etc. That fight had faaaar less questions raised than the Weidman fight.

I just think thats because Sonnen didn't win, Silva marks didn't really have much reason to get defensive."

justgivingsomeadvice,Futurology,1389261517.0,"&gt; I've learned about anti-Malaria efforts and so on from Bill Gates there, a proven person who is capable of changing the world...

But this is part of the issue he gets at. I should qualify the claim with the obvious statement that not every TED talk is guilty of being the preaching of ""middlebrow megachurches."" But when you're listing examples of how TED has bettered your life, well that's the issue isn't it? You feeling good about the world and getting a better idea of Bill Gates' anti-malaria efforts is all well and good, but it's not really helping advance society in any way. Which is fine of course, it's not like everything in your life has to have that kind of meaning. But the problem arises when TED is being packaged not as infotainment, but as a key to a better future. 

&gt;Now he's saying that optimism in facing difficult problems isn't relevant to anything practical

This is such a false dichotomy. He's not saying optimism isn't relevant: how many times does he argue against cynicism in the talk? His argument is that optimism alone doesn't do anything. You can feel optimistic about anti-Malaria efforts after listening to Bill Gates' talk, and that's great. But unless that encourages you to do something about it, it doesn't really matter, does it? I don't think sufferers of malaria are helped by your new understanding, unless that compels you to action. And the problem with TED is that, as the speaker notes, you get a fleeting sense of optimism, satisfaction, and maybe some interesting brain snacks. If anything, this may invoke in you a sense of complacency that actually *hurts* the future (because you, as a potential catalyst for change, decide to leave the status quo).

But the vast majority of them don't actually actually encourage change. I just read the transcript of Bill Gates' speech. As usual you have to admire the man's ideas and thoughts. Maybe I feel optimistic that a man as rich and smart as Bill Gates has ideas about how to fix the education system. That's great, but... how does that actually help? I've taken a few analysis-based classes on education, and there are a lot of great ideas people have, like a detracked school system and greater flexibility for great teachers to create their own curriculum. But what Gates' ideas do is promote the current system (tracked schooling, for one) and avoid complicated questions (like how to adequately gauge teacher performance). Due to TED's time restrictions or his own lack of knowledge, he doesn't talk about the need to promote tolerance and understanding of linguistic diversity. There are a lot of good bits in his speech, but ultimately Bratton would argue (and I agree) that we're not going to improve our education system this way. And it's a problem when this is supposedly a platform for improving the future.

The first time was understandable, apparently pap smears are not normally that painful.

But they get me, I wouldn't want to get it done by anyone else now, Its the only time I see that doctor, I had one done by a GP last year, and I blacked out and threw up on myself, so I'll take conscious drilling sensation over unconscious vomiting. My normal pap-doctor (a GYN at a sexual health clinic) is funny, she tells me about her day and the crazies they had at the clinic pharmacy last night, she does her best to distract me, and she's patient with me once its over and I need time to recover from the pain."

Don't try and assume an expended amount. It's certainly possible to burn that but it'd be a competition session for a straight 60 minutes or crazy paced passing drills for 60 minutes.

An elderly man asked me if I was all right, if I needed help and all that, and he actually asked if ""he should call the police for me."" I told him that breaking a girl's heart is not illegal, and he smiled and said ""but it should be."" And it hit me full force when he said that. No. No it should not, it never should be illegal. We cannot legally regulate feelings. And no one should be punished for the feelings they evoke in others, because that would make us hostages of the first unstable nutjob that comes our way.

It's true that by going out there and exposing your inexperience, you might look a little foolish, just like if you've never played tennis and decided to learn, you'd look pretty foolish your first few times on the court.  It doesn't mean much to look foolish, though, especially if you're sincere and self-aware.  Let's consider the worst possible interpretation of your actions:  you're lonely and have nobody to talk to.  That isn't so bad.  It happens.  People move.  People get married and drop off the face of the earth.  Friends grow apart.  Nobody is going to assume that you are unworthy of friendship simply because you don't have any friends.  Furthermore, think all the good things that your actions prove about you:  You value human contact.  You're brave.  You believe you can grow.  You don't push people away to hide a weakness.  Potential friends and other good people will appreciate those things about you.  The rest aren't any loss.  I think you're on the right track, and I think you're very brave.  Good job!

mundabit,TwoXChromosomes,1389263377.0,"This is how I interpreted that exchange, and I don;t see it as odd, It was a bit strange to do it in front of him so he saw you receiving the money, If the money was specifically for you, either do it in private, or loudly announce ""this is for you, our daughter, the one we provide for"" to avoid your partner trying to 'reclaim' the money.

8 months in is a bit early to be having financial issues. I agree with Phosphate-3, Gender is irrelevant, the fact that he is male means nothing about how much he should be paying, But at the same time, Your individual financial backgrounds are important, as he earns more/has more, he should be paying more for the things he wants.

I have similar issues in my relationship, we are 6 years in and registered, so its more serious, but we are only now talking about joining our finances. and its *still* tough to mention money. You don;t want a relationship to turn into a buisness transaction, but unfortnatley you have to talk about it.

a simple rule my partner and I had when we first started going out was ""can't afford it? don't suggest it"" so if he said ""lets go out to dinner"" I would look in my wallet and say ""how about fish and chips?"" (a food I could afford) he, unhappy with fish and chips would look in his wallet, as he earns more and say ""nah, we'll go to that nice italian place, my shout""

he has the option to not pay anything, and have free fish and chips. If he is unhappy with that, its his responsibility to come up with and implement a plan he does like. 

when it comes to going Dutch, we always agreed before hand. ""lets go to gold class (fancy cinema) when the hobbit comes out, we'll split tickets 50-50, but each pay for our own food"". With this plan you can't be afraid to have a domestic in public, a few times he has forgotten the plan or decided to change the plan, I have to put my foot down, sometimes in front of the cashier waiting for someone to pay, and explain ""no, we agreed to pay our own way, I'm not paying for your drink tab, you wanted to order expensive drinks for yourself, you pay"" 

It may look like we don't love each other when stuff like this happens. but in reality it's what keeps us together, the only other option is to bottle stuff up, slowly go broke, then have shit hit the fan later, which  is the way your relationship will go if you don;t have a chat with your partner, it doesn't have to be too long, just a simple ""hey, I just wanted you to know, I'm reviewing my budget, because as you know I don't have much, so I'll probably try and plan our dates a bit better, or double-check before we do things how much it will cost, I might not be as flexible with paying for things, But please don't think I'll be mooching, in fact the reason I am doing this is so I wont have to"""

I don't really go to strip clubs often, but I have a few times, and would be willing to again. 

I think something that women don't realize is that when most guys go to strip clubs, it's more about the other guys than the girls. Strippers aren't really very attractive to me, even when drunk, they're sort of just these things that are there for entertainment, the prime example of female objectification, because to most guys they are literally like objects. I know in the back of my mind they are just women, but when I look at a stripper I almost feel like they are a different species than say a girlfriend. 

So why go? Male bonding. Say your a guy that doesn't like watching basketball, but you'll still go drink beers with your friend and watch it, not because you care about the game, but because it's something to do, something to go back to when there's a lull in the conversation. 

Going to a strip club isn't really about getting aroused, it's about hanging out with your buddies while you get drunk and objectify women. "

It's not that I don't believe that the things I believe are true, it's just more nuanced than that. Firstly, I'm Jewish because I was born into a Jewish family, and I remain Jewish because I feel it is terribly disrespectful the those who came before me who were discriminated against for their religion if I just turn around and go ""nah, can't be bothered with this Jewish stuff. sod it.""

But specifically Reform Judaism is about looking at Halacha and making sure that it is relevant to modern life. For example, I am less concerned by the method used to kill an animal and more concerned that the animal was kept in good conditions and didn't suffer. I believe that is more inkeeping with the ethos of Judaism, even if it's not what is written in the Torah.

But it's not about believing it despite thinking it's not true, it's about knowing and respecting the fact that my truth is not necessarily your truth, and that doesn't make either of us less right."

TofuRobber,harrypotter,1389264097.0,"I'm glad that there are means to get younger people interested in world politics using Harry Potter but there really is a lot of missing information so after some quick research I though I should shed some light. 

I was confused as to why visiting a place that enshrine soldiers was seen as a bad thing to even be considered controversial. To me it's like people being mad about the US and it's Vietnam Veterans Memorial (The Wall). Sure Japan did bad things during WWII but they did it for their country, why shouldn't they be honored for it? 

The reason why the Yasukuni Shrine is controversial is not because it is enshrining soldiers, it's because it's enshrining **war criminals**, people who did more harm than necessary, intentional civilian casualty, murder, anything that can be deemed as unjustified by military necessity. These criminals are then being enshrined in this place along with many other honorable veterans, and in a few cases secretly without full consent, especially 14 class A war criminals who were political/military leaders during WWII. It also seems to glorify Japan's past military actions.

Therefore, China's ambassador can be said to be correct when say that this shrine is the horcrux of Japan. Japan (with my limited knowledge) was destroyed from WWII because of ""Militarism"" (their Voldemort). They sought power and control though a strong military and just as Voldemort devastated the wizarding world, Japan's military actions have history of harming and terrorizing the neighboring nations. And so, like Voldemort's horcruxs, by enshrining the war criminals it makes light of their actions and pretty much absolves them of their crimes. The history of their misdeeds becomes overlooked and so the reminder of the horrors of war soon fades from public mind. The shrine becomes a horcrux, storing the evil of war, visiting this place strengthens it, allowing it to grow strong once again. (Visiting the shrine had seemed to be used as an excuse to do some aggressive military activity on Japan's part in the past.)

Then there's Japan's ambassador's response. He does not deny anything but claims their worries are unfounded. ""[Fears of rising militarism in Japan are unfounded given the country's postwar record of commitment to peace.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/06/voldemort-china-japan-shrine_n_4548249.html)"" He does compares China to Voldemort as a response. So his response says, although Japan may hold a horcrux we still known shame in our Voldemort. We have seen what our Voldemort has done and we condemn it. Just visiting a shrine does not necessarily mean anything aggressive. China, however, you and your arms race are worst than us. You are actively seeking power, power with the potential to doom us all.

So yeah, Although it's funny, they are talking about some serious stuff. This is just the rambling of some guy on the internet so just take my words with a grain of salt. I'd advise you to do your own research as all of this is really quite interesting. It also goes to show that Harry Potter can even be applicable to real world global issues."

It was only 9 months ago (damn, has it really been that long? Seems like yesterday) that I had my first kiss. I'm 20.

I thought it was never gonna happen for me. I thought I was gonna be one of those 40 year old kissless virgins. Nothing happened for me in high school. Nada. I was that nerdy guy with really bad social skills. I've been in your position before. But, something happened. Last year, I just stopped giving a fuck. I stopped caring about dating and girls and all that and just decided to focus on myself.

I always had a thing for one of my friends, and it turns out, that the more we hung out that semester, she started to develop feelings for me too. One thing led to another, then the next thing I know... BAM. We're kissing, making out, holding hands, etc and we hung out whenever we could.  It just came out of nowhere. I honestly wasn't expecting it. 

The point of my story is that there's still hope for you. Don't give up. It **will** happen. 

What I did was that I worked on my social skills. This, in turn, made it easier to talk to girls. It's like mastering any other skill: you have to constantly practice it, or else you'll never get anywhere. The constant practice makes you more comfortable. I suggest checking out this subreddit, for a start:

/r/socialskills

Good luck, man. There's still many years left for you to get that first relationship, that first kiss, etc.

Feel free to PM me if you'd like to talk about anything.

P.S. There are few experiences that are like your first kiss. The moment when you go in for it...the moment when your lips meet her's, the moment she reciprocates...it's amazing.  I vividly remember mine. I still remember the sensation of her lips touching mine. It was magical. I was thinking, ""Holy fucking shit, is this really happening? OMG"" 

It'll certainly be something you'll remember for a long time."

LostMyPasswordNewAcc,4chan,1389265230.0,"I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my butt-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my buttcheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my butt of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My butt was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know.

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two buttcheaks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poo- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my butt off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my butt cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my butt at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for butt-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my buttcheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your butt having the texture of a Brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.

Guys, DON'T SHAVE YOUR BUTT-HAIR!"

You seem to be hung up on the term ""survival of the fittest."" It's a term that Darwin and many biologists today prefer not to use, as it's often misunderstood. Evolution doesn't necessitate that the strong survive and the weak die off. In Darwin's words, ""It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.""

Fitness is all about adaptability, and it applies to genes, not individuals. In our species, pro-social traits were selected because alone, we are quite fragile and vulnerable. Cooperation and mutual aid is a large part of what gives humanity an edge over other species. When someone is down and out, we care for them. We expect others to reciprocate if we find ourselves in hard times. It's a mutually beneficial relationship.

To quote Darwin again, ""If the misery of the poor be caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin."" "

sharshenka,literature,1389267152.0,"I don't know, that seems like an unsatisfying reading of the book - kind of like saying it was all a dream. It doesn't seem like there really is a cause and effect relationship between the reading of the earlier story on the actions of the later characters. Robert does finish Adam's journal - he finds it under the leg of his bed the night he leaves Zehdelgheim (sorry if that is spelled wrong, I'm on a phone). Louisa feels more connected to Sixsmith because she finds his letters, but would she have dropped the story if she hasn't found them? I don't think so; it was still her first scoop, and she would have still suspected Sixsmith was murdered. Similarly, how were Cavendish or Somni motivated by reading/seeing the previous story? They are both aware (and pissed) about their oppression before they are exposed to the previous works.

I would say that the book is more about how people live on through their work. In his suicide note, Robert says he would rather ""be music"" than a lump of meat wandering around, and Somni doesn't try to escape the raid she knows is coming because being captured and executed will help deseminate her Dedications. Sixsmith dies for hiss final work, the HYDRA report, and Louisa is willing to take a similar risk for her story (although she is also trying to save her life by publishing it). Cavendish is in sort of the same possition as Ayers - profiting off of another man's work - but at the end realizes that he could produce his own memoir and thereby give more meaning to his life.

All of that seems diminished if the first four characters are purely fictional. They become the work of some unseen author (or at most two authors) who, what? Wanted to be really thorough in creating background material? It makes the book less impactful, in my opinion."

Basically, map design in the earlier CoDs was a case of having particular areas that players could hold down to their advantage - the construction building and central building on Backlot immediately spring to mind, or the large 3 storey building on Crash.


Due to the complaints of camping, and the want to push the speed of the game to feel a bit faster, the maps have evolved into a far more flowing obstacle course race track-like thing where you always have the option to push forward in most cases. The problem that comes with this is that every room has a very large amount of exits and entrances, which then bring in lots of chokepoints. Those chokepoints are there to concentrate firefights in particular areas where players are happy when they get multi-kills."

My mom has always had health problems, particularly asthma, and she was in and out of the hospital throughout her youth. She's always been overweight/obese, and I think it stems from steroidal asthma medication from her childhood. She takes steroids even now and I think she's at her heaviest. But I think she also eats. And when my dad was really bad, her outlet was food. It's mine too, but I was skinny growing up so it didn't affect me really until high school, when I started taking birth control. 

And the way they live, the food they eat, it's miserable. They're hoarders even though you can walk through the house. They have so much unnecessary stuff. My mom buys replacements for things instead of looking for the original. And my dad goes to swap meets and garage sales and buys junk for them to sell on eBay. They do well but the junk just sits in the house. 

And while my dad is apparently better, he still makes me uncomfortable. My dad is the sweetest, nicest guy on the planet. But the depression turned him into a huge asshole and he makes faces and mumbles under his breath and talks to himself and the dog and I know if my mom left him, he'd be a crazy guy on the street. My mom won't leave him though, she has nothing else in her life.

The most obvious one I've seen though was one that had a small camera attached to something that sat on his ear. Very obvious. When I mentioned it, he replied with ""you know, ever since I've started wearing this, it's amazing how much nicer people are to me"". 

Other cops I've spoken to have pointed out that there really is a huge statistical drop in the amount of complaints made against police that wear cameras, and a lot of the complaints are otherwise resolved very quickly when the review of the footage happens, regardless of good or bad outcome for the police officer involved."

Arkanta,Android,1389267786.0,"I did, and I was making the same point.  

Xposed is technically amazing (since hooking into every method was really not easy), but by its very design comes with an overhead, and there is really no way to avoid that without rewriting the bytecode. Maybe with ART xposed we will see something better.  

The lower user experience quality comes from the modules, not Xposed itself. You can do the same things with xposed that you can with custom roms, but matching the quality of the features, while maintaining compatibility with multiple roms is hard. So it's really more a gravity box problem than a xposed one. I personally find many custom roms very shitty and unpolished.  

I understand that Xposed is not a viable option, and I agree. I just find Gravity Box great, and Xposed technically nice. They are certainly not without flaws, but I appreciate the great flexibility they brought to the community."

&gt;What is a Rubber Doll?


&gt;There are four basic categories which the term Rubber Doll can apply:

&gt;1) The BDSM community as a service submissive.

&gt;2) The TG /TV community as a Sissy doll in Fetish attire.

&gt;3) The common category to both of the above as a show doll for exhibitionism.

&gt;4) Art form.


&gt;A relatively new phenomenon, the fantasy fetish female rubber doll as we now know it was originally brought to our attention by Peter Czernich of Marquis and Heavy Rubber fame. His concept which is now widely accepted as the standard is as follows:

&gt;The doll is totally enclosed in Latex Rubber with exaggerated female features. These are huge torpedo tits, very small waist, exaggerated hips and thighs and sexual organs. Bright lipstick, large eyelashes, and long nails are used to accentuate this female form. Usually
the doll wears a tight form fit hood with eye, mouth and nose openings. Sometimes a wig will be used and fetish footwear to set off what one would consider to be a naked Rubber Female doll.

&gt;In most cases this type of doll is a service submissive or slave and is used by others for their own entertainment.

arktic_P,fantasyfootball,1389268866.0,"I think Coby Fleener will drop a bit in production since Dwayne Allen will be back next year. Before Allen went down, the Colts were running their O through alot of 2-TE sets (like the Pats used to with Hernandez/Gronk), and the top 4 targets went Wayne/Hilton/Fleener/Allen. When Allen went down, they went to a base set with 3 WRs, (top 4 targets became Wayne/Hilton/Fleener/DHB), and then when Wayne went down it was Hilton/Fleener/DHB/random WR.

So over the course of the season, Fleener went from being the #3 target in an offense that still ran the ball a good bit since Bradshaw and Ballard were still healty, and ended up being the #2 target in a more passing oriented offense.

I'm not saying drop him out of the top 15, but I would put Pitta ahead of him, and maybe Bennett too."

Theory is great and entertaining for a bright guy like myself to enjoy but practice is where my life got fucked up and never got better. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get outside of the patterns of thinking/feeling that led me back to using even if when managed to quit for a time. If I stop for a month I've proven that I'm not an addict and can use again.

As for the depression I agree that this is a difficult situation for you. I'm still medicating my ADHD with stimulants and my anxiety disorder with a prescribed drug as well and don't think I could have stayed sober for 5 years without those. The combination of that medication (which wasn't enough to stay sober with prior to the 12 steps) and a truly earnest embracing of the 12 steps is what I need to stay clean. I know there are some who argue against any medication  in AA but my feeling is if I'm not using it to get high or escape but rather to help me accept and stay in reality it is a good thing. It also needs to be under supervision of a doctor. Like you I have abused otc drugs like cough medicine so I need to be under a Doctors care to take anything other than Advil and Sinus medication.

Perhaps a good place to start looking at it: Where does coping end and getting high begin? If depression is the justification for continued use then it would delineate use from abuse. In looking at your last two years where can you see patterns of abuse being rationalized by your history of depression? If, like me, you never risk feeling bad by staying high most of the time depression wouldn't seem to be the problem but the excuse. If you only use when depression is present, like taking aspirin when you have a head ache instead of out of fear of getting one, then maybe it is use instead of abuse. Just an idea."

My first love is CompSci, with it's cohesive theorems and... just that feeling of ""completeness"" that comes with theories that just 'click'. I know that I'm being extremely vague, but I don't know how to describe it. 

It's like learning graph theory. An algebraic quadratic equation is on the sheet which looks very complicated. Then it's differentiated. Hmm. That doesn't look too bad. The teacher tells you to plot both equations on the same graph sheet. And then that feeling of understanding just fills your brain with closure.

The first film we got of the offense they ran in the Sugar was after we'd already played the first half.

I agree and in many ways this corroborates my point; if his ex-wife had suddenly become more sexual she would just get a strapping 20 year old man to pump her, but she would have no hope of getting any sort of meaningful commitment from him (and she knows this) so it clearly isn't the case that she has become more sexual. Previously she was turned off her husband because she underestimated how much of a catch he was compared with her, she's totally tanked in the open dating market while he has done fairly well, so now she is giving him more of herself hoping to win him back.

&gt;Wife and I have no plans on getting back together so trying to ""lock me down"" doesn't add up. I am thinking she might have fucked another guy and that got her all sexual again?

He might have no plans to get back with her, but she sure does with him"

I agreed eagerly to that. We only talked about it for a long time. One day I said to him let's stop talking and just do it. So he introduced me to SLS. I hadn't known that voyeurism was really a step to swinging but it has led us into the lifestyle. The more we participate in events, the more we talk about what we want and what we aren't comfortable with right now. That list is ever changing as we grow more accustomed to the lifestyle.  As long as you are very openly communicating with each other (WHEN THINGS HAPPEN) what you are comfortable or uncomfortable with, then this way works out very well. 

What's nice about this approach to introducing someone to swinging is that you're not saying ""I want to have sex with someone else"", you're saying, ""What we have is so hot. Let's show it off!"" That made all the difference for me. Also, my SO has said to me that I am like his toy and he wants to show other people how amazing his toy is. This is a total turn on to me. "

Fahris,asktransgender,1389270758.0,"So, I took some time to examine your sources, and I want to pick at them for a bit. Most of them are too inclusive in some ways, and uninclusive in others. [edit: I'm working off a definition of transgender that includes people who identify differently from their assigned gender - not people who simply challenge gender stereotypes (ie, butch women).]

[scottishtrans.org](http://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trans-Umbrella.png)'s umbrella includes ""Cross-dressing people, transsexual women, transsexual men, non-binary gender people, and intersex people"".

There are two problems with this umbrella: crossdressers don't necessarily identify under the trans umbrella, and are cis. Because some crossdressers are cis, that automatically excludes them as a group from being trans. There's nothing stopping trans (or cis) people from crossdressing, but crossdressing isn't the thing that puts anyone under the trans umbrella.

Intersex people are also not necessarily under the trans umbrella. This is a similar argument to crossdressing: because not all intersex people gender dysphoria or identify with a gender other than the one assigned to them, intersex people as a group shouldn't be included in the trans umbrella. This is not to say that being intersex doesn't cause them problems similar to what trans people face, or that intersex people can't be trans (they can), but intersex people shouldn't automatically be assumed to be trans.

Your [second image](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DHqGp13VpV0/TUwbvj9Nk0I/AAAAAAAADdI/gHWBIXGzmmQ/s1600/Copy+of+transgender+umbrella.jpg) includes ""transsexual, crossdressers, performers, intersex, and gender benders/androgynes"" and has some of the same problems, and some new ones:

I've discussed some of the problems with [transsexual labels in another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1uq9d8/transgender_umbrella_label_are_all_the_sources/ceksq3z), but I'll concede that some people identify strongly with the label, and there's no doubt that it's under the umbrella. I've already discussed crossdressers, but the ""performers"" part of this diagram has issues.

In order for ""performers"" to be under the trans umbrella, they *all* have to be somehow nonconforming with their gender identity. The diagram admits that ""Some identify as Transgender. Most do not."" So, it excludes itself from the trans umbrella, because it doesn't meet the criteria *at the top of the image* as having a non-conforming gender identity.

Intersex people have already been discussed, but the image has the *additional* problem of implying that intersex conditions are obvious from birth, and that parents or doctors will choose a gender for their child rather than raising the child in a gender neutral way to allow them to discover their own gender identity. 

The last term, ""Gender Benders/Androgynes"", says that ""Masculine ""butch"" lesbians, effeminate ""queens"" men"" and so on fall under the transgender umbrella. This is untrue, as masculine women are no less cis than femme women, and would most likely strongly object to someone telling them that they have a non-conforming gender *identity*, when instead they've simply opted for a more masculine presentation (or vice versa, in the case of effeminate men).

This image also makes no effort to include the *wide* range of identities that fall under nonbinary identities, and is strictly binary in it's descriptions of it's labels. Garbage.

The third image, from [lgbtcentredg.co.uk](http://www.lgbtcentredg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/umbrella_img.gif) has some of the same problems as the other images:

Intersex people shouldn't be lumped in with transgender people, nor should ""cross-dressing &amp; transvestite people"" (it should also be noted that ""transvestite"" is a very dated term and considered offensive by many trans people as well as crossdressers). 

Androgyne shouldn't be included, as [androgyne](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aandrogyne) doesn't say anything about gender identity, only presentation. Inclusion of polygender people is fine, but should be expanded to include people under the genderqueer umbrella. Most likely *also* very dated.

The [fourth image](http://31.media.tumblr.com/28af9b3566a5738446b16c57ce5e59dd/tumblr_mx3a40uWuE1rfwfq9o1_1280.jpg) is even more garbage than the others. First, transgender does not ""encompass any individual who crosses over or challenges their society's traditional gender roles and/or expressions."" This definition focuses on gender presentation and roles, rather than gender identity. Transgender encompasses people whose gender identity differs from the identity assigned them by society, *not* someone who presents ""butch"" or ""effeminate"".

There's a bunch of terms there that flat out don't belong as well: drag kings/queens, ""intergender"" (I think they mean intersex), transvestite, masculine women"", ""androgynous persons"", ""feminine men"", crossdressers, and eunuchs. It also has some other problems with the ""okay"" terms, such as ""agendered"" (rather than agender - agendered implies that something happened to make someone agender). However, it does do an okay job of including the lesser used labels of two spirit, hijra, 3rd gender etc. The main failing here is the focus on presentation and over-inclusiveness.

The [fifth image](http://img.docstoccdn.com/thumb/orig/108909209.png) also suffers from overinclusiveness (drag king/queen, transvestite, crossdresser), although it also fails at terminology slightly - androgyne shouldn't be included, and instead merged into the genderqueer definition.

The [sixth image](http://www.illawarraqinfo.com/USERIMAGES/transgenderumbrella.gif] is the [second image](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DHqGp13VpV0/TUwbvj9Nk0I/AAAAAAAADdI/gHWBIXGzmmQ/s1600/Copy+of+transgender+umbrella.jpg) again with tinier text and terrible Paint art. 

The [seventh image](http://www.transviolencetracker.com/images/TransgenderUmbrella.jpg) has the same problems as above, except it also includes the ""pre/post/non-op"" terms, which don't really say anything about gender identity and objectify transition. Bleh.

Anyways. Be careful of assigning labels to groups that haven't adopted those labels for themselves. Because of this, the definition of ""transgender"" has progressed farther and farther from ""people who challenge social gendered norms with their presentation"" to ""people who don't identify with their birth gender.""

So, to answer the question, yeah, lots of sources are garbage. The best resource I've seen for separating some of the issues I talked about above is the [genderbread person](https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/922360_512377738825760_824300766_o.jpg). "

&gt;I don't know what to do..I don't think my mind can deal with losing her. I think..they would probably have to put me on suicide watch. She's all I have now.

Even though I don't doubt that this is how you feel, don't put that on a person you love. Ever. No one should have to deal with the burden of being solely responsible for another person's happiness. You can derive happiness from being loved, but a good chunk of it needs to be self-generated for a lasting and healthy relationship. 

One, it's exhausting and demoralizing for the other person to be solely responsible for your happiness. Because they love you, they will try and probably fail to make you happy. But doing so doesn't give them the space to work on that part that is self-generated for themselves, and as a result they will feel unhappy and unfulfilled. 

Second, believing that someone is ""all you have"" leaves you more vulnerable to be hurt by them. Since they are the source of your happiness, you put more weight on what they say, and it cuts deeper. Also, the fear of losing them leads to manipulative and eventually abusive behaviour. This might have been what led to your grabbing her. Don't go down that road. If you really want her to be happy, find things in your life aside from her to derive satisfaction from. Work on yourself and learn to love yourself. Tell her that you are trying to improve yourself for the sake of both of you. Get to the point where if you can see that you are making her unhappy, you will be able to let her go without her having to dealing with the guilt of haven taken *all* of your happiness away. I'm not saying that she will leave you, but ironically, the more self sufficient you are, the better she will be able to love you and you her."

Aelonius,worldnews,1389270902.0,"And there we stand on two opposing ends with a massive cliff in between our two sides. I am of opinion that the people in the EU have no influence on the policies made at the highest level, and that the current situation is really catered to keeping those in power, right where they are. I've got no problems with the values that the EU has, but I have a problem with the implementation. As a national in a sovereign nation, a nation who has fought against oppressive governments in the last few centuries, I do not want to see a federal state. I do not want to be told by a politician whom I have no influence on or no affiliation with on how I should be living my life and which restrictions should apply.

Sure, the EU does give a bunch of benefits and while they are great, I do believe that a quote would be neccesary to reflect how I see this kind of subject.
&gt; Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.* - Benjamin Franklin (Historical Review of Pennsylvania, 1759)*

I believe that by giving up our freedom as nation to an overarching government, we give up our ability to be the people who we desire to be or implement the rules we deem fit for our nation. Topics such as immigration are a hot one here, and I am a supporter of restricting access to the country for foreign nationals that are not here for tourism. I want to close the borders to people from Romania and Bulgaria, not because I do not like them, but because we've got plenty of people in need of work and we do not need any fortune seekers here unless we can't fill our vacancies with native people. I want to see that my country becomes a country to be proud of. To feel that we make a difference, rather than becoming a cogwheel in a giant machination. 

We can have free markets, we can have cooperation but we do not need to have a unified body that shifts towards a federal government such as the United States. You mention free movement of labour, which you find interesting. But I do not believe that this free movement is a great thing per sé. It encourages the outflow of intellectuals and skilled workers from the less fortunate countries, meaning they possibly face a massive problem with knowledge and actual skilled professionals in their own country. Own people first may sound harsh, but that's how I see it. The EU is becoming more and more socialist, and I do not like it that we're forced to pay for a pet project of a bunch of politicians. The way I see this progress is that the more we begin to integrate, the more we start to look alike to the US or the former USSR. While you some that's a wet dream come true, to me that's the absolute opposite of what I am standing for.

In other words, I believe that the EU is trying to pull off a 'Palpatine' in hoarding power untill it can't be returned (which pretty much is reached) after which they control what we as sovereign nations do.

You can't say crossdressers are trans, because not all crossdressers are trans. You're forcing labels onto people they don't fit, and they haven't chosen those labels for themselves.

&gt; 
&gt; If you do not specify a duration (e.g. until end of turn, until your next upkeep) for a certain effect, you must remind players that the effect will not end on its own. An example is Sleight of Mind.

This is useful, but not mandatory. See [Beguiller of Wills](http://magiccards.info/dka/en/28.html).

&gt; **Targets**

&gt; Since a spell or ability's targets are declared as it is put onto the stack, costs cannot contain targets. Furthermore, if a spell does not have the proper amount of targets, it is countered. 

&gt; For example, in order to cast Hex , there must be at least six creatures it could target. If any one of those targets is removed from the battlefield before it resolves, none of them are destroyed. If you do not wish for this to happen, you must use ""up to X target(s)"" in your wording.

This is wrong. A spell that targets is countered upon resolution only if *all* of its targets are illegal. As long as a targeted spell has at least *one* valid target, the spell resolves, trying to do as much as possible. See rule [608.2b](http://magiccards.info/rule/608-resolving-spells-and-abilities.html).

So in the case of Hex, you need six creatures to cast the spell, but if any becomes an illegal target, the rest is still destroyed. See the Gatherer rulings for Hex."

Ostrololo,custommagic,1389272110.0,"&gt; **Flipping A Coin** 

&gt; The proper wording for flipping a coin is: Flip a coin. If you win/lose the flip, do X. The game prefers to use ""win"" or ""lose"" over ""heads"" or ""tails"".

They do use ""heads"" and ""tails"" in certain circumstances. I will copy what I said in another thread:

&gt; They use heads and tails when you don't have one outcome that is strictly better than the other. So for example, for [Odds](http://magiccards.info/di/en/153a.html), countering the spell isn't necessarily better than copying it. But for [Stitch in Time](http://magiccards.info/query?q=stitch+in+time&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname), taking an extra turn is better than not, so they use ""if you win the flip""."

To be perfectly honest I'm not convinced that this level of cheating - with noticing the neighbor's new haircut at a 1/100 and carrying on multiple long term sexual relationships concurrently outside the marriage at about a 99/100, is Clint it at about 15 - is necessarily worth ruining people's lives over.

Cheating is not cheating. There's grades of it. This dude feels terrible and it's not even like he had sex or anything. Sure it was on his wedding day and that's fucked up but weddings can be crazy times. Emotions run very high. 

Having someone that you share chemistry and history take advantage of you in a moment of confusion and drunken bad decisions is a totally different thing to the groom texting his mistress during the reception or actively ttrying to sexually assault the bride's cousin."

This is why Kishimoto is really bad with retconning. He keeps using the same cast and giving them multiple roles because he doesn't want to create new characters without a purpose. So giving Genma and Ridou a history was to plotlink™ the 4th's flying thunder god technique.

&gt; **Weather conditions upside down: Even polar bears taken to warm up in United States**

&gt; *Tuesday, January 7, 2014*

&gt; [Caption: *In parts of the United States it's currently too cold even for polar bears.*]

&gt; According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, it is currently warmer in Tampere, Finland than in Tallahassee, the capital of the state of Florida.

&gt; Even more astounding is the fact that the whole of Finland is now warmer than Atlanta, located slightly above Florida in Georgia.

&gt; The monstrously freezing temperatures have caused for instance that the polar bear Anana, who is used to Arctic conditions, has not been allowed outside in a Chicago zoo.

&gt; On Monday, Chicago experienced a record-breaking temperature of 27 degrees below zero.

&gt; – In nature the polar bear would be eating seals in this kind of weather in order to generate a warming layer of fat, explains Sharon Dewar, PR Director of Lincoln Park Zoo on CNN.

&gt; Around the same latitude in Pittsburgh, bald eagles and African penguins have been left indoors even though they are used to extreme temperatures in nature.

&gt; The monster winter has likewise affected people's lives. On Monday, Minnesota governor Mark Dayton ordered all 2,000 public schools in the state to close for the first time since 1997. Many schools have remained closed even today.

&gt; Minnesotan schoolchildren have seized the opportunity to have extra fun despite the harsh weather.

&gt; – I've been out of school for only four days in my life. This day and tomorrow are two of them, Graham Myers told CNN on Monday on the way to a cinema."

No one ""owes"" you the right to safety. As a society we've decided that safety is important and so try to mitigate the occurrence of violence. The vast majority of them hinge on stigmatizing the act of committing a crime. We're basically asking everyone to not hurt each other because asking is pretty much the extent to which we can control the actions of others. Nevertheless crime still happens and everyone is aware of it. Knowing that people break the social contract, that there is very little we can do from preventing them from doing so, and then going out in the world with your super duper optimism pants on and not taking precautions because people ""should"" do the right thing is just naive.

danhakimi,AskComputerScience,1389273342.0,"Computer Science is a field of mathematics. It is not the same thing as programming. Programming is what you think it is -- writing code for computers. Computer science is more than that -- it's a field of math, but a different kind of math than you might think.

You don't really need to know much math to program (although most tutorials will start to teach you programming with algebra). But programming might be easier for people who are good at math. Try teaching yourself online through something like Codeacademy.org. It might ""spoil"" you (in that the code on those websites is much easier to play with than the hard languages that any good CS department makes sure you know), but it will give you a nice, simple, slow introduction to programming that will let you figure out whether it's the type of thing you want to delve further into.

But to be a Computer Scientist, you need to learn math past Algebra 2/Calculus, because that's what Computer Science is. But it's a different kind of math. A lot of it is what we call discreet math, for the most part -- math dealing with individual units of things, like counting (harder than it sounds), number systems, and things like that. And then there's some abstract math under it (computability theory, complexity theory, and things like that that only make sense once you've started studying computer science). The foundations of computer science are rooted in philosophy of math, logic, and epistemology. You'll never have to multiply numbers in your head, or perform a sin function, or do anything like that, but you'll need to deal with things that are complex in their own ways, which still count as math. And I'm not sure those things are going to be as hard for you... It's hard to say.

There's not much reading involved in CS, but that doesn't mean it's easy. I don't really know many online resources that teach it, "

1. Leave the key in the ignition for a few minutes. I believe it has an internal warmer designed to help with cold starts.  
2. Twist the throttle once, quickly and completely, before attempting to start. Give it some gas to get it going.

&gt; * do you think Christie was personally involved in ordering the lane closures?  
  
Probably not, but his staff didn't hesitate before engaging in petty, vindictive, political retribution.  That speaks volumes about the leader.  

&gt; * if he's not personally involved, then what's w/ all the blackout redactions on the texts + emails?  

Sounds like conspiracy theory nonsense.  

&gt; * do you think this has any practical effect on his chances for 2016?  

I can't stand Christie.  He's a RINO.  A North-Eastern liberal who supports liberal policies and engages in liberal tactics.  
  
I think this issue will hurt him.  His tough talk act has always left him open to attacks that he's a childish bully.  Take this story and a couple more lesser ones similar to it and you have a powerful narrative.  Conservatives already can't stand his policies and Independents aren't going to vote for someone painted as a partisan bully.  He'll get the RINO establishment vote and that's it.  It sounds like there might be some competition for that faction this time around too (Scott Brown, maybe others).

[This post](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kx90x/this_one_is_for_the_guys_of_reddit/) is full of red flags about how she views herself and really helps exemplify the self esteem issues I was talking about.

Weird stuff, bro.

**Edit:**

Yeah he has long hair and when we shop in stores together workers refer to us as ""ladies"". None of that matters to me.

mysanityisrelative,SubredditDrama,1389273822.0,"JW's and Mormons aren't considered Christians by many sects because they reject the Nicene Creed which entails belief in:

* **One God**, Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth and all things Visible and Invisible
* In Jesus Christ his **only son begotten of the Father before all ages God from God, light from light, True God from True God, begotten not made one in being with the Father**
* Who for us men, and for our salvation, was born of the Holy Spirit by the Virgin Mary and became Man. 
* He suffered under Pontius Pilot, was crucified, died and was buried and on the Third Day, He rose again in fulfillment of the scripture. He ascended into Heaven and is Seated at the Right Hand of the Father.
* **From thence He shall come in Glory to judge the living and the dead and his Kingdom shall have no end.**
* The Holy Spirit, the Lord the Giver of Life, **who proceeds from the Father and the Son**, who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets.
* One holy catholic and apostolic church.
* One baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
* The resurrection of the body.
* Life in the world to come.

I've tried to bold the major points of contention. The biggest are that they believe that they reject the Trinity (i.e. that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one God in three Forms) ~~and that Jesus is the *only* Son of the Father (they also claim that Joseph Smith was a Son)~~*(Edit, apparently this part is incorrect. Apologies)*

These may seem like small, silly differences but it really is a fundamental difference which many consider heretical (not a word to be used lightly)."

alive1,Borderlands,1389273942.0,"I got my copy of BL2 pretty close to the release date, and it took me one year and a month to finish the storyline on Normal.

When people on here are talking about raiding bosses over and over again to get that one special item, I wonder how they can even handle so much entertainment. I don't quite know if there's a word for it but to put it awkwardly: I feel that BL2 gives me so much of a dopamine release that I get nauseous after a short while of playing it, and have to stop and take a break.

BritishyAccent,AmericanHorrorStory,1389274387.0,"I think that you can make an argument for any one of the witches being the next supreme.  
Up until the latest episode you could argue the same thing for Nan, she had very few moments of strength or power. Who is to say that this won't happen for Cordelia?  
Furthermore, I think that Cordelia's blindness kinda contradicts the idea that Supreme's have perfect health.  
The ambiguity of who the Supreme is fuels the plot and tensions within the coven. I like your red herring idea but on balance I think that it is useless to hypothesise over who is the next supreme. In itself, the idea of a supreme is a red herring for the coven, as they focus on power struggles and social hierarchy rather than the outside danger of voodoo/ witch hunters.  
Because it creates so much drama, the identity of the supreme is sure to be a twist, I wouldn't be surprised if it was Cordelia but I am not convinced that it will be her over any other witch. "

This woman made a decision. It wasn't a bad one; it was just a decision. It may be one she now regrets, but that's fine. It was her decision to make. 

Expecting celibacy from an ex is unrealistic. It's how some people attempt to move on. She had sex with one dude, once. It's not like she fucked the whole block and OP is concerned about her being promiscuous. He's upset she didn't sit there with her legs closed waiting for him.

3454355,AskMen,1389274597.0,"Poor fuckers. This is a tough enough watch already but then they turn the camera around and you realise the film maker is an absolutely gorgeous young woman. This stuff must be embarrassing enough to talk about anyway without having to talk about it to a young woman who is beautiful, successful (made a film), and funny (refusing to say anything about the shoes was hilarious).

It does however illustrate what complete tossers the two non Michael characters are. Being a massive misogynist is bad enough, saying massively misogynistic things to camera is a deal worse, but saying them directly to a woman's face suggests a casual comfort with their own misogyny which is frankly terrifying. So fuck em, they deserve to die alone.

I wonder if they tried it on with the filmmaker and if she took the opportunity to tell them what I was screaming at them throughout the film, ""the problem isn't that you are ugly, and indeed you are not ugly, the problem is that you are terrible people and you clearly despise women. Chicks don't dig it when you obviously loathe their gender"".

creamofporkpiesoup,standupshots,1389274825.0,"I like to call it ""gentleman's thrush"". I wish I'd thought of that when I first went to my GP, but I was flustered because it was the same doctor who'd given me a prostate exam (the time when I discovered that I could totally *not* take a cock, even though I'd always thought in prison, for sure), so I just said I thought it was a 'urinary tract infection'.

He prescribed me some antibiotics, which may or may not have been able to get rid of it, but I was too embarrassed to go back when it didn't go away, as I always feel if I've not got better then it's my fault (this time I had been drinking on the medication though, but it had been cosmopolitans and I thought they were supposed to help)

Instead I went to the sexual health clinic at the hospital where I was working at the time, on an evening when they were open late. I'd been peeing like crazy, so I thought I'd go just before I went up, then drink a load of water in the waiting room. I sat down (because sue me, it was a long day) and saw a damp patch on my boxers. “Is that… piss?” I thought, but a sniff test was inconclusive (may have been Dishonourable Discharge). Anyway, it turns out they ask you not to pass water for two hours before a test, as it can wash away any shameful buildup.

Apparently, now there are cotton swabs they can put down the eye of your old chap, but not in this clinic; there was a little plastic wand with a hoop on the end, like for blowing bubbles. The nurse asked me a mental arithmetic question to distract me while she put it into me. It was a confusing sensation (genital invasion, not mental arithmetic), and it took me a while to understand what it was (it was pain). She held the bubble-wand against a glass slide, said 'hmm' and then put it in again. Pain again, but still a novelty.

I gave my urine sample (which took *ages*, because I'd ticked 'my penis itches' and barely waited at all in the waiting room), but was told I’d have to come back again after not urinating overnight. Now, I pee in the shower almost by reflex in the morning (no judging, guys; I always make sure to swoosh it down the plug with my foot), so was now looking at adding an accident on the train to my embarrassments.

I didn’t drink anything from that point on, and the next morning slunk off to do some ‘photocopying’ in the morning. This time, I knew I was there for nothing but to have something go through my penis the wrong way, without even a little scrotal coddle (even though I don’t need it; I’ve had a go on a practice bollock and know what a lump feels like) and was understandably tense. Morning nurse didn’t have the same technique as evening nurse: “I’m going to put this in your winky now” (and then immediately put it down my winky). I’m not ashamed to say I screamed.

I had to sneak back up again an hour later to get the results (it was about the time I’d normally sneak off for a secret poo anyway, so I knew I’d get away with it). “Non-specific urethritis” was all they could diagnose me with until the lab got back in a fortnight to say if it was or wasn’t Chlamydia, but they gave me some pills all the same. The Sexual Health Professional offered me some condoms, and I’ve got loads, but it’s poor form to turn them down when you’ve been prescribed treatment in a sexual health clinic.

So down I went, back to work, and I expected that my colleagues, working in a hospital as they did, were fully aware of the significance of the Purple Paper Bag of Shame, so I slipped it into my pocket, but it still stuck out over the edge. Obviously a colleague had to ask me to do something just as I was halfway in the door of the men’s locker room with my right hand conspicuously in my pocket, and obviously the girl who I’d been seeing who also worked there later said “I think I’ll just go to my GP surgery” so now the hospital clinic probably think I didn’t tell her and am a complete cad.

Well, that was long. Anyway, I don’t work there anymore, and if making an appointment to see your GP with such a complaint, you should just come out and say “I’m pretty sure it’s gentleman’s thrush” and act like the receptionist isn’t very worldly for reacting with confusion."

4. It really is too heavy
5. It's not a self oxidizing self protecting material. Al and Ti form oxide layers over themselves naturally which prevent further corrosion. Stainless steel is protected this way by a thin layer of chromium - but if you scratch that layer, stainless steel can start rusting at those scratch sites, whereas in Al or TI the scratch would oxidize and reform a new protective layer.

We like the same music so there is never any arguing about that, we generally like most of the same shows, we like musicals (never thought I'd find a guy who doesn't say musicals are ""gay"") and we like playing video games together. We still have a healthy sex life even though it's tapered off a lot after having a kid.

kaiouap,runescape,1389275254.0,"Me and the friend I started playing with, were trying to understand how combat xp worked.

Attack/defence/strength were quite straightforward.
HP not so much, because of the hidden decimals of xp, and we were killing cows and goblin, decimals were important!

We decided, after many experiments, that it was based on how much you _got hit_. That makes sense, it is like the saiyan, you are hitten and you heal, so you get stronger.

Then we grow of level, and being hitten was harder, we started using lower and lower armour because of that.

I am not sure when we exaclty realize we were doing something really silly :-)

Also, the Sixth Floor (the JFK assassination museum) is worth checking out, as is the Old Red museum, which covers Dallas history. Also, consider the Dallas Heritage Village, which has many pioneer-era buildings from the history of Texas.

Otherwise, the weather has been covered. We don't get snow often. But Dallas's unique position gives us a lot of ice instead. The city will shut down and you will rightfully laugh at us. But be prepared that you will get a day off of work with an inch of ice or snow. More than that and the city will be shut down for days.

If you have a car you were planning on bringing, if it doesn't have air conditioning, sell it before you get here. A car without A/C is worthless down here and instead buy a new one with it down here.

WinterCharm,apple,1389275420.0,"So I did some follow up - and Alienware laptops apparently use a soft touch plastic. 

It's really a rubberized plastic. More specifically, Thermoplastic vulcanosate elastomer. (TPEs) are one of the fastest growing polymeric materials which combine the elastic and mechanical properties of cross- linked rubbers with the melt processability of thermoplastics.
There is surprisingly little out there on them. Mostly research papers. There isn't even a wikipedia page. o_O
My guess is many of the intricacies in processing them, along with some of their properties are IP, and not available to the public.
In less scientific terms, it's a fusion of plastic, and rubber (so a combined polymer melt) which is soft to the touch, yet rigid. Still has some of the issues that plastics would have, but it's at least very nice to the touch :) - a premium feel with the usual advantages of the ease of manufacturing a plastic. Because it's rubberized it may also be less prone to cracking, but that would depend on the full chemistry.

The nexus 5/nexus 7 are also backed with TPE. 

So are many of the soft touch rigid cases. - but the knockoff cases are plastic *coated* in rubber - which feels the same, but is gross when it starts to peel :)"

BritishyAccent,AmericanHorrorStory,1389275488.0,"Well, I think outside of the Mouse Maze being used for witchcraft it had a few symbolic meanings. Primarily, the mouse represents the Rat Race and by extension a questioning of the American Dream.  
Notice how the white corridors of the office were juxtaposed with the white maze? A worker trapped within a corporate environment, chasing a monetary reward can be seen as similar to the mouse in the maze, chasing a piece of cheese.  
The sinister end of the mouse's life indicates a scary end for corporate workers also. A sense of futility in chasing a reward.  
As /u/d3loots mentioned, Hecate is an ancient goddess of prosperity. On face value it seems like Fiona possesses the rat with the financial health of Hank's business and traps it, confusing it within a bureacratic maze. The FBI comes in with a search and seizure which no doubt would take months to deal with and greatly damage the stocks of Hank's company.  
The only part of the scene that I was not sure about was the, almost severed connection between Fiona and Hecate when the mousetrap fell. I was confused because before the mousetrap snaps shut as Hank says something along the lines of ""Get in touch with our friends"".  
It seems that there is both more to Hank's company and more to the outside threats to the coven. The issue of supremacy is not such a large point of tension as you the power of outside threats are merely hinted at."

M4ttz8,summonerschool,1389275657.0,"A lot of people use the delivery system technique, which is essentially putting your ball on a teammate and ulting when he dives the back line. For example: let's say you have a J4 jungle. Shield him with your E and when he EQ combos to the back line, use your ult. Since your E has a much larger range than your Q, you put yourself in much less danger and it combines your damage with your teammates. However, MAKE SURE you stay in range of your E, otherwise your ball will return back to you and you will whiff your ult.

Now sometimes you won't always have someone as simple as J4 to do this with. There are plenty of people that this works on, however: Malphite, Jayce, Olaf, basically anyone that is supposed to go for the back line in a quick manner. It requires a lot of teammate synergy, but if you can pull it off you get a great ult on their back line without putting yourself in danger (i.e. mission accomplished).

Try it in a few normal games to get the hang of it, and feel free to ask your teammates if they can play champions that you can use as your own personal delivery system of devastation. "

PieceofthePuzzle,AskReddit,1389275728.0,"Just yesterday, my boss let me go via text. His reason was that his girlfriend had lost her job, so is taking mine. The fact that his girlfriend is childless, lives with him, and unqualified, and I have an eight year old, a mortgage, and ten years of experience apparently was not a concern for him.

Edit: You guys are awesome. Thank you for your anger on my behalf. Internet hugs for all of you!

Edit Two: I've been getting a lot of comments about how my child and mortgage should have no bearing on his decision to employ me. I never said it should, but the fact that his girlfriend has no expenses, and therefore no need for my job, just makes me even more butthurt about this. I do realize that it may have come across as entitled, though. I didn't mean to sound that way, I'm just furious and worried about how I'm going to take care f my family."

Gertiel,NoStupidQuestions,1389275750.0,"I actually happen to know someone who lives a cash only life. He receives his pay in cash, so sees no reason to use banks. He has managed to purchase cars, and even multiple houses. He just pays cash in full for them. He was really angry the first time he bought a house because they made him purchase a cashier's check and charged him a fee for the purchase. Since then, he always goes through a certain closing company which accepts cash. The first couple of houses he bought through them, they wouldn't give him the keys until they'd checked over the cash. They said it took them four of those special pens to check all the bills the first time. In case you are wondering about all this house buying, he buys houses that are distressed and fixes them up. He rents them or sometimes allows people to rent-to-own. He only takes cash payments from his tenants.

Edit to add: I should mention I live in an area where housing prices are exceptionally low. You can buy a really nice three bedroom house with a two car garage for as little as $75,000 around here easily. I don't know what he's paid for all the houses he's bought, but I know it was really low. He got the most recent house for &lt;$25,000 and says he will spend $30,000 in supplies to get it up to snuff for tenants. He does all the work himself, so I'm guessing the work on that house will be quite extensive."

miyakohouou,asktransgender,1389276124.0,"Actually, the AMA and most insurance companies DO consider SRS and FFS as medically necessary surgeries (at least in some cases).

My insurance company expressly does recognize SRS as medically necessary, they just don't cover it because as far as I can tell, ""fuck you, that's why"".  Actuarilly speaking there isn't a huge reason not to cover it, paying out of pocket SRS is cheaper than the cost of a friends appendectomy, and we're relatively rare.

In an ideal world, yes. But if you follow that logic then why arm police officers at all? I also think it's an easy thing to say when you're *not* the one grappling with an armed person in the midst of a psychotic episode.

I don't know whether the police acted reasonably or not, I just think that it's best to reserve judgement until both sides have had a chance to have their say. TYT segment is based only on evidence provided by the family of the deceased - which is a potentially pretty biased source. The top rated comment so far literally says the police murdered him. There is simply not enough evidence available to us yet to make that statement.

If they need to be in a certain position or need to be doing something according to ""the plan"" then tell them, don't ask.
If you need to be doing something according to ""the plan"", just do it and use strong and slow motions, push and pull steadily.
  
If your partner has expressed a desire to be dominated, you can decide to include them in the process (make them aware of the exercise), if you feel they would be (very) ok with it, than don't tell them, or tell them afterwards.
  
If you have a desire to be dominant though, you NEED to ask.
Whether or not you include them; don't tell them ""the plan"", that's for you to know and them to find out (there needs to be trust, or it won't work). Regardless you should set clear boundaries and have a save word and/or gesture. Remember: you are BOTH there to have fun.

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1389276338.0,"[I've actually discussed this question before!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ptgto/how_did_the_roman_republicempire_contend_with/cd5zlkt) :D I'll go ahead and steal some of the stuff I wrote down there and put it here, while adding in a bit more context for you.

Funniest thing about elephants in antiquity - they were seen as *the* shock troop by those who used them (Lookin' at you, Carthage and the East). They were like monsters out of legend, and they were *terrifying* when charging. However, elephants were similar to a hand grenade without a pin - you never knew what would set them off, or even if they would hurt you more than they hurt your enemies. Again - Carthage is one of the greatest examples of an over-reliance on elephant warfare...and when facing off against the Romans, they never were able to use them to their full potential. Hannibal Barca is famous for bringing his elephants across the treacherous passes of the Alps - and yet, the only time they were extraordinarily useful was *in* the Alps, when the tribesmen, confronted with this monstrous creature, were scared off by them. Without that boon, Hannibal might not have made it. 

However, we're discussing methods that the Romans used against elephants! So here goes nothing :D The first time that the Romans encountered war elephants was when fighting Pyrrhus of Epirus in Magna Graecia (Southern Italy). Pyrrhus is famed for his ""Pyrrhic Victories"" against the Romans (He won his first few battles, but with *extremely* heavy losses), and the first of these was accomplished with elephants. From [Plutarch!](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html) 

&gt; At last, when the Romans were more than ever crowded back by the elephants, and their horses, before they got near the animals, were terrified and ran away with their riders, Pyrrhus brought his Thessalian cavalry upon them while they were in confusion and routed them with great slaughter. 

Needless to say, the Romans were perturbed by this loss. They hadn't ever faced elephants before, and those things are TERRIFYING if they're charging you down. So they had to come up with a solution. And they were a bit freaked out by how many men they'd lost - in fact, there were a whole bunch of Romans who advocated quitting the war! But then, an ancient man named Appius Claudius, who was EXTREMELY distinguished in his day, heard that Rome was about to concede. And he got PISSED. He had himself carried to the Senate (he was blind), and gave a speech, chastising the Senate as a whole, telling them that Pyrrhus was merely ""The servant of one of Alexander's bodyguards,"" and that they were pathetic for cowering before him. 

Needless to say, Rome changed their mind about the whole peace thing. They sent back the message that, so long as Pyrrhus ""was there in arms, they would fight him with all their might, even though he should rout in battle ten thousand men like Laevinus. [the consul]""

The Romans then sent an emissary to discuss the matter of the Roman prisoners that had been taken, and it was headed by a man named Caius Fabricius, who was really poor. So Pyrrhus, trying to get a good deal out of him (and probably trying to get an in with regards to Roman politics) offered him a bunch of gold, which he rejected immediately. So then....

&gt; [...] on the following day, however, wishing to frighten a man who had not yet seen an elephant, he ordered the largest of these animals to be stationed behind a hanging in front of which they stood conversing together. This was done; and at a given signal the hanging was drawn aside, and the animal raised his trunk, held it over the head of Fabricius, and emitted a harsh and frightful cry. But Fabricius calmly turned and said with a smile to Pyrrhus: ""Your gold made no impression on me yesterday, neither does your beast to‑day.""

I had to tell that story. But anyways! So Pyrrhus had to fight another battle at Asculum against the Romans. The Romans had learned from their previous encounter that the elephants needed to be dealt with. Pyrrhus had apparently lost one, so he was at 19 of them - but that's still 19 elephants! And Rome was TOTALLY ready this time. Dionysius of Hallicarnassus gives a WONDERFUL description of them!

**Dealing with Elephants: Attempt #1**

&gt; Outside the line they stationed the light-armed troops and the waggons, three hundred in number, which they had got ready for the battle against the elephants. These waggons had upright beams on which were mounted movable traverse poles that could be swung round as quick as thought in any direction one might wish, and on the ends of the poles there were either tridents or swordlike spikes or scythes all of iron; or again they had cranes that hurled down heavy grappling-irons. Many of the poles had attached to them and projecting in front of the waggons fire-bearing grapnels wrapped in tow that had been liberally daubed with pitch, which men standing on the waggons were to set afire as soon as they came near the elephants and then rain blows with them upon the trunks and faces of the beasts. Furthermore, standing on the waggons, which were four-wheeled, were many also of the light-armed troops — bowmen, hurlers of stones and slingers who threw iron caltrops; and on the ground beside the waggons there were still more men. 

So, how did these wondrous ancient tank/APC/battlewagon things fare against the elephant?

&gt; When the king had ordered the elephants seem to be led up to the part of the line that was in difficulties, the Romans mounted on the pole-bearing waggons, upon learning of the approach of the beasts, drove to meet them. At first they checked the onrush of the beasts, smiting them with their engines and turning the fire-bearing grapnels into their eyes. Then, when the men stationed in their towers no longer drove the beasts forward, but hurled their spears down from above, and the light-armed troops cut through the wattled screens surrounding the waggons and hamstrung the oxen, the men at the machines, leaping down from their cars, fled for refuge to the nearest infantry and caused great confusion among them.

So, those worked well. Ish. Other than the fact that the Romans needed men with the wagons to fight the men with the elephants. Supporting the elephants? What a NOVEL idea!

**Dealing with Elephants: Attempt #2**

Later on in the Pyrrhic Wars, the Romans learned a few things:

* Elephants don't like fire

* Elephants don't like pain

* Elephants don't like noise

So Roman strategies from here on generally included two of the above. Next time they fought Pyrrhus' elephants was at Beneventum - where the Romans defeated the Epirotes by shooting their elephants full of flaming arrows, causing them to panic, stampeding through the ranks of the Epirotes. 

**Dealing with Elephants: Part 3**

The most famous incident of anti-elephant warfare was in the showdown between Hannibal Barca and Publius Cornelius Scipio (Later Africanus). Hannibal had vast numbers of decently strong, but inexperienced troops - and his best cavalry (the Numidians) had gone over to the Romans. He also had 80 elephants. So! Starting off, the Romans began with **noise** - the cavalry blew their warhorns all at the same time, causing a good number of the elephants to panic, stampeding through the Carthaginian lines. Next thing Scipio did was something that was *very* difficult for Romans of this time to do. Let me add some context here. 

The manipular army of the Punic Wars was probably the greatest ""levy/citizen/militia"" army in history. It was more flexible than the phalanx, and way more useful than most of the other formations in use during this period. However, it wasn't perfect - mostly because of that whole ""militia"" aspect. Men were untrained and unused to working together, for the most part - and that meant that the Romans were limited in tactical flexibility with what their men could respond to. 

Enter Scipio. He'd just come off of a strong campaign in Spain, and he'd had *years* in command of these men, who he'd trained hard, forging them into a unit, rather than just a consular army. THen, for his invasion of Africa, he pulled the same thing - except he added some invaluable men to his army. He added the survivors of Cannae, veterans who had seen the worst come to life. And they also had a vendetta against Hannibal - they'd been *exiled* for losing to him. 

So, all of these well-trained veterans were *super* well-coordinated - most especially the most notoriously flighty Roman troops, the *velites*, or the light skirmisher infantry. So what Scipio did at Zama was he had his heavy infantry form channels - and filled the channels with these *velites*. When the elephants charged, the *velites* would chuck their javelins at them and retreat, goading them to charge straight through the channels. At the rear of the army, Scipio had units specially trained to fight elephants - and the elephants were dispatched, with more damage done to Hannibal's army than his own. 

Funnily enough, the Romans adopted elephants to their own use, with moderate results. There are also reports of flaming pigs being used against elephants, but I don't have any sources to confirm this one ;)

It's like they put some safety on your character so you can't start trouble while in ports and on land?

~~Boat~~ Ship sailing definitely gives you a great feeling of Piracy. Between your crew singing shanties and having to dodge rogue waves during storms, you really start getting a sense of something neat.

I haven't beaten the game yet so I can't say for sure, but when you are outside of the animus it's a pretty boring and weird first person story thing. I haven't enjoyed it and I pretty much just go back straight into the animus when I can.

jackzander,seduction,1389276649.0,"Sometimes we *want* things from girls. If a girl is attractive enough to us, we get so overwhelmed by the desire to touch and smell and bring them closer that it *can* feel awkward. Because we've created in our minds a one-sided, parasitic relationship, where we crave to take and consume and use with no thought to what we offer in return.
Our subconscious makes this feel awkward because that *would be awkward*, rightfully so.

In reality, though, touching a girl who likes you is **symbiotic**. You're giving her something that makes her blood run warmer, something that makes her feel accepted as a person and desired as a creature.
And as a species, girls obsess. It doesn't matter how you touch a girl for the first time, it'll sit like a fog in her head and pick away at her attention throughout the day. They love this shit.
We love this shit.

So understand what touching a girl means. If you're thinking of touch as a Seduction Escalation Mechanism, then you're going to feel like an awkward freeloader.
Embrace the *value* of giving touch, and your whole perspective will change.

""Michael Bay is a good filmmaker"" is a matter of personal taste.

""somewhere there must be someone who never ever lies"" is a belief about whether something exists.

beefcakez,naturalbodybuilding,1389276933.0,"In my opinion, your weight is only as relevant to your physique as determining your competition weight class. 

I've seen amazing physiques, balanced, symmetrical, etc. from guys who are sub 150 lbs, and I've also seen guys who weight 180+ lbs (lean, mind you) that look like complete junk. 

Everyone's body composition is different, and there genetic capabilities are different.

However, if you really want a stage weight range, you may look into the chart the legend Steve Reeves put together (for naturals). 

5'5"" 160lbs

5'6"" 165lbs

5'7"" 170lbs

5'8"" 175lbs

5'9"" 180lbs

5'10"" 185lbs

5'11"" 190lbs

6'0"" 200lbs

6'1"" 210lbs

6'2"" 220lbs

6'3"" 230lbs

6'4"" 240lbs

6'5"" 250lbs

I think this is a good one, as I've found it to be fairly true in my experience. However, that's with a disclaimer because I was blessed with some fairly good bodybuilding genetics. i.e. (fairly) narrow hip bones and wide clavicles. Some others not blessed with these proportions won't look nearly as aesthetically pleasing at the same height/weight, etc. (guys with wide hip bones and narrow shoulders). 

[Here I am in 2010 at a stage weight of 155 lbs @ 5' 7''](http://i.imgur.com/1p4PgeL.jpg) 

[Here I am in 2011 at a stage weight of 155 lbs @ 5' 7''](http://i.imgur.com/ZwJu7Y1.jpg) (Had a bad contest prep and actually *lost* muscle!) 

[Me in 2013 at a stage weight of 165 lbs @ 5'7''](http://i.imgur.com/OX1Nr0f.jpg?1) 

I can tell you now that I could have been much leaner in 2013 (peak week screwup and poor prep), but more so tell you that even though I'm close to the weight range Mr. Reeves established, I feel as though I need an additional 15 lbs of lean mass, mostly in my upper body, to be truly competitive. 

I hope that helps answer your question, /u/imnumber4.

QuimLiquor,AskReddit,1389277151.0,"One night at work (sex shop) me and the other employee at the time came in one night during a blizzard. It wasn't really bad when we came in, at around 4:00, but by 8:00 the streets were a fucking ghost-town. Our last customer was at 5:30. So I call up the district manager and was like ""Nobody is here. Nobody is *coming* here. The roads aren't safe. What we sell isn't bread. Isn't rock salt. Isn't shovels. Nothing we sell is essential. Can we shut down the store and go home?""

""No. What if somebody wants to come in later on?""

""So, we're stuck here open during a blizzard (at this point it was up to about 12 inches or so) in case you might make that one sale later on?""

""Yep."" (hangs up..)

We ended up having to stay there until closing (which was 2 in the AM) and on the ride home, about a block and half away, my car hit a patch of ice causing it to do a 360 in the middle of the road stopping about an inch-and-a-half away from a what-looked-like-6-ft pile of snow and ice. The only thing that saved me was, being that it was 2 AM and the middle of a blizzard, there were no other cars on the road.

The next day I come in, fucking livid.

""Nobody else came in, for the rest of the night. The store made no money and you put our safety at risk for nothing. What would you have done if another car was on the road or I had hit the pile of snow head on?""

He can give you as many excuses as he likes, it boils down to - he doesn't care about locking the door.  In his eyes, locking the door doesn't even register.  Even though you've made it clear to him that this is important to you, he just doesn't care about the door.  

If you get robbed and the door was unlocked, you are shit out of luck.  The insurance will not pay out, they'll say you failed to hold up your end of the insurance contract when you failed to lock your door. 

There are a few ways to approach this.  Sit him down and spell it out.  ""Babe, when you fail to lock the door, it makes me feel like my safety is of no interest to you.  I've told you over and over that this is a big deal to me, and yet I still consistently find the door unlocked.  What can we do about this?""  If he says he'll put a sign up - ""Great - when?""  You need timescales and firm commitments.  Not ""I'll try"", actual measurable efforts.  Maybe implement a fine system - something he has to do every time the door is unlocked.  Take you to dinner, or put $5 in a jar.

The other option is that things start to disappear whenever the door is unlocked..."

I think most people believe in the golden rule, but if their moral expectations don't line up with your own then it's unlikely your notion of acceptable behavior will be congruent.

I think our dissonance here comes down to how view societal participation. From what I can tell (and correct me if this is wrong) you view it as something you have to opt out (or be removed) from; your participation and therefore acquiesce to society's morals is implicit simply by existing in the society. I believe it's something people have to actively opt in to. There are many groups (as well as individuals) that just don't see eye to eye with the rest of society. Despite polygamy being illegal it's still practiced in some parts of the country., for example. No matter how many times you tell a Mormon that it's ""wrong,"" they likely won't cede because their moral base is different from your own. Society can certainly remove you if you choose to participate and break the rules, but I don't believe the notion that everyone is inherently a part of society is correct.

The larger point I was trying to make was that we're to some extent responsible for everything that happens to us. If you're raped, there are most certainly decisions you could've made to not end up in that situation. Is it your fault if you put yourself there are get raped? Absolutely not. But at the same time we have to acknowledge the agency everyone possesses.

 Is it problematic if we focus more on that than the person being raped? Certainly. Is it victim blaming to say that people shouldn't be dumbasses and walk naked in dark alleys in bad parts of town drunk as hell making suggestive comments to people? Certainly not."

sturdyliver,Catholicism,1389277338.0,"I edited above to note that I can't find a canon law reference on my statement. This is commonly accepted at the Eastern Catholic parish that I attend, but maybe it's not how membership is canonically defined.

1. You can receive your sacraments in any rite, but for one-time sacraments (baptism, confirmation, holy orders, matrimony), you may need permission first for them to be licit. I know that I have a Latin rite friend who married a non-Christian in the Maronite rite so it's definitely possible.
2. It sounds like it would be valid, but I don't know if it would be licit. If it wasn't licit then it should have been caught by the parish.

The people in charge of sacramental prep at a parish usually know the answers to these kinds of questions, so I would definitely recommend asking them. I am a confirmation sponsor at a Latin rite parish, and they initially mistook me for Eastern Catholic and had some paperwork prepared for me!"

I hate these companies with a passion and I promote the alternative companies any time I can. Helping people minimize the amount of money that goes to these corporations is a passion of mine. 

But that's only one arm of it. Retail ISP/home phone/cable tv is only a portion of their business. Rogers for example competes for corporate clients - convincing IBM (for example) to go with a small competitor (like Wind mobile) is impossible.

The bigger issue was that she was always too tired to have sex, so tightness was a non-issue.

Also pro-tip for the delivery: don't look down.  You don't need to see the baby coming out of your wife and will probably scar you for life.  Just focus on her face and keep telling her reassuring things like ""you're doing excellent honey"" or ""almost there, just a few more pushes"" even if shes not.

For an example of what I mean, play some music through in-ear headphones until you hear it at a comfortable level that only just covers ambient outside noise. Then remove the headphones and hold them at arms length and you will see that they are almost, if not totally silent.

Now that you know how they work, hopefully you will ken why they don't damage your ears."

""What if i don't want to grow up? What if I don't want to be independent?"" 

*Your response should be:* 
""You don't have a choice. It is unfair and inconsiderate of you to expect me to continue taking care of you as long as you want - you have two siblings, and I have a life outside of being a parent. You're going to have to grow up regardless of whether or you want to, and it starts now. By this time next year, you need to be either gainfully employed and out of the house, or in school full-time. If you're going to continue living here, you will be responsible for cooking dinner three times a week, taking your sister to soccer practice, and cleaning the bathrooms three times a week."" [Insert more chores here, if needed.] [I'm assuming that you're okay with her staying home if she helps out around the house.]

And then she's going to whine for a while, but you need to hold firm. Tell her she has [insert period of time here] to take some initiative and tell you what she wants to do with her life.* If she wants to apply to art school, she needs to put together her portfolio and start talking to people who work in that field (ex. any of her old art teachers, people from the Fine Arts department at a university). You can have a successful career in art, but you need to have a lot of talent, and you need to know the right people, and you need to work as hard as you can. It's not an easy field to succeed in by any means. 

If she wants to major in something else, the process is the same - figure out the jobs that you're interested in, and talk to people with those jobs. 

From now on, make sure the two of you are setting **concrete, short-term goals**. (""Be an adult"" is a pretty vague and daunting concept for an 18-year-old.) If she wants to apply to art schools, look at the schools' websites together and figure out what she needs to do in order to get in, and how much time she has to do it. Write a checklist for one week of things that she needs to do. Every day, check in on her progress. If she makes an effort, praise her and tell her you're proud of her. 

If a month goes by and nothing has changed, pack up her stuff and kick her out. She can come back home if/when she's willing to grow up. 


* Remind her that if she changes her mind, it's completely fine. This is the point in her life where she *should* be trying a lot of new things and figuring out what she wants to be. What *isn't* fine is dicking around and doing nothing."

And if he sees that you're blaming him for his anxieties he's going to see you as exacerbating them.
This is probably why he shuts down.

The best way is just to remain calm and relaxed and act as if you don't need it. That if it happens it happens, and you're not putting pressure on him.
That's not something you can tell him, it's something you just need to do.

I'm in bed with pneumonia and on my phone, so I'm not in a position to whip out stats. My point was more that there is no ideal nation that has zero issues with police corruption or police action being found to be out of order or inappropriate. But that doesn't mean that any incidence that seems excessive from the outside will necessarily be found to be so once it's investigated.

I just think it's easy for us all to sit here on the internet and say that there was an easier or better way for this to be handled. Or how things would've ended differently if we were in charge. But if that's the case then I would encourage you to step up and be the change, become a police officer and be better than the police officers whose conduct disappoints you.

I'll leave it up to the professional investigators to decide that and if they say it's unreasonable then I'll agree this police officer is a contemptible monster - but for today I won't be making a decision, or accusation of murder, based off a single report that comes from the deceased persons family.

It's something to separate the ""good parents"" from the ""bad parents"". It's often overused though and personally I don't like the term at all.

For someone who just wants to take a quick look into CF the place seems very toxic yes.

You've told them 100x you don't want kids and they still try to change your mind because you don't know what you want yet. Many doctors refuse sterilization, IUD's, hell I've read some denied birth control pills because they don't agree with not having kids.

hurston,childfree,1389278515.0,"The desire to have children is a biological urge, like the desire for sex. Because most people don't realise this and are unable to articulate verbally the reason they want kids, they tend to come up with justifications for doing so. Make no mistake, these are not reasons to have kids, which is obvious if you think about them at all, as they are not well thought through. Here are some examples :

""Do you want the human race to die out?"" - In answer to this, there is no shortage of people. In fact too many people and a lack of resources is a threat to humanity.

""Don't you want your genes to carry on?"" - If you really think about this, why? For what purpose? Why are my genes more important than anyone elses? There is the idea that this is a kind of immortality, but people are forgotten in three generations. No-one remembers Einstein because he had kids. That kind of immortality is actually at risk from the time taken to bring up kids.

""If you don't have children, all the people who we don't want to have kids will take over"" - The general response to this is to ask what group or groups are you so genetically superior to that it would be worth spending 20 years of your life slightly diluting their bad genes. This is ill thought out positive eugenics that crumbles under scrutiny.

""Don't you want to give your parents grandkids"" - You can bet that the people who say this have not even asked their parents if they want grandkids. They want the kids for themselves and pretend that it is some sort of noble selfless duty for the benefit of someone else.

""It's selfish not to have kids"" - They can never answer who you are being selfish towards by not having kids, because not having kids isn't selfish. In fact, due to the strain on resources on planet earth, it is selfish towards everyone on the planet if you have kids.

tl;dr - People want kids because of hormones, there is no other reason that cannot be exposed as a justification."

sharshenka,literature,1389278760.0,"That is a good point about Autua. The name Sixsmith is interesting as well, because there are six main characters in the book. I'm guessing there would be more in other stories as well.

I'm not saying your interpretation is 100% wrong, but I don't think it is 100% supported by the book, either. How do you explain the birthmark? It is part of a story written long before Somni is born, then pops up in the real world twice? Or Somni's world showing up in Robert's letters, or Somni having deja vu about Louisa's car being driven off the bridge?


If we are just tgeory crafting, how about this alternative interpretation:

The only ""real"" people in the book are Cavendish and Hillary Hush.

After getting out of Aurora house, he published Hush's first Louisa Rey novel, then his memoir. They then collaborate on The Orison of Somni 451. Cavendish expands on the idea of lower classes being grown in tanks (which he thought of on the train), and throws in cannibalism based on his love of the movie Soylent Green. Hush provides the plucky heroine and writes the action scenes. When Hush insists on putting his ""damn birthmark"" in the story, Cavendish declairs ""I'm ruddy well going to have been famous"". Thus the reference to the incredibly popular movie based on his misadventures. In the next edition of Half Lives, Hush adds the complete Letters from Zehdelgheim. He then writes Sloosha's Crossing as a companion book to Orison. Without Cavendish to temper his enthusiasm, he goes WAY overboard on the mysticism (""you made the ruddy devil a ruddy character!"").  To prove that he is the superior author, Cavendish then publishes The Shipboard Journal, and does away with mysticism entirely. In fact, the religious are either fools or extortionists. Unfortunately, he overdid the high flying language, the book was a flop, and Cavendish and Hush never speak again.

It's caused some friction in the past, and we even almost broke up once over it, but that all got sorted out, and everything is fine now. She's accepted that I do drugs occasionally and she even smokes pot with me and my friends every now and then. So yes, it can work.

As for the trying other stuff, as someone who's had his share of experiences with hallucinogenics, I can tell you, *don't do it*. I love doing shrooms/LSD and the likes, but trust me, if you know you have anxiety issues, don't do it. The chances that you'll have a bad trip are simply too high if you can't control it properly. And the worst part about a bad trip is that it won't go away until the trip is over, so you'll be stuck in it for a couple of hours. Not something I would wish on anyone.

You should only do hallucinogenic drugs when you are mentally stable and you know that you'll be able to deal with it. I can do it pretty much whenever I want because I know how to deal with it, but people that are inexperienced might have serious trouble if they're a little bit down/anxious.

Hallucinogenics are amazing drugs, and I love doing them, but they're not for everyone. And they can actually make your anxiety worse if you're not careful."

Omega037,changemyview,1389278934.0,"&gt; Communism has only been even somewhat implemented in the Paris commune. This is because Communism is an end game, and as such has not actually been tried anywhere. Which you'd know if you'd read any material concerning communism.

This is a [No True Scotsman fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman).  There is nothing wrong with our theory, because anytime someone has supposedly followed it, they weren't *really* following it.  

The fact is the poor implementations *are* a practical representation of how Communism manifests itself at the macro-level.

&gt; Interestingly enough waste management doesn't have the problems with job satisfaction that one would assume given your outline there.

In part because they are well compensated.  However, it is hard to find *some* kind of job that people hate.

&gt; In other news money is not that great of an incentive, after financial troubles are over money stops making you happy . People volunteer to brush oil off animals, the wages for Doctors Without Borders is hilariously low, etc. etc.

Whether money makes you happy or some people are willing to forego money are moot points.  The fact is that money is the primary objective that leads the vast majority of people to work.

&gt; In a communist system there would be no economic uncertainty, and as such by default people would be happier.

That is an interesting theory, but there has not been a lot of practical evidence of that.  Knowing that you have a job and a paycheck doesn't make up for the fact that you don't have any food.

&gt; This is less of a problem than you actually think. There are already people who only do the bare necessity to not get fired, regardless of paycheck.

Yes, and those people are generally less successful than their harder working counterparts.  At least a capitalist system will have a minimum amount of work they have to do, while communist they could just not do it at all.

&gt; In a capitalist system cronyism is rampant, people let others die for money, and you're comparing that to people who say they need a bit more than they actually do?

Communist governments also have endemic corruption, the only difference is that it is limited to just the political class in capitalism.  So it goes from the state or a few industrialists screwing you over, to everyone screwing everyone over.

&gt; This is leninist thinking. See, Lenin had seen what happened in the Paris commune and concluded that the revolution could not be sustained purely by the workers. As such he decided to create professional communists, and thus came the things you said. But, you'll be happy to know that your issues also exist in mixed economies as well as those that purport to be capitalist.

&gt; In a communist system it would not be possible to have re-education camps or a secret police. Alas we're not there.

Again, No True Scotsman fallacy.  Both systems have been tried many times by many cultures in many forms.  That is how Communism acts as an applied theory.  "

Going cold turkey is opposed to stopping it by gradually doing it less and less, or stopping it with help like special gum or medicine. You don't get any help; you just stop.

One time, I was at a house party and a friend of a friend I hadn't met wanted to hook up with me (or so I heard). Well, this girl was very forward and very domineering and confident, I loved it. We chatted for a bit and then she said ""let's go"". She grabbed my hand and took me to the *woods* behind the house, which was a new experience for me lol. She shoved me against a tree and the rest is history. We became fuck buddies and eventually friends, and she liked pull out the ol' strap on a lot, which I had no complaints about. So that didn't seem terribly red pill.

Another time a FWB and I were cuddling after sex cause we were cool like that, when suddenly she started crying. After she got done she felt terrible for unloading on me, kept reassuring me it wasn't a romantic thing or anything like that, just that she was super stressed by school and life. I told her that I'm her friend after all, she can cry on me any time she likes, what are friends for? We're still really good friends (although not with benefits right now). So that didn't seem terribly red pill either."

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389279098.0,"Firstly, let's look at numbers. UK's population 63mln. Poland's 38mln. Meaning for the case to make sense the number of migrants settling in Poland would have to be circa at 400k, not 750k. 

Now, some links: [Demography of UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom) and [Demography of Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Poland) as well as this one: [Ethnic minorities in Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_minorities_in_Poland)

96.5% of Polish citizens claim Polish nationality. This already gives you certain number. Now, in 2011 census 418k of Poles claims (Silesian) as their first nationality. Second group being German with 59k (drop from 2002 from 152k, most probably because they ""became"" Polish citizens and claimed Polish nationality as first). Silesians are basically Poles but due to changed borders after II WW many of them were actually more German (or actually German) then Poles. We have plenty of other immigrant groups, obviously not as high as in UK but its mostly due to historical events in our country and surrounding ones.

Interesting facts from the history - [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_demography_of_Poland)

* Poland was in union with Lithuania , where plenty of Eastern Europe nationalities lived and mixed with each other;

* Breakout of Total 1931 Polish Population by Language and Religion Figures as % of Total Population - Polish 68%, Ukrainian 20%;

* Before World War II, the Polish lands were noted for the richness and variety of their ethnic communities. Following the Polish-Soviet War, a large part of its population belonged to national minorities. The census of that year allocates 30.8% of the population in the minority

* In 1931, Poland had the second largest Jewish population in the world, and one-fifth of all Jews resided within Poland's borders (approx. 3,136,000, roughly 10% of the entire Polish population);

What I'm trying to say is that we as a country were one of the most liberal in history. I obviously don't know details about all those historical events but quite possibly ""somehow"" people in our country coexisted quite peacefully... until Hitler and Stalin killed nearly 6mln of our citizens.

Britain has people of origin: 4.2mln Asian, 1.8mln Black, 1.2mln Mixed and 1.9mln of ""other white"". Why sudden big deal and requirement to control UK's borders after 700k Poles came to UK legally, in the period of 10 years, under EU laws. Poles who came here to work, contribute and mix well with societies. Who came here in their ""best age"" (after education, before retirement). Poles of whom many will go back to their country as (believe me) there are plenty of reasons to go back. We even share same religion and very similar other points, meaning you won't see a Pole wearing fancy Asian clothes or doing jihad war.

If UK wants to have a serious talk about immigration then why not include all other people (immigrants) in it and not point fingers at only specific groups?

Also, even statistically looking, there is no way many more Poles will come to UK (this figure will stay at similar level as some come in, some go out - proven facts). How would you resolve immigration from India or China where there are billions of people? Nobody asks UK to bring more outer EU immigrants. Immigration from EU won't be as high as simply most EU migrants already moved, while numbers of people living in EU countries tells you exactly what figures there are and how many more may come here."
fitnerd21,AskMen,1389279100.0,"Professionally speaking, everything is amazing.  I'm the youngest guy to advance as far as I have in the company I work for.  Slight downside is that some people are envious.  I counter this by being friendly to everyone at the workplace, and have a standing reservation at the local bar after work on Thursdays.

On a personal level, things are shit.  I'm in an on-again/off-again long distance relationship, which I'm struggling to convince myself will work.  To that end, I decided to do the online dating thing, went on a couple dates, even had a two week fling.  But being abstinent (no matter how forward I am about it), is always a deal-breaker.  Even on the Christian/Catholic sites.  Are these women going out with me, hoping to change me?

Second, sex is about *your* pleasure, too, not just hers. I wholeheartedly commend you for pleasing your partner (honestly, that's awesome of you) but do something that gives you pleasure, too (not instead). I'm sure she'd love you to lose yourself in pleasure, too. Obviously, don't do anything that is painful or terribly uncomfortable for her, but that's what communication is for. You need to communicate your desires and what you'd like to do and she should reciprocate and let you know what she likes and doesn't like. 

Otherwise, try not to think about climaxing too much during the act. Let yourself just feel it naturally. If you orgasm, great. If you don't, at least you were enjoying yourself, right? If you orgasm before her or sooner than you wanted, oh well, at least you were enjoying yourself! And you can keep going on her (if you want) with fingers, oral, toys, etc. 

I hope this helps some. Feel free to ask for more advice or clarification or anything. Best of luck in the bedroom. "

Yes, SSRI's can cause impairment of various sexual response phases, in your case: Orgasm. This occurs because they inhibit neurotransmitters other than Serotonin. (It is also possible they increase your sexual desire) ([info](http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/home/article/how-do-ssris-cause-sexual-dysfunction/59906499777e48108b9c3263b67cce81.html#0912CP_Article1-tab1)) 
  
However, one must remember that SSRI's alleviates the symptoms of depression and do not address the cause.  
  
I believe you are highly intelligent which is causing you to have social and performance anxiety and therefore, depression. I know of ways to increase your physical sensitivity, without addressing the phycologial, but honestly that is not going to do you any good in the long run.   
  
You can achieve orgasm regardless, by indirectly addressing the problem: you need to change your mindset, and remove focus from the goal of having an orgasm, to enjoying the moment.    
You will need to analyze the parts of your life that you are not happy with and address them first. Identify where your frears and axities lie and confront yourself with them.
  
I could unload some general advice on you, but honestly, you are intelligent enough to have figured out most of it on your own already, you need a professional to help motivate and direct you.
You need Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or [CBT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy).  
Put some effort into finding a CBT therapist who will be able to help you, don't settle to quickly, try to find someone who you feel comfortable with.
  
Also, you need to reframe from pornografy and frequent mastrubation for longer periodes of time, before you will start to experience the benefits. ([Here is a good TED talk on the subject](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU))  
  
Your intellect is a tool, you need to train yourself in the application of that tool to gain you happiness, and not be hindered by it. Eventually you may not even need the SSRI's anymore.
    
Remember changes like these usually need a minimum of 6 months of conscious effort. 
  
The best of luck to you."

hpartist,guineapigs,1389279328.0,I have the 2x5 cage with a loft and my piggies love it! We just had a litter of 4 so there is a copious amount of pop corning going on. This cage is literally the perfect size and the ramp is just big enough so that they can comfortably travel to the loft (probably about 4-5 inches wide). Guinea pigs are quite intelligent for rodents so you probably don't have to worry about them hitting their heads much.

Your last sentence speaks volumes to me. I have this same 'existential terror'. Only I now fear disappearing because of all the things I love about life. Being able to appreciate a sunny day, laying down in the cool grass, laughing at a friend doing something stupid.

There was an AMA with a 100 year old woman the other week, and someone asked her what the best memory of her life was. And she said it wasn't some great event. It wasn't some life-changing moment. She said the best memories are the simple days she had making someone smile, someone making her smile back and being selfless and doing something meaningful for others. It's really what this whole big thing called life is all about. No one knows how we ended up here. No one knows what's going to happen tomorrow. It could be the best or worse day of your life.

It is not the most important factor as far as deciding whether or not I want to play a game, but if it has all the factors I want in a game - good story, fun gameplay, nice graphics - AND it has a great female protagonist? Between picking that game and the other just-as-good game that doesn't have any good leading female characters, I'm going to lean towards the former choice.

I would like to note that my definition of a great female protagonist is not the unbreakable superwoman, but a woman who has depth and strengths and weaknesses and is relatable and well-written, rather than a sexy doll/walking trope. I've heard the Bayonetta games are really fun, but I kind of hate her physical design and it makes me not want to play the game at all.

2. I'm not sure, unfortunately, and I'm the kind of person who can be combative. However, I would say open the class with reminding them you are *not* there to force them to agree with you and certain political viewpoints, merely to consider views they don't generally agree with and see why people feel that way. Encourage them to make their own cases, but respectfully, so that it's clear all views are welcome to the discussion. Encourage them to really learn WHY people feel the way they feel, especially when those feelings do not match their own.

3. Hah, as someone who's always been really outspoken I don't know how to give advice like this to others, I just am. Too bad I'm not in your class, I'd give 'em courage! In all seriousness, just say what you said here: these are real issues that have real-world impact on real people, especially women, and they're not something to easily be dismissed. Make it clear that all voices are welcome, men and women and not one over the other. You could also try doing something like an anonymous comment submission, but...that could end up with some ugly notes in your inbox. Perhaps encourage students too worried about speaking up in class to meet with you privately before or after lecture time so they can test out their opinions without the audience and less judgement?

Will you post your classes online? It might be fun to watch.

Omega037,changemyview,1389279544.0,"&gt; In reality, **I'm sure a dockworker gets paid more than a painter**. I enjoy roofing, but I work in the service industry.

That is how capitalism solves the problem, by increasing the incentive.  Communism doesn't have that mechanism.

&gt; Who wants to work?

In a capitalist system, you *must* work in order to have money for food and other needs.  This compels people to work.  

In a communist system, you get these things anyways, regardless of whether you work.  I mean, think about it.  If I told you that you would get the same paycheck if you go in to work today or stay home and watch Netflix or play on computer, what would you do.

&gt; Communism: Do your part; get what you need.

What is to stop me from saying that my need is far greater than it is?  After all, who determines need?

&gt; I don't have a rebuttal. What do we do when we don't want to be ""capitalists""?

In a capitalist system, people who don't participate hurt themselves, but don't hurt anyone else.  If they want to try to live in a commune, they can.

In a communist system, engaging in capitalistic behavior (underground markets and such) is inherently damaging to the overall system, and must be stopped."

I did it on another character, and this time I got the ring of Hircine, AND then went back and killed the werewolf and got the Savior's Hide too.  This time when I collected the rest of the artifacts I got the achievement.


I believe it is necessary to get both the ring and the hide from Hircine to get the achievement, even though that is not officially so.  BTW this is playing WITH the unofficial Skyrim patch enabled [PC].


People were saying that the quest would bug out and never complete for PC players if you used console commands while playing, ever.  I am now convinced that is NOT TRUE.  Not only does the bug occur for XBOX and PS3 too, but I used the console numerous times in my successful playthrough.  You can't use the console to give yourself the item - you have to do the quest.  BUT, if you are out of lockpicks and you use the console to gift one to yourself, you can still get the achieve.  So the ""don't use the console"" thing is false, I have debunked it."

pakap,technology,1389279669.0,"The big take-away in that article is, surprisingly enough, in the headline: IBM is confident that the tech is mature enough to get out of the lab and start earning serious money. Confident enough to invest a billion bucks, which is not exactly spare change even for a big company.

If this works - if it does make money - we'll likely see a huge influx of capital and talent in the AI world, specifically natural language processing and all the bio-inspired, language-based side of AI. This could be huge.

On the other hand, I'm getting flashbacks (well, I'm not that old, but still) to the heydays of expert systems. 

Warning: wall of text ahead.

Disclaimer: I am not a computer scientist. I studied the history of AI and I understand some of how it works, but I welcome any and all corrections by actual experts.

Back in the 60-70s (IIRC), AI researchers figured out a new way to organize information that was inspired by the way we do it, at least at the conscious level - we have facts, rules for connecting facts (inference, deduction, etc) and ways of learning new facts, so that's what they did for these systems. This worked great for a number of things - medical diagnosis, chemical identification, complex mechanical maintenance...

So anyway, this worked pretty well. Well enough that it got out of the labs and was adopted by serious, money-making companies. General Electrics, big pharma companies, railroads...the market for expert systems was huge, and credits for AI soared, both in private R&amp;D labs and in public universities.

Then, a few years later (I want to say four of five years, but it could be ten), things started going wrong. Systems became unstable, taking too long to deliver answers, or delivering nonsensical ones.  They couldn't be trusted anymore.

Turns out, there's actually a limit to those kinds of system. Remember in *Jurassic Park* when Ian Malcom talks about non-linear systems? It's kind of like that. The more facts and rules you add to a system like that, the more risks of error you introduce, until it's almost guaranteed that any request you make will be somehow warped - systems like that simply *do not scale* beyond a certain size.

So, expert systems failed. When they failed to deliver, businesses went bust and investors got cold feet. Budgets crashed, both public and private. And AI research went through its worst period ever - what's been called *AI Winter*. It took years until AI researchers were taken seriously again.

Source: I wrote my Master's paper on AI from the perspective of a translator, so I researched the discipline's history (what there is of it) pretty extensively. Main source for this was Daniel Crevier's *Ai: The Tumultuous History of the Search for Artificial Intelligence* - pretty good book, highly readable, with original interviews of the pioneers of AI like Minsky and McCarthy."

bo_knows,personalfinance,1389279697.0,"&gt;Our goal is to save over 10 years to purchase a house. The plan we're thinking of is to set up a 3/4 fund portfolio, seeded with $10-20k leftover after establishing our emergency fund, making roughly $2k/month contributions and letting it ride. 

General rule of thumb would say that if you had a purchase within 5 years, you'd want the money to stay around in an investment that was stable, so that it didn't fluctuate much, so that you were certain you'd have that money for your purchase.

A 10yr horizon is longer.  I'd certainly go with your plan, with the caveat of possibly slowly moving that money to CD's or a savings account as you get within a few years of your purchase. 

If you're flexible on your timeline for purchasing a house, and could feasibly wait longer if the stock market tanks and you need to wait until your investments recover... then by all means ""let it ride"". "

&gt; Even as publics in many of the surveyed countries express a clear preference for women to dress conservatively, many also say women should be able to decide for themselves what to wear. This attitude is most prevalent in Tunisia (56%), Turkey (52%) and Lebanon (49%) – all countries where substantial percentages are open to women not covering their heads in public. But nearly as many in Saudi Arabia (47%) also say a women should be free to choose how she dresses. Smaller, but sizable percentages agree in Iraq (27%), Pakistan (22%) and Egypt (14%). What the survey leaves unanswered is whether respondents think social or cultural norms will guide women in their choice to wear more conservative or less conservative attire in public.

Même en Tunisie, presque *la moitié* (44%) des gens croient que les femmes ne devraient pas pouvoir porter ce qu'elles veulent en publique.  C'est là, je crois, le vrai contraste culturel - c'est pas dans le fait qu'ils s'habillent différemment, mais dans leur relation avec les droits fondamentaux des gens.

It devalues the wages of the poor, causes them to have to go into more debt to survive, which destroys their credit and cripples their ability to save. We require them to take a horrendous K-12 education that allows them to go nowhere in life. As an apology, we give them No Child Left Behind and a bare-bones ""all or nothing"" welfare system that kills their incentive to climb the economic ladder any higher than the maximum that they can while still qualifying for benefits. Not only that, but as soon as you hit the lower-middle class, you have to begin paying an obscene amount of income taxes, which further reduces the incentive to get off welfare.

Look at how government spending transfers wealth to the upper class.  We spend so much money on the military industrial complex to fight unnecessary wars, and huge amount of corporate subsidies.  We bail out Wall Street, and they give million dollar bonuses and use the money to buy interest bearing government securities to leach off taxpayers even more.  Not to mention, excessive deficit spending requires money creation, which puts upward pressure on prices, and transfers purchasing power from consumers to the government and banking system.  It's probably not a coincidence that the wealth gap started massively increasing almost immediately the after dollar was moved to a pure fiat standard in 1971.

Gertiel,IWantOut,1389279978.0,"I hate to say this, but anyone can just stick dots on a chart. And yeah, fine, I'm sure they really did plug in some sort of data to come up with that chart. The thing is, exactly what data? I went to the link provided and read this, ""Some are easily quantifiable, like jobs (which includes unemployment and income), while others are more woolly, like civic engagement and community."" What exactly is ""civic engagement"" and ""community""? 

To further muddy the waters, that's not even a chart made by the people that actually crunched the numbers. Apparently they're shy of publishing a full chart directly naming names, so the kind folks at the Economist just plugged in the few random figures they did make public to create that chart.

Now don't take me wrong. They may actually be right in the end overall, though I would argue much depends on the needs of the person in question. If you're going to be poor with a fairly minor but somewhat expensive to maintenance health issue, I'd suspect you're easily going to be much better off somewhere that sort of medical care is provided through some form of socialized medicine rather than a system like the US where it will cost you big bucks out of pocket. Yes, I know we have medicaid, but what about the working poor? Those who make just a little too much per year for medicaid are often in much more dire straights financially overall."

Omega037,changemyview,1389280123.0,"&gt; Then would you not feel any guilt or compunction about slaughtering millions of people from other communities to save the life of a single person in your community?

There is a balance here.  While it would be worth killing 100 rats to save one human, it wouldn't be worth killing a million people I don't know to save one person I somewhat know.  But I would rather have two people I didn't know die than one person I did.

&gt; I have absolutely no reason to feel empathy towards a dandelion. Plants lack a central nervous system and therefore cannot feel pain or suffering. Animals, on the other hand, can feel pain and therefore deserve empathy.

Yeah, I can slightly change this and use it as my own argument.

I have absolutely no reason to feel empathy towards a [insert animal here]. [Animals] lack a developed enough central nervous system to truly comprehend pain or suffering. Humans, on the other hand, can feel pain and therefore deserve empathy.

&gt; If it was ever scientifically proven that plants can feel pain then I would feel bad about all the grass I have cut in my backyard. Until then, I feel no empathy towards plants.

Plants respond to negative stimuli just like animals do.  They get wounded, sick, stressed, and those those can impact them for the rest of their lives.  The ""pain"" that animals feel is merely neurotransmitters like acetylcholine activating neuronal pathways that  have been trained to represent pain (as a mechanism for sensing injury).  Plants have a different mechanism, but it plays the same role.

First, abandon this stupid idea bored into your head by popular culture and bitter divorcees.  Am I saying everyone SHOULD be on the hunt for a relationship?  Absolutely not, but don't apologize for going after what you want.  Yes, nineteen is young, but it's a perfectly good time for you  to start having experiences that reflect the things you value.  It is completely acceptable to want what you want.

&gt;she is absolutely amazing and she is single and thinks she doesn't deserve a boyfriend but she does **but I don't think its worth pursuing because in the end she wont like me.**

people tend to appreciate others who actually invest themselves without expectation.  you cannot control how others choose to behave and nobody owes you anything in exchange for your attention.  since you seem to think socializing with this woman would only be worthwhile on the condition she'll eventually love you, you're pretty much diving into the deep end of the friend zone with someone you don't even want as a friend.

&gt;should I keep pursuing girls or focus on myself for a while?

do both.  stop focusing on what is wrong with women who don't want you, stop focusing on your own ends (will this girl eventually date me?).  do your best to become the best version of yourself you can (whatever that may be), and socialize with people you admire whether or not you think they'll eventually sleep with you.  you can make yourself appealing and you can give it a shot with the people you like, but you can't control whether or not someone wants you... imagining you can will not make you happy."

Edit: seeing as you were responding to /u/Honey-badger's mention that it was mostly catholic - I think that's probably because of Sinn Fein and the IRA and their little habit of bombing people. While protestant groups have also carried out bombings, the Catholic ones were the ones that have stuck in global memory for being more recent (the Protestant ones were more in the 60's and 70's) and better remembered.

I also don't see Bach or Harry Potter being in the same camp as a joke about pinning a screaming person to the ground and fucking them against their will or a joke about negative qualities being associated with someone's skin color. 

The reason has to do with content and values. One group of content isn't offensive to a lot of people, one group is offensive to many people. I think people that find the latter group of content funny do so for bad reasons. It's either because they aren't thinking enough (i.e., being empathetic, criticizing stereotypes, putting yourself on another's shoes, etc) or because they genuinely wish ill on the groups addressed in that content.

There are a few, tiny exceptions which don't make the rule. There are a few rape jokes out there that aren't really jokes against the victim, but are about rape and are funny. There are jokes out there that aren't against the race being talked about, but involve their race and are funny. The issue isn't with those.

What I have yet to here are good reasons for finding most ""insensitive"" jokes funny. If it were just a matter of taste, then the content likely wouldn't be an issue. The content wouldn't be offensive. "

You're pretty easy to bully early game, so try to avoid confrontations and focus on safely farming until you have a good number of stacks on your q. You scale more off levels and q stacks than gold, so prioritise farm and staying in lane over kills early on. A popular tactic on Nasus is to run teleport, and use it to buy an early chainmail or negatron cloak (depending on what kind of damage your lane opponent is harassing you with) without missing out on farm. Between that and the lifesteal on your passive, it becomes difficult for your opponent to harass hard enough to beat your sustain. Once you have 200ish stacks and sheen, you'll be able to straight up beat most lane opponents in trades, provided they haven't been fed many kills. Teleport will later prove its worth by allowing you to go off on your own to farm stacks/push lanes, then teleport in when a fight breaks out in earnest."

silverionmox,europe,1389280699.0,"&gt; Yes, but everybody acknowledges the United States government as just that, a federal government. The same is not the case with the European Union, because many people don't consider the European Union a federal government, and feel ""fooled"" because when their country agreed to join the European Union, it wasn't with the notion of it becoming a federal government.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That's the problem. 

But that's mostly a matter of the national governments spinning the issue as they like. How would the EU be able to influence that without doing something that would amount to an unlegitimized powergrab?"

I will agree that I shouldn't have said that a typical restaurant shoots for 35%-38%.  That is what my restaurant shoots for due to the specific niche.  And yet, you haven't really contributed to the subject in any meaningful way other than pointing out this correction in a dickish manner. 

&gt;I wouldn't bother, as his info is either wrong or misleading. One major flaw being that equipment is not factored into food cost.

I explained why I used that as a substitute for the actual cost of ice, and other than the wrong industry standard, everything I wrote is accurate **for my restaurant.**  Feel free to spend some time contributing to the community and write your own breakdown of costs for this or anything else, if you'd like.

Dajbman22,AskMen,1389280794.0,"I had a situation in college where I started developing feelings for a female friend of mine. We were in the same major, but she was one year behind me so we only had a little overlap (it was Psychology, so after the first 2 semesters, there really isn't an order you have to take the classes in). The thing that was really holding me back was that as I was becoming friends with this girl, I was going through a pretty intense breakup of my first LTR (about 1.5 years). I didn't want to jump into anything serious right away as I was still processing the end of a very serious relationship.

I still developed feeling for my friend pretty soon on into our friendship. I tried my best to keep them at bay, not wanting to jump into a rebound situation. The problem was that about a month into me really developing those feelings, the semester was coming to a close. We were spending almost all of our free time together, we would go on long walks alone, even sometimes hold hands. Yet this whole time neither of us said anything about taking anything beyond friendship. By the time finals week was coming around the bend, I felt like things were going to boil over between us. I logically knew it was too soon to jump in again, and I really didn't want to screw up the friendship we had. My plan was to spend the summer alone, get my ex out of my mind and system fully, and then see how I still felt about my friend. The more I thought about that plan, though, the harder that summer in between sounded in my mind. I also didn't hold back on those intimate one on one nights with this friend. I felt like something was going to blow.

Finally, one night sitting in the campus coffee shop, I finally broached the subject both of us were avoiding in every way possible. I explained to her how I had developed romantic feelings for her, and I sensed that she was reciprocating them, but that I just wasn't ready yet. I told her I would love to go out with her once the fall semester began, but I just needed time to clear my head and that it had nothing to do with her. She understood, and said she would love to take me up on that offer when the time was right, but that there was no pressure if I changed my mind about us before then. She wanted me to do what was best for me.

When the guy behind the counter reminded us that they were closing for the night and we got up to leave. As I was walking her back to her dorm, I just looked at her the whole time. I realized that if I let us spend a summer completely apart, I may loose this connection. I couldn't let something that felt so right slip between my fingers. I stopped her, looked her in the eye and just said ""Forget what we just agreed to back there. I can't risk losing this chance. I want to be with you right now, not in 3 months."" She just said ""If you are sure that's what you really want than let's do it"". We embraced. 

We're getting married this June. "

I would try to make friends in the wrestling club who can vouch for the similarities. Drive home that judo has more in common with western wrestling than it does with martial arts. It is essentially jacket wrestling, with a ruleset and move names that happen to come from Japan.

You might need to offer some concessions. I'm not sure I personally would be comfortable with a judo club staffed entirely by undergrads. You should probably find a way to to have someone on-hand who can deal with the occasional concussion or the freak spinal injury. You may, for the CRS's peace of mind, just have to leave out armlocks and chokes entirely. If the school wants to take a hard line on that, they do have a valid point."

goocy,skeptic,1389281183.0,"This is a flawed idea because of two major reasons.

* Consciousness isn't based on quantum physics. There is no indicator that anything in the body can meaningfully interact with the information from entangled particles. Every information-processing device is far too big, and the body is far too warm for any useful entanglement to occur.

* Consciousness isn't an entity. It's the result of our cognitive filtering process, and allows us to focus on the most important task at hand. You can literally get unconscious (for example, during deep sleep, under anesthesia or in a coma), and yet it ""magically"" reappears afterwards. That's because consciousness isn't an entity that goes somewhere, but the obvious surface of a bunch of processes that can be started and stopped.

Stating ""Consciousness goes into other universes after death because of quantum physics"" violates these two basic issues. And it assumes that there are multiple universes, which is a hotly debated topic in theoretical physics. This theory it doesn't explain *how* the quantum physics behind it work (physics utterly relies on formulas), so it's a mystical explanation with a naïve view of consciousness.

Since the author doesn't have a background in cognitive science, and saying ""quantum physics"" without formulas is as useful as saying ""magic"", this is very obvious bullshit that doesn't need a lot of debunking."
wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1389281183.0,"The Buddha was omniscient. That's what happens when one attains Nirvana. How can wisdom free of concepts be limited by concepts? As far as scientific reasoning goes, I believe he told people what was necessary at the time. It probably would have taken him the rest of his life to expound on everything he knew. I guess he figured the time was better spent teaching people how to come to his understanding themselves, ""teach a man to fish"" and all of that.

Is it dogma in the Roman Catholic sense of ""what you need to believe to be a Buddhist?"" No, but it would be beneficial to be open to the idea, even if there's no threat of damnation if you don't. I think us people growing up in Christian countries are used to thinking like ""what do I have to believe"" because of the assumption that religion has to be a ""get out of hell free"" card. No offense to the Christian users here; I know for you personally that's not true, I'm only talking about the cultural influence."
Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1389281189.0,"&gt; I feel like my social life has been nothing but a lie

I think (and it sounds like) your friends/peers don't have a 100% accurate view of asperger's and what it actually means or the effect it has.  That can make people nervous in the same way that for some folks, being around other races or cultures which they aren't familiar with can cause them to act strange or awkward, lead to social misunderstanding.  I think it's helpful to educate people on this sort of thing if you can.  I find that a reasonably cogent and relatable article is [this one](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergerSyndrome) even though it relates to fictional characters, it's a quick n' dirty rundown which most people understand better than a clinical reference sheet.  Also keep in mind that if they are open to you, making a legitimate effort to include you and/or modify their approach to you versus how they approach other people, even if based on misunderstanding of your wiring... it generally means they value you in some way and are trying to understand you and make whatever interaction/relationship you have with them work.

* I didn't have that social policy, so I never made them.  Stupid in hindsight, because they would've also given me that extra gold which would've helped.  Plus, once I got the social policy I wanted them to take advantage right away.

* I never realized this.  Everytime I hear someone talk about their GS on higher difficulties, they may plant one academy early on, but then save all of their GS for 6 turns after they get research labs up for the biggest science boost. Is this wrong?

* By the time the Eiffel tower was available, he was already influential over my Civ. I had shit culture, so he was able to become Influential over me and Hiawatha by turn 225 or so.

I'll keep this in mind while playing in the future though.  Any ideas on how I could've messed up his tourism?  I had the whole world DoW him through bribes at one point, and it didn't seem to matter.  At any given point, India was at war with someone through one of my bribes. Maybe 20 turns in between peace deals before I would get him into another war.  His score was so high though, I think most of the AI were scared of him and would turtle up."

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1389281227.0,"With 20% down:

20% downpayment

3% loan fees (plus points/origination, so could be more)

1% title insurance

$2000 misc. fees

1st year insurance

HOA transfer fee (I assume there's one because it's a condo, may be very low like $75 with luck)

That should be pretty spot on (probably erring on the side of caution with the misc. fees, which should actually probably be $1k or less, I. E. Survey, appraisal, etc. ). 

So if you budget 25% (plus points/origination) plus 1 year homeowner's insurance you'll be good. If you escrow insurance and taxes you'll need more. I honestly don't know how to calculate what the escrow company will want. If you have 6 month of taxes+insurance you should have more than enough (someone else here can probably give you more details, I don't normally escrow investment properties, and don't care on residences since it's money I will have to pay anyway, do doesn't change net out of pocket).

You're thinking that you are on the same level of knowledge as your parents are, yet saying that both of you are vastly ahead of me. I could make the same claim about my level of knowledge and my parents to someone who was 10, and it would make about as much sense as what you are saying.

This isn't about age. And if it was, you're not at some magical plateau where you stop learning and growing as an individual. Regardless of how you feel about it. Especially not, seeing as that the conversation we're in is regarding personality and shallowness. How can you honestly claim it's something you've gotten past, and say you've done so because of your age, and that I can't possibly have because of mine?

All of the things you write about are things people learn at different ages. I moved out at a younger age than you did. I'm financially independent. Also, it seems you don't even know what a credit rating is, because I'd be very surprised if you have one. You have a credit score, like I do. And I've been in love, like you've been in love. I've had good sex and bad sex. Meaningless one night stands and wonderful lovemaking. I've even taken part in raising my younger siblings for a good deal of time, in case you don't want to count me taking care of orphans when I was younger as experience building. I've been arrested, and I've built political parties in countries I haven't been to. But I know full well that I'm far from done growing and learning. Because, honestly, there aren't enough human lifetimes there has ever been or that there ever will be to scratch the surface of what there is to learn and experience in a universe as vast as ours. And honestly, I'd be pretty fucking sad if I thought I'd devolved to the point where I'm barely half way through my life, but largely done growing and learning. 

And you, you probably aren't *close* to your 60's yet. You have, at the very least, a third of your life yet. Probably closer to half of it. And I'm not even going to get that deep into the things people younger than me have achieved. But Issac Newton invented calculus invented calculus for the fuck of it before he turned 26. How can you honestly sit there with the opinion that knowledge builds massively until you turn a certain age that you're older than for everyone, and then knowledge stops building, and people older than you are on about the same level as you? Even the ones twice as old as you are? You have to understand how ridiculous that sounds, right? I've talked to several people older than you are who said they felt like you seem to when they were younger, until they realized that that's not how it works, and that they reached a point of realizing that there's so much of their life left, and that they're so far away from learning all you can. And I know other people who feel like they haven't really grown that much at all since they were 30.

I think that is a pretty localised thing you experience, I was born and raised in Northern Ontario and you could have regular social interactions with police going down the street or outside public venues or wherever you were and most of them were nice friendly people, or at least cordial if they didn't feel like talking, not assholes.

The one time I was pulled over the cop gave me a relatively hard time and I just stayed calm and professional about it and it was no biggie.  He had legitimate grounds to pull me over, and he may have been trying to get a rise out of me but he didn't and he backed off a bit. He ticketed me for what was wrong and I went on my way.  There are a lot more nice cops then dick cops out there.

your mother is narcissistic and abusive, and likely will never believe this to be true or make serious attempts to change.  you cannot wait for your mother to become the person you wish she would be, you need to work on figuring out how you can tolerate keeping her in your life, or whether that might not be the best choice for you.  if therapy is not within your means i would strongly recommend doing as much reading as you can on [""toxic mothers.""](http://www.psychologies.co.uk/family/toxic-mother.html)

the mother-daughter relationship is extremely complex and challenging to navigate.  your needs are just as important as your mother's, or anyone else's on this earth.  nobody is perfect, ourselves included, but do not allow yourself to think you deserve an abused existence simply because you had the misfortune of a mentally ill mother not up to the job of being a good parent.  take care of yourself and learn you are valuable whether or not your mother says so."

Considering USD 1.000.000$ would not make a big % of the total available resources whereas 1.000.000 BTC would be a huge part (1/21 of the end total). 

I think the reason economists use another definition is, that they can limit the scope of their analysis to a managable level, my definition would be too abstract and cover too many cases.

So my point being, asking why money is important kinda equates to asking why resources (and the management thereof) is important, which i'm sure others here can answer much better than me.

Sunfried,askscience,1389281601.0,"Formerly nearsighted glasses wearer here. Lens prescriptions are measured in ""diopters,"" where 1 diopter is a mild prescription (you can see the drugstore reading glasses that usually correct between 0.5 and 2.0), and 9 is ""geebus, how does this person see anything?""  Diopters are broken into quarters, and can be positive or negative.  IIRC, my lenses were -4.25 and -4.5, or something.  (I could be wrong on the +/-.)

Assuming you can align the centers of the two lenses, then two consecutive lenses should more or less add up-- so a -4 lens, followed by a +4 lens should result in mostly clear vision, if you were viewing things in the world of perfect optics and such.

However, in real life, there are a lot of physical concessions-- pupil centering is one thing, and lens artifacts-- the material and shape of the lens (shape as far as fitting in the frames) produce weird edge effects that the glasses-wearer sees at first (new lenses can be weird for a day or two) and then forgets about as the brain corrects or re-calibrates for them.

* How should I do this in the future? Especially since Gandhi had the best religion for me (pagodas and mosques available to buy), I didn't focus on it. Should I buy my own missionaries and spread the religion myself?
* Yeah, there's really no excuse for this one. I don't know why I didn't set these up.
* Gandhi was influential over me by the time I discovered Archaeology, so I didn't feel they'd help much. I already had most of the social policies that I wanted to get by this point, and I thought other buildings had priority.  
* Unfortunately, he kinda was. Anytime that I felt my neighbors were getting too curious about me for my own good, I'd have them war against each other. By the later game, I was getting Gandhi to DoW people on the other continents just to change his production. I'm talking most of the game.  I wasn't kidding when I said Gandhi was a willing warmonger throughout the game.

However, I do think **I** should have personally bit the bullet and took his capital and second best city.  They were near the coast, so I could move my forces just below his capital and move up through to his second best city. I would've gained all of his wonders then."

I didn't engage in any wars except when Monty DoW'd me early on, and then I was bribing Gandhi into as many wars as I could.

However, with the culture, how do I gain more culture. I was allied with 7 or 8 CS's, and had all of my guilds up and all culture buildings up with specialists working the guilds.  What am I doing wrong there to have such little Culture per turn?

I didn't switch to Order because I didn't have enough culture to get a good amount of social policies, and I got the 2 free ones from being the first to adopt an ideology. I had a lot of happiness from freedom through the gold buildings giving me happiness, and specialists take up half the amount of food they normally would. I couldn't give those up easily.

I took the Crossbowmen because I was afraid of a war from Hiawatha, and I wanted to either deter him or be able to beat him back ASAP.  The Composite bowmen wouldn't have done the job.  I delayed NC until turn 125 because of a war I had with Monty. My cities at the time were either building Circus's and Colleseum's to deal with Unhappiness from plopping so many cities very quickly, or they were building Composite Bowmen for the war with Monty.

What I majorly disagree with is when I see anarchists and socialists who advocate smashing property or killing the bourgeoise. And in general I find the bourgeoise/proletariat rhetoric that some socialists use to be oversimplistic and kind of annoying. 

And I see some ""anarchists,"" such as Chomsky, advocating increased state socialist/welfare state policies in our current system which makes me think they don't care about decreasing state power as much as just getting free stuff. Now, I'm not one to advocate eliminating all welfare to the poor in one fell swoop, but getting even more people dependent on the state also seems like a pretty terrible idea if we hope to delegitimize it."

NoOfficialComment,loseit,1389282172.0,"&gt;  I used to lift weights about twenty years ago during university. I'm not really interested in bulking up, just staying in shape physically and trying to prolong/extend my lifespan.

Staying in shape physically means being strong and flexible as well though. These are huge parts of health and longevity.

You don't have to specifically bulk up in a traditional sense but there is literally no downside to being stronger not to mention that as you age having a higher percentage of lean muscle mass is so incredibly beneficial. Prolonged running will have an impact on your joints if you're not careful to spend time strengthening the stabilising muscles.

The problem with extended periods of caloric deficit with no resistance work is you're likely to be catabolising your muscle mass as well as losing body fat.

On top of that do plenty of mobility work. Yoga would be an excellent investment in that sense as you'll get your resistance work in that way as well and it's very low impact.

Best of luck."

If following your natural eating impulses made you skinny (or fat) and you want to change that, why are you still worried about the same urges that put you in your current state?

Gaining and losing weight is about turning a biologically-mediated process into a cognitively-mediated process. Doing so will often cause your biology to adapt, creating a nice feedback loop.

Take some solace in that.

Use that to realize that he's right, you are a wonderful person who deserves happiness.  Find it in small ways right now.  Baby steps.  Other that separating from him, don't make any big decisions.  Live simply, focus on who you are and what you want.  Take it day to day.  You've got the right of it by exercising, talking with therapists, and getting tested.  Do some rebuilding on your self esteem too.  Small goals accomplished in quick succession will help build that back up.

It's okay to feel hurt.  Own that pain and realize you'll be living with it a while.  Don't think you have to put it away or ignore it to get better.  You'll be able to realize how to heal once you understand what about this makes you hurt, and the only way to do that is to hurt.  Give yourself time to do that.  But also ask for help.  Your dad seems to be supportive, make sure you accept help from friends, let them take you out, let them be there for you.  You're going to be missing a major social outlet and you need people there who will be as unconditionally supportive as possible.

I hope you get through this.  It sounds awful.  Best of luck!"

&gt;  She's a narcissist, so we could let her make it all about her

&gt;  she would see this second wedding as the ""lesser"" wedding

I'm so sorry you have to deal with this woman as your mother.  I have a really shitty family (druggies, drug dealers, excons, current cons, manipulative twats, losers, etc etc) and after I was able to get out of that environment and start my own life, I told them all to go fuck themselves, unless they were interested in being decent human beings.  Clearly none of those people will be invited to my wedding, and I've been very straight forward about what I deem acceptable behavior (wanna smoke weed?  What up.  wanna smoke crack with your baby in your lap while you play playstation?  Fuck off).

If I were in your shoes, I'd not tell my crazy mother anything about my wedding details.  I'd tell her that she's a horrible person and she's welcome in my life when she gets her shit together and actually has a positive net influence on the world.  I assume this is much too harsh for your dealings, but as you can see the kind of person I am, I wouldn't fathom planning and paying for a second wedding to fuel the needs of such an asshole.

When a wholesale customer would return a part to the parts department (and we choose receive it) they are entitled to a full refund... But the dealership accounting itself would ""Withhold"" the check until the customer would call in several times asking for it. 

This would understandably make the customer pissed and the PARTS department that was paid on COMMISSION would suffer.

They didnt buy an alignment rack till three years ago despite the need for one...

the shop is an OSHA nightmare, but it isnt the techs fault the equipment used is so old it malfunctions regularly.

They've been caught several times withholding paychecks from fired employees.

They used to generously provide the (now retired) chief of police with a brand new... very expensive car on a regular basis...

Well I suspect that's going to depend on what you're doing. Endless treadmill etc is boring that's for damn certain. Try finding a sport - one with a decent skill component and social aspect is awesome. You'll be working out without realising it, making new friends and learning ancillary skills like hand/eye coordination and agility.

&gt; I think it's ok to acknowledge that working out sucks most of the time, just like studying sucks and cleaning.

Working out doesn't suck: I get to find out what else my body can do and become better in the process. Studying doesn't suck: I'm learning new skills and becoming better in the process. Cleaning...might give you that one! lol

I guess what I'm saying i that, yes: if you are even remotely pushing yourself as you should be there'll be times in the middle of your workouts that are not fun. And they shouldn't be. But at the same time you can't go on endlessly believing that every form of exercising (or any other activity/task) sucks. I just can't see anyone succeeding long term in life with that approach."

millapixel,AskReddit,1389282782.0,"It's not that uncommon! I really recommend making sure you shower and wash your hair regularly, and try to put a little bit of effort into your appearance. Girls (and I imagine guys also) are more likely to be attracted to someone who knows how to take care of themselves. You don't have to be really stylish, you don't have to do loads with your hair or spend money on clothes. You just need to show that you care enough about yourself to put a little effort in, even if it is fairly minimal.


Interaction wise... Girls are normal people too, you don't need to put them on a pedestal. Try not to sound desperate as this is really off putting. Step back and evaluate how you treat women. Is it fairly? Are you being creepy at all? Crowding them too much? Putting them on a pedestal? Being nice to girls helps, but don't do it only for potential rewards. Become friends with them. Follow your instincts, does she seem to like you a lot and treat you differently than other guys? She might be into you. Get to know her well enough to know what she likes. Is she embarrassed by being at the centre of attention? Don't ask her out publicly and showily! Does she like more formal fancy dates or something low key like hanging out together at home with some silly movies?

You don't have to decide right now if you want to leave him, but please see a counselor (without him) who can guide you in making that decision yourself. They can help you line up your ducks in case you decide to leave eventually, give you resources in case it gets so bad you need to get out at the drop of a hat one day, or give you resources about anger management if you plan to stay.

Think about this though... if you had a daughter, what would you tell her if she lived with a man behaving like this? Would you want her to stay? Would you worry about her safety? Would you tell her to get out?"

Cykuta,todayilearned,1389282916.0,"I still say it's way too murky an area for law to intervene. If you could somehow prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the intent of making someone commit suicide, then possibly, yes. But emotions are a complicated and very inexact field, and I just don't see any reasonable way to go about this.

There are people in my life that simply cannot see why they have hurt me. They are not arseholes (ok, they are, but not intentionally), they don't have any ill will: they simply cannot understand why their actions result in emotional suffering on my part. To them, I am a ""crazy (how I love that label! fixes everything, instantly) overly sensitive pathetic weakling"" that cannot cope with ""real life"" and what have you. No matter what we think of them, they really believe this. So they don't intend to make me suffer, yet I do. Would they be punished by this emotion-law, or would they be the equivalent of ""not sound of mind"" and institutionalised until such time as they understand why the ""crazy bitch"" wasn't really crazy? How would that work? It simply can't. Let's not try, honestly.

Coming back to the suicide thing, I still don't think this is a matter for  law punishment, unless you have, I dunno, a record of a conversation where they say, ""Imma go demean this bitch until she drinks weedkiller and then we can marry"" or something. But just being an arsehole really shouldn't be illegal, if only so that you can be sure that those who are actually nice are genuine, not fearing you ratting them out to EmoThPol."

by_a_pyre_light,pcmasterrace,1389282949.0,"Yeah, the performance was close. For me though, the biggest difference was the VRAM, and while the 7970s and 770 traded leads in Anandtech's benchmarks, the extra VRAM is important to me for BF4 (which uses up to 3) and a bit of future proofing. I'm tired of being *juuuust* behind the curve and want to be just ahead of it next time. Case in point, when I got my GeForce 6800 GT back in the day, I got the 128MB due to budget. My buddy got the 256MB. I get the Radeon 6850s w/ 1GB of RAM, and 6 months later, 2GB is standard on almost all new cards, and I can't even make that gap up w/ CrossfireX. So, I want to have 4GB of VRAM next time, and the 770 had better Battlefield performance and more VRAM, so that was the difference for me. 

As for the price, no, they were all around the same price from what I saw. I understand the 7970s recently shot through the roof because of Bitcoin mining, so that's probably why. :-/

I will check out the 680 though, since it may be cheaper. Thanks!"

sometimes being committed to someone means putting up with some stupid bullshit. the real question is: is he being a responsible adult as well? so far, he is demonstrating very non-adult responses. he sexted someone, and he quit his job and lied about it. an adult takes responsibility for his own actions, and works to solve his own problems.

has he been looking for a new job during this week? how does he plan to pay the bills once his severance package runs out? is he taking responsibility for what happened?

i won't say ""dump the mother fucker already"" as others are saying, but i will say that you need to really think about your relationship and decide if he is worth the time and effort you are investing. if he is, then yeah, suck it up and keep going. that is what a commitment is about. if he isn't worth it, make a clean break.

but as for your question: yes, this is what adult committed relationships are like. things don't always go smoothly, but if you love him, you go through it with him."

Unless you plan to make amends somehow, that's just some guilt you'll have to deal with.  Your dreams are just your brain sifting out the constant conscious thoughts.  They'll be there as long as you actively think of her.

It basically sounds like you freaked and bailed.  You like this girl, love her even, yet the thought of being with her forever scares the crap outta you.  So tell me, is that going to be any different with anyone else?  Let's say you meet someone else in a few years, you date, you live together, you're now 33-34 and things are getting serious.  Are you going to wonder what else is out there again?

I would definitely not date anyone.  Not because you're not over this girl, but because you have internal issues that keep you from committing to anyone.

Games will be programmed (more specifically compiled and bug tested) against a specific version of direct X. The toolkit gets updated monthly or weekly sometimes. 

So often times you can't just ""get the newest version"" and be fine with it. As the game may produce unexpected behavior (ranging from minor glitches to showstopper crashes).


Point is if the game asks you to install direct X, do it."

 * Does she drink a lot?
 * Is she medicated for any reason?
 * What does she do for a living and when was the last time she lived on her own?"

when you're making your decision, I'd recommend considering the following:  what sort of qualities does your girlfriend really identify with?  think about what she values personally; think about the days you two have had the best times together.  what traits about her really shine through when she's in her element?  the best gifts are the ones that highlight our favorite versions of ourselves."

It's a mysterious reddit thingy which happens often to spammers as well as those who use proxies and/or post to controversial subs a lot. This is why your posts are not getting voted up, nobody can see them. The only people who can see them are either you or the mods of the sub you are posting to. You can appeal to reddit admins to have your account reinstated but it rarely works. I used to post as /u/nonsequitur1979 [+10] but got ghosted after I started posting in controversial subs (usually because of collectives of trolls who report you for stupid reasons and reddit's algorithms are rather unforgiving if you end up being the target of unwarranted mass-reporting). Try signing out and viewing your comment history and you'll see what I mean. Sign up with a new account and there's a good chance you'll be OK.

I originally noticed all this when I saw your post caught in the spam-trap (which happens automatically for ghosted accounts on most subs). I approved it and others can probably see it now but be aware that all future postings to pretty much all subs are likely to be invisible to all but you and the mods until the mods approve it, assuming they check the spam-trap regularly."

tehsuigi,toronto,1389283327.0,"&gt; The capital costs of maintaining a street car infrastructure are massive in comparison to buses which are mightily flexible, re-rout-able and easily fixed

They also have higher operating costs than streetcars - more drivers needed for the same amount of passengers and cost of diesel fuel, specifically. Buses may be easily fixed, but that's in part because our streetcar fleet is over 35 years old and nobody makes parts for them anymore. The new fleet is based on an existing Bombardier platform, slightly customized for Toronto, so repairs in theory would be easier.

&gt; If memory serves me well our street cars are custom-made with a custom-track and are even more expensive than standard street car systems.

Our streetcars are custom-made because **no one in North America was making streetcars in the 1970s.** We were more or less the only major city in this continent to keep their streetcar system running for actual transit use instead of as a tourist route. [So we had to design the damn things ourselves.](http://transit.toronto.on.ca/streetcar/4503.shtml)

The custom track width is different - it's a holdover of early-20th century Toronto streetcars, where the concern was that if the TTC's predecessors used standard gauge track, that freight trains would try to use them along Toronto streets. From the almighty Wiki:
&gt; According to the TTC, the City of Toronto feared that the street railway franchise operator, first in 1861, the Toronto Street Railway, then in 1891, the Toronto Railway Company, and in 1921, the TTC, would allow the operation of steam locomotives and freight trains through city streets, as was common practice in Hamilton, Ontario (until the 1950s) and in many US cities, such as New York City and Syracuse, New York.

Back to you.

&gt; In addition, switch overs to buses would be to trolley buses as have been implemented in many places already. Those buses have (if I can recall a study I read earlier today, 80-90% the capacity of a street car, though perhaps not the newest large cars.)

Trolley buses are just regular buses with electric motors. They don't have any capacity advantage over them (provided you compare apples to apples - articulated trolley buses to articulated buses, that is). Funnily enough, [Toronto had trolley buses for a few decades](http://transit.toronto.on.ca/trolleybus/). We abandoned them because they just didn't make sense at the time.

&gt; Nobody ever talks about BRT though.

I think that's because there's a lack of local examples - diamond lanes for small stretches of Yonge and Eglinton Streets do not a BRT make. Once the [Viva rapidways](http://www.vivanext.com/) are fully operational, maybe Toronto will clue in."

This is purely the effect that drugs like these can have on the sexual response.

Also the stuff other people have mentioned about going from once a week to once a day--that's a big jump, and I suspect you're losing a lot of data granularity in that leap.

I wasn't really sure what to do with the sexual desire section. A lot of that stuff changes on a day-to-day, or really, moment-to-moment basis, so I wasn't sure what to answer. Is it an ""on average?"" Also, how am I supposed to know what other people of my age and sex feel, sexually?

Also asking for a precise weight is some what-the-hell levels of specificity and related pressure. Give us some ranges, here. Same with the specificity of birthdate--is a swing of 30 days really too much?

The funny thing is that you know that you are full of shit but just can't see it. How else could you say with a straight face that simply getting rid of Kim would make things better, yet at the same time admit the fact that the entire population there is brainwashed to view the West as being the devil - i.e. a cultural issue which by now goes much deeper than Kim. Or imply that North Korean leadership is stupid while saying in your next post that Kim is a smart man who knows exactly what he is doing.

There is no happy ending no matter how you look at it, but I can absolutely assure that continuing to indefinitely isolate and/or antagonize an already extremely paranoid regime, which has nuclear weapons, like North Korea WILL eventually lead to a catastrophic conflict. Whether or not your delicate, holier than thou sensibilities likes it, North Korea must in one way or another be dealt with; and that means either engaging in some sort of cultural AND political diplomacy, or engaging in what would be an absolutely devasting military conflict.

I'm learning to now, at 26, to pair a good wine with a meal etc. I did smoke weed, and tried ecstasy a few times but that's about it. 

My parent went through a super messy divorce when I was 15 - same year I went to boarding school so my relatively normal bouts of teenaged rebellion were met with the over-reactive nature of those in recovery seeing everyone else as being addicts that just haven't realised yet. 

I don't have an addictive personality and I'm not codependent but I do feel like I recognise these kinds of behaviours more easily in others and have from a young age. I could identify narcissism and psychological damage in adults really easily (and call them on it) and I still to this day don't understand why people can't see it in themselves. I think I may just be abnormally reflective - I've always tried to take emotional stock and evaluate where I am and where I want to be.

My parents have *so* many issues and I see them more clearly now that I've been pretty much out of their lives for a decade and have just come back in. However, I learnt this the hard way.

if you want to continue the relationship (note, i am not saying dump him, nor am i saying you should take him back - that is up to you) then you need to find a 3rd person who can act as a councilor for you. a relationship therapist, a close friend that you both trust, whatever. you both need to talk through all of it honestly and without assigning blame.

keakealani,musictheory,1389283973.0,"As /u/CrownStarr points out, this is a pretty absurdly broad question, so I don't know that there's any meaningful way to make a generalization. I also personally feel that all (or most) music within a given piece should, in some way, be related - thus, it's sort of impossible to say that there are different melodies, so much as different permutations of the same germinal idea(s).

However, I think it depends heavily on the content of the text. Strophic texts function very differently from a free poem, which functions differently than prose. Every style of text has a huge bearing on how it should be set - the rhyme scheme, meter, and use of literary device can and should inform the ultimate musical setting. Length of poem also obviously makes a huge difference - it's much more difficult to include several different musical ideas when you're only working with a small textual idea, while it's also difficult to stick to one unified melodic device with a longer, more complex text. 

So it's really based on a lot of different context factors, the most important of which is text setting. (Although, formal structure, context, etc. can also be really important as well.) "

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1389284049.0,"I encourage you to try. I'm an American black woman who attends a Thai Theravada temple with many other South Asian families, like Laotian and Nepalese. My experience has been pretty normal, and it makes me happy to practice within that community.

Saying that, when I first came there were things I had to keep in mind as an ~~American~~ westerner, even though I'm not white or male. 

First, it's not about me, it's about the practice, period. No one is there to roll out the red carpet for me to walk to my comfy meditation cushion on. I bow when I greet the monks, as well as when I give them food. I act in gratitude to *them*; I don't think I'm some kind of gift to them. Unlike other areas in America (or other American sanghas), I'm not a customer receiving service. I'm a lay person receiving a gift. So don't freak out just because they aren't treating you like a visiting dignitary when you walk through the door.

Also, I said it before here, but ""ethnic"" temples are used to ~~Americans~~ westerners treating their temples like tourist attractions and/or ~~Americans~~ westerners saying they are Buddhists but scoffing when they talk about karma or rebirth. This may have led a particular community to be wary of ~~Americans~~ westerners who come in off the street. It's not so much racism as it is having had bad experiences and feeling cautious.

If that happens, some of the best ways you can show you are serious is to observe temple etiquette, always greet the monks with a bow, show respect for the Buddha, and *always, always find a way to be helpful*--take out the trash, wash the dishes, offer the monks food, donate regularly as your budget allows, etc. Remember that before you came along the temple was a community, and it takes the work of a lot of people just for you to be able to show up and sit down. Show gratitude.

Saying that, your experience will depend on the area. I don't know about single white males, but as a black woman, I honestly had no problem fitting in as a respectful person. Judging by the pictures on the wall, this particular temple is used to all kinds of different racial minorities going there over the years besides South Asian, like black, Latino, and East Asian. I felt more uncomfortable in suburban white sanghas, to be honest. For example, at the Thai temple, when us laypeople encourage each other we can share our day-to-day issues involving being racial and gender minorities easily and sincerely. Not so much in white convert sanghas. A lot of people make a big deal out of ""they will never accept you as [insert ethnicity]"" but so what? I'm not Thai, I'll never be Thai, and I like being black so that's no big deal. That doesn't stop me from participating in the community.

So, basically accept that you will have to be more mindful about showing respect as an ~~American~~ white convert because it doesn't come naturally to you yet because (I'm assuming) you weren't born into it. Also, try to attend consistently for a while before you ask for more formal instruction. If you ask now and later decide the temple is not for you, you may be seen as a flake and that contributes to their experience of ~~American~~ western Buddhists being insincere.

Edit: There I go with my American bias assuming you are from America just because you're a white guy haha.

Edit 2: Realized I was implying those people at the temple aren't Americans when I meant to say I was culturally western and talking about how cultural westerners have to be respectful. I corrected what I said. American privilege strikes again!"

azoenophile,raisedbynarcissists,1389284117.0,"I experienced something very similar with my ex's family. 

I eventually went NC with all of them and left the family interactions to him. That's his family and he desperately wants to feel like the family wherein he was raised loves him. My ex bent over backward for his family members, including allowing his older brother and his family of five to move in. For a year and a half. That ended up being the last straw for me. 

Your mama bear instincts are normal. You want to protect your husband from all the hurt that you know his family inflicts. If they're not doing it now, it's bound to happen sometime soon. But make sure you're being his rock and his place of comfort, too. 

I think a large part of what caused the dissolution of my relationship was my inability to see his family as anything but a threat. His Nmom would make comments like ""if you ever have children, you'll just have to bring them to [home state] by yourself or I'll never see them, because she is not welcome in my home."" And from that point, I saw every interaction with his mom as a threat. Without issuing an ultimatum, I still wished every day that he wouldn't speak to her. Wouldn't allow her to come visit. Wouldn't drop everything because she called and wanted him home for the funeral of an estranged family member. 

Thats his family, and he wants to feel loved by them. Until he is at the point where he decides to go NC on his own, any push from you will probably be met with opposition. I wish I had recognized that earlier and been more understanding in his endless quest for love from his family. His family being nasty caused me personal anguish, but it didn't change his feelings for me. His family only caused strife in our relationship because I allowed them to do so. 

If you don't want the texts and calls and Facebook statuses, block his family from contacting you. They will always carry drama, but it's only a competition if you engage. "

you cant understand that if your view or opinion is counter to established scientific consensus on a scientific issue or claim, then you better fucking believe you have to be a qualified expert to have any weight to your opinion. however the equally uninformed and uneducated do not have to be expert in their field to accept and adopt the scientific expert consensus

it seems you rather foolishly assume the two sides of a debate such as this are equally ill informed, i might not be a medically qualified practising professor on vaccine theory my self, and lets imagine i know absolutely nothing about it (which isn't actually true), the fact that those that actually ARE qualified and knowledgeable form a consensus and agreement is not something you can ignore.

how do you not understand that your opinion can absolutely be based on others expert credentials and shared knowledge and keep its validity.


your entire comment is ridiculous.

pants_guy_,explainlikeimfive,1389284243.0,"There's a new argument that builds off that one. 

To flesh it out a little, the Western and raw material-rich states were the subject of a sort of internal Imperialism, where big banks in the Eastern US were the only ones able to lay out enough capital to invest in resource extraction, would take as much as they could and ride roughshod over the existing communities or the ones that were built solely to work for them.

These started eventually turned into the labor clashes at the turn of the last century and are the root of early 20th century Western populism-- a movement so left-wing that it would make modern European socialists blush.

The Great Depression (and the Dust Bowl, which was caused by aggressive overfarming, which in turn was caused by demands for ever-increasing demands by the Eastern banks that caused the Great Depression) helped to change the circumstances to an extent. With the New Deal, Federal projects such as power plants and new military bases meant for the West a change in bosses from Wall Street to Washington, DC.

A unionized public sector work force doing the ground work, led by highly-skilled and highly paid specialists, funded by high taxes on the Wall Street banksters who once broke strikes and murdered agitators with glee, meant a massive transfer of wealth from East to West in the United States for the first time, ever.

Westerners repaid the Federal government by electing Ronald Reagan in 1980.

For airbending, the teachers were the air bisons. Again, the power source is unknown, but some suggest it's the planet's rotation around its axis, as that is one of the sources of wind currents.

If you are deep enough to 4-bet and see a flop, the hand you 3-bet matters greatly. Something like 9Ts will flop a lot better than 28o.

Dantilli,socialskills,1389284470.0,"I agree with the random compliment thing, you should ALWAYS accept a compliment, to not accept it is actually rather insulting. This is because you're basically saying ""no, you're opinion is wrong and I refuse to acknowledge it"".

As for the ""best guitar"" thing, just reply honestly. I personally would probably give a little chuckle to show it is just a joke (and because it's such a hilariously massive exaggeration for my guitar playing...) and say something like ""well they like to think so"".

One thing I would say though is when talking to anyone, especially fans, ALWAYS be honest. It's ok to play it up a bit if you think it's fun to do that. But don't feel pressured to be a ""guitarrist"" all the time, don't be afraid to let your personality out. I have infinitely more respect for the musician that can express himself fully no matter the situation than the one that always puts up a front. This also helps you express yourself better in your music, though that's kinda hard to notice yourself. 

There are many, MANY musicians that made it big because they could express themselves well. It gives you something unique. I know you probably aren't really aiming to be big, but that just makes it even more important to be you and not just a ""guitarrist"".

Sorry if this seems uncalled for, I just feel it's very important. Hope it helps :)."

When I confronted them about it I was told if I made a fuss I'd loss my job.  Ended up talking to every employee about it who had the same thing happen to them.

Roninspoon,knifeclub,1389284735.0,"For Kitchen knives; 

* Use a scale material that won't absorb water. Like stabilized or sealed wood, or a synthetic.

* Same goes for liners.

* Use the right epoxy. They aren't all the same, and they have different properties other than color. Some handle shock better, others handle heat better, etc. Like steel, there are all kinds of opinions. Generally speaking, it seems the longer an epoxy takes to set, the longer it will last on the knife. For what it's worth, on this project I used [LockTite epoxy](http://www.loctiteproducts.com/p/epxy_qset_s/overview/Loctite-Epoxy-Quick-Set.htm), but only because it was the best option I could find at Home Depot. It would not have been my first choice.

* Choose the right steel. For instance, very high carbon blades will react with the acids in some food and both the blade and the food can get discolored.

* Balance and handle comfort are paramount in kitchen knives, especially the Chef's knife.

* Also very important for the Chef's knife, is the curve of the blade from tip to heel. It has to be straight enough towards the heel to chop flush with the board,  but curved steady enough through the tip to rock smoothly for slicing. This is especially important if you're shaping your own blade.

* Keep your handles simple but elegant, like I didn't. Making the scales from two different materials like that added complexity and errors to my process."

xadriancalim,relationships,1389284753.0,"These awful feelings aren't for THIS girl, they are coming from you.  You will undoubtedly see any meaningful relationship as a problem.  You're afraid of commitment, but that could stem from anything; abusive childhood, divorced parents, mental trauma.  Something is keeping you from being involved with people.  Strangely enough, you were together for a long time and yet when it became apparent that you were likely going to be together for longer, something flipped.

Notice how you said, ""...by being together during a time of our lives when everyone else we both knew were out living like single college people...""  I'd normally think you just aren't ready for a long term, monogamous relationship, but you were together almost 10 years.  You see your single friends has having the life you want.  It's a life free from ties, from links, from anything associating your identity with another's.

The thing is, if you don't feel like you want to date anyone for a long time, that's fine.  You don't have to.  There's no rule that says you do.  But from what you've written, you sounded pretty happy being with this girl.  Few problems, she's lovely, and you feel bad about what you did to her.  So, you have to come to terms with what's most important to you; being with this girl, or being on your own.

Find that out first.  If it turns out she shines brighter than any promise of awesome bachelorhood, then I'd try to win her back.  But you have to work on YOU first.  She's not the one rekindling anything."

And yeah - the couch really does suck - you got me there. I pretty much stick to lolpodding and eating flak if I'm couching it up. Why can't the PC be unplugged and the console be plugged into the monitor and KB&amp;M. This way you can still play at a desk.

The problem here is that we are talking about 2 different kinds of players. I was assuming that PS4 console players would play on the PS4 because their computers couldn't handle the game. You talk about a different kind of player - one who actually enjoys a gamepad."

Dismantlement,LetsTalkMusic,1389285105.0,"Unless I'm really rusty on my music theory, something being in Phyrigian mode doesn't have any bearing on its key signature or whether its diatonic, so a song could be in any major key but still be in Phrygian. In that sense I think they put a lot of the music in that mode to help achieve that dreamlike and emotionally detached quality, but without enough reversions to the Ionian, or other modes, to make the music balanced, three-dimensional, and satisfying. For that reason, songs like Brother Sport don't feel uplifting to me. Rather it sounds like they're avoiding any straightforward expression of emotion in that song. Take the hook starting with ""You're halfway to fully grown"" which they repeat a couple dozen times throughout the song. Even though the hook is in F# Major, the two most pivotal moments within it are in B Major and C# Major. This acts somewhat as a motor, providing tension that constantly wants to be resolved, but it never does become resolved. They never provide an answer to the B Maj/C# Maj diversions, whether it be through a simple final F# Maj chord or something more creative. The song is pleasant enough to listen to, but my emotional state in its closing statements is identical to that at the 4-minute mark, or the 2-minute mark. No closure, no evolution, no beginning middle and end, no narrative, and therefore no motivation for me to revisit it. It doesn't help that I don't know what the hell they're saying (I had to look up that lyric I quoted just now). 

As for the rhythms, as I said, they're certainly effective at making the music *busy* when they want to, adding layers of instruments playing their own simple rhythms, but truly interesting? Nothing stands out for me; at least, there's nothing interesting enough to offset the endlessly repeating melodic lines, which tend to wear themselves out before the song's halfway through. Seriously, ""My Girls"" isn't so different from a song like Rihanna's ""We Found Love"" which was lambasted for being too repetitive, it just replaces the pop structure with something more freeform and rambling and the predictably saccharine chord progressions with predictably uncanny chord progressions."

We have an epidemic of guys who are very competent when it comes to academics, technology, or whatever passion/career they have, but they're borderline useless in social situations.

When you have a presentation in a class, volunteer to go first. When you have a group project, take charge and organize the plan for how to go about completing it. When a girl catches your eye, introduce yourself to her, get to know her a little bit over the course of a few weeks while being flirty, playful, and fun, and if she seems receptive, ask her out within a reasonable time-frame. Stay on top of your homework so you'll be able to take advantage of any social opportunity presented to you, and make sure you're active in making social events happen too.

Streetcar drivers are also unionized...

&gt;and capacity isn't going to happen when it takes 2 buses to carry as many people as one streetcar. 

That's fine, an increase in the number of vehicles increases frequency and the streetcars also cost about six times as much to purchase.

And because they use buses right, not because they're the suburbs and have lower population and destination density?

Furthermore, the streetcars were knocked out by the ice storm while buses weren't and streetcars functionally take up two lanes of traffic. Streetcars try to bridge the gap between buses and LRT but they're pretty much the worst of both worlds.

I never asked him directly whether he's killed anyone. I can very safely assume he has, but I don't want to hear him say it. If he had come to me hurting and wanting to talk, I would've listened without passing judgment because in that position, it's something he's clearly struggling with.

The movie is saying there are no proper outlets for the feelings of boys and men in general. Consider an average male teenager. He has feelings as anyone else. He has problems at home, in his social life, at school. Where does he express and manage them? He can't go to his friends. He can't go to his parents. He can't go to a psychiatrist.

It's her responses that make me think she didn't talk to him, and she as much as said that directly in a couple of posts.

The difference in this and his masturbation being the following: He wants to have sex, she knows this, he masturbates to alleviate that. She is telling him she has no sex drive, doesn't want to have sex, and then she masturbates. In her case, yeah I think I would definitely be concerned if I was the guy.

Basically this article is about stretch-induced hyperplasia. 

The idea:

**Stretching the muscles is a do-or-die situation: either it splits or it strengthens and multiplies.**

However, it's only been proven in small birds so far, which is possibly why subreddits like /r/birdswitharms exists ;) 

Regardless, hyperplasia is real phenomenon. 

Hypertrophy refers to an increase in the size of the cel. Hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of cells or fibers. (A single muscle cell is usually called a fiber.)

Many relationships succeed because there is substance, common ground, and just a general joy for both people being around one another.  

There is no actual thing as ""out of your league.""  This is a stipulation and a bar we set for ourselves.  You can always better yourself physically, mentally, and psychologically.  But if, for some reason, some one is ""out of your league,"" it's more likely that you don't share in the same interests, cannot find common ground, etc.  

For example, pick a model, any model.  They are likely not going to date me.  Not because I'm not attractive, but because I'm not THAT attractive.  They are going to date other models or movie stars because they share in the being pampered and expensive things and having their outfits designed by the top designers in the world.

hornwalker,DebateAChristian,1389285830.0,"&gt; Reality is also how we interact with and experience all that is physical.

You are confusing our perception of reality with reality itself-two very different things.  People can experience reality differently, yes, but the experience is subjective while the reality that experience is drawing from is not(as you yourself pointed out with your color example).

There's plenty of overlap between art and science.  I would go so far as to argue that art is just a different way for us to understand the world we are in-not necessarily through the scientific method but through the intuitive creative process.  To paraphrase that quote from V for Vendetta ""art tells lies to discover the truth"".  Science tells little truth's to discover bigger truths.  Philosophy examines what *is* true.  Religion is unique in that it *claims* truth in spite of lack of evidence, and often going against what we know is true(for example, the Church fought hard against heliocentric principal for a very long time, even after it was disproven).

&gt; Religion...[is] neither right nor wrong when addressing what [it is] intended for. The are all right. They are all valid. The only exception is when they attempt to answer questions that should be answered by science

But what is it that Religion is intended for?  When you get down to it, the purpose of religion at its core is and always has been to explain that which we don't know-what happens when we die, the soul, the origins of the universe, etc.  Morality, community, culture, and all the things we associate with religion beyond the supernatural claims are secondary to those claims.

However, as we are seeing, science does this much better because it **doesn't make things up**.  Mental illness was treated in prehistoric times by cutting a hole in the person's head to let the bad spirits out.  A reasonable assumption for the time based on what they knew then, but still only that-an assumption.  Science makes no assumptions-only testable hypothesis.  


Religion claims to be inspired by God-it has set itself up to be flawless.     Someone who claims to hear the voice of god and act upon it is presumable doing that which is Divingly ordained.  Should it not then be a perfect command?  

&gt; [Religion/Culture] so for the purpose of religious debate, the two words are interchangeable.

If words have any meaning, no.  Religion is a cultural aspect, but as I've said its also a declaration of a defined reality as truth.  For the purpose of religious debate, we must recognize this important fact.  Religion says a talking snake convinced the first two humans to eat a magic fruit which upset god.  Facts show us something very different happened(evolution, there are no talking snakes, and one cannot learn anything from eating a fruit except what that fruit tastes like and whether or not it makes you sick!)

I respect peoples rights to believe whatever they want, for better or for worse.  What I don't respect is when their religious beliefs are used to justify actions which I disagree with, or when they use their religion as justification for policies that hurt society or some part of it.  "

I was thinking more in terms of fault interactions and participation in making society function.

The thing is, I don't think they actually are held to a higher standard than other victims. Because of the way we've sensationalized rape (it's often grouped with murder which is a far, far worse crime of which to be the victim) and put the focus on how someone was victimized rather than the crime having been committed, victims are much, much more visible. While what happened at Steubenville was awful, the amount of coverage on that one girl was probably a thousand times that of a victim of murder. We don't even talk about people being assaulted or mugged in the media anymore. Those people are generally subject to the same type of questions (why were you there?

unicornbomb,bettafish,1389286025.0,"Its no problem! I'm a big fan of planted tanks -- they make aquarium maintenance so much easier in the long run, IMO. They're pretty easy once you get going. Sorry if this is kind of long, I just didnt wanna leave anything out! 

**Lighting** --  You'll need a decent light for plants depending on their light needs -- I use the Aqueon modular LED with 2 daylight bulbs and 1 colormax bulb -- the stronger the light, the better color you'll get out of red/purple plants, but unless you're trying to grow really demanding plants, thats really an aesthetic thing. 

For a 5g, a desk lamp or two (depending on tank shape) fitted with a [6500k daylight bulb](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Feit-Electric-200W-Equivalent-Daylight-6500K-Spiral-CFL-Light-Bulb-ESL40TN-D/203252142#) would probably work fine -- those bulbs are easy to find at hardware stores. I'm lazy so I use a cheap christmas light timer to turn them on and off. 

You'll want 6-8 hours or so of light to start -- if you notice algae growth, cut the light time, if you don't, you can slowly increase. I do 10 hours in my tanks, but I have CO2 injection and a LOT of plants, so they out compete algae for nutrients, and any algae that does manage to grow gets eaten by my otos. 

**Substrate** -- what do you have right now? There are a ton of options -- the only substrate I think isn't ideal for plants would be really large gravel or pebbles (not porous enough to hold nutrients and a pain for establishing root systems) but even then there are plants like java fern and anubias that prefer to be tied to decor with their root systems above the substrate. Root tabs like Seachem Flourish tabs can make most any substrate workable. 

There are plant specific substrates like Ecocomplete and Flourite make things simple and can just be used straight out of the bag after a quick rinse. 

I use CaribSea Sunset Gold sand with Seachem flourish root tabs -- just push them into the substrate near the roots and replace every few months once its fully dissolved. I have a couple spots of ecocomplete under the sand where I have a lot of plants. I'm a big fan of sand -- its safe for bottom feeders like corys, snails love to dig in it, and its easy to keep clean since waste sits on top of it, vs gravel where it sinks in between pieces. 

Some people do the [Walstad method](http://www.bookmasters.com/marktplc/00388Shrimp.pdf) of rinsed organic potting soil top with sand. This method is great for plants (they'll grow like crazy) and keeps water quality awesome. I found it kind of messy, and the tannins from the soil will discolor your water for a while. Bettas like this though, since it mimics conditions in the wild. My biggest issue with it was the ridiculous mess it made everytime I wanted to move a plant or change something. Also.. soil can sometimes harbor critters like small aquatic detritus worms that feed on the organic material. Bettas enjoy hunting them and snacking on them and they're harmless, but I reeeally prefer my substrate to be worm free, lol. 

**Maintenance** -- Not much required, tbh. I trim plants every now and then if they're getting too wild. You can replant the trimming into the substrate, trade it in your LFS for credit, or sell it on /r/Aquaswap. I feed excess duckweed to my goldfish in my outdoor pond, but dont put duckweed outside otherwise -- its insanely invasive and ridiculously hardy. 

Some people do fertilizers. It is super helpful but I dont think its 100% needed. Seachem makes good ones. A daily dose of Excel can help plant growth immensely and control algae. Iron and Flourish are nice too if you decide you want to go that route. I do Excel and Iron daily, and one dose of Flourish after a water change.  The rest you probably won't need. If you have to pick one, do Excel.

When the British policing system was set up, it was in a 'policed by  consent' sort of thing, in that the police force would only be effective if the public consented to be policed. Which seems entirely obvious now, of course. 

Related to this, it can be said that there are two types of policing, ""hard"" policing and ""soft"" policing. Hard being the crime control/enforcement side of things, with the 'soft' policing as being involved in the community (which also helps with crime prevention).

Both should considered equally important for an effective police force.

Then the connection being that Australia, for somewhat obvious reasons, *almost* entirely basis it's police system from that of England.

It is kind of a heavy system for kids new to gaming, though, as far as rules are concerned.  This made it difficult for them to run their own games.  Fixed this by getting them the Pathfinder Beginner Box.  It has everything they need, and greatly simplified the rule set.  It also has materials for teaching the kids everything they need to know.  Since the Beginner Box rules are a subset of the core rules, they will have no problem graduating to the wider rule set."

Canuck147,TwoXChromosomes,1389286321.0,"Spoilers - I'm male. Keep that in mind for context.

I think by the standards imposed by this author I would be described as pro-feminist rather than feminist myself. I've seen this argument made by my feminist friends a couple of times and I can respect it - but I'm not sure I agree with it.

I think the attitude of 'feminism doesn't need male allies' is a little self-defeating. In many aspects the treatment of women is inescapably linked with the treatment of men.

A prime example is women in the work place. There have been countless articles describing the challenges women face in trying to raise a family and work at the same time. Young women are expected to take maternity leave plus substantial time off for children's sick days, doctor's appointments, and the general stress and frustration of raising a child. This expectation, which does have some basis in reality, encourages businesses to discriminate against women from a practical standpoint. 

The only real way to eliminate this type of discrimination is for men and women to more equally share the burden of raising children. Countries like Sweden have made strides towards this by mandating that some percentage of 'parental leave' is only available to fathers. This has encouraged men to take more time off with their children, but more importantly it has set a precedent that 'men take time off to raise children' and businesses are adapting to that new expectation.

My point in all of this is simply that in order to make the work place a better place for women, it is necessary to simultaneously encourage men to spend more time raising their children *and* make it more socially acceptable for men to do so.

Saying that 'feminism doesn't need men' seems sort of analogous to saying that 'businesses don't need women'. I'm sure both could be successful catering to one gender, but I'm also sure that both would be stronger by being more inclusive."

ThePrevailer,explainlikeimfive,1389286340.0,"General Tips from someone who's seen lots of people fail. If you're going to be serious about it and are actually trying to make money investing:

Diversify: Don't just buy $10,000 of one thing and let it ride. Spread it out. Don't put all your eggs in one basic. Get exposure in different industries. 

Pick something you're comfortable with. Look at some stable companies that aren't in trouble in the news. Look at their financials, check out morningstar or whatever if you want. Pick something you're willing to hold for the long term.

Don't try and 'play the market.' You can't/won't win. If you try and time the market with news and rumors, you'll lose. By the time you hear about it, the people with big money who actually influence the price have already acted on it. 

Fill your portfolio with stocks/mutual funds and sit on your hands. Look at it once in a while, and wave. Keep an eye on it, but don't poke it all the time. The market goes up, and it goes down. It'll go down a couple times a decade and once or twice it'll go down big. Ride it out.

Use your head, not your heart. The biggest problem I've seen is people ""liking"" stocks/companies. They let their opinion of the company influence how they value the shares.

No, it doesn't have to come back up. Sometimes, it's time to cut your losses. If something's down x% and you decide it my be time to sell, make a decision and go with it. My very first interaction when I got into the business was helping someone pay a transfer agent $50 to remove a worthless stock from their IRA. They put their entire retirement into this one stock and rode it all the way to bankruptcy. ""I figured it had to come back up sooner or later."" It doesn't. If a stock is a dog, it's a dog."
ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389286340.0,"I don't think that people should masturbate as much as they like, because the people at /r/nofap have a good point - you can become addicted to porn and masturbation. This will cause you to desire sex as often, which isn't always a bad thing but can be if you're in a relationship with a partner that wants to have sex often.

On top of this, I think that drive from testosterone is an important motivator for getting men out there to get a partner. If you don't have that sexual urge to meet someone, you become complacent in your desire to find a partner - which isn't inherently a bad thing but is counter-productive if you're looking to meet someone.

Lastly, orgasms are an important thing to have for sure. They relieve stress, can act as a natural sleep inducer, boosts immune health - but you can get this through sex as well. Now, I acknowledge that everyone needs a little ""me"" time, but if you're deriving all of your orgasms through masturbation then you're depriving yourself of an important aspect of existence - sex with another individual that goes above and beyond masturbation in so many ways.

If she's your best friend hopefully she'll understand why you need to create some distance, my friend was really undestanding about it but I can't speak for everyone. If you do this though, make sure you completely move on before making contact again, I've just made the mistake of talking to them before I was ready.

It's fucking hard, believe me. She'll be on your mind constantly but it will eventually start to fade. You may lose some of your friendship in the process but it's an important step to make. And since you are such good friends already, it can be possible to build that friendship back up again if you play your cards right. 

Unfortunately, it's impossible to choose who you develop feelings for, it's just a part of life.

42420,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1389286708.0,"We agree I think on many aspects of this discussion. My point is that if you accept that rock music is not limited by a conventional time signature, then you should also agree that EDM is not limited by the same convention. 

Similarly, if you agree that sonatas (form or not) are not limited by their conventional tempo structure (adagio-allegro-adagio), then you should also agree that dance is not limited by similiar tempo conventions.

Other limiting factors come in to play. As you say, a form convention based around modulation makes it more richly variable than music that stays in the same key. I could equally argue that a tonal convention based on minute manipulations of a sound over time makes it more richly variable than music that is restricted to a single group of instruments with defined tonal qualities. 

I'd say that the argument is much more complex than we think, and we can't use the limitations of individual conventions to criticise the limitations of an entire style of music."

razzertto,TwoXChromosomes,1389286751.0,"Can I ask if this is a venue problem maybe? What I mean is that I seem to read about OK Cupid being a cesspool of trolls, creepers, and stalkers on a regular basis. I'm sure there are some good people on there but I wonder if switching to a more traditional paid site works out better? I met my husband on eHarmony several years ago. I encountered only one or two trolls, tops. Most of the guys were pretty sincere and we had very nice interactions even if we didn't end up on dates. 

I know (now) that eHarmony has these weird christian origins but I met many non-religious men on there because I filled that out in my preferences. I don't know what the fee structure of Ok Cupid is but I get the impression that it's free-ish? eHarmony was kind of expensive but it keeps trolls from sending you dick pics and abusive messages because of how it's structured. It's not a site for hookups. 

That's not to say that you can't meet trolls anywhere, but by it's nature OK Cupid seems to be full of them. I wouldn't last ten minutes on a site like that. Maybe the other dating sites might have fewer choices but better ones? I don't know, maybe not; it's just something to think about. "

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389286955.0,"You'd need to eliminate social security and all that stuff...only thing I'd keep is healthcare since funnelling that money into UBI would likely produce less efficient results than simply covering everyone. 

Also, if you actually recommend a $25k UBI a year...sorry, but you're insane. A more realistic amount would be in the $10-15k area. 

http://jsfiddle.net/3bYTJ/11/

What you do is eliminate social security ($800 billion), medicare/aid ($750 billion), welfare ($400 billion), and trim defense and other stuff a bit ($200 billion). 

With a 3.45 trillion government budget, that brings us down to $1.3 trillion. 

We then introduce universal healthcare...the costs of this are tricky, but if it really does cut costs like other countries where we only need to spend $3000 per citizen, it would only cost about a trillion....although it might cost a bit more due to unforeseen costs. I use the number $1.3 trillion or so for the sake of calculations, although it could be less, could be more.

http://jsfiddle.net/3bYTJ/11/

Using that calculator to calculate for $2.6 trillion in other government expenses, and calculating a basic income for 230 million people, it would take a flat tax of 32-40% on ALL income and corporations to pay for UBI, depending on the amount. Maybe a bit more if we run into loopholes that can't be closed and other inefficiencies, but even if we end up spending $3 trillion, we'd only need a 42% rate as opposed to 40%. So really, I can't see the real rate exceeding 45-50% in the worst case scenario (at which point we can scale back the benefit a little to lower the rates).

Yes, this would cost trillions of dollars, but yes, it would be worth it. And let's face it, the money's gonna go right back into the economy in terms of consumption. "

First off, she'll need to be in a 36 band for the most part.  For some of the tighter bands she may find a 38 to be more comfortable, but I doubt it - the larger the band size, the more they stretch.

The difference between the snug underbust and the three bust measurements are 6"", 9.5"" or 10.5"", and 7"".  Those four differences work out to be the following cup sizes: E (6""), G or GG (9.5""), GG or H (10.5""), and F (7"").  I can tell you now that it's not going to be the smallest ones.

Like I said, I'm not very experienced in this range, but if you made me pinpoint a starting size, it'd be somewhere around 36G/GG.  No, that may not be exactly correct, but it *will* put you in the correct ballpark.  So if she gets fitted and the fitter says something like 40C, you know that they're not fitting her correctly.  If they offer a band size of anything larger than 38 or a cup size of anything smaller than F, then disregard their fitting method."

He also said they're all trained to be very fast Smeargles and they always go first and put his entire team to sleep, then they have 3-5 turns to do whatever they want which is enough turns to decide the game.

However Smeargle, as I said, are really weak. Even if you teach them OP moves they're easily one shot. Just use a priority move like Quick Attack (lets you go first) and it doesn't matter how fast they are... they're gonna die in one attack. There are worse things to worry about IMO on wifi."

He was at the age where his wanted to start settling down, where I still wanted to enjoy my youth and achieve things. I felt really immature in comparison to him because of that. I knew I was going to change a lot as I aged, and I certainly did. Just two years later, my morals and priorities have changed so much. I'm slowly transitioning from a carefree teenager to an adult (albeit still a little carefree).

When we split up, I realized how awful things were. He would always tell me I was too young to understand certain things, and I was too young to know what I want (I never wanted kids and that still stands to this day). I feel as though the things he said to me carried over into my current relationship and I have a bit of an inferiority complex now.

Also, why would they raise prices when to do so would mean people would shop elsewhere? Look, why don't you read the /r/basicincome faq? They have a pretty decent explanation of this.

Also, if you look at the wikipedia page...some products actually have NEGATIVE income elasticity of demand. As money goes up, demand for some products goes DOWN. So there will always be some cheap product people can buy. 

Also, once again, keep in mind...competition....some shelter will go up, but some will need to remain cheap to attact people at all. Some good will go up, but some will remain cheap to attract people.

To think everyone will just raise prices on everything, if anything, is naive.

Also, would it really distort the market more than, say, welfare?

It's been really interesting to learn about, though I'm not sure how in-demand and high-value therapy work is. I want to do something that's useful to people, not just jam myself into a saturated labor market.

The other thing is I've started to address some of my sexual insecurities, which I've managed to keep buried for a while, first through porn, and then through quitting it. If that makes sense. I'm having a hard time coming to terms with my lack of sexual experiences, including being a virgin. The few times women have asked to have sex with me, I either said no out of fear or couldn't get an erection. I don't think about it all the time, but it does weigh on me. All my friends seem to have no trouble both getting girls and having sex with them.

edit: Oh, I want to get my thoughts down about Valhalla Challenge. First, I think our big-picture priorities should be:

1. Successfully helping men and women permanently stop using porn through accountability and measurement.
1. Creating a safe place for men and women to discuss issues in their road to recovery, anonymously and honestly.
1. Building a community of health-minded men and women for mutual support, acceptance, and help when things get tough.

We're doing a *pretty* good job of those things already. It might make sense to have an FAQ in the sidebar with trouble-shooting tips or add a more visible accountability mechanism than looking through a long list, but those things are secondary."

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1389287143.0,"&gt;Do you think that the rise of feminism and the eroding of a man’s social and economic sphere are responsible for the conflict between genders?

No, because conflict between genders existed before the rise of feminism.

&gt;I know almost nothing about feminism besides what a woman’s lit class has taught me and it seems to me that whenever someone brings up the word feminist it automatically sets men against women.

[Why men are afraid of feminism](http://www.michaelkaufman.com/2012/why-are-some-men-still-afraid-of-feminism/).

&gt;Now I know this is in part because men lump feminism with misandry but couldn’t it also be that women are partly responsible for the negative connotations associated with feminism.

I don't think men or women are in cahoots to do either of these things. For example, I am a man, I am a feminist and I do not associate it with misandry.

&gt;I simply say this because feminism seems (at least in my opinion) to focus on women and their needs at the expense of men rather than focusing on the fact that they are human being who deserve respect regardless of gender.

Feminism does not support women's rights at the expense of men's rights. Certainly at the expense of men's privileges, but to abolish privilege would be to establish equality.

&gt;Furthermore even the terms used in feminism seem somewhat hostile towards men; I absolutely hate the word male patriarchy as it focuses all the blame on men because I’m sure women have upheld the power structure and even encouraged it at some points. 

The word is just ""patriarchy"", just so you are aware, and it doesn't focus all of the blame on all men. You have a misunderstanding of the word. A patriarchy is a social establishment where men are favored institutionally within society through cultural, societal, and legal precedent. 

[Definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy)

Also, feminism recognizes, for the most part, that women have participated in the perpetuation of patriarchy. However, women are nevertheless victims of the system itself first, and participants second. Often, they are participants due to their victimhood to the system.

&gt;So please enlighten me I’d love to learn how women view this.

How about ""how *feminists* view this"", because this is ""askfeminists"" not ""askwomen"" and not all feminists are women."

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1389287584.0,"&gt;  including all of our large family and friend base while also covering the cost and actually being able to properly socialize with guests during the reception

If you figure out how to have a large party and still socialize with all of your guests, let me know.  Even my 50-60 person house parties end up with me saying ""Greg was here?  I didn't even see him!""

As for saving money by having a small ceremony (lets say family only), and then a large reception, I don't think you'll see much on savings.  The ceremony isn't the expensive part of the venue.  For example, my wedding space costs $2600, $300 of that is the chapel for the ceremony, and the rest is for the building on the same site we're using for the reception.  The chapel seats 170; the reception depot seats 100.  Since it's uncouth to invite someone to the ceremony and not the reception, I'm limited by my reception space size, not the chapel size.

I'm sure you situation is very different from mine, since we're going fairly traditional (everyone is invited to the ""wedding,"" not the ceremony or the reception).  If you want to have a ton of people and save money, I'd recommend looking for a non-traditional space (such as a tent in a park, versus a large building that seats 200+ regularly and they know that they're worth a lot of money), and going for a buffet of less expensive food (like BBQ or Italian).  Food costs will be the biggest thing with so many guests, though you'll also just want a space that accommodates that many bodies."

I wouldn't recommend trying them only on period sex days because it takes a few tries to understand the direction of your vag canal and get a softcup situated the right way. Once you're able to wear it with no leaks (took me 1 or 2 days to get it right). Beyond sexy times, I love it as well. I feel fresher than pads and freer than tampons. :) Also, if you're in the US, they sell them at CVS and Walgreens so maybe that'll save you some money on shipping. They are in the same aisle as the tampons, but usually hiding on the very bottom or very top shelf.

Best of luck! 

edit: Forgot to answer the second part of the question.

The ""MOD-629"" is the model number - Model 629 (with no ""dash number"", it means the gun is a 629 no-dash - the initial variant of the gun; later ones were the 629-1, 629-2, etc. until the current 629-6). The initial ""6"" in the model number indicates that the gun is stainless steel.

His website probably has a lot of people to deal with--try having the population of Reddit all asking you questions, and see if you can answer them all on an individual level. AMAs get a few thousand questions, but only about a hundred are ever answered.

Attacking those with an agenda against the government has been ongoing since the inception of the current form of US government. You'd do better in this comparison if you were able to provide McCarthy-levels of hysteria perpetuated by the President himself. As it so happens that is not the case, and to the government it probably just looks like a case of domestic terrorism.

The NSA's been active since before Obama was ever in power, let alone President. It's just under a lot more scrutiny today, when it should have been under scrutiny when Bush passed the Patriot Acts.

I live 5 minutes from a Res and it's the scene of either abject poverty or extreme wealth based entirely upon the whims of their tribal chiefs.

IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,bodybuilding,1389287809.0,"The most important thing to consider is the long-term consequences this will have on his body's natural hormone production. There is a good possibility that using exogenous hormones now could impact is ability to produce natural testosterone down the road. 

Does he want to be 19 or 20 and have low test? Does he want to have to struggle to get testosterone replacement therapy at such a young age? If he isn't eligible for TRT, does he have the income to continue using steroids for the rest of his life? These are things he needs to consider. 

16 years old is not the time to mess with the body's natural hormone production. If he eats right, trains hard, and sleeps enough, he'll grow. He's in the prime natural bodybuilding years of his life right now.

To give you a little background on steroids in general: Most steroid cycles consist of just injectable testosterone *or* injectable testosterone plus some other compound. In either case, his testicles will cease to produce testosterone while he is on cycle. When he comes off cycle, he will have to kickstart his natural testosterone production with post-cycle therapy drugs (PCT). 

However, this is not a foolproof process and things don't often go as planned. There is a good chance of side effects during the cycle, and these vary from person to person. There can be complications. He could get bad gear (because I assume he isn't getting it from a doctor). Does he have the money to afford steroids, pinning equipment, and the necessary ancillaries in the first place? Is he prepared for a worst-case scenario in which he has to cut his cycle short? I'm going to guess that the answers are no, no, and no.

The fact is that *he* doesn't know anything about it. I guarantee he hasn't done enough research. This is real biochemistry, and it involves *him* as a guinea pig. He's got plenty of natural potential right now. If he's concerned that his test is low (hint: it's not), tell him to eat more eggs and sleep more.

Check /r/steroids if you want more info. They're very helpful over there."

People sort of look at being a follower as a bad thing. Everyone wants to be the leader, and if they can't they try to dismantle the leader's power. 

Anyway's, I'm going off topic. The point is Bure is just saying that she's a follower of her husband's leadership. WTF is wrong with that? Every single social encounter you witness has a hieriarchy. Whether or not you want to admit it, it does. Bure, admitting that her husband is at the top of that dynamic, is not a bad person for doing so. It's absolutely nuts how fucking pathetic this society is. Everyone wants to just pretend everyone is perfect and special, all regarded as the best person alive. No, the truth is, no one is. People are muddled and riddled with pros and cons. Stop trying to push this bs, ""everyone is perfect"" crap. "

WalterFStarbuck,AskEngineers,1389287973.0,"With regard to your first point, variable geometry inlets and shock traps tend to be used to control the Mach number at the compressor face. You certainly don't want any shocks making it that far. I'm not exactly sure how the F-22 and F-35 have handled the same problem, but I suspect it has to do with the geometry of the S-ducts which other aircraft like the F-15 and SR-71 did not have.

Your second point is dead on. The major problem in an engine design is off-design performance. There are so many components and the flow properties can change so quickly that extensive prediction, modeling, and testing must be done to make sure there are no aerodynamic and structural vibration modes and that you always have enough stall margin over a really wide range of flight conditions. 

The afterburner is fuel-inefficient but it's a really easy solution to what could be a really nasty problem. Something people tend to forget about aerospace propulsion is that throttling an engine is really hard. This goes double for rockets. It was a big deal that the Lunar Lander's descent stage had to have a wide throttle range for pilot control. Before then rockets were largely on/off and even after, most rockets have a pretty narrow throttle range. 

Turbine engines are easier to throttle, but there is a lot of aerodynamic, structural, combustion, and heat transfer analysis that has to be done to make sure the compressor won't stall and the turbine won't melt away. The fact that we can push the limits of turbine engine efficiency to the point of supersonic flight without an afterburner is a testament to modeling tools and testing as well as minimizing thrust-required (read: drag) at transonic Mach numbers."

dunnoyabassa,relationship_advice,1389288001.0,"i'd recommend the following:

try to figure out WHY she's so ring hungry right now (hopefully a conversation the two of you can have outright).  what is her reasoning for wanting to get engaged?  

it sounds like she's ready to make some kind of significant life shift, but her hope is to have you do it with her.  does she want to move, or seek jobs/schooling in a new location?  is she interested in having kids soon (seems awfully young for this, but it happens)?  

the point is to discuss and figure out what her goals are... what would the two of you getting engaged accomplish in her mind?

if it's something concrete and reasonable she wants, like a desire to relocate, a desire to live together, a desire for children... well nobody's saying you asked for this, but your girlfriend has your relationship on the table.  you need to explore whether or not you can help her with these specific desires, and if you feel you can you need to establish a concrete timeframe that you intend to work with.  if you feel you cannot help her attain what she wants in the foreseeable future: BE HONEST.  Explain that you do NOT intend to relocate, live together, have kids, etc. and if she does not accept this the choice to stay with you is her own.

if it is not something concrete or reasonable that she wants (as in ""all my friends are getting married, i feel left out, i want a wedding, if you really loved me you'd marry me, big shiny rock to hashtag on instagram, "") she is being a child.  Explain that you are not going to risk your relationship by making a choice you're not ready to make just because of pinterest, again if she has a problem with this, she is free to find someone who will.

the fact of the matter is your girlfriend hasn't given you an ultimatum, but she needs to understand that she also can't control your behavior and should not delude herself into thinking she can.  if she is ready for the next era of her life, make it clear that she has EVERY RIGHT TO BE, but YOU ALSO HAVE EVERY RIGHT NOT TO BE.  It is selfish of her to demand you sacrifice your own needs to fix her circumstances for her.  She has no obligation to wait for you to be ready when you may never be, but you have no obligation to be ready just because she wants you to be."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389288029.0,"I'm sure she'll answer herself, but I wanted to give a guy's perspective as well.  I see where she's coming from, and while I used to not agree, I'm starting to more now.

&gt;Many men might be thinking the exact same thing. So if everyone applied that logic, nobody would approach anyone else.

Maybe, but men typically do the approaching, or are at least expected to.  I'm not saying that's how it should be, but that's how it typically is.  When I go out, I expect that I'm probably going to have to approach someone if I want a date.

&gt;Guess what, if a man does that the woman won't ask for his number either most of the time. 

And they should, and some do, but in reality, that's not how things work.  Usually, if the guy is all over the girl and the girl is interested, she will flirt back, and the guy asks for her number.  

&gt;You're simply playing it safe and avoiding outright rejection.

If you've been reading our conversation and what she actually said, she might as well be humping the guy with how forward she's being.  I've been on the receiving end, and when it's *that* obvious, if you don't ask her out (assuming you're interested), you're just being a moron.  She's basically *screaming* ""I'm interested!"" so if you do nothing, it might as well be rejection.  I said in my other post that I have been rejected in that instance, but still, it was a complete anomaly, and I'd still make that call every time because nearly every single time it's the right call.

&gt;Guys go through the exact same things you listed. 

Have you ever hung out with girls?  I mean, not just in a relationship, but just been around friends, especially if they're getting ready for a night out?  Speaking from my experience, we absolutely *do not* go through the same thing.  There's a reason guys get ready in 20 minutes and girls get ready in an hour+.  I've seen girls go through multiple outfits before choosing the right one.  I've pretty much never seen a guy do this, even ones that are super into clothes and their appearance, it just rarely happens.  

&gt;It's still the guy who has to take the risk.

The girls take risk, too by putting themselves out there.  Ever flirt with a friend and then she says something like ""you're the best, you're like a brother to me!""  It feels like rejection, even though you never asked her out.  But in the end, some girls really are super obvious, and in that respect, she's right - just ask, and 9/10 times you won't get rejected.  I understand there are exceptions as I pointed them out in my other posts, but sometimes it really is blatantly obvious.

&gt;Yes you do. Because you don't get rejected.

Actually, they are getting rejected, and I was the one to originally point this out.  Here's what I said:

&gt;I've been rejected, and it's really not bad at all. Some people might say it's different due to the actual confrontation, but to me at least, it didn't add anything. It was the same ""oh, she's not interested, move on.""

Like I said, the ""you're like a brother!"" is the same to me as ""no, I'm not interested.""  I felt nothing different at all.  If you're all over someone and they show no interest at all, you've been rejected, and it sucks.  Happens to both genders.  

&gt; If there wasn't a difference you wouldn't have a problem taking the active role and actively asking a guy out.

Except that's not usually how things work.  Girls expect that if a guy is interested, he'll ask her out.  We have different jobs.  You may not like it, but that's how it is.  Maybe it'll change someday, but most girls wait to get asked out because that's the way they've learned to go about things - just like we learned that if we want a girl, we gotta ask her out.  We can't wait, because it likely won't happen.  

&gt;No, they don't. Just like a girl won't ask a guy out or make a move if she wants him. 

You're really fooling yourself here.  They aren't the same thing at all.  If you think they are, then you really are just kidding yourself.  You're trying to argue based on your ideals instead of reality.  

&gt;Guy face the exact same problems, dilemas and conflicting expactations. It's not something that is exclusive to women.

Some of those things aren't exclusive to women, I agree, but I still think they do have more that they're responsible for when it comes to appearance, or at least more that they feel they're responsible for.  There is *so much* societal pressure that's put on women, and guys don't really get that at all.  Be presentable (nice clothes), well groomed, and don't smell bad.  Beyond that, have some confidence and you're golden.  Hell, when I was in college, I remember going to the club and going up to some girls and dancing.  They give me this look like ""really?"" (I wasn't really surprised, I was pretty overweight at the time and didn't dress super nicely), and I just kept going anyway, and boom, my confidence now has 3 girls grinding on me.  Seriously easy.  And you know who I would approach?  The hottest girls I could find that were wearing pretty revealing or tight clothing.    "

WinterCharm,apple,1389288108.0,"**Carbon Fiber**

This is insanely general. To give you an idea of how general it is... 

&gt;Carbon fiber starts as very, very thin strands of fiber that are finer than a human hair.  These strands are twisted together like yarn (called a tow) and woven into carbon fiber fabric which typically comes in 3k, 6k and 12k weights. A 3k fabric has 3,000 strands of carbon in each tow while a heavier weight 6k fabric has 6,000 strands per tow.

&gt;Carbon fiber fabric comes in a variety of weaves that have different strength properties. The most common are plain weave, harness satin weave, twill weave and unidirectional.

&gt;Weave is critical for two reasons – appearance and functionality. Each weave looks very different and sometimes people prefer the look of a certain weave for a specific application. Also, weave impacts product strength. A unidirectional weave creates a carbon fiber sheet that’s very strong in the direction of the fibers, but weak in the opposite direction. Plain and twill weaves, on the other hand, have more uniform strength since they’re strongest at the points where the fibers cross in either direction.

The quotes above are the courtesy of ProTech Composites - a company that sells carbon fiber.

in addition, the actual carbon fibers are soft and flexible - they are sealed by some sort of adhesive, and the types of adhesive you use can change the properties of the ""plates"" of carbon fiber that you make.

Finally, they are hard to work into complex shapes - most carbon fiber cases/casings are thin flat sheets, not complex 3D unibody-like shapes. 

However, complex shapes *are* possible with carbon fiber. Things like: [These knives](http://store.carbonfibergear.com/escort-carbon-fiber-dagger-bundle) - although they have a lot of trouble holding a sharp edge :/ and you can't traditionally sharpen them (so I wouldn't waste your money). 

generally, Carbon fibers are: 

1. Expensive - especially if making complex shapes. this is really its biggest disadvantage
2. Very light and very strong
3. transparent to most wireless signals - it doesn't block them like Magnesium alloys would.
4. very rigid. It doesn't dent, and will rarely crack...
5. decent thermal conductors. Better than most plastic, not as good as aluminum or Mg alloys. 
6. if pushed way beyond limits, it will *shatter*. ex: when it’s compressed, pushed beyond its strength capabilities or exposed to high impact. It will crack if hit by a hammer.  Machining and holes can also create weak areas that may increase its likelihood of breaking. This doesn't happen often (the shits's really strong), but when it fails, like glass, it fails catastrophically. :/

* 2) The descriptor ""loud"" on my part was incorrectly used as ""loud"" is relative. What you say is loud may be quiet to others. If someone is 100 yards away and shouting you will probably hear nothing and say it is quiet.
If you hold what you deem a ""loud"" headphone at arms length it is quieter even though when held closely you said it was loud.

Brightt,relationship_advice,1389288189.0,"Something I forgot to mention in my first post by the way, is that we've been together for almost 5 years now, so it's been working for a while. The last time we had a big fight about it was about a year and a half ago, which was when we almost broke up over it. The reason we did was because she kept insisting I smoke too much pot, which I said I didn't. Especially when compared to some of my friends who do it every day, while I basically only do it when with those friends.

Anyway, to answer your post. Well, I don't usually have to reassure her about it. She gets plenty of attention and affection, and I spend most of my time with her, seeing how we sort of live together. She used to think I valued it over her some times, but that was in the past. I can assure you though, your SO sounds like a responsible person and you shouldn't be worried that he the drugs come before you. As long as he's not neglecting you or his responsibilities, there really isn't something worry about. Responsible drug use is nothing to be afraid of or to shun, and to be honest, it can be a really nice way to relax.

She's been with me while I was high and she wasn't quite a few times. It depends on her mood usually. Sometimes she doesn't like it, sometimes she doesn't mind, sometimes she partakes etc. But I guess you're talking about the other drugs, and not pot, seeing how he usually smokes around you..

When I first started doing hallucinogenics, it was mainly shrooms. And the first couple of times, I used to run away from my friends and usually ended up going to my SO because I felt safe with her. So, I actually was at her house once while tripping, and I once stayed over at her dorm (where we sort of live together) when another friend was staying over. She wasn't overly happy with it at first, but I become really, *really* emotional when I'm on drugs (be it alcohol, weed, shrooms, LSD, whatever). So both times she just took care of me and held me close and that stuff, which was actually the best way to deal with it. If you're ever in the situation that your SO comes to you while under LSD/shrooms/the like, simply hold him close and snuggle with him, and you'll rock his world, trust me. He'll love you for doing it.

That was a couple of years and a lot of trips ago though, and since I've done it enough times to deal with it properly now, I'm usually not as clingy as I used to be. Recently when I did shrooms with 2 friends at my house, she came by, and she didn't really mind, because she didn't even notice I was tripping. If your SO is experienced, you'll barely even notice he's on drugs, normally. By now she's accepted my occasional drug use, so she was actually really nice to have around, because I could hug her (and bury my face in her boobs, which feels *amazing* while you're tripping) and love her and all that. So, it was nice to have her around that time. And she had a great time laughing with my friends who were doing it for the first time and were having their minds blown.

I dunno, the best way to deal with it for you, honestly, is just to be open minded and don't bother about it. Your SO sounds responsible enough, and I would let him have his fun. And a pro tip, whenever he's doing one of the harder drugs, just be there for him, hug him, kiss him, hold him close etc. He'll absolutely love you for it. "

teuast,HalfLife,1389288424.0,"It actually is an issue in all forms of gaming. In really classic board games and stuff, it's pretty much intrinsically balanced because each player is exactly the same, and everything that is unbalanced is unbalanced in the same way. In modern MP games, on the other hand, it's a much bigger deal because of the variety of characters. F'rinstance, back in the early days of the TF2 Equalizer, shit was broken as fuck, one guy at low health with an Equalizer could take down an entire squad of enemy players by himself if he got even the slightest jump on them. In SP games, meanwhile, it's not *quite* as big of a deal, because you're fighting AI, but it's still something designers have to think about. Look at the Strider between HL2 and HL2EP2: they changed the way it worked so that it wouldn't completely rape you on the final battle, because I guarantee you, if you were fighting 12 HL2 Striders on that arena, that's pretty much what would happen. That's only the first example that came to mind, but every enemy in every game gets a lot of thought put into balancing it.

Hitler didn't seduce a nation. He seduced a small core of rabid followers who represented a small but very loud minority in Germany. As for how he wound up in control of Germany, the country's ruling class handed over the reins of power to him, because he was seen as a business- and aristocracy-friendly alternative to the socialists and communists.

German big business, the German aristocracy, and -- most importantly -- the Germany military all went along with Hitler because in terms of economic and military policy, he was doing what they wanted.  

We really need to correct the ""Hitler took over Germany"" meme. He was **given control** of the government by the ruling class in order to clamp down on the angry unemployed masses. "

Internet feminism means:

*  Finding meaningless bullshit to complain about in the context of a relatively comfortable first-world/middle-class life.

Gh0stP1rate,magicTCG,1389289165.0,"I guess I don't understand why magic cards need to have high values.  Wizards doesn't participate in any secondary market sales, so they are making $4 per rare sold (the cost of a booster), minus LGS profits and other overhead.  There is no reason a secondary market has to exist at all - the investors would suffer, but the players would benefit.  

Very few products are sold in an unknown package.  If I buy music, I don't buy a random mix tape in my genre and hope for the song I want.  I pay $0.99 and I buy that song.  When I buy books, food, houses, cars, phone apps - I always buy exactly what I want, and I know what I'm getting.  Can anyone help explain to me the benefits of a randomized sale model over direct sales? Focus on the impact on players instead of middlemen (the LGS and investors/collectors). 

Would players suffer if Wizards offered an on-demand printing service, selling any rare from any set (including P9) at $4 each from their website? Now the entry fee to any tournament is only ~$300, for an all-rare deck+sideboard. Casual players like me would suffer (I like my dollar rare bin), but the formats would be opened to players who previously could not afford it.  I would seek out and play in legacy and vintage, for example. 

What are /r/magicTCG's thoughts?"

Why the hell would you group together secular countries ( i.e countries that are not governed by Sharia law therefore not "" Muslim countries "" ) and countries that are governed by Sharia law that mandate women to cover up and put them all under an umbrella of "" Muslim countries? While majority of the population may be Muslim in the examples of countries given the acceptance of more modern clothing is going to be vastly different in a country that is secular than a country that is dictated by its government about how their women dress. 

Speaking of Turkey in general ( I am from there) I have lived in Ankara, Istanbul, Antalya, Diyarbakir, Adana, and as a teen who had spent her life majority in America, in all those places I dressed just like I do in Florida. I wore everything from mini skirts to backless dresses and no one ever batted an eye. Now would I go to Uskidar wearing a mini skirt and a top that showed maximum cleavage? Probably not as it is a more conservative area. But no one is going to tell you what the hell to wear or badger you for wearing it. Yeah you may get a couple cat calls but I get that here in America also. 

I've seen more skin on the beaches of Antalya and Izmir than I have in Florida. You wanna talk about micro bikinis, thong bottoms.

It's funny, the way blood feels as it slides between your fingers and runs thin tracks along your forearm, causing you to wonder if it'll slip under your sleeve and ruin that favorite shirt of yours you can't admit you wear too often. Still, despite the anxieties you're able to conjure up, you watch the blood take a 90 degree turn and drip to the carpet, the hardwood floors, and the linoleum as you race to the bathroom and submerge yourself in the steaming water of the shower. It would only take a few minutes to clean the stickiness and crust from your prickly skin, but the heat pouring over you has you feeling a little better about the whole situation, so you stay longer - long enough to forget about why you're there, except to wash away the feeling of forbidden pleasure. What would they say? What could they say? Probably that you did it with the best intentions - *It had to be in self defense. No doubt about it. They were always really nice, especially to me.* Little do they know that that little voice in your head, the one stirring up your gut when you're sure you're in control, is the same voice that cries whenever they're around, ""Just do it.

I live in a metro area, so there are a TON of bridal stores to choose from.  I didn't want to get bogged down at the more expensive stores, so I went to David's Bridal, Terry Costa, and Alfred Angelo (three stores known for having selections for lower budgets).  I also went to a small boutique that I had visited previously with my BFFs when they were getting married.

I was straightforward about my budget, which was ""$500 to $600, including alterations.""  The attendents I worked with were sure to find me dresses that wouldn't need a lot of altering, or that were well below $600, so I had wiggle room for altering.  I'm almost 6', so I found that most of the dresses I liked would have to be ordered in a ""long,"" meaning it was about $50 more expensive (for the extra fabric, I assume), but that's wasn't a budget buster.

I ended up buying a dress at the local boutique, since it didn't need much altering (it was long enough!  Just too big), and it was under my budget.  I had tried it on once, and made a second appointment to try it on again when my BMs were with me, and was determined to buy it ONLY if they offered me a deal (I'm frugal to the max).  They gave me an extra discount because it was their ""pre-black Friday"" sale when they were trying to get rid of older samples to make more room, so I ended up paying about $300.

I haven't had it altered yet (to make it smaller), but I'm sure those alterations will not be more than $200."

My point is that, at least *I think* sport bikes generally have higher performance components, like brakes, to keep you safe. Don't hate me if your cruiser has amazing brakes, it has just been my experience from the bikes I have ridden.

""According to the NAS, the effects of marijuana on blood pressure are complex, depending on dose, administration, and posture. Marijuana often produces a temporary, moderate increase in blood pressure immediately after ingestion; however, heavy chronic doses may slightly depress blood pressure instead. One common reaction is to cause decreased blood pressure while standing and increased blood pressure while lying down, causing people to faint if they stand up too quickly. There is no evidence that pot use causes persisting hypertension or heart disease; some users even claim that it helps them control hypertension by reducing stress. One thing THC does do is to increase pulse rates for about an hour. This is not generally harmful, since exercise does the same thing, but it may cause problems to people with pre-existing heart disease. Chronic users may develop a tolerance to this and other cardiovascular reactions.""

what_the_whale,MakeupAddiction,1389289689.0,"&gt; No, you would not be hurting someone by saying you ""murdered"" a test because people who have been murdered generally aren't alive anymore to get hurt by it. 

You can't be serious. That's why you think there's no ""murder culture"" -- because dead people don't have feelings? And so since the person's dead, no one else is hurt by murder or references to it? No families, no friends? No one to fear being murdered in the future? And no reason to value respect for the dead?

Why, by the way, are you using the term ""hurting someone"" to refer to ""_____ culture""? I'm not talking about hurting people. You don't need a culture to hurt people. Individuals can hurt other individuals. None of what you're saying is actually relevant to the existence of a ""rape culture"" or any other ""[bad thing] culture."" 

&gt; There are a significant number of people among you--whether you know about it or not--who have been sexually assaulted. 

*I* have been sexually assaulted. That doesn't give me any reason to consider myself harmed by someone saying s/he raped a test or similar. And the same applies to others -- if they can't even handle a joke unrelated to themselves just because it reminds them of a negative experience, it's their responsibility to work through their issues. It's not the speaker's responsibility to self-censor, especially if the person bothered by it won't speak up and say, ""Hey, your joke bothers me.""  

I'm tired of other women expecting me to have the maturity level of a child, just because I'm a woman. This is just one more example of that expectation. Sorry ladies, sorry rape-culture believers and feminists, but I'm an adult. And you could be too, if you wanted.

&gt; Rape is a specifically awful kind of torture that dehumanizes a person in a way that a mugging does not. 

Tell that to a person whose sense of personal value is based not in what he *is* as much as in what he *earns.* Women tend to be valued on what they are, while men tend to be valued on what they do and have, in terms of work and resources. For some, a mugging is a greater violation than is a rape.

Really, you don't get to just lay down the law like this and decide what hurts who the most. And, again, this has nothing to do with whether there's a rape culture or not. 

Also, what you're saying about rape being torture can only apply to some rapes, largely violent and overt rapes. Statutory rapes, abuses of authority, rapes while incapacitated by alcohol, rapes while passed out, these are wrong but wouldn't be accurately described as torture.

&gt; When you get mugged you lose your money and some peace of mind. You lose a lot more when you're raped. 

And what is that, exactly? What is it that you lose when you're raped that you can't lose otherwise? And, who are you to dismiss the feelings of victims of other crimes? Who are you to say that being mugged, or being robbed or burgled, doesn't involve sense of personal violation, rage and fear? The burglary of my house was certainly a violation for me, which I felt deeply. It was my *home*. My place to be safe. Just like my body is. I can't be alone in something like this.

&gt; To compare the two is incredibly disgusting, but I wouldn't expect more from a person who is more upset that people are trying to prevent rapes than they are about people actually being raped.

Hey look, another person here is lying right to my face about what I've said. Why do you bother? What do you think you'll achieve by blatantly lying about me?"

&gt; **• Simplification comptable pour les entreprises.**

&gt;Quelque 1,4 million d'entreprises de moins de 10 salariés seront exonérées de l'obligation d'établir une annexe comptable et de publier leurs comptes (même s'ils devront toujours les déposer au greffe du tribunal de commerce). Les entreprises de moins de 50 salariés auront, quant à elles, la possibilité d'établir un bilan simplifié. Cela pourra faire économiser jusqu'à 3000 euros à une TPE. L'ordonnance devrait être prête à la fin du mois.

&gt;**• Déclaration sociale nominative**

&gt;Jusqu'au milieu des années 2000, toute entreprise devait déclarer les salaires versés à ses salariés à tous les organismes sociaux (Assedic, 1% logement…). Aujourd'hui, un portail commun existe. La prochaine étape - expérimentée par 30 entreprises - sera de générer automatiquement les données à l'administration via le logiciel de paie. «Les entreprises n'auront plus rien à faire», précise l'Élysée, où l'on chiffre entre 20 et 25% les économies sur la gestion de la paie. Une cinquantaine d'entreprises pourraient être concernées d'ici à mars et 500 en octobre.

&gt;**• Création d'une unité de production**

&gt;Un tel projet est ultraréglementé: l'entreprise doit fournir une étude dans chaque domaine (urbanisme, santé, environnement…) et obtenir une autorisation pour chacun. Les délais peuvent aller jusqu'à 7 ans. La région Midi-Pyrénées expérimente la fusion de toutes les autorisations pour qu'un accord soit donné au bout de 12 mois maximum. L'entreprise n'aurait plus qu'une seule étude à faire réaliser, représentant selon les cas une économie de 40.000 à 200.000 euros, a calculé l'Élysée.

&gt;**• Construction de logements**

&gt;Le gouvernement travaille à des dispositifs qui réduiront considérablement les temps de procédure pour les constructions de logements. Grâce aux ordonnances, la lutte contre les recours juridiques abusifs - pouvant retarder la réalisation d'opérations - sera renforcée. Lors de sa visite, François Hollande procédera à la signature d'un protocole qui engage l'État à céder en plein centre-ville de Toulouse un grand site appartenant au ministère de la Défense, devant permettre de construire 750 logements sociaux à proximité de la future gare TGV de la Ville rose. Il s'agit de «la plus grosse opération de cession de l'État réalisée à ce jour» pour construire des logements, selon un conseiller.

&gt;**• Conseil de la simplification**

&gt;Confié au duo Thierry Mandon-Guillaume Poitrinal et constitué de 12 personnalités qualifiées, ce conseil sera officiellement intronisé par François Hollande ce jeudi. Dix groupes de travail seront conduits sur différents thèmes où l'État pourra simplifier les procédures (exporter, céder son entreprise…). Une centaine de propositions devraient être faites dans l'année qui vient. L'École d'économie de Paris pourrait être chargée d'évaluer l'impact sur la croissance du «choc de simplification»."

For regular shooting, I'd look into purchasing something newer - the stainless steel 629 (and its carbon-steel counterpart, the Model 29) underwent many ""Endurance Package"" upgrades to increase the platform's durability when shooting a steady diet of 'full-house' .44 Magnum loads - these upgrades were incorporated into the later engineering changes/dash-number releases, and were completed by the 629-3 or 629-4 (corresponding Model 29 engineering changes: 29-5 or 29-6) in the mid-90s. Mainly, these upgrades were several changes to the lockwork to prevent the cylinder from cycling backwards or even unlocking itself in recoil. While your 629 no-dash will probably be fine with occasional Magnums, more modern guns (i.e. the current production 629-6) will do even better with a steady diet of Magnum loads.

Plus, should you ever decide to sell your gun, less wear will mean the gun holds more of its collector's value, and thus should fetch a higher price."
GhostdadUC,sports,1389289913.0,"I think there are a few factors at play here.

First, hockey, for me at least, is incredibly difficult to watch on TV.  It is incredibly hard to see the puck especially when it is at the close end of the rink to the camera where it is practically invisible.  This leads me to wanting to go see the game in person instead of wanting to watch it on TV.  I don't have that problem with basketball in general is it is incredibly easy to see what exactly is going on on television and in person.

Secondly, a lot of the cities that are selling out are Canadian cities that do not have any other professional sports franchises.  Calgary, Montreal, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Edmonton all get their cities full attention when it comes hockey season as it is A.) Canada's favorite sport and B.) the only real ticket in town.  I understand that many of these cities also have CFL teams but that is only a few games a year and I'm sorry but I consider it to be a minor league.  These teams have nothing to compete with all year long when it comes to sports entertainment dollars which probably boosts their season ticket holder base.  

Most american cities that have NBA franchises, outside of San Antonio, Utah and Portland have either an NHL team competing with them during the year or have MLB and NFL teams as well competing for season ticket holders as many people can't afford have season tickets to more than one team.

You find it offensive, i don't find it offensive, yet you have the jumped up sanctimonious arrogance to deem my choice of words as ""Inappropriate"" and offensive as if its some universally agreed upon convention.

I'm sure you will have trouble understanding this (as you clearly are a major retard) but in cases of offence and appropriate tone there is no universal objective measure as there is with scientific 
claims. yet for someone so keen to point out everyone's right to have an opinion you seem to conveniently forget this and hold my words and tone as if there is some universally agreed upon standard.

And that kind of deductive leap isn't what a literal interpretation of the bible is about... if anything, that kind of leap is consistent with a *non-literal* interpretation.

Similarly, I never once thought on reading Genesis 1, oh, since God made Earth first, He can't possibly have THEN put it on an orbit around the sun when he made the sun...

musicmusicmusic420,changemyview,1389289971.0,"&gt; I don't mean that anyone who is studious in these facets of higher learning is doomed to be unsuccessful or lack originality. Offering them as voluntary courses, however, detracts from genuine ""art"" by inflating the market, for lack of a better word, with trained individuals.

I think you have hit on something important here. which is that the training in these arts is ultimately useless if it isn't coupled with a fresh perspective or genuine inspiration. However, education in the arts is ideally meant to provide someone as many tools as possible to be creative. It doesn't replace creativity, but it certainly doesn't prohibit it either. 

I'm a Music Composition major at a university, and I definitely see what you are talking about however. I know way too many people that are technically well-trained in music, but ultimately neglect the artistic aspect of it. Whereas I know people who never went to college, joined punk bands and have ten times the musical and artistic creativity as people who have studied it. 

It's not that these institutions are detrimental, it's just that people often don't utilize them as well as they could. But I certainly feel like my education has done nothing but add to my creativity and awareness of music."

SublethalDose,bestof,1389289983.0,"&gt; physicians need to both encourage people to lose weight and, for those who inevitably don't, innovate solutions

This bugs the hell out of me, because I've talked to a good friend who is a doctor, and according to him they have two choices.  Doctors can try to educate patients and encourage lifestyle change, in which case patients sometimes simply don't come back, and most who do come back don't actually make any changes, so their treatment is delayed for six months or a year while they try to stop killing themselves.  Or doctors can immediately prescribe medication to any patient who will benefit from it.

From the doctor's point of view, encouraging lifestyle changes means a very small number of patients change their lifestyle, and a very large number have their treatment delayed or even stop going to the doctor altogether.  Medicating everyone right away means that a very small number of people are unnecessarily medicated, and the larger group gets their medication promptly.  If you encourage lifestyle change, is that optimistic or just elitist?  Do the patients who will change matter more than the patients who won't?  I'm tempted to say yes because the changes they make will hopefully ripple out and contribute to society as a whole changing for the better.  On the other hand, that means exposing most patient to a higher risk of suffering and death as punishment for not helping society move in the right direction.

Wait... I just realized I'm okay with that.  As long as it doesn't push up my health care costs, anyway.

LOJABE,bipolar,1389289983.0,"I take seroquel, 200mg daily at night.  What I can tell you is this: It's like a fucking anesthetic.  Seriously, I can't even sleep without taking it anymore.  Wanna know why I never forget to take my meds?  If I'm awake for 20 hours without taking my medications, it's like, ""Oh yea, forgot to take the seroquel.""  Going from completely awake to dry eyes, exhaustion, and general sleepiness in 20 minutes.

To be on track, though, I will say that my retention, in general, is better, but I attribute that to the medication doing its job, not necessarily the medication acting like fucking NZT.  For instance, I went from needing my GPS on my phone to find a place at least three times to remember how to get there to only needing it once, even over the course of 50 miles.  I have severe ADD, but I feel like seroquel, along with lamictal, has curbed some of that.  Once I get up to 300mg of lamictal, I start tapering off seroquel and start taking welbutrin.  I'm actually kinda excited about that because welbutrin, after doing some research, is pretty much a miracle drug (if it works for you).  It's used to treat ADD, nicotine addiction, depression, manic episodes, a whole bunch of shit.

TL;DR

I don't feel like a god in the classroom, but general retention has improved since taking seroquel."
elkab0ng,sports,1389289984.0,"Stop 10 people on the street in any city in the US, ask them to name a hockey player and a basketball player. I think it's safe to say that in most cities, they would have a harder time naming a current NHL player. Bad for TV ratings, but great for teams - people can buy a ticket and know up front that they're going to see a good game, they're not worried that the one player they're interested in might be out with a busted knee or whatever on that game.

If you go to an NFL game and sit through a 3-hour game, you'll see maybe 6 minutes of action. Baseball, maybe 12 minutes. Basketball, 30. NHL, darned close to 60 minutes, and the game will be over pretty close to the scheduled time, so you can get home on time. All those are pretty good numbers if you're looking to sell seats.

I was up at midnight responding to you to make up your own mind on the matter and I didn't want to go diving in to google scholar to find all your sources when you can do it yourself.  But because you insist, I just did a simple google scholar search.  

Below is a bunch of reviews and studies for you to look at.  You decide whether or not a lot of things I believe aren't worth the merit.  I'm not going to try to defend my beliefs to you, because I know my beliefs are supported and I'm not going to cite 500 articles to prove to it.  So read this stuff, then come back and say what you think on the matter.

[Probably the one study you should read.  It is the most balanced and objective of all deals in my opinion and even addresses the Seralini case that I posted before.  It is up to us, the scientists, to remember to weigh the moral value of our research and present it to the public *as is*.  That means performing responsible research that shows true results with reasonable and rational conclusions, even if the public disagrees. ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584506/)

Don't take this the wrong way, please don't.  In fact, I want to talk to people who have read the evidence and had their own opinion.  I'm a scientist, so I change my opinion according to the evidence.  I did it before.  I'll do it again.  In fact, I used to be anti-GMO before I actually sat down and read the literature.  I've read a lot.  I believe GMO is good and like all technology, we now need to be responsible with it and use it to further mankind.  "

My parents were getting ready to move overseas so they knew our family wouldn't all be able to get together at the same time for long time.  So my parents booked a week at an all-inclusive resort in Mexico.  
One night after dinner my dad and I walk up to the bar.  

Me: Dad, lets do a shot together.  
Dad: You know I'll drink with you all night but I don't do shots, it's a waste.  
Me: C'mon Dad, we're in Mexico, I'm likely not going to see you for like a year.   
Dad: Maybe another night...  
Me: OK but I'm holding you to that.  
Bartender: What can I get you gentlemen?  
Me:  I think I'll have a...  
Dad interrupting me: Bartender is that a bottle of mescal I see back there that is nearly empty?  
Bartender: Si Senior.  
Dad: Would you please pour the rest of the bottle into two glasses?  
Bartender: Do you want the worm in one of the glasses?  
Dad: Oh yes.  [pulls out some random Mexican coin] to me: this side is heads and this one is tails, OK?  
[with out waiting he flips it in the air]  Call it in the air or you lose.  
Me: Tails  
Dad:  Awe, it's heads, I guess you get the worm, son.   

We proceed to shoot what must have been a triple shot each, ugh.  

Now fast forward about 2 hours.  We are shooting pool in the bar and I'm chatting up this chick from NYC who is traveling with her mom.  Her mom can tell what my angle is.  The girl is down to fool around, but doesn't think she can ditch her mom.  She wants to but can't figure out how to slip out.  My dad overhears this says ""Would the two of head over to the bar and find out if they have any buttermilk, I've heard it's good down here.""   The girls mom is confused but my dad says ""I'll explain it when they get back.""  

My dad does this thing when he's in a new restaurant, he'll say to the server ""I've heard that this bar has the best buttermilk with-in 500 miles, is that true?""  The server always says, what? I don't think we even have buttermilk, and then my dad just orders a beer.  

But when he said this I knew he didn't care about buttermilk, he had just given the girl and I an out.  He then proceeded to engage in a conversation about NYC with the mom and keep her distracted.   

She and I duck out and head for a little bungalo I'd seen on the beach.  
We start to make out, and who shows up?  No, not her mom.  The worm decides to make a return visit.  
I pull back from a kiss, turn and vomit into the sand.  
I apologize and she says, ""yeah, well maybe I'll see you around another night"" and she bolts.  

The next morning at breakfast Dad and my Mom and Sister, who had watched the bar scene from a distance, all wanted to know how things went once I slipped out.  I leveled a stare at my Dad, remember the worm?  Yeah, I puked him back up when I was kissing her on the beach.  My family gave me so much shit for the rest of the trip.  Each night at dinner ""Who's the lucky girl you're going to try and barf on tonight?""  

I did see the girl later in the week and we did hook up.  

TL:DR, Dad books trip to Mexico, Awesome!  Dad gives me shot of mescal with a worm it, Not Awesome.  Dad runs interference while I hit on a girl, Awesome!  I puke from the worm, while making out with girl, Not Awesome.  End up hooking up another night, Awesome!  
Bottom line: I've got a pretty awesome family.

The part about short stories being a waste of time was an isolated question, and there was no further theme of this throughout the article, so even if I didn't understand the rest of the article it wouldn't have been relevant. Secondly, I stand by my original statements. McCarthy explicitly says that everything other than sitting and writing is ""a waste of time"", which again is really arrogant and trivialising, and contradictory to other statements about his son within the same paragraph. People suggest he should travel and he says its a waste of time? How about to understand more of the world to better him as a writer? I understand that part perfectly, and disagree with it. 

I think you were just trying to be scathing because you didn't like my comment, and you had a point because I hadn't read it in full. That's ok.

A couple of things we've noticed: 

1. With flash video, you can't resize it once it's in a panel. For example, if I pop out the video on [this page](http://flash.flowplayer.org/demos/configuration/index.html), it fits in the window but if I try to make the panel larger, the video itself stays it's original size. [Here's an example.](http://imgur.com/eHyCw0P) This works with videos using the HTML &lt;video&gt; tag, however, and youtube. The problem here is sometimes the video panel is too small, especially if the video is a code tutorial or something, so it's useful to resize it.  
2. It doesn't seem to be working with videos using the [flowplayer html5 player](http://flowplayer.org/).

I think this is one of the most obnoxiously narcissistic behaviors I see women engage in regularly.  I often don't even want to *attempt* to talk to women outside of a dating/pick-up context because so many women see any attempt to interact with them as a pick-up, and reject you when you had no intention of making a move.

Like, as you might guess from my handle, I play warhammer 40k. Occasionally a chick will come into the store and want to play.  And it causes a stir, because girls who play wargames are *very* rare.  

Every dude who tries to interact with her is going to learn that she has a boyfriend within 30 seconds of conversation, as she makes it clear she's not available and they shouldn't even try.  Some of them probably are interested in her, but most just I think shes there to play, and it's hard to fucking play a game without *talking*.

Then they complain they get frozen out of and treated hostility in places like that.  It's like, ""No bitch! You walked in there and assumed every man there wanted you and preemptively shot him down, *that's* why they don't like you.""

I noticed a lot of the responses here mention porn, yet OP's post does not. I basically agree with everything OP wrote in the literal sense, but in this day and age, masturbation is more often that not synonymous with porn, which can become more problematic for people than you would think. I knew too many people in high school for whom no porn would have been kind of a problem. I wouldn't go so far as to call that an addiction, but it's certainly time (and sometimes money) that could often be more well spent. I guess my only minor issue is that masturbating as much as you feel like might be overkill (and potentially somewhat desensitizing). But within reasonable limits, go for it."
