Blacksheep01,Bitcoin,1389123127.0,"It is. I've written a thesis on late 19th century/early 20th century ""leftist"" political movements in the US and when doing academic research you will find the movements I noted above under the categorization of leftist movements. [That aside, this political spectrum chart is more useful in explaining things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Political_chart.svg) The chart shows Libertarianism and Authoritarianism on the Y axis and Left and Right on the X axis, which shows a more accurate range than just a straight line chart with ""left"" and ""right."" So you can be an authoritarian leftist or a libertarian leftist  just as you can be an authoritarian rightist or a libertarian rightist. Regardless, the anarchists and libertarian socialists I explained above are on the ""leftist"" side, but down in the libertarian quadrant, just as your likely beliefs (I assume based on your commentary) are likely on the right side, but down in the libertarian quadrant. 

Additionally modern day anarchists and libertarian socialists refer to themselves as leftists as do other stripes of socialists and anarchists. There are many subreddits here for those movements in which you will find people self identifying with that label, even if they believe in decentralization and partial collectivism rather than centralized state authority. I think the problem with the usage of the word ""leftist"" is due to US media/general usage of the term, which is often used to describe Democrats or European political parties that believe in a strong centralized state (US Republicans believe in a strong central state also). However, most of those parties are not leftists or libertarians and more accurately fall into center authoritarianism or right authoritarianism."

Diguiseppimon,AskReddit,1389123213.0,"Dealing with debt from a hospital bill from 2 years ago. Long story short, didn't have insurance, had to go to the hospital, they ran every test under the sun after I asked them not to, got slammed with a $10k hospital bill. Fought it, fought it, and fought it some more, they refuse to drop any part of payments, so I had to go into debt consolidation. I had never had to deal with hospital bills or anything by myself. I didn't know that when you go to the hospital, you don't get one lump sum of a bill. If you get an x-ray, food, meds, ANYTHING, each section will bill you separately. 

The reason this is hard for me, is because I live on my own, my parents do not help me with anything, and I am at that point in my life where all my 'adult' things are kicking in. I can barely afford the minimum payments they want, and if I didn't have to pay them, I would honestly be pretty set. I am going to need a new car in the very near future. My LT boyfriend and I have been looking at a new house/even a different apartment. I would love to go to school. But that one hospital trip holds me back from everything, because although now that my credit *score* isn't too terrible anymore, *each division of the hospital that billed me counts as a delinquent account* on my credit. So until my bill is paid off, at the minimum payments I am making, which will take a good 5+ years to pay off, I will not be able to 'grow up'. I can't get loans without a cosigner (parents will not help), and without a loan, I can't get a car, house, or anything important. It makes it hard when you are trying to save up and be an adult, but have one fucking thing holding you back, when you would otherwise be able to afford it. "

No, I'm not implying I think a genocide is around the corner I'm merely trying to demonstrate how deep rooted the hatred/stereotypes against Jews are.  If we could get 1/3 of our people back in return for a couple submarines (a minute fraction of Germanys GDP, a gift THEY volunteered),I think we would take that bargain.  We all are not so different from our ancestors and it is folly to assume you or anyone else would have behaved different had you lived in 1930's Europe.  Now then, bring on the posts claiming I'm just continuing the guilt trip and I'll let you guys all go back to laughing about how cheap and greedy Jews are.

And yes, Jews were blamed for and subsequently massacred during the Black Death and yes, Martin Luther, in his Christian spirit, did call for the Jews to be burned and expelled.

asexist-throwaway,OneY,1389123368.0,"&gt; Start by writing down a description of the person you see yourself

Here's the problem: I want to be a person I am now. Without the sex problem that is.

I wanted to end my libido with chemical means, but safe and effective anaphrodisiacs don't exist, as it came to my knowledge after extensive research (and two threads on reddit). 

I can probably shelter myself from erotic content when I'm at home, but I need to go to work every day and I want to go out and see my friends to have fun with them. So it's impossible not encounter a trigger for sexual thoughts.

I'm a kind person with sharp sense of humour and ability to easy hold interesting conversations. A lot of people like me.

So I can try to act all macho and do negging and peacocking and DHV'ing and awkwardly trying to put down ""AFC's"". So basically act completely not like who I am just in hope I can wet my dick some night in the future. Do the wrong things for the wrong reasons. 

And there's prostitutes. Can you see why I want to spend my money on an hour of paid sex rather than a fedora?"

TheLittleGoodWolf,sex,1389123645.0,"From the Cambridge University link:

&gt;The genitals are covered in sensitive skin which is quite easily irritated. Keep the genitals clean, wash daily, but be gentle and don't overdo it. If you have problems try using unscented soap products **or something instead of soap**, an aqueous cream, which you can buy from any chemist

From the NHS link:

&gt;Gently wash the penis with warm water each day when you're having a shower or bath. If you have a foreskin, pull it back gently and wash underneath.

&gt;While regular personal hygiene is important, too much washing with soap and shower gels can cause soreness. **Gently washing your penis once a day with warm water is sufficient to maintain good hygiene.** If you want to use soap, choose a mild or non-perfumed soap to reduce the risk of skin irritation.

From Ask Alice (the link from columbia university):
&gt;To prevent infection, uncircumcised men should retract their foreskin and wash with soap and water every day. **Be sure to rinse away all of the soap underneath the foreskin when you wash your penis — any soap left there may lead to inflammation.**



From [healthline](http://www.healthline.com/health/balanitis), on balantitis:
&gt; Irritation in the area can also cause balanitis. Irritation can arise from:
* not rinsing soap completely off of your penis after showering
* using scented soaps to clean the penis
* using bar soap that dries out the skin
* using scented lotions or sprays on the penis

From [medicalnewstoday](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/184715.php), also on balantitis more specifically on how to prevent it:
&gt;The area should be washed thoroughly and gently with warm water. As soap may irritate it should not be used.

It also lists some of the primary causes as:
&gt;* Some detergents (washing powders) if not completely rinsed
* Some fabric conditioners if not completely rinsed
* Some perfumed soaps
* Some shower gels 


From [this paper](http://childrightsnurses.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Foreskin-Chapter-Thesis-Excerpt.pages_.pdf) (ctrl+f soap): 
&gt;The “3 Rs” are a helpful mnemonic for foreskin
care: retract the foreskin (boy retracts himself), rinse underneath, and replace the foreskin back forward.
By puberty, if retractable, it is recommended that rinsing underneath be performed more regularly, i.e.
daily. Soap is not necessary and can be irritating (Birley et al., 1993)

&gt;It is known that excessive use of soap under the prepuce can disturb the floral balance, and
contribute to inflammation of the foreskin and glans (balanoposthitis) (Birley, Luzzi, &amp; Bell, 1993; Fleiss
et al., 1998)

While yes, soap can be used and is not always harmful it does always have some effect and there is in fact no need to use any soap when washing under the foreskin."

Of course, there are several conditions in which things go terribly wrong, but every body system has those.  I remember learning that, while pregnancies are rough no their own, unsanitary conditions in hospitals were responsible for a good number of deaths before modern medicine.  In those cases, developing medicine was responsible for the deaths rather than the pregnancy on it's own.  When you consider the fact a pregnacy's design is to create a new life entirely, it's really impressive they are as successful as they have been throughout history.  "

thumper242,todayilearned,1389123956.0,"If I were to look at the short term, I would say it's just my artistic style; however, now that I can see a decade of photography, I can honestly say that I have been able to pick up on some trends based on how my life was going at the time.  
  
For instance, I did an end of the year count on photos and compared it to every other year I've been shooting. I do this every year to compare.  
  
[Here](http://i.imgur.com/6yLjR23.png) is that count.  
  
You can see me get more and more into photography in 2004 though 2007. In 2008 and 2009, I had a period of incredible turmoil and severe depression. I broke up with my girlfriend, dropped out of college, smoked a forest of weed, drank and ocean of whiskey, and generally had a very bad time.  
  
In 2010 I pulled myself out of it slightly and began photographing a local band after I met some great people. I spent a lot more of my time photographing in general, and in addition I was going to shows pretty constantly.  
  
In 2012 I went though a relapse of sorts and had some bad times. I took 12,000 less shots than the previous year.  
  
In late 2013 the relationship with my now fiancee really began to take off, I turned my life around greatly, and I upgraded from the Canon 20D I got in 2005, to the 60D I'm shooting now. Right now is the best I've ever shot. On Facebook I divide my photos into seasons to keep the albums small and to make the passage of time for me. This last season was one of the largest I've posted and the quality is better than anything I ever expected to be shooting. The vibrance and creativity of this work is something I've quite proud of.  
  
I was curious about color enough to go back though my work just now and see if I could find good representations of my photos from each year and see how that compare. These are photos I was proud of at the time, and representative of what I was shooting then.

The essential problem, I think, is that there's a strong disparity between what makes for good gameplay, and trying to do something that actually provides something akin to that experience. Mount &amp; Blade (n.b. - I've only played vanilla Warband) does a pretty good job, but is often hamstrung by technological limitations. I have a strong feeling that most shooters, at some point, are going to run up against a sort of Gameplay/Historicism wall.

The perspective of the general is equally flawed, if only for the sort of lack of soft restraints on your power. I think that, if you want to get there, you do need to be more ""literary,"" or - and this is frankly probably a better choice for video games - toss the window dressing and try to capture those parts of the experience you really want to get across."

acsempronio,skyrim,1389124075.0,"Consider this from a different perspective, then:

You are woken up in a carriage on your way to be executed with the leader of the Stormcloaks.  You are accused of throwing in with the Stormcloaks and the Captain doesn't seem to care about the truth.  

Suddenly a dragon attacks.

In the ensuing melee and confusion you find yourself looking for a hand to safety... Ulfric isn't around... the leader meant to die beside you is missing... but an Imperial Soldier is there to get you on your feet, re-arm you, and have you and he find safe passage out.

Furthermore, the Stormcloaks seem to be fighting and killing people as they escape undergrund from the Dragon.

While I understand they are at war with each other, the Stormcloaks can't for one second be gentlemanly about the situation and hold off on killing the Imperials until at least the dragon isn't destroying the place.

Even further... The Imperials are the only ones fighting off the dragon.  The Stormcloaks can't even recognize that the dragon may be a threat to everyone RIGHT NOW, let alone to them later on as well.

the Imperial side just seems to make rational decisions while the Stormcloaks make emotionally-charged decisions that can even hamper their own progress... and that's just in the first 15 minutes."

mfranko88,Rockband,1389124217.0,"Just a heads up: Rock Band 3 and only RB3 has an option of turning on specially notarized cymbal notes. So when a crash cymbal happens at the end of a roll, the game has you actually hitting the green cymbal instead of the green pad.

Every other version of the game is compatible with these cymbals, including The Beatles. These games will NOT differentiate between pad and cymbals in its notation. If it shows a green note, you can hit either the green pad OR the green cymbal. Either one will register as a hit. The cymbals are a blast but you have to do a bit of listening to know which one (pad or cymbal) you should hit. The biggest drawback of this are the Run to the Hill or Everlong type patterns, which have the hihat cymbal (the yellow cymbal) charted to the red pad, and there is no way to ""authentically"" play it.

If this excites and interests you I STRONGLY recommend Rock Band 3's pro mode, which has cymbals charted for every song ever released going back seven years now."

I think I understand your point, but it seems to me that the line between ""history"" and ""trope"" here is a bit fuzzy. Are people talking about how futile it is because of some special thing about the game mechanic as inspired by the history, or because that's what sorts of tropes you'd expect out of a WWI game?

It seems to me that, outside of the showmanship, a shooter is a really bad way to communicate the messages you're trying to get across, and that fun gameplay really risks sacrificing them, particularly if it's about the grimy first person terror of war."

I mean, they spent a lot of money flying me out there from the other side of the country.

Drop_,DotA2,1389124347.0,"The problem is that it doesn't really let you leverage that early game tankiness it provides, imo.  

Other early to midgame items provide so much more.  Mek, Drums, etc. provide not just bulk but beneficial auras and actives.  

I feel like Vanguard was much more powerful in previous versions of the game as well due to the higher value of regen items when long term lane and jungle farming were the priority before many heroes received hp regen buffs as well.  

The worst part of Vanguard is that it's hardly more than the sum of its parts.  If I'm playing Bristle, I would rather be able to keep the 3 items in my inventory (stout + Vit Booster + RoH).  Yes, it's 1 less HP regen and slightly more block early/midgame.  But if they didn't auto combine like they do they could be built into a hood and heart for example, which preserves Bristle's relevance in the game for much longer.

I think it just comes down to the fact that getting vanguard is investing heavily in the pre 30 minute game, at the expense of the lategame, while at the same time forgoing the powerful teamfight items (mek, drums) which arguably have a bigger impact if your team is actually trying to win in the pre 30 minute timeframe.  

I still think it needs a bigger buff as well, because the block still isn't at the advertised rate.

almightybob1,truetf2,1389124495.0,"Trading in TF2 is a lot like exchanges in chess. There are generalities which usually apply, but circumstances can change the value of an exchange.

As a scout, you are the equivalent of a bishop or knight. Useful and certainly good to have around, but low on the pecking order. In general, exchanging for a higher-value piece or player is a good thing. If you can trade scout for demo or medic, it's like exchanging bishop for queen - almost always a good decision. Trading for the pocket is also pretty good. Trading for an equivalent piece - an enemy scout or the roamer - is fine *all other things being equal*. But in TF2, they usually aren't.

So when is it a bad idea? If you are already at a numbers disadvantage (or in chess, a materiel disadvantage) trading for an equivalent value - or even sometimes trading up - may still be a bad idea, because proportionally you could still lose more of your firepower. Sometimes it is better to keep your piece alive and use the threat it poses to your advantage. For example if you are the only one alive defending last, chasing the medic down and then dying to the soldier could let him win the round uncontested. If you had stayed alive and threatened him, you might have held him off until help arrives.

Of course, the chess analogy isn't perfect for several reasons: the uber mechanic, the ability to recover materiel through respawns, the potential to trade yourself for multiple players (or none), but you get the idea. *As a scout, yes trade up if you can, unless the situation dictates otherwise.*"

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1389124513.0,"No, I totally agree with you. This goes back to my previous point. Marx wanted to put class mobility in stasis by putting everyone on neutral ground. Rand embraces class mobility, and all of the strife therein. She also embraces new industry. She likes the game that it is made up of, and doesn't feel people should be ashamed to make it to the top. She doesn't want people to expect those at the top to help them out. That expectation is harmful in every way. Helping people to the top takes them off of their own path. Expecting people at the top to help you out, takes those people off their own path. These paths should never be crossed, as it would harm the very nature of a society built upon the constant drive for the better life.

I go back, therefor, to continue my examination of Bioshock from a Marxist's lens. It isn't just a society that collapses around a character, it's also about the character themselves. The main character of Bioshock is in an odd position. He is a slave, preprogrammed to orders. That said, he is not without agency, and he has choices along the way. The major one is whether or not you consume Adam from the Little Sisters. It is odd, in a game that acknowledges nilhism, Neitzche, and existentialism, to have a morality score that offers different endings, good and bad, based on your good and bad choices. What's extremely odd is what's considered the ""Good"" choice. The main character rescues all of the innocent little sisters and takes care of them until they take care of him. The ""Good"" choice, is the main character setting up a commune with the Little Sisters."

lendrick,politics,1389124516.0,"&gt; If you are really trying to argue that nobody has seen rate increases, then you are not worth having a discussion with. The other possibility is that you're just being a dick.

No, that would be ridiculous.  However, without knowing how many people have seen rate increases and how much a typical rate increase would be (or if, on average, rates actually went *down*), it's a pretty worthless statement.

Without knowing how many people are affected or to what extent they're affected, there's no way to answer a ""What about them?"" question.  If rates went up significantly on average for everyone, the answer is different than if, on average, they went down.  It would also be different if they went way up for a few people and didn't change much for everyone else.  I don't know the extent of this ""very real impact"" that you're talking about.  You're implying with your words that it's a really big deal, but you're refusing to provide any data that shows this, and demanding that people tell you what you want to hear.  How big is the impact, actually?

So, I'll repeat myself:  *substantiate your claim.*"

No because ""not hiring"" is very different from ""firing""

&gt;Or doing initial health screenings, or avoiding hiring a smoker? 

Yes. These all involve the same things. And people do this, usually through their unconscious bias to hire attractive people, but sometimes through conscious bias to avoid hiring *all kinds of people* that are more likely to quit or take long leaves.

&gt;What's the difference? Where do you draw the line?

What do you mean? From a ""who would make the best employee"" hiring decision, you don't draw a line. All factors are fair game. From a legal perspective we try to establish prohibitive factors but they're not 100% effective. There will always be discrimination when you build a system that rewards discrimination (by punishing those that fail to discriminate)."

Fire bolt + attack from a Goblin Scout kills both Scholars and Skirmishers, and since it only costs 1 resource for a fire bolt he has enough to deploy another Goblin Scout (if he has one on hand, if he doesn't he'll just move the Scout and let me do 1 damage and I'll drop some other creature in the Scouts row, but now we're up to 3 resources so Kelthor can play Lightning strike + attack to kill the more costly creature, or deploy another creature, War Oliphant or Centaur Archer comes to mind).

IIRC, he was using a new way to mount the teeth on the blade in the 2nd version of the bot, which ended up less robust than expected - the disc tore through the bolt holes, launching the tool steel tooth.

My favorite story about arena damage was The Judge, which had an extremely high power pneumatic hammer. In the preliminary fights of season 3, Judge was using a pointed spike, but kept punching holes in the steel on the floor that the staff would have to go in and weld shut. At the request of the staff, the people operating Judge switched out to a flat sledgehammer head. After one fight like this, they realized that was a mistake - instead of punching nice little weldable holes, the hammer would warp entire 1m^2 steel plates when it hit, and those ended up needing to be replaced.

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389124856.0,"I disagree with your overall sentiment.  

As a Kings fan, you probably agree with me that what we've seen on the court for the last decade or so has been substandard.  From an athlete/team perspective, we haven't had an enjoyable product.  One of the only things that has kept me interested in the game is the other dynamics at play.  

The not-game-related events were some of the most captivating things about being a Kings fan.  I loved speculating about new draft picks.  I loved when we signed new players or traded old ones.   I hated the Maloofs.  I liked that there was a campaign to get Tyreke the ROY award.   I liked how DMC learned to manage his attitude and work towards leading the team.  I loved how Isaiah went from being the 60th pick to being a high quality NBA player.  

To pick one of those examples, Isaiah's amiability and backstory made his on-court play all the more special.  If IT was a 6'3"" 10th round pick who wasn't a likeable guy, would fans care nearly as much about him?  I doubt it.  

I kind of understand where you're coming from in the sense that I can get joy out of watching basketball for basketball's sake.  I'd rather watch an NBA Summer League with no audio game than an NFL playoff game in person.  I can appreciate athletes working to beat other athletes in a fair sport.  

At the same time, I fully appreciate that quality NBA basketball can't exist without the media and other aspects of the entertainment side of basketball.  The NFL has bloomed in popularity (and subsequently, talent) because of it's accessibility to demographics that may not have traditionally cared for sports. Basketball needs to do the same if it hopes to attract top talent.  

I hate that Boogie gets T'd and fined for being a passionate player, but I know that the NBA needs to protect it's family-friendly image if it hopes to grow and flourish.  When the NBA struggled with its image, fans had to deal with poor coverage and tape-delayed playoff games.  If the media environment we have now makes it possible for me to watch a dozen games a week, I fully support it. "

acsempronio,bjj,1389124938.0,"I have your so-called ""flat feet"".  I've had them my whole life.  It has nothing to do with my hamstrings and everything to do with genetics.  In fact, one foot has a slight arch and the other basically does not.

As someone in the medical field you should know that there is no such thing as ""flat feet"" but there is a thing called ""over-pronation.""  The opposite is ""over-suppination.""  It all has to do with bone construction and that has to do with genetics.  Arches don't ""fall"" either.

My pronation hasn't affected me much at all.  I'm a minimalist runner and my ankles, calves, and supportive tissues have never been stronger.

If you are going to use the argument of how one thing affects the other you should reverse your stance: the state of your feet affect everything above it... not the other way around.

Furthermore, your supposition fails to take into account a number of other factors that affect everything from your feet to your head.

I can't touch my toes much.  I used to (before I switched to minimalist running) but now, not so much.  Does this mean that minimalist running makes me less flexible or that a lack of flexibility has made me a minimalist runner?  

The answer is neither and a bit of both.  While mimimalist running has shorten my steps (but increased the quantity over a given distance) it has prevented the classic heel-strike stretch.  Pointing the toes up and reach far with the heel elongates the leg, providing dynamic stretching to the hamstring group.  This may be a bit anecdotal as I can touch my toes *following* a run where before minimalist running I could do it before too.

The bigger issue is lifestyle: I started working in a position that has me sitting down a lot whereas before I was walking and standing more (and before that I was in the Marine Corps.)  the decrease in extended periods of mobility has made my body adjust. This, of course, is probably anecdotal as well.

Before you make the accusation that I can't have flat feet and join the Marine Corps consider Occam's Razor and know that I faked it."

McLarenF1God,confession,1389125093.0,"Easy there ya' crabby bastard. I've been at this long enough to know what I am doing when it comes to insurance companies. My car history is an inch thick of paperwork. Every time someone has caused damage to my car, I report it and if possible, I throw in an extra damage claim that was never reported from the last time someone ran into my car because the 500 dollar deductible was not worth it the first time. Hit and run after hit and run after brick through the window after hit and run. Maybe you're the type of guy who doesn't mind paying $4,500 dollars in deductibles over the course of 3 years, despite these accidents never having been your fault. At least I managed to save myself 2 grand in the mean time. That's four deductibles instead of eight. I'm not making faulty claims, I'm simply bundling up the mistakes of other drivers and saving myself some money in the process by reporting the damage later. I win a little, and the insurance company doesn't question a thing, because the damage is real. I'm not empathetic towards the insurance company int he same way I'm not empathetic towards Comcast. Maybe you are, I don't know. You call me an idiot, but what I did was smart. Two hit and runs for the price of one deductible! Nonetheless, of course he is responsible for the accident, but he is not responsible for the damages.

lavender-fields,AskFeminists,1389125096.0,"The most important thing to do when looking at gender issues in another culture is to listen to women *from that culture* and give them opportunities to speak rather than assuming that you know what they want and what is best for them.

For example, many non-muslim feminists are initially opposed to hijabs and other head coverings because they see them as oppressive.  But many muslim women have actually come out saying that they want to cover their heads, that they choose to do so freely as an expression of their religion, and that ending the practice of cover their heads is not an important aspect of feminism to them.  

So while it is not inherently wrong to hold another culture to feminist standards, it is important to recognize that one's own culture is not the default and does not have all the answers, and that it is crucial to let the women of the foreign culture speak for themselves."

I'm going to take a different tack from others in here.  You said she is your second partner and she is 4 years older.  Ask yourself, is it that you didn't like how rough she was or are you feeling a little intimidated by her in the sack?  
If it's the rough part, you should tell her you don't think that the two of you are sexually compatible, you like it slower and more gentle.  Take it from there.   

If on the other hand you are nervous that you kind liked what happened it just happened too fast but you might be into it... I would tell her that you don't have much experience in the sack, you are open minded but aren't ready to jump in too deep just yet.  

It sounds like you've got yourself a bit of a cougar there, older, more experienced, teeth and claws.

As a CS major, I meet a lot of the stereotypical anime fans who don't really take care of themselves (in terms of being a healthy, clean, and socially interesting person). There are plenty of people who don't fall into this generalization, of course, but some reason this portion of the fanbase is the most obnoxious about their interest. I don't necessarily need anime to change but if the social stigma went away, I'd probably be able to introduce more of my friends to various anime. 

Of course, there are aspects of many anime (e.g. escapism, fanservice) that specifically appeal to this group of people and thus create a particular western culture. Still, I think you made a straw man in your response to the actual question in hand."

* Forums

   * Official

   * Reddit

* Videos

   * uTube

   * Twitch

So if person wants to know what is going on and what has been going on there is lots of media out there and doesn't require *trudging up reddit posts and random forum posts*. Rocket has been vocal about things he is doing for DayZ SA and hasn't hidden it away.

Hell, I really even didn't follow DayZ at all yet I picked all kinds of things up by just following gaming news on semi-daily basis.

I don't think any modern gamer has any room to say that *Information is too hard find!* when developers have come more vocal about development and putting that stuff out there. This is not just about DayZ SA, but about games in general. To me too often it seems that people don't bother do any research on game they are interested in, but either bitch on forums about it **or** purchase it with zero research and then proceed to bitch.

When it comes to whole argument of *""Should DayZ SA be sold in its current state?""* it's, like you said, up and downside of Early Access and similar concepts. Is it worth it to put Alpha into hands of gamers or should developers just keep holding stuff back and release it e.g. 3 years from now?

P.S. All what have I said above doesn't mean that games like DayZ SA should be immune to criticism!

squashedbananas,AskReddit,1389125381.0,"Lots of options, actually. You have to remember that just because you can do magic doesn't mean you can do it *well.* Plus, there certain laws of magic (like, the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration: the first one is, you can't create food out of nothing).

So, with that said, there are plenty of career paths, including quite a lot of options we have in the Muggle world: government worker, lawyer, teacher, hairdresser, shopkeeper, writer, singer, gardener.

Then you have some options that only apply to the wizarding world: Healer (you could say they're doctors/surgeons, but they're really not), curse breaker, broomstick crafter, Quidditch player. 

Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts and got his wand snapped; however, it's entirely possible that his wand was snapped more as a legal measure than as something school-related. He was expelled for keeping a monster that was suspected of attacking students. Harry was threatened with expulsion and having his wand snapped, but that was again, more of a legal issue (he broke the law - *again* - by doing magic in front of a Muggle). So it's possible that if you get expelled, you can keep your wand, but that if the Ministry gets involved, you're SOL.

It's pretty fucking harsh to snap a wand, because you can't really do magic without it. If that happened, you could become a caretaker/groundskeeper somewhere (like Hagrid), or do some kind of profession that doesn't really require magic. Of course, you could also pull a Hagrid and hide your wand away in an umbrella so that you can still use it at times.

Of course, Squibs can take jobs in the magical world or the non-magical one, like Filch and Figg. Filch stayed as a caretaker of Hogwarts. I don't know what Figg did when she wasn't working for the Order of the Phoenix/Dumbledore. "

It's pretty normal for CQ to go splat though if you're getting hit by a zerg or smaller premades running around grabbing off small groups. So either stay with your zerg and die whenever they all wipe, or run around tagging extractors solo and hope for the best!

Currency for PVP doesn't translate to PVE, so you won't be wasting any marks/favor if you were to spend them :).

Honestly, for our coach, I feel we have as close to a perfect starting five as most teams can hope to reasonably get. I'd take Iggy over Batum ideally because you don't really lose three point shooting, Iggy is also a great defender (better in some ways), and he has more drive and experience.

I'd take Hibbert over RoLo for the same reasons that the Blazers gave him an offer when he was an RFA. RoLo is nearly the perfect C for what the Blazers do, but having Hibbert start and RoLo come off the bench would make me seriously think the Blazers were going to the Finals this year.

tattedspyder,beards,1389125410.0,"So many of you seemed to miss the point of the article and are sounding off with ""but I'm a man!  I do manly stuff!""

If you do manly stuff (welding, fishing, chopping down trees, etc) then the article *wasn't about you*.

There is a basic idea that a beard is a sign of manliness and that manliness is defined by certain traits or abilities.  A manly man is a leader, he's tough, he can build things, destroy things, kill things, fix things, and his grooming consists of not being dirty for longer than he must.

So many men these days, and it's not their fault, just the world we live in, *don't* know how to do basic mechanical things, *can't* fix, build, destroy, kill anything, spend *hours* each day carefully styling each hair and picking each piece of clothing to achieve an I-don't-care-how-I-look look.  These are *not* ""manly"" men by any sense of the definition, but they grow a beard because it's trendy and somehow feel that the beard alone makes them qualify as ""manly"" men.

I'm not a beard elitist.  If you want a beard, grow a beard, if you don't, don't.  If ""metrosexual"" hipsters who have never done a single day's manual labor want to grow a beard that's *FINE*.

But, as stated in the article, it used to be a certain breed of man that grew a beard, a manly man, a tough man, a man other men looked up to.  Now that breed is watered down and the image of a beard no longer conjures thoughts of admiration, just dismissal or scorn.

I tell them.  Expressing my thoughts and feelings has always been difficult for me, and when you expect me to start picking up on signals and coded language then it's just too much for me.  So I expect honesty, and literal expression of wants and desires, in my company. The only way for me to help people understand this is by showing them with my own words and actions.

&gt;It can be a confusing subject, especially given how the term Damascus gets thrown around these days as marketing blather.

&gt;Here's the most succinct version I can provide on this troublesome issue

&gt;A long time ago, someone figured out that steel made in a certain way was pretty much better than the steel everyone else was using. This was called Wootz crucible steel.

&gt;This Wootz steel was used a lot by some sword makers in Damascus. A lot of these sword makers folded the steel several time. Sometimes they folded it with other steel, sometimes they didn't. Regardless, folding the steel and hammering it out has a number of positive side effects. This process is called Pattern Forging.

&gt;It also tends to produce an interesting pattern.

&gt;Wootz steel kinda disappeared, either as a result of extreme secrecy and oral tradition breaking down, or due to a lack of critical resources. No one really knows.

&gt;No one really knows what Wootz was, but after a lot of research and experimentation, a few people think they've figured it out.

&gt;A much larger number of people produce Pattern Forged steel blades using more common and readily available steel. These blades have very similar aesthetics, but different material properties. These blades are sometimes better than blades that are not Pattern Forged. Sometimes they are worse. Very very often, they are called Damascus Steel, when they really are no such thing, they are simply Pattern Forged Steel.

&gt;The term Damascus has become somewhat synonymous with Damascus in modern knife marketing. This is sad. Many people will get in long winded pedantic arguments about things like Pattern Forged vs. Damascus as a term versus a technique. Or Wootz Steel vs. New Damascus, which is another long story. Or the relative merits of Pattern Forging versus new super steels.

&gt;Really, very long and angry arguments.

&gt;Also, there are a number of cheaper Damascus Knives available on the market that are really just blades that have been treated with acid etching, paint, vinyl overlays, what have you, to create the pattern associated with Pattern Forging over the top of the cheapest steel that will hold an edge.

PracticalDemonkeeper,todayilearned,1389126067.0,"It might be one of the unfortunate consequences of the way history is sometimes taught in the U.S. where there just isn't enough time to cover all the details, especially the later in history you get. I'm not saying I agree with that reason, because it is a shame that so much gets left out just to make sure that classes follow the curriculum, but that's usually the reason given.

Anecdotally, I never even heard of the Scholls, the White Rose, or most other details of WWII until majoring in history in college. Barely even covered WWII in high school, let alone resistance movements in Europe. Even then, learning about Sophie Scholl, specifically, didn't happen until I took one class one semester in college about women and the Holocaust. It is very much a shame."
imbreaststroke,runescape,1389126069.0,"The last time I checked they sold for 286gp/scrap and since you get 21-40 scraps/damaged chitin (depending on your smith level) you can get 6k-11k/damaged chitin.  With an inventory of 20 (assuming you pick up charms and the herbs/seeds worth more than the equivalent chitin scraps; and no BoB) you can get 120k-220k/inventory just of chitin.  If you throw in the grimy lantadymes and dwarf weeds that's 11k/herb or 50k/seed.  Add in a BoB (terror bird=12, war tort=18, yak=30) you can get several 100k/trip.

Edit: I just checked and chitin scraps are, at GGE price, 269gp each.  This makes it 5.6k-11k/chitin.  An inventory of 20 would be 112k-214k in chitin.

mrcleanup,relationship_advice,1389126179.0,"Here's what you need to know.

She says something, and you get a sinking feeling in your gut.

It doesn't actually matter *why* only how you feel. Following your heart is the best way to avoid regret, overthinking things and trying to convince yourself to feel a way that you don't feel is the best way to end up having regrets.

To top it off, she says...

&gt;so either I do my duty on the appropriate days of the calendar, or we part ways and she tries to find another man before her waning years arrive

effectively telling you that your sperm matter more than who you are. The timeline matters more than who you are.

The key to a great relationship is finding the right person, not building the right relationship. And there are a lot of factors, time is one of them.

Here's a great example. There is a woman who gets raped at 16, she spends the next 9 years feeling completely damaged, has a transformative experience around 25 and starts to learn to trust again, it takes her 5 years of semi-committed relationships to really learn to respect herself and trust, she is now open to a serious long term life partnership. This is a more extreme story, but not something unheard of. Ready for the follow up question?

What happens if you meet her and fall in love with her at 20?

Well the short answer is that you are completely screwed. You can either wait 10 years for her to heal and start looking for a life partner, or date her now and be a temporary part of her healing process. Or... you can accept that something like poor timing can be enough to disqualify a relationship with an otherwise perfect seeming person for you.

Some people have mismatched habits, or religion, or hygiene, or interests. And sometimes the timing just isn't right because each person is at a different point in their journey.

Be honest, admit that you aren't ready for that, that you don't know if it will be a year or 5 years, and that she should only stay if she is ok with that.

If a woman leaves you because you let her see who you really are, you have to let her go no matter how much it hurts. This is how you find the incompatible ones, and it's hard, but it is also how you realize that what you have is truly special, when you show them who you truly are and they treasure it."

Seeing as 096 was only 4 pixels, it would be a stretch to think that Oleski somehow found one of the guy's own personal photos, discovered a blotch that activated 096 without getting killed himself or having the photo discovered when the containment teams had to find out what caused the breach that proved to him that 096 was in the photo (they're not going to go home without knowing what triggered 096), and then planted it on the guy's wall where it had shown signs of hanging for a long period of time.

I'm using it with a Logitech k400r, which is a combo keyboard/touchpad and unbelievably, it doesn't work too badly for RTS type games (although nothing beats a real mouse so far). I have an Xbox controller for certain other games (like Ducktales/side scrollers) but I've yet to try an FPS with the k400r. It's a little clunky, but I've adapted so far.

The problem people run into is thinking that singular weather events can really be anything more than a data point that can be used in the model.

In addition the data points from the US can't be considered alone, but also in context with the rest of the world. In the simplest terms the US could be colder than average while the global average is still going up, which would mean this cold event is still consistent with climate change models.

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1389126546.0,"&gt;As far as I can tell, people who have BitCoins would be ill-advised to spend those BitCoins.

But, you say at the beginning of your post that you are deeply skeptical of BitCoin?  If you really believe the value will crash so much, then why not buy as many goods and services now as you can (given you have BTC) knowing that your BTC will be worth less tomorrow?  Why not get on an exchange and short-sell BTC?

The answer is fairly obvious.  You really have no idea what the future holds (nor do any of us).  What is actually happening right now is that many early adopters fear a price crash, and are trying to 'use' their Bitcoin before this happens.  Meanwhile, many merchants believe the price of Bitcoin will go up and are eagerly trying to attract customers to pay in BTC.  You must be on one side of the fence or the other.  Either you believe the price will fall, in which case you should be short selling BTC at every opportunity.  Or, you believe the price of BTC will rise, in which case you should be hording coins.  And if you don't know what to think, at a minimum, BitPay converts BTC transactions 'instantly' to USD for a 1% fee (less than credit cards), which allows you to forego much of the risks.

And this right here is exactly why he did this study. When you start telling overweight people that the ONLY way to lose their weight is to go through what you're proposing, they tune you out immediately. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if you eat less you lose weight, if you eat more you gain weight, but people don't seem to grasp this because when someone tries to tell them, people like you come in and ruin what could be a simple plan by telling them there is no way it's true, because he didn't get his blood checked, or his liver biopsied, or proven that he can do something or hits a certain mark on a chart.

Life-in-Death,AskReddit,1389126715.0,"God, reading this makes me so worried about my brother.  

He married a super quick-to-anger woman.  My mom and I used to blame ourselves: Poor _____, he went from a household with a verbally domineering mom and sister to one with a verbally domineering wife.

I hate visiting them for the holidays.  This Christmas, my mom and I watched in terror as my brother accidently backed into his wife who had entered the kitchen and was standing right behind him.  We were just waiting for the screaming and blaming (we have also learned that saying anything just makes the situation worse).  Amazingly enough, she just laughed and we all breathed a sigh of relief.

We are all slightly terrified of her, but she controls access to the grandkids, so...(My mom changed a lunch order from a salad to a sandwich she knew would make her feel ill.  When she was sitting there suffering, I was like, why did you order that?  And she was all, ""It's not worth it, there is too much stress right now as it is..anything to keep her happy""...)

Watching her this holiday though I started to see that she actually just has no control over her emotions.  I watched her scream and storm off to her room after a kid helpfully asked her for a second time in three hours about making the dessert that we had been planning on making all day.  Another time I was discussing an in depth, obscure, political situation I had researched with my brother and she started yelling from the other room that I was probably completely wrong.

Anyway.  My brother is scared to say anything, ever.  But he has also become a passive aggressive ass, probably as a result.  He also screamed at me (in front of everybody) for the first time in a probably kick-the-dog scenario.

Overall though, shockingly, I think the relationship still manages to be a net-positive for both of them.  Oddly enough she idolizes him and he has the actual final say on most things.  But I hate seeing it.  I hate that my nephews and niece see it.  I hate that this is going to be a part of my life for the rest of my life.  I hate that my mom sees it and also gets treated like crap.  

Guilt is pointless, I know you know.  Congrats on your amazing find, and enjoy every minute.

Wolf_Stansson_DDS,AskReddit,1389126779.0,"This is a self-repost to clear up an extremely common misconception:
 Here is a breakdown (based on the costs at my restaurant and a 24oz cup):

* Cup- 7 cents
* Lid- 3 cents
* Straw- 2 cents
* Soft Drink- 1.7 cents per oz. (~$68 for a 5 gal BiB, yielding 3840 finished oz, at a ratio of 5 to 1 water to syrup).
* Ice- very conservatively estimating 1.5 cents per serving (Ice machines are crazy expensive. Here I'm taking $4,000 for the machine divided over the expected life of the machine, ten years, divided by 365 days divided by roughly 70 drinks a day which is based on my restaurant's numbers)


Neither my soda costs nor my ice costs are factoring water costs because that is included in my lease.
Right off the bat, you have 13.5 cents for cup, lid, straw, and ice. The average drink is 1/2 ice, 1/2 soda. So we add an additional 20 cents if they only fill up once. Average person will get 1.5 refills if they're eating in; we'll round down to 1 refill. 

At this point, our total cost is 53.5 cents. I sell this drink for $1.69. This is good enough for 68% margins, but hardly the cash cow people seem to think it is.
Even if someone doesn't refill, it is still only 80% margins. Typically, a restaurant will shoot for a food cost of ~35%-38%. Sodas are slightly more profitable, but nowhere near the level people seem to think.

**TL;DR Soda costs a lot more than you think at restaurants.**

I never once defended brucemo, i never once said srssucks were all racists. You felt like you were implying i was. Perhaps because saying ""the date on the rniggers drilldown doesnt really prove or disprove anything at all to do with srssucks racist population"" made *you* feel like i was implying srssucks must be racist. Which could only come from you associating me with the brucemo person, by commenting on them.

&gt;  he's arguing that ""it"" is the gender neutral pronoun in English.

More to the point he was also arguing that ""they"" the more preferred gender neutral pronoun by *absolutely every fucker else except transphobic shit* was more incorrect.

The justification is as flimsy as me invoking historical use of the word ""nigger"" and how its rooted in the latin for ""black"", thus is the correct word to use to refer to black people. It ignores the charged nature in the words context. Its a semantic argument to get a free pass to use a racist word. 

IT was the same old shit. And fuck anyone who says otherwise. Cunts.

Different tools use different amounts of air, and while the PSI rating will let you know if you can run the tool, the CFM of the pump will let you know how long you can run the tool.

For example my old 20 gallon, half-horsepower air compressor is great for most things like ratchets &amp; nail guns because you typically operate them in short bursts. If I wanted to run something for a long period of time like a cutoff wheel or dual-action sander, I could only use it for a short time before I had to wait for the PSI to recharge because the pump (input) can't match the tools output.

I'm not sure it matters what kind of fabric you use, but I'd stick to natural fibers like cotton, perhaps a light canvas-type fabric. When you start working with nylon and synthetic fabrics, everything gets trickier because the fabric is slippery and it frays a lot more than cottons.

Another thing you need to be careful of is not to use too heavy of a material, in case your friend's sewing machine can't handle it. (Mine can't patch denim.)

Or you could just get a huge piece of red felt, then cut out and glue white felt onto the background. That may just be quicker and easiest. It all depends on what you want. :)

xadriancalim,dating,1389127056.0,"Agreed.  And while you're writing these things out (because I'm sure you'll be back here) try not to assign too much emotion to her.  ""The fire in OUR eyes,"" ""WE both feel the same way.""  You can't know what she feels.  It's perfectly fine to say YOU have these feelings.

What you're doing is setting expectations and she's not living up to them.  Then you get bent out of shape because it's not going your way and then you stare at the phone waiting for something to happen.  Texting is fine for confirming plans, small chit chat.  It is NOT to be used for serious conversations.  Plan to meet, talk it out face to face.  Express your feelings, OWN them, don't regret them.  Then let her TELL you what she's feeling.  Then find a happy place in between.

In the mean time, put your phone somewhere else and go do something productive.  I say this from experience, I did the EXACT SAME thing and it doesn't end well.  Stay away from your phone unless you're making a call to her.  Go exercise or watch a movie or read or paint a few houses in your neighborhood, but stay away from your phone for a while."

I feel like the second you bring in the idea that you are the priority, then you're just setting yourself up for failure. 

I do believe in tit for tat. So I would not go down on a man if he just didn't want to go down on me. But thats not because I'm trying to be mean or insinuate that my pleasure comes first, its to avoid resentment. If I am always giving head but never receiving, I'm gonna be unhappy. But if I don't give or receive, while its not ideal its all bad. I can respect sexual boundaries. 

When we both want oral and are willing to give, I have no problem with him going first or anything like that. I don't keep track. The only thing that matters is that you do your best to reciprocate once in a while.  

As far as the swallowing things go, I've never had a guy expect me to swallow and have been offered tissues or napkins after I'm done (I swallow so I always decline anyways). Even though I'm totally willing to swallow, it is a turn off that its required to some men. Thats a sexual boundary, it should be respected. I feel like with-holding oral all together is akin to punishment in that respect. I mean, I can get the idea because you're swallowing my juices I should swallow yours but I have to say swallowing sperm is a bit different from vaginal juices. Unless she squirts I guess. "

99% eh? Seems like you just made that number up. Just 'cause athletes don't go pro in the States, they also have the opportunity to find another professional league abroad.

So you are telling me no athletes have a social life? So for instance a star quarter back at a school, or a star basketball player won't have social life or won't be invited to parties? I have to be more specific though, the athletes I'm specifically targeting are football and basketball players since those are the most popular college sports.

And if you don't think you athletes AREN'T getting paid under the table then you are terribly misinformed. Yes players have been caught, but it still happens. But at the end of the day, this is suppose to be an Amateur level competition, which means no player is suppose to be paid. Why? Because this is a University, not some place where semi-pro's go just to fuck around in class and train for the pro leagues.

I use to go to a big D-1 school and had class with football players and lived near football players. These players had it fucking good. They lived life with ease and always partied and looked like they never took their academic life seriously. And to say when people play the victim card on them by saying they don't get paid, no time to do anything, or living on the poverty line, that's just ridiculous.

I've been in a lot of abusive relationships, mostly mental/emotional ones, and I've had stalkers too.  Many countless people told me that most of my problems would be solved if I just stopped any and all contact with them.  Don't pick up the phone, don't answer texts/emails, don't log into sites where I'm 'friends' with them, and don't go out of your way to run into them in public or private.  It sounds so simple, but I feel like my naivete made it complicated.  Also, when I was younger, I was one of those people that had to have the last word.  That certainly did not help things, and rather encouraged my exes to further mess with me.  "

* Understanding of digital SLR technology and navigation

* Ability to learn and adapt quickly to new softwares

* How well I pay attention to detail

* My awareness for lighting

Your terminology is wrong.  There is a great spectrum of players and games appeal to a different set of them, but games by and large only fall into 2 categories.  Casual and core, that's it.

TotallyNotSuperman,whowouldwin,1389127612.0,"It depends on if leaving to recover counts as a loss.

If it does, then Hulk is likely to win. He has enough durability and healing to talk what Flash can dish out, and he has punched through dimensions at one point (negating the Speed Force dump). Flash will eventually get tired, but the Hulk won't.

Now, I'm not sure how the speed steal would work on Hulk. When Wally used it on Inertia, he could still think. If Hulk could still think, he would get angry at not moving, and the added rage could very well give his body more energy with which to move. Flash could siphon that energy off too, but he can't keep at it forever. He needs to sleep and eat.

If Flash was allowed to disengage to rest, then we'd be looking at an infinite battle. Flash can't hurt or trap Hulk, and Hulk isn't fast enough to hurt Flash. Whenever he starts to get tired, Flash could go to the other side of the planet to recover. Even destroying the planet wouldn't be enough to defeat Flash, since he's capable of independent dimensional and temporal travel. If Hulk is about to destroy the planet, Flash can just go to a dimension where he didn't."

Professor Minu Sherazi, Professor of Human History at Luna High University.  She first appears in the book in the year 2635, but was born in Palestine (now New Canaan) in 2016.  Her childhood was spent trying to find a way out of there, since the politics and religious strife were nothing but distractions and obstacles to her.  She wanted to be an astronaut, as space was just starting to open up again with the first permanent colony on the Moon, but it quickly transpired that she was terrible at the sciences.  However, it was pointed out to her that soon would come the commercialisation of space, and there were none better than her at knowing what people were thinking, so why not apply that to sales?

She was offered a job at a prestigious New York marketing firm straight out of college (British terminology - i.e. not university) and took her first step on the long road to space.  A couple of years later she was transferred to their office on a Low Earth Orbit station.  There was no artificial gravity in those days, so as soon as they finished constructing The Wheel at Luna High, she applied for residency and got it.  She started her own marketing firm and handled the publicity for Luna's first big pop star, which made her filthy rich.  When artgrav was discovered, she personally contributed 38% of the funding for the conversion of Luna High.

She lived through the Amalgamation, when Earth became one nation whether it liked it or not, but one of the things that robbed from the world for a long time was the ability to be publically homosexual - the more ""enlightened"" nations had to pander to the more repressed ones for there to be any chance of a peaceful merging, and then a couple of generations had to pass before things could relax.  As such, she was alone for decades - the first gay marriage in Luna High occurred on her seventy-fourth birthday.  By that point, she saw no real reason to attempt to find someone, and instead stepped into a cryogenic freezing chamber ten years later, with instructions not to revive her until a: it was possible and b: she could be given back her youth in an open society.

One hundred and thirty years later she woke up, having been treated with a relatively early form of Lazarus Period Increasing Technology (Lazarus PIT), which took five years to regress her age to her mid-twenties.  From then on out, she only aged if she changed the nanites' settings, which she never did.

She found that her vast riches had only expanded over the past century, and she bummed around the solar system for a few years, seeing what she could, experiencing what they'd let her - cloud-diving on Jupiter, micro-gee sex over Venus - and did the interview circuit until people lost interest in revived cryo-travellers.  She returned to Luna High in 2238, did a Master's, followed it up with a Ph.D and took the Professorship at her alma mater.

So yeah, fairly interesting backstory - she's also really fun to write, as she's relatively juvenile but still able to be serious, filthy rich so she can go anywhere and do anything, a disgusting pervert, and extremely playful.  Parts with her in just flow out of my fingers - it's never been that easy to write a character before.

Ostrololo,plotholes,1389127705.0,"No. Pure-blood means exactly that: there's no trace of Muggle blood in your lineage. Here's how your blood status is determined: 

* A pure-blood has *no* ancestors **known** to be Muggle or half-blood.

* A Muggle-born has *no* ancestors **known** to be pure-blood or half-blood.

* A half-blood has either (a) at least one ancestor **known** to be half-blood; or (b) at least one ancestor **known** to be pure-blood and one **known** to be Muggle.

As you can see, it's natural for half-bloods to be the majority, since it's the most encompassing group. Harry is a half-blood because of (b): his maternal grandparents are Muggles, but his father is pure-blood. Harry's children are half-bloods because of (a), since his father is half-blood. In fact, all of Harry's descendants will be half-bloods (excluding the occasional Squib). Pure-blood supremacists advocate that Harry's lineage is forever tainted by his Muggle ancestry.

There's one subtlety: the ""**known**"" that I bolded. Blood status actually has no basis on science and is a pure social construct. *All* pure-bloods have, if you look back enough, at least one Muggle ancestor; it's just that pure-bloods families make an effort to erase that until it's forgotten history. Similarly, Muggle-borns actually have a Squib ancestor; the Squib abandoned the Wizarding world and married a Muggle; generations later, the magic gene resurfaces. So *all* Muggle-borns have at least one wizard ancestor.

Strictly speaking, *all* wizards are half-bloods and the the purity of one's blood has anything to do with one's magical abilities, which is why blood status is undeniably racism."

http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/General_PvP_Strategy

http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/General_PvT_Strategy

http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/General_PvZ_Strategy

So what I ended up doing was thoroughly reading through each of these, taking notes on which units are strong against which, as well as direct counters to certain builds. Based on my notes, I created sort of flow charts that showed specific build orders that can be executed depending on which matchup you've found yourself in and what they've been building. Play as reactively as you can, and find a standard opener against every race. (personally, PvP = 4gate, PvZ = FFE.. dont have PvT worked out quite yet.) Improving your scouting will be essential as well!

I've been trash at this game for a long long time, I think I've won 16 matches in two years. Pretty sick of getting stomped on so I've been doing my best to improve.. this helped me quite a bit, hope it does the same for you!

An adventurous lad could explore the woods in the locale of his neighborhood, and if the gods of woods porn smiled, the intrepid stripling would stumble into a clearing where he would find the remains of a campfire, along with various other mysterious artifacts, including the treasure of a few weathered and wrinkly pages of faded porn magazines. 

The bushes were large, the boobies were au naturale, and the captions, for some mysterious reason, were usually in a foreign language I later decided must have been French.

I was never bold enough to take the treasure home. Instead we would find a likely hidey hole and stash the loot, marking it in hopes of returning the next time we wanted to stand around awkwardly with little pre teen erections looking at the forbidden and mysterious hairy crevices and enormous mammaries until we got uncomfortable enough to decide to stash our secret away for another day.

I think it's this nugget that obscures your point, if that is in fact true. You're framing the problem as within direct control of the victim and even dismissing their status as victim. Based on my own anecdotal experience, most of the victims did nothing to instigate it; all they did was be socially isolated and smaller than their peers. That isn't their fault, though.

The exception to that is that you can request allocation of an array in RAM (there's usually about 2kB of RAM), but that allocation becomes invalid when you finish handling an event and poll for the next one (I think GetNextEvent() is the corresponding call in Windows), as another app can be handed control. That does mean that you have a dangling pointer, and if you haven't cleared up, the other application can see your temp data - a weakness of the model. 

Security rests on a couple of things. There are no user id's applied to the file structure, but access is controlled by a small set of flags (PIN1 entered, PIN2 entered etc. - but some of these don't correspond to any external condition such as the PINs). Access to a file is governed by the file access privileges and the flags with which an application was installed. It's possible to have things like write-only files. A weakness of the model is that there is only this restricted set of flags, so you have to agree who owns these and other resources. This isn't really a security problem, but it's a pain to agree between the parties. One reason that it's not a security problem is that it's a common programming style to hold data only in app variables - which works, because the apps never terminate and Java prevents access  to each other's memory allocation.

How did the apps get on there and get their privilege settings? Well you send a series of structured messages to the SIM (over SMS, or over BIP/GPRS) which are encoded and signed with keys specific to that SIM *and* that ""security domain"" owner. A security domain isn't really a user in the sense we would normally think of, but one security domain can't interpret messages sent for another security domain, and it may have privileges to write an app to flash or modify it, or to create or modify a file. A security domain might be owned by a customer (e.g. a bank) or by the telco, and this is used to insulate them from each other. The initial keys are created by a third party (the smartcard manufacturer) and issued to the domain owner, who can then change them to a new value.

In summary, you have a bit of a mixture. There's no concept of Unix-type users on the SIM, but there are application owners due to the security domains. Used properly, you can ensure that another party's app cannot your data and it generally cannot see the ""proactive commands"" sent to the handset, but as the OS is event-based, a DoS would be trivial and every app can request that they are passed any type of event coming in from the handset. 

Most of these limitations are due to the very primitive OS, so wouldn't affect a big iron OS. My guess is that such OSs have a privileged ""super-root"" which is not accessible to any user but runs system processes, and that admin users can submit requests to this to do things like set up new users and irrevocably hand over resources such as disk space to them, while the OS handles things like setting up fresh crypto material for the new user in a manner inaccessible to the original admin. I have worked on authentication systems which put in Chinese walls like this so that an admin could set up a sub-admin for a new customer in a multi-tenant system, but thereafter could only request summary information. Those particular systems had an underlying database which in principle I could access through Linux root privileges, but it's a valid demonstration of the concept."

You're into guys who are also fit, which means they'll be more likely to appreciate your body and the work you put into making it strong.  Dudes have pretty diverse tastes in women, and no matter how you look, some will be into it and some won't.  Better to do what makes you happy and embrace the results.

namer98,Christianity,1389128401.0,"&gt;I would encourage you to think more on this: If we are justified by the keeping or obedience of the law, then why the strange statement in Genesis 15 about Abraham being righteous for his belief/faith? Why, even for a second, would God say that mere belief (which of course led to right action) is righteousness?

Because being righteous is a good thing, and being righteous does not occur in a vacuum. He was *being* righteous. His faith alone did not bring him to all those actions. Abraham took actions, caused by faith, but actions that should not be discarded or looked down upon.

&gt;Another question, how disobedient must one be before they are considered wicked? If you, yourself, admit that you cannot keep the law perfectly, how can you know if you are righteous enough? To me, the only way around this is by righteousness that comes through faith.

Because we can know God is just and merciful, I don't have to worry about my soul. I know that if I honestly try, I am ok. 

&gt;And again, why would a holy YHVH make a law and not expect you to keep it perfectly?

Do you think God asks more of people than they can give?

&gt; To me, this seems impossible. I cannot believe that the same God who swallowed up the sons of Korah, struck down Nadab and Abihu, and killed David's firstborn did not expect perfection. 

Some infractions do cause death, I won't deny it. 35 of them. (Ok, maybe 36 I forget)

Related to that, the other thing is that I think critics and audiences rate movies based on different criteria. The critics are generally judging whether a movie is good or bad, while everyone else seems to vote based on how much they enjoyed it regardless of quality. I'd guess that's why ""so bad it's good"" movies or mindless movies where you just ""shut your brain off"" that are enjoyable even though they're not actually good can get good ratings from audiences."

BlueBeanstalk,news,1389128455.0,"You act as though this is not the case. There are many departments, mine included, that will throw you under the bus in a *heartbeat* the moment an officer screws up in any major way. 

The way this is being handled right now is through two separate investigations. One is going to be an in-house administrative investigation, where the officers involved in the death operate under Garrity, which is somewhat the opposite of Miranda. These officers are required to answer all questions posed to them, and any deceit or refusal to answer are taken as an admission of guilt and the appropriate sanctions (termination) will be taken. The reason it is considered paid leave is due to innocent until proven guilty, because we do not want to penalize an officer and their family if it turns out a shooting like this is justified. 

You also need to consider good-faith acts by the police. If an officer is given information that leads them to make the decision to arrest someone, and it turns out that information is tainted in some way, and you can show the officer did not know the information was tainted, then the liability on the officers part is removed. 

All of this aside, regardless of if an officer is protected or not protected by a department, there is not an immunity against civil litigation by the public against an individual officer. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that if an officer is a ""bad apple"", they *will* get punished in some way. The media is quick moving and sensationalist, so you hear about the officer who shoots a restrained subject, but you don't hear a headline story on how he is terminated six months later after the investigations find him at fault. 

Finally, you need to realize that no two officers are the same. You have the officer who will find every relevant charge to put on an arrested individual (crossing the middle of the street from a bar to a cab and arresting the subject for Unlawful Pedestrian in the Roadway, and Drunkeness). And then you have the officer who will give you warnings at any chance he or she can. But this is the problem with posts like this. People look at individual instances of police misconduct around the world and make a decision that ALL police are as bad or worse than the criminals we are here to catch. And it is because we are all high-school dropouts who couldn't make an honest wage flipping burgers or something of that sort.

hermithome,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1389128542.0,"I'd recommend replacing the corner desk with a secretary desk/bookcase top. Something like [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Eastlake-1880-Walnut-Cylinder-or-Barrel-Roll-Top-Secretary-Desk-Bookcase-/110991897413?pt=Antiques_Furniture&amp;hash=item19d7a1f345). A couple discrete cuts in the back of the secretary desk will allow all the necessary wiring to go through and it's a nice way to have a work station that's both compact and beautiful. The one I linked to is super pricy, but this is the kind of thing you should be able to get locally for not too much money if you check some antique stores and some craigslist ads.

If you can find a vintage mental cabinet, that might work really well with your design. [This](http://www.etsy.com/listing/117882694/large-vintage-file-cabinet-with-storage) example is a bit too large for the space, but it gives you a general idea. You may also find that a [horizontal file cabinet](http://assets.dutchcrafters.com/product_images/pid_3344-Amish-Lateral-File-Cabinet-15.jpg) works really well. I love horizontal filing cabinets, though it depends on how you use them. You can also always add shelves on top of a horizontal cabinet which is nice.

Main desk. Well, you definitely need a grown up desk. You can go the proper desk route and get a nice vintage desk, beautiful wood. But think about doing something about bit different. Like an awesome [terrarium desk](http://www.pinterest.com/danielzeller/terrarium-work-desk/). You're office really does need some green, and terrariums are awesome. But if you don't go that route, get some sort of terrarium for your desk. You can get all sorts of cool ones, like [an Ewok terrarium](https://www.etsy.com/listing/114570072/star-wars-cube-terrarium-with-vintage), [a hobbit hole terrarium](https://www.etsy.com/listing/164592898/ooak-miniature-custom-hobbit-house-lord) or these [cool ecospheres](http://eco-sphere.com/product-info.html). Also back to the usual desk, you can make one. I mean, doing it from scratch might be a lot of work, but you could also get an awesome wood desk with a glass-top and take the glass off and put gears in it, or maps. Something a bit like [this](http://makezine.com/2008/06/19/dale-mathis-wickedcool-ge/). Or you could take one of those curio tables with lots of little sections, and put all sorts of cool things in the little boxes and put a glass top on. That would be really really awesome. If you're going to do it from scratch, you could get awesome natural tree for legs. [Example 1](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Natural-Unfinished-Teak-Root-Console-Table-with-Glass-Top-from-Brookstone-/181073784535) and [example 2](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Wood-Cross-section-Console-Table-w-Glass-Top-Modern-Stylish-Free-Shipping-New-/191026058711)

If you want the map to be a bit more personalised, here's an etsy seller who does [custom map inserts into clocks](http://www.etsy.com/listing/104498649/custom-map-bicycle-clock-large-size). Other clock recommendations are [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TNU68E) and [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188BV1U), though those are a bit expensive. You can also go for the gear look in a more modern way, like with this [auto-timing chain and gear wall clock](http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/auto-timing-chain-and-gears-wall-clock).

[Vintage roller skate bookends](http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/vintage-roller-skate-bookends) - these would be particularly nice on open valance above the window, I agree with /u/G0ATLY's suggestion about window dressing.

Don't give up! IT guy and not getting an employment? Improve your skills meantime, learn something which has a necessary demand now within IT. My friend (IT guy) waited months to find a job, found it eventually and it was a decent job. While doing it (or possibly before even finding that job) he said to me something like ""I am going to learn new programming language"". I've asked, for the purpose of a new job, where he replied, no, I like learning new things within my industry and you never know when it may be required. Since then he changed his job for even better.

You can also share of flat (if you're not doing that already) and even share a room with somebody.

Fortunately I didn't have to use Jobcentre I found jobs via a family (he quit his job and suggested I could apply for his position), via advert on the place or again via friend's recommendation."

Esoteric_Indulgence,truegaming,1389128630.0,"I think complaining in general seems to be a cultural phenomena (among other things). I used to work for an EU-based company that was producing the same MMO as a US-based company. The content of the game itself was largely the same, but when I looked at the EU community versus the US community, there were a lot more gamers complaining on the US side. This is not to say that the EU community never complained, it just seemed that when they did complain, it was over something that was especially crucial to gameplay or community engagement. Every time I visited the US community site, there were guaranteed to be complaint threads about every topic imaginable, even over the tiniest insignificant details. If I had been an average gamer browsing MMO communities, I think the mentality in the US community would have effectively deterred me from joining that game. It just looked like if anyone had something to say, it had to be something negative.

Since having that experience, and since I actually also live in the US, I have to honestly say that I am a complainer too. It seems to me that a large part of it is my culture. If you asked me what I have to complain about, I guarantee you that I could find something in under .5 seconds regardless of how inconsequential or trivial it was. But I'm more self-conscious about it now and I try really hard not to complain if I can help it. If I'm going to voice discontent, it should be over something worth the effort."

I never saw him as a black-and-white villain, which is one reason this movie is so great.  Characters are rich and don't have to be evil to be antagonists.  

But he was definitely out to kill Ramius - not capture him - which I think suggests that he knew Ramius was trying to defect.  If he was going rogue, capture would ostensibly be a possibility; if he was defecting, he'd be facing death on capture so there's no way he would surrender.  Also, Ramius was widely known by the other Soviet sub captains so lying to them would probably be pretty transparent anyway.  

It's interesting to think about, but I'm of the opinion Tupolev knew he was defecting."

Or it is talking about peace, a lack of war. Salvation *from war*. Being saved *from physical distress*. This is a common theme with David. Even your verse with Jonah talks about it. I am saying David wanted to see a lasting peace, and never really did. That was why his son, a king of peace, was the one to build the Temple.

People have always said we were ""soulmates"" and meant to be together, but I honestly don't think I believe in soulmates.

Yes.  Just provide a card that says ""We're so glad we could get together with all of our family to celebrate your big day.  Having such a lovely vacation didn't seem in the budget, but we made it work because you're that important to us!"" or something.

&gt;  Is this normal? 3 parties?!

Not really.  I guess an engagement party, wedding shower, and hen party would be normal?  But personally I think those parties are a way for folks to celebrate and potentially provide gifts; if she's not asking for gifts, she just wants to celebrate with her friends, but if she doesn't have that many friends (and no female friends), I don't even know who she's inviting to these parties.  I would think the local one would be enough (and MAYBE the one at the destination).

&gt;  Do I just come out and say that she can deal with this one?
Yes.  Tell her with all the money going toward these travel plans for your family, as well as planning your own wedding and living your life, you don't have the time or money to plan this event for her.


It's important that you're direct and clear with her.  Your reasons for not helping/paying for things are that you cannot afford the time or energy, as you're planning your own wedding and dealing with a new home.  She should understand this, and if she doesn't (and throws a fit), there's not much else you can do, other than assure her that you do love her and her wedding WILL be awesome, but you cannot plan things for her."

Because I was seeing someone else at the time, and I couldn't return the feelings.  I asked him why he told me so quickly, later on, and he thought it wasn't that soon.  We had been friends for 1-2 years by then, and he said he couldn't hold back anymore.

After we got together, I was the one who wasn't sure if I loved him....I had a lot of reservations; I have to see a future with the guy, and it took me maybe...2 months to sort that out.  He was patient, though, and I recall him saying, ""You don't have to say it back.  I can see it in your eyes, in the way you look at me, even if you won't say it out loud.""

My ex-boyfriend, my first boyfriend, he had forbidden the both of us to say ""I love you"" until we were both in a place where we could...for lack of a better way to put it, get married.  We were young, he was still in school with no income.  I wanted to say those 3 words somewhere between 3-6 months in, and for the first year of our relationship.  He said I love you after 2 years, out of the blue.  And that was nice, but it was too late."

Ignoring any and all traffic signals, merging without warning, not checking mirrors before a merge and almost hitting me multiple times per trip, pedestrians just wandering out into the road randomly and almost getting hit, driving below the speed limit in every lane on both surface streets and the interstate, driving in two lanes at once, swerving back and forth across three lanes of traffic due to texting on their phones, randomly stopping in the middle of the road, a total inability to drive on wet streets (which is bad because it rains a lot there), it just goes on.  During the entire 700 mile trip back home, every time there was a traffic snarl on the interstate, we'd take bets on whether it was a Florida plate causing it, and every single time it was until we got back to Tennessee, which is apparently beyond their range."

mrcleanup,rpg,1389128908.0,"To be fair, sometimes we just misjudge. Do we scream at reality with impotent rage, on our knees with our fists raised to the rain as lightning flashes above us? Well perhaps in movies.

But I know my group can be a bit thick sometimes. Let's consider the possibility that the DM is doing things appropriately and the players are just too caught up in their preconceived notions that they aren't really looking at what the DM is putting in front of them.

I ran a quest one time where every time the players opened a door I asked if they checked for traps, which way they turned the key in the lock, and whether they *touched* when they searched something or just looked and where they stepped. This was a dungeon designed to kill, and I knew it, so I was foreshadowing for them that these were important by asking. They got annoyed at me... until it started to matter, and when the rogue put on a necklace of strangulation without letting the wizard check it first... you couldn't hold that against me. And after that they got a lot more cautious.

My group didn't expect these kinds of things because we don't normally do that kind of dungeon, and we take turns DMing. Our normal pattern did not require the level of paranoia that this dungeon did.

If the DM has made an error at this point it has most likely been that there is a pattern to the encounters that has set up a set of expectations, and not necessarily that he has been delinquent in this specific instance. We are creatures of habit they expect what has happened in the past to happen in the future."

You're absolutely right; I'm not mad they called, I just thought they had really misunderstood the realities of the safe temperature range for that dog. Animal control, when they called, basically laughed with us because they knew full well that a Husky outside in the winter isn't cause for alarm....they just had to follow up. 

Maybe MORE to the point, OP's neighbors aren't just leaving their dogs outside. They are leaving their dogs outside, restrained (a bad idea), seemingly without a water source outside of snow (a bad idea), and being generally lackadaisical about their care. That's a completely separate situation

I never have temperature concerns with a Husky but I do worry about their ability to get to water. The dog we got called about was half Shepard and just massive; you'd have to physically pull her out of the snowbanks because that is just where she wanted to be in the winter. My Border Collie mix, on the other hand, is probably going to get some boots and a winter coat pretty soon because she loves doing mountain hikes but I worry for her paws/body temp when she's out in the elements for 4+ hours. Even in the bitterest cold my Husky will move out of the sun to a shadier snow bank to nap so that pretty much tells me all I need to know about his temperature preferences. "

When you're tall and walk into an interview, it's immediately noticed, often as the first (and defining) characteristic about you. Sometimes it'll be a disadvantage, sometimes it'll be a boost, but either way it's going to be the feature that initially defines you.

For ongoing success, I've found that while giving presentations or going into group meetings, it's better if I can get there early and don't have to stand up (getting around the stand to shake hands part is tricky). People seem to retain what I say better when their not distracted by my height; after the fact you can stand and let their perception of you be adjusted, but at least at that point they've already made a judgement based on the quality of your work, not on your appearance.  Especially in team settings, where being tall sets you apart, rather than makes you part of a group.

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1389129370.0,"It's important, and I'm with the current ""trend"" that believes it is, but personally having a hard time with it.  I grew up in a big household mentality, living with not just immediate but extended family.  They're all also pretty traditional, and surprisingly, even my very liberal older sister believes one should wait till marriage before actually living with another.....I should note, she's not against sleeping over at the guy's place for days.  But that one should always have their own apartment to retreat to, if need be, before marriage.  If she could afford it, I'm sure she'd want to keep her apartment even after marriage :P  She'll have her bastion of privacy.

I've been arguing lately with my mom, after I told her I planned to move out with my boyfriend (together for a year now).  She sent me a long email yesterday, talking about why cohabitation before marriage is a terrible idea.

Here is a small portion of her email.

*""You will be the one left holding the bag, at a time wherein it will be harder to find a life partner - as women 
age, there are less and less men available to marry.
And you are no longer young.
The men, no matter how old ( even at age 60 ) they are have no problem looking for a wife.*
 
*It's also very easy to leave a girlfriend who co-habited with the guy, than it is to divorce - since from the beginning 
of the relationship, both sides are fully aware that there are no commitments, no permanence, no stability, etc.*
 
*And unlike marriage wherein the guy you'll marry will  be considered as family by us, a live in boyfriend is
not considered family at all. 
There is nothing that will bind us to this guy.
Cohabitation is taboo to the Chinese - more so to my family.
How will I tell them ?*
 
*And if there are children - what kind of home and stability are you giving your future children?*
 
*Do you feel comfortable introducing him as your boyfriend while you're co-habiting?
Wouldn't you feel more proud and legitimate, that you can introduce him as your husband ?*
 
*Furthermore, don't you think anyone who marries you is very lucky, that you deserve stability and permanence ?
That you're worth the commitment of a marriage ?""*

I think she does raise some legit questions.  I don't really know what to do.  I had a talk with my boyfriend, and due mostly to financial issues...I think we're not going to be moving any time during this beginning half of the year, at least.  I may, however, pseudo-move in and bring a bunch of clothes and crap to his place, and stay there like half the week.  I'm already kinda doing that but without the convenience of having any stuff there, aside from make up remover and tampons."

Look up the really early steam engines - they were extremely low-tech, enormous, very slow, and not very powerful.  They tended to have a single piston which moved once every couple of minutes.  A train, on the other hand, would have had at least two very compact pistons (which would have needed to be kept at least somewhat synchronised), and a boiler capable of making high-pressure enough steam to slam them in and out almost faster than the eye can see.  We're talking high-precision engineering to limit the loss of steam and pressure, and high-quality smelting to make metal that can actually withstand that.  It's possible that you could make something like Stephenson's Rocket during the Renaissance, but there wouldn't be any Flying Scotsmen."

They are in people's yards, sides of the highway and through just about every forest you walk through or drive by. On top of that, there are these incredible abandoned houses/foundations/fireplaces deep in the forests along with old logging trails/roads. The abandoned houses are amazing, sometimes they are found when a new construction project happens, they clear the forest and bam, 100-year-old vine covered house appears. I remember finding broken old signs posted on trees in the middle of the woods marking something that no longer existed, always was fun to find.

Anyway, glad to see this study being done. I always tell people the forests are new growth here, many with origination dates in the 20s - 40s, which is hard to believe because the forests have come back big time. Paintings of my town from 1900 show barren farms all the way to the ocean, now you can only see the horizon if you are at the beach. The soil here is incredibly fertile and the climate is outstanding for growing, hence why all this stuff is ""lost.""

To shower the bride with gifts!  I think your mom or FMIL is usually the host (sometimes sisters or BMs, but they tend to do the bachelorette party instead).

I think Bridal showers are for the older crowd.  My friends will be at my bachelorette party, but there's no time (other than the wedding) to celebrate with my older family members.  This is the only reason I could see doing a bridal shower, but I don't have a lot of older women in my life, and even making it coed wouldn't be very large, so I don't think it's worth the time, effort, and money it would take to plan the party."

Brienne has the body, the skill-set, the work ethic, the determination, the honor, and the guts, but she has all of that from the unfortunate circumstances of her life and how she's developed as she's grown. 

Now, Arya has many of the same things from the circumstances of her life. 

What's the difference between them then? Why do I choose Arya as the most bad-ass? 

Because Brienne is a reluctant pawn of her circumstances. In her heart of heart, she yearns for a different life. 

In Arya's heart, there is stone and certain justice delivered with a patience that belies her years and does her family proud. She is the embodiment of the name, Stark.

WinterCharm,apple,1389129591.0,"Advanced Materials researcher here :) 

**Aluminum**

1. Aluminum is lighter than most metals, and pretty rigid when compared to plastics
2. A unibody of aluminum allows for better sturdiness than a plastic jigsaw of puzzle pieces - those tend to creak and bend and fall apart. 
3. Aluminum is a fantastic conductor of heat. This enables apple's MacBooks to be thinner than plastic variants could ever comfortably be (and if they were, the air coming out would be searing hot, and the plastic would be too thin). The aluminum acts as a heat sink, dissipating heat to the environment, allowing fans to run cooler and quieter. 
4. Aluminum is soft enough to be precision machined, allowing for a great finish, and a good fit of all parts. 
5. it has a low coefficient of thermal expansion - allowing it to be unibody without expanding so much that it would stress parts that are screwed into the chassis - like the main board, etc.  

**Plastic** 

1. Easy to cast
2. Very cheap to make, process. 
3. Can be lighter than aluminum, depending on the grade
4. Resistant to dents (alu, and other metals dent easily, but don't crack. Plastics crack, but don't dent) 
5. terrible heat sink, prone to melting if overheated. 

**Magnesium alloys** 

1. Lighter than aluminum
2. can be easily injection molded like most plastics
3. Stronger than most plastics, but NOT as strong as aluminum (Aluminum is almost twice as strong in terms of a young's modulus.
4. Not as heat conductive as aluminum - so it's not as good a heat sink. About 45 W/m*K vs Aluminum's 205 W/m*k. 
5. It's naturally EMI shielding - moreso than aluminum. The macbook pros can have wifi antennas directly behind the thin aluminum lids of their machines. doing this with a magnesium alloy would reduce Wifi Performance. A plastic ""antenna port"" would be required on the external of the device. 
6. It's WIDELY available - 1 cubic mile of seawater contains about 12 BILLION pounds of magnesium.

**Tl;Dr:** 

Plastic sucks, but doesn't dent. 
Mg alloys somewhat better than plastic, but block wireless signals too much. 
Aluminum is far superior in almost every way, but more expensive. 


**Some additional random info, if I haven't managed to bore you yet**

1. If you wanted to strengthen the current aluminum unibodies, I'd suggest adding about 2% vanadium - vanadium is quite expensive, but Alu-Ti-V alloys are used in jet engine single crystal turbine blades because of how ridiculously rigid and strong/light they are. 

2. I would *love* to see apple do single crystal unibodies out of Al-V-Ti superalloys, but a BMG type liquid metal alloy is the next logical step, because purified vanadium costs $22,000.00 per Kg. o_o.

3. Bulk metallic glasses (like LiquidMetal™ which apple has bought rights to for consumer electronics uses) are great, because they are rigid like plastics (they don't dent) and are EXTREMELY rigid - almost as much as sapphire or diamond, and strong - more so than titanium and steel. They are a material of the future, though, because we still haven't really figured out how to cool them while molding quickly enough for large scale objects - this is needed to make unibody MacBooks or iPhones out of them. The only reason that SIM ejector tool is liquid metal is because it's thin enough that it can be supercooled during processing, and that itself was a trial run. we'll get there but it'll take time. 

4. Vanadium hardened steel is used in critical engine components like the crankshafts of almost every single car out on the road today. 

Hope this helps :) Feel free to ask more questions :)

BlueBeanstalk,news,1389129615.0,"And I agree completely, but as an internal investigation committee, this is as far as their power extends in this situation. 

Remember, if someone kills another person, regardless of circumstance, it is a homicide. The prosecutor will make the determination of what the state believes to be the level of the homicide. If the shooting is considered ""good"", and the killing was done only as a last resort and was justified, then the homicide would be Justifiable Homicide and no charges would be filed by the state. 

If the killing is not determined to be Justifiable, then the Prosecutor must determine what level it is. These change based on the state but they typically can be broken down into 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree manslaughter, reckless or negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter, and some states have even more distinctions. 

All of this is determined by a criminal investigation, and the appropriate penalties are applied if a conviction is found. However, as far as the administrative side is for IA, they can fire the officer and make it almost impossible to be employed as an LEO again."

jm434,vegan,1389129907.0,"I don't really have any resources as I just figured things out on my own.

I have noticed when searching for 'eco-freindly' web shops that they tend to be more prevalent in america so I'm sure if you search around you'll find something. 


Essentially you just want to avoid buying brand new as much as possible. Go to the US equivalent of charity shops for clothes and use ebay/craigslist/amazon used sections.

If you do buy new try and buy products which were sustainable sourced, there is a british clothing company that uses renewable energy, sustainably sourced materials and ships (they typically have a lower footprint than planes) so I'm sure you'll find american ones.

Try and avoid buying out of season fruit/veg and if you can buy them without packaging (I go to a food market with my own bags and avoid the sellers which sell produce in plastic containers/bags). 

Bulk buy dried food like rice, beans, pulses etc as then there is less packaging and less transportation involved. I have a 10kg bag of 'broken' basmati rice (consists of all the rice bits that don't make the cut, but personally is exactly the same if less visually pleasant). Even using on average a cup a day that 10kg bag lasts for a solid 7-8months.  

If you can kick the habit of owning physical books then move to digital or just rent from a library, in many cases you can pirate digital books as well saving you even more. 

If you can buy recycled toilet roll, kitchen roll, stationary. Avoid buying flowers and occasion cards (those are SUCH a waste, and if you think about it, no great loss because how often do you *actually* cherish a dieing plant or a commercialized piece of card?) or gimmick gifts. Personally I don't get/receive gifts at all but I'd imagine you wouldn't have that luxury. 

Avoid having too many baths and try and limit your showers to 5-10minutes long (that might be impractical if you're a woman, but at least make your shower time shorter). When using the bathroom/kitchen sinks you could always capture the cold water before it turns hot (if that's a thing over there) and then use that to water the garden/manually flush the toilet.

It might seem unsanitary but you really don't need to shower any more than once a day, sometimes even once every two days unless you sweat a lot or do any physical exertion. Also it's unnecessary to flush after every time you pee, you can let it sit for a few times first. My previous housemates and I had a policy of 'if it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown flush it down'.

Try and look for more natural, handmade hygiene products, though if you're using vegan products then that should be fine. Though I only shower with water (as I said, allergies) I use solid deodorant (this is a UK [example](https://www.lush.co.uk/product/35/100g-Aromaco-Solid-Deodorant-)) as they use less water in their manufacturing and you have the advantage of them being airline safe, so also look for solid shower wash.

err that's all I can think of at the moment.   "

Gobizku,fatpeoplestories,1389129964.0,"You clearly have no idea what you're talking about if this is what you think.

There's two main focal points of PUA.  Inner game and outer game.  Inner game is improving yourself, to become a more attractive person.  Overcoming things like shyness, anxiety, valuing your own time, and in general learning how to be a more confident and successful person.  These are things that many people innately struggle with that cause self-esteem issues (which many label as unattractive, whether they'll admit it or not).

Outer game is things like how you dress, how you start conversations, and make up the bulk of how others initially perceive you.

At no point is anyone taught to be bitter, nasty, or to despise the opposite gender (or same gender for someone who is gay).  PUA is just a set of skills that will make you more attractive if done correctly.  What the individual person does with that is up to them, and certainly can be used by hateful people, but to group all people who are trying to better themselves as such is pure bullshit.

So no, they really aren't the same.  That goes for negging too.  Negging and skinny bashing are not the same in any capacity.  Thinking they are only furthers my point that you don't understand the purpose of either well enough to have an informed opinion on it."

kiwirish,CFB,1389129979.0,"QB: B+. Hill wasn't really great but played hard and well all season, improved a lot, has a better arm, and has a bright future ahead.

RB: B. When your leading rusher is a QB, it often means they've outshone you, but Jamaal was a strong weapon this year and help from Lasike and other RBs made our offense a lot better than 2012s.

OL: C-. Terrible at giving us protection, bailed out by Hill being a great runner. That UVa game was absolutely terrible. Nearly a fail. Learn to fucking not false start every play.

WR: C+. Did the job well enough and we never had a QB with a precise arm, but too many dropped catches that were crucial.

DL: B. No improvement from 2012 and 2013 but the DL was strong this year. Although Kaufusi's bone headed moves against UW has made some enemies.

LB: A. Bye bye Van Noy, it's been an honour watching you play. KVN has always kept our LB unit scary, and one  of the best in the nation.

DB: C. Run coverage was alright but injuries were everywhere to start off with. Pass defense was shocking, Bronco needs to sort that shit out or we'll be exposed by any team with a half decent air attack. 

K: A. We actually made Field Goals this year!

P: B. Meh, usually good but terrible in the bowl game.

KR/PR: Nothing of note really. C+."

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1389130004.0,"&gt;Exactly how should I short-sell BTC?

I believe Mt. Gox allows for this.  Or maybe BitStamp.  Certainly, an exchange exists that allows you to short sell.  

&gt;This volatility exists not because the currency is young, but rather because this volatility is inherent to the protocol.

I don't see how you reach this conclusion.  Why doesn't Gold or Silver swing so much?  

I reason that the swings are due to the youthfulness of the currency.  In 50 years, the 'future' of Bitcoin won't be so uncertain.  The idea, by that time, will be played out.  Either it will be considered a valuable commodity, and the price will fluctuate similar to that of Gold, or the use of BTC will be outlawed globally, and the price will have plummeted to near $0.

If sex is all about living within your means, and abortion is ""passing the buck"", are there any situations that do allow for the buck to be ""passed""? Should relatives of people who require very expensive medical care who can't afford it themselves, be obligated to keep them alive no matter what the cost? What about brain-dead children or disabled spouses? If you ""need to able to afford for all possible outcomes"", should we ban couples with histories of illness or a high likelihood of expensive medical conditions from having children? What if they have loads of money to afford the treatment?

If I said to you that I jerk it to videos of brothers raping their sisters with a horse cock from my little pony while being peed on by a moose wearing a nurse's outfit, you'd say ""ummm, okay, that's never going to happen, and it's a kind of odd fetish.""

Where it starts to cross into gray is when the fantasy/fetish might be a little more obtainable.  If the dude is into his sister, well, that's a little more obtainable.  You start to question if the opportunity presented itself would he do it?

It's the same concept as the argument about ""non-practicing"" pedophiles.

nappythrill22,49ers,1389130486.0,"The main reason we could not produce offensively when we played the panthers in week 10 was a poor adjustment to the defensive sets we were facing.

Depending on down and distance, traditionally when a team blitzes it's *whole* front 7, the safeties (who are in a cover 2 zone) will play up (press) to prevent the quick slant dump offs (which are the best way to neutralize a full 7 blitz). Seattle did this to us with devastating effectiveness. When the safeties do that, they risk having their outside CBs get beaten downfield one-on-one. Meaning that if protection can hold for *just a second*, the QB can float a pass long for a favorable one-on-one match up on a smaller CB. Seattle can get away with that because the CBs are big, and the best in the NFL.

**HOWEVER**, in week 10 the panthers chose to drop the cover 2 safeties deep, to give deep help over the top of their CBs to prevent long completions, while still blizing 6 or 7. This coverage package leaves massive openings behind the LBs which can be easily exploited with quick slants over the middle. They did this on **almost every defensive snap of the 2nd half!!** It was a big gamble that we never used against them. Their D coordinator was basically daring us to run something to exploit that. We ran a total of 2 plays designed to beat that, and we beat it both times. Once was a quick slant for 9 or 10 yds to Mario Manningham for a 1st down, and the second was a 3rd and 12 (had been 3rd and 7 prior to FS penalty) where Frank got 10 yds, but was short of LTG. Whether Roman wasn't calling the plays to exploit it, or whether Colin wasn't audible-ing to change the play call, doesn't matter *that* much. The point is, if we don't exploit the opportunities *given* to us, we will never be able to control clock, and gain 1st downs.

If we see those sets again, and *DO* exploit them, it will force the panthers LBs to back off, which opens up holes for Gore in the running and read-option run game. Read option cant do anything against a full front 7 blitz, and we need to learn that before Sunday."

the purpose is this. some submissions are faulty and of those some get removed and others can remain, be flagged as faulty and be fixed by the submitter after a mod request.

There is more to women than age and the fact they are women to consider. Whats her job, what is her cultural background, is she a daughter, mother, cousin etc?  

You are looking at women through their age when there is so much more. Women are after all people. Consider what kind of women you have dated, where you looked (or where they looked for you). Maybe change your habits if you want to look for a woman your age who you can accept. 

As a woman in her early 20's, whose boyfriend is almost 30, had he ever mentioned to me that he didn't find women his age attractive because older women are fillintheblank that would be a red flag to me. Just as if I said something like that to him, that should be a red flag to him.

Dimethyltrip_to_mars,LetsTalkMusic,1389130974.0,"agreed. most people fawning over dilla didn't know who he was until after he died. i had a chance to see him at a album release store signing in Atlanta the week before he died, but I was barely interested, and even then in 2006, most of the rap message boards I frequented weren't really concerned with Dilla's releases, outside of maybe Jaylib.

praise to producers is common, but the amount of praise dilla gets over most other producers for making sample filled beats with non-quantized kicks is a but much.

the one thing not being pointed out here is that the massive sampling allowance is due to the album being released on an indie label, and flying under the radar. there are thousands upon thousands of dilla fans, and probably more fans than people that actually purchased the album. 
i can't find any sales numbers via billboard, and that only furthers my statement that overall it was a low-selling indie album. low selling indie albums have the same advantage of all rap albums made pre-1991 or so, in that sampling laws weren't being pursued for the most part, as they probably weren't even in existance yet.

probably the first time i heard someone mention the word ""sample"" in a rap song was probably Stetsasonic's ""Talkin All That Jazz"", from 1988, but even in 1989, ""Paul's Boutique"" did way more sampling than Donuts, yet some sample sources not as lengthy, but to this day gets grandfathered in an allowance to have a sample-heavy album for retail, even with reissues.  

""Donuts"" would have never been released on a major label. Even if samples would go unnoticed by the original artists for whatever reason (ignorance to rap, artist being dead, etc), the lawyers and clearance people at the major labels wouldn't allow the album a go-ahead in the first place. 

Sometimes things slip, and you have people like the jazz artist that tried suing the Beastie Boys for ""Pass The Mic"" over a decade after ""Check Your Head"" first hit the shelves, but even that is kind of rare.

One thing to check on this bike: I understand that there is an oil strainer (a fine wire mesh) behind the oil pump which has to be cleaned when the bike is serviced. This is not the same as the oil filter. Check the manual and the owners clubs rather than taking my word for it, as I haven't done that particular job.

The reason it is important is that this engine has a nasty habit of blowing its big end bearings (this kills the engine). The factory service instructions didn't mention the strainer, and over time it clogs up and stops the oil flow. I had a Z250A3, which had a smaller version of the engine. It died.

I mean literally what is the difference here? What if you knew for a fact she is unwavering in this new mindset and would never change? 

Take a woman who has had many sex partners in the past, had a revelation, and now it's been years and years with this new mindset to have this connection. Now take another woman who has never had sex, hasn't really been presented with it, never cared much for sex, but a day before you met her, she decided if she ever were to have sex, it should be special (the same mindset as yours).

Omega037,changemyview,1389131175.0,"&gt; Lincoln used a lot of political tools to placate the slavery loving people in the country for the time being but make no mistake: slavery was always coming to an end in the US.  Lincoln did really want to end it and any bargains he offered were to slowly ease the south into that change and not to avoid the change altogether.

What Lincoln wanted or whether slavery was destined to fail is completely irrelevant to this discussion.  You asserted that the North attacked the South in order to stop slavery, but that doesn't match any of the facts at the time.  Slavery certainly caused the South to secede, but it was not the driving motivation of the North at that time.  

&gt; The south wouldn't have seceded were it not for Slavery and the north wouldn't have fought were it not for slavery.

So you are saying that if the South had tried to leave for an issue unrelated to slavery (like perhaps a disagreement over involvement in the Mexican-American War), the North would never have attacked?

Unless you believe that the North would have let the South secede amicably for another reason, then the reason they seceded doesn't actually matter.  Their policy was to prevent secession, and it was that policy that turned the secession into a war.

&gt; No matter how you slice it slavery was the defining feature of the civil war and is deeply connected to every issue regarding the war.

I have never said that slavery wasn't an issue even the defining feature of the war.  However, to say that it alone was the cause of the war ignores the fact that the North had a decision to act or not.

This is no different than Japan in WWII.  Did Japan *have* to attack Pearl Harbor?  If so, then it was our decision to embargo oil that was the *cause* of the war between the US and Japan.  However, if you believe Japan did not *have* to attack the US, then the decision to do so itself was the cause."

In my experience, the vast majority of players like to feel badass. They don't like feeling challenged or that they're in over their head. If you give them a puzzle that seems a /little/ hard to you, then you've probably just put an obstacle in the way of them feeling badass.

If you have someone in your party who's very good at difficult puzzles, then throwing those puzzles at the party will let that one player feel badass for a bit. However, if you throw several simple puzzles around for everyone else, and a difficult puzzle specifically for the puzzle-guy, then the whole party is more likely to enjoy themselves.

My rule of thumb is that I try to only throw in challenging encounters and puzzles for boss encounters, or scenes that are meant to be the capstone of the adventure."

Drop_,CrohnsDisease,1389131319.0,"For me it's things like milk products, nuts, and sugars as far as food goes, and stress is definitely a contributing factor (every flare I've had has been during a high stress period).  

The thing is though that for most people if foods can trigger it is a personal thing and while some foods are very common in terms of what triggers a flare for people (milk products seem to be the most common).   But others report high fiber foods causing problems for example.  

The difficulty is that most medicine is generalized medicine and based on guidelines.  So when researchers are looking into what might cause problems they are generally looking for generalized things (i.e. most crohn's sufferers can't eat X food).  some foods are somewhat generalizeable, but it's not universal and in general foods which are ""easy to digest"" tend to be recommended (white breads, rice, peanut butter, bananas, etc.) but that doesn't necessarily mean they work for everyone.  

But since it's so personal it's difficult to get scientific evidence that food has an impact on things like flares.  But if you ask most people with Crohn's or UC who have had it for a while they will probably tell you there are foods they essentially have to avoid.  

I guess this is a long roundabout way of saying that while there is no scientific evidence that stress or particular foods exacerbate symptoms of crohn's, that doesn't mean that on a personal individual level foods or stress do not have an impact for you.  

I would really recommend keeping a food journal and trying an elimination diet, or one of the more popular diets for crohn's / UC sufferers, along with keeping a food journal.  "

As a software engineer, it depends on what work needs to be split up, and the current design of the code. I have worked on some projects where adding multi-processor support was trivial because the code was written in a way that lent itself to easy modification in that regard, and other times I have had to do extensive rewrites in order to get basic threading working.

It also depends on what is deemed beneficial for such things, and that can only be determined after a lot of testing and profiling. It could be that simply offloading short-running tasks onto a background threadpool works well enough.

There is also the potential, if you try to parallelize too much, that you actually lose performance trying to divide up work too much (for lack of a better, easily understood way of putting it) because it can get difficult to properly track process scheduling and manage resource contention.

I obviously haven't seen the code myself, but if it is a decently well written engine it likely wouldn't be a massive undertaking to do it. Most of the time taken would be in the profiling and making sure that anything offloaded from the primary thread ends up actually being beneficial for performance.

Real harm can and does occur for individuals who have their names released. There are plenty of cases of people incurring not only social and financial harm, but also physical harm and sometimes death due to wrongful accusations. That is why I think that no one should have their name revealed before a verdict is presented. Now, I would blame the media for publicizing people when crimes are committed, rather than calling for police conspiracy right off the bat."

Uh, you just spent the entire article describing how it *doesn't* work anymore for non-wealthy Americans. And when China and India reach the same level of development as the US and Western Europe, what do you think's going to happen? They're going to follow exactly the same path that's been followed here: export the cheap labor and the pollution elsewhere (probably Africa), using the leverage they gain that way to strip away any protections and living wages that workers in China and India have managed to accrue by that time, and let income inequality skyrocket again.

Decreasing poverty and income inequality are nothing more than a middle phase of capitalism; they're most certainly not its end state."

zjpeters,AskFeminists,1389131607.0,"I think this has good intent with poor execution. For instance, I'm a male, but I have been knitting since I was a wee lad, so I popped out a scarf in a few hours on saturday, a hat while sitting indoors avoiding the wind chill yesterday, and on and on. Obviously I break the standard assumption of a knitter according to their standards, and I know /r/knitting has a decent share of male knitters as well. *However*, that doesn't mean that the gender stereotypes don't still exist. I've had plenty of people try to tell me that knitting is for women, or ask me if I'm ""ashamed"" of knitting in public. Those are the people that (again, this is just me assuming) this class is likely trying to aim for. In the same line of thought, I grew up on a farm with four sisters, all of whom know how to do standard car maintenance and repair. Again though, this doesn't mean that those assumptions about women and cars, bowling, sports, whatnot don't still persist in today's society, as the world is full of misogynists.

I think /u/JayHoffa touches on the interesting topic of gender identification, because their strict rules of male and female choices don't cover identification. 

Personally, I think the better approach to a class like this would be to find the historical reasoning behind why these hobbies are considered gendered. From what I can tell the class doesn't require any sort of learning about the gender separation, just that you have to perform a ""gendered"" hobby. Going bowling and knitting a scarf doesn't teach you anything about gender or society, it's just completing a hobby. "

Rossegut,HaloStory,1389131631.0,"This was posted in /r/Halo too, hope you don't mind if I copy/paste the points I made from that thread.

* The script makes it sound like there's a lot of gore and gruesome death scenes. Good--Alex Garland hit the nail right on the head with that one. Every time someone was killed, they were killed in a way that it showed Covenant superiority. Plasma grenades blowing people apart, energy swords slicing unsuspecting soldiers in half, charged plasma pistols melting marines--Garland captured humanity's disadvantage perfectly with the violence.

* The dream sequences were unecessary. They were shallow and tried way too hard to build MC up as this war hero filled with remorse. I think the opening scene with the buildings and his later line ""Why? I do."" where he blames himself for the Fall of Reach are perfect for establishing character, everything else was forced and emotionless.

* Movie totally fucks up everything about the Flood. In the movie, Chief and the marines encounter the Flood for the first time inside the Silent Cartographer--this is an absolute step down from the suspenseful, eerie atmosphere of the swamp in the game's *343 Guilty Spark.*

* The Flood emerge from facilities underneath the Pillar of Autumn's crash site. Compared to the game this is sounds out of place and just feels weird to envision. Again, they should have stuck with the swamp.

* The movie merges the Library and Halo's control room into one facility. I could understand this, but if they removed the shitty dream sequences they might not have had to make this move. Not a big deal but I think it could have been avoided.

* Cortana disappears. The fuck? In the game she notes how much information she absorbs through the control room, but in the movie she literally goes crazy with it and bails on the Chief for what felt like a half hour of screen time.

* Captain Keyes is no longer a proto-gravemind, he's a tentacle-wielding zombie who tries to sway chief to join the Flood. This is lame. I would have preferred to see Chief find Keyes's infected body, reach inside and pull the dogtags/transponder out. Instead he found Keyes on the Autumn's bridge with tendrils whipping around. Sounds more like Doc Ock than the horrifying proto-gravemind from the game.

Apart from that, I was very impressed with the rest of the screenplay. Everything pre-Flood had me thinking, ""holy shit, this is amazing."" Garland worked in some dialogue from the game, material from the game's novelization, and painted great scenes. Ignoring all the things I mentioned as cons, the movie was an excellent adaptation of Halo."

sleepyj910,changemyview,1389131685.0,"Not British, but in a democratic nation.

Democratic politics is complicated.  Elected officials can't just do whatever they want, so it's impossible to keep promises.  The only way to do anything is to make compromises and deals, which always look shady and cowardly.

But the politician's God is and will always be the public.  If the public are against it, they will never be for it.  The public can tear down everything and blocks any dreams a politician may have, and so the politicians job is to manage the public.  And the greatest measure of the public's will is the voting box.

You can't sit here and tell me public opinion has no affect on public policy.  Gay marriage is evidence that if the public demands it, it will be done.  

So corruption and shitty politics exist yes, but mainly because the public allows them too, through ignorance and apathy.  And if you disavow voting, you empower corruption and shitty politics, because now the politicians can ignore your concerns as a 'non likely voter'"

My grandmother, who was born around 1910 and lived through the Depression was amazingly frugal, and I have tried to practice the same lifestyle.  I just don't see how the kids of a generation that endured this kind of hardship would do anything but teach saving and frugal living.  No.  If you ask me, I think we as Americans decided to reject this and listen to advertising and let ourselves buy into this idea that we have to compare our lives to others, that we deserve the world and have a right to live in what is relative luxury.  In addition, the Boomers came into a great time for the US as an economic powerhouse.  Germany, Great Britain, France, and Japan are suffering the effects of WWII and destroyed industry, the US is investing infrastructure, Nixon goes to China, the US government comes to the realization that creating homeowners means creating a class of consumers, etc.  Does this not make more sense?  

Does it not make sense that the right global and economic conditions as well as policy came together to build a strong generation of Americans?  What did it take to get a mortgage before the FHA and other government programs?  50% down, terms of a few years, not 30 years, variable rates that had to be renegotiated.  The ""ownership society"" is a creation of the Post WWII 20th century, created by government policy and favorable economic conditions.  Maybe boomers were promised the world, because they weren't alive to see what it was like before all of this was in place.  Either way, this doesn't point nearly as much to an entitled generation as it does to a nice, temperate period of economic growth.  Do we still live in that economy?  In the big picture of our economic history, these few decades from WWII to the 80s are really just a short period.  Why do we continue to act as if this is just the way things have always worked?"

maxwellhouseeyes,malelifestyle,1389131746.0,"I'm from the UK, so obviously things are a bit different for me [because our university fees are tiny in comparison to your college fees (then again, with our current government, we'll probably end up paying the same as you lot fairly soon)]. But the general consensus here (apart from among businessy students) is that studying at university is an important part of your transition to adulthood. It's not absolutely *necessary* if you don't want to go - it doesn't exactly put you at a disadvantage if you don't - but you learn a lot of useful things outside your course as well as in it. In addition, people generally choose their courses because they meet their interests - I don't know many people who decided to study classics/history/languages because it would get them a job!

I find it a bit sad that it costs so much in the US, because obviously it puts pressure on people to have a long-term plan and to focus on moneymaking as soon as they leave. I'll also admit that I'm quite ignorant to why it costs so much more than it does here though. Is it not possible for colleges to get more public funding?

Apologies if this sounds dismissive! I'm just intrigued. If it were possible to reduce fees, more people would be driven to study because of their interest in the subject, rather than having to think a lot about how their course might get them a job in the future. Is it because the US is so vast and there are simply so many colleges?"

If someone can get 15 sweaters for the same price from very good brands off the clearance rack at Nordstroms Rack or a thrift store, I think that makes them both more frugal *and* more fashionable.

And fashions change. Why invest in something that's going to last 40 years if 5 years from now, you're going to cringe at it?

What do you seek? Money seems rather base. So what do you want? Fame, personal recognition from God? Name your reward.

Eternity with God after this life.

&gt; As I recall, three of the commandments in the decalogue carry an old testament death penalty (yep, just three):

Actually, 35 carry the death penalty. But like half have to do with sexual immorality in one form or another. And just like how that sin is punished, all good deeds must be rewarded for God is just. 

&gt;You may protest: ""All the good I did, and God is putting me to death for a single Sabbath violation? You would think a loving God would provide a way that He will overlook one act of indiscretion. It was an accident.""

Nowhere does it say an accidental violation warrants the death penalty! It must be purposeful. Look at Num 15 for your example. However, let us go with it. I break the Sabbath, I am put to death. That is my punishment, it is paid off. Off to heaven I go, because a just God settled the balance.

&gt;Wouldn't it be great if God could offer cards of redemption? 

You mean offerings? Yes!

&gt;Do you feel that this offer takes away any of your choices?

No. Because I claim that my good deeds are my own. If they are not my own, it is because I never did them. You claim you cannot do a good deed. I claim you can. Do you make a choice or not? "

IAMAfortunecookieAMA,bicycletouring,1389131985.0,"You're in Haiti, and you have a Nikon, an inreach, a GPS, 200 in cash, a wallet, and fancy camping gear. Problem #1.

If I was in Haiti, I would carry a shitty camp stove, plastic soda bottles for water, a foam camp pad, and generally cheap gear. I purposefully make my very nice, very fancy $1500 bike look junky by coating it in stickers and keeping the handlebar tape black. I try as hard as I can to look ""homeless"" or at least seasoned. 

My point is, having the best of everything is usually where world travelers start. By their second and third tours, they're using significantly cheaper or more beat-up stuff and luxuries are abandoned, and if anything, the trip gets MORE fun. I work from the road and I understand having technology, I do; I carry a laptop and a smartphone and I tether wireless internet. But I don't look like I'm packed for that. I look like a bum. No bike jersey, no $150 helmet, no Oakleys.

If you look like you aren't carrying a bunch of fancy stuff to have an american vacation, you won't get robbed. Try instead to look like an adventurer and have your most visible stuff be cheap. Hide your electronics at all times or simply don't carry them."

Those are only required to back up your arrogance if you believe they are.

That sounds an awful lot like what anti-PUA feminists claim.  ""That only works on women with low self-esteem.  A *real* woman would never fall for that.""  

Another interpretation of what successful moochers do is that they go for women who aren't gold diggers that require the man have lots of money in order to be attracted to him.  

&gt; Secondly, women can tell if the guy is ""going places"" from a young age [...] You don't need to be the CEO, you can be the golden boy.

Megawatts19,nfl,1389132129.0,"Maybe it's something that's intangible. Maybe this was just the perfect storm Rob needed to have a dope ass defense. The players were fed up with Spags and basically hated his demeanor. Ryan is the polar opposite personality than Spags. Also, Dallas didn't really want him anymore. We saw Payton jump at the chance to hire Rob. Maybe that boosted Ryan's confidence to know that somebody wanted him and was willing to let him call the shots.

Not only that, but there were a loooot of unknowns on the defensive side this preseason. We had minimal tape on Hicks and Galette who both broke out this year. We also has just drafted Vaccaro so no one knew how he would fit into the defense. But the biggest thing to me was Keenan Lewis. I had honestly never heard of him before we signed him. The guy has been one of the best shut down CBs in the league this year. Last week he was manned up on Desean and Jackson never got his hands on the ball until Keenan left the game with an injury.

This defense didn't really have an identity, and because of the Rob has been able to move people around to fit whatever role he wants them to, and the players have been very responsive to his style and demeanor."

Percy Jackson is a pretty good example, because his series had some declining popularity, and the Lightning Thief (in which he's at his weakest) was by far the most popular.

Comic book characters that have movies made of them tend to be up there. The Avengers are a fantastic example of this.

Most people remember Sora from the first Kingdom Hearts game but he's drastically more powerful (skyscraper buster) by the end of Kingdom Hearts 2. I blame the ridiculously long tutorials.

Gobizku,fatpeoplestories,1389132258.0,"&gt;However, this is where our views split, you see, one of the basis of my theory is that this behavior comes about primarily when you have someone who is uncomfortable or inexperienced with being the proactive agent in the social ritual, in terms of PUAs, it seems that they need (or feel that they need) that extra little edge in social equity before they are confident making more overt moves.

That's not the purpose of negging at all.  It's impossible to have a meaningful conversation when two people have different perceived values of themselves and feel the opposite person is on a different value level.

Negging is used primarily when the person you're talking to thinks they are of more value than you are (so they're talking down to you or insulting you).  Negging done correctly has a psychological effect where it will even the level.  Either the person will see an increased value from you or will lower their own value to that of yours.  Once this occurs the person will likely stop talking down to you, start treating you like a person, and a genuine conversation can occur.  You wouldn't do it if the person you're speaking to already thinks they're on the same or lower value level as you, negging at that point would actually be detrimental as the person would probably become self-conscious and you would be unable to have a meaningful conversation.

Skinny bashing is just used to insult someone.  That's it.  It has no ulterior motive, no other purpose."

I haven't ever used it for myself, but I did once see a man getting up in a woman's personal space, that sort of jostly-aggressive thing people will do when they're trying to rattle/distract you enough to get at your pockets or steal your bag, or shove you into a more secluded space, and rather than freezing up I actually had a phrase pre-loaded:  ""Sir, do you know her?""

* The **significant** premium I pay for my ingredients compared to my competitors, due to my desire to focus on having the best product, rather than the best profits

I can't find the exact quote but my absolute favourite was something along the lines of 'a revolution is always for the middle class. They enlist the aid of the working class to supplant the upper class.'

And then there's this one:

&gt;[N]o one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?

Ultimately, violent revolutions make things ~~work~~ worse, and so much apathy exists in the general populace that peaceful revolution won't happen, and those who try will be largely ignored. The only way to change the world is to amass enough money, power and influence to effect meaningful change, but by the time you've achieved that, your goals will have changed.

The more things change, the more things stay the same.

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389132531.0,"http://jsfiddle.net/3bYTJ/11/

Going off this calculator, having $2.6 trillion in other government spending (reducing fed budget to 1.3 trillion or so then adding another 1.3 trillion for universal healthcare) and assuming 230 million people eligible for benefits, you'd need 32% income/corporate tax for $10k, 35% for $12k, and about 40% for $15k.

For $6k you'd need 26%.

let's see how this works in practice.

Min wage dude making $15k a year pays $3900 in taxes, and recieves a $6000 benefit. This makes him make $17k a year, which isn't much of a change from what they make now....raising the wage to $9/hr would likely accomplish something similar.

At $50k, you'd pay in about $13,000, and get $6,000 back, for a total of $7000 paid in or a 14% tax rate. On the other hand, they'd pay closer to 10% with a higher UBI.

And of course, the top guys only pay 26%.

So it's pretty clear who wins here. The rich get lower taxes, the middle class gets slightly higher taxes, and the poor are only marginally better off than they were.

And if you have no job...you can't live on that unless you live in a super low cost area...all your money would be going to rent alone basically. With rent ($400-500), food ($150-200 for one person), utilities ($150-200), and other miscellaneous expenses....$10k is cutting it close enough. 

For UBI to be worth it, it needs to be AT LEAST $10k. 

With $10k, that same min wage worker pays in $4800, which makes them come ahead by $5200, so they make $20k, which is about a 33% negative tax.  With $15k and 40%, that min wage worker pays in $6k and gets $15k, allowing them to make $24,000 a year, which is a lot closer to the ""living wage"" ideal liberals are throwing around.

Someone making $50k at the 32%/$10k rate would pay in $16,000 and get back $10000, meaning they'd pay $6,000 instead of $7,000, or 12% vs 14%. At $15k they pay in $20,000 and get back $15,000, meaning they would only pay in $5,000 or 10%.

So the higher the benefit, the more progressive it is on the middle class. The higher the rates on the rich, but a $6k UBI seems like an excuse to give the rich a huge tax cut while not really accomplishing much for the middle class. So you need to bring the top brackets into the 30-40% range and have a $10-15k UBI to really see tangible benefits. 

Also, I included universal healthcare in there because otherwise you'd need to give people $300 a month for bargain basement insurance that doesn't cover everything, when if we went universal and brought our costs in line with other countries ($3000 per person, I went a bit higher to be on the safe side), it would be a similar price and a heck of a lot more efficient because everyone would be covered.

It will feel less awkward to skate alone the more you do it, so just keep at it.  The loneliness doesn't go away, but the feelings of awkwardness for skating spots alone does. "

Omega037,changemyview,1389132748.0,"Well obviously, they did go to war for those reasons of history and political and cultural realities.

However, I don't think they were absolutely compelled to do so.  They didn't want the South to secede, but keeping the South was not an absolute requirement for them.  Moreover, the South did not know that secession would lead to war:

&gt; The Confederacy did not want war.  One of the first things Jefferson Davis did after assuming office as president of the Confederacy was to send a peace delegation to Washington, D.C., in an effort to establish friendly ties with the federal government. The Confederacy offered to pay the South’s share of the national debt and to pay compensation for all federal installations in the Southern states.  The Confederacy also announced that Northern ships would continue to enjoy free navigation of the Mississippi River.  

Additionally, several of the states only got involved *because* of the North's decision to go to war:

&gt; Four of the eleven Southern states did not join in the first wave of secession and did not secede over slavery.  Those four states—Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia—only seceded months later when Lincoln made it clear he was going to launch an invasion in order to “save” the Union.  In fact, those states initially voted against secession by fairly sizable majorities.  However, they believed the Union should not be maintained by force.  Therefore, when Lincoln announced he was calling up 75,000 troops to form an invasion force, they held new votes, and in each case the vote was strongly in favor of secession.  Thus, four of the eleven states that comprised the Confederacy seceded because of their objection to federal coercion and not because of slavery."

All states except Arizona, Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee recognize that some categories of false statements are so innately harmful that they are considered to be defamatory per se. In the common law tradition, damages for such false statements are presumed and do not have to be proven.

Statements are defamatory per se where they falsely impute to the plaintiff one or more of the following things:

 - Allegations or imputations ""injurious to another in their trade, business, or profession""

 - Allegations or imputations ""of loathsome disease"" (historically leprosy and sexually transmitted disease, now also including mental illness)

 - Allegations or imputations of ""unchastity"" (usually only in unmarried people and sometimes only in women)

 - Allegations or imputations of criminal activity (sometimes only crimes of moral turpitude)

X or VS one is remixing the other

Feat. or With is a little more versatile. X feat Y would be X's song with samples, or a smaller part from Y.

**EDIT**-Found this that sums it up more clearly

X featuring Y: Generally Author X's work, but includes some significant contribution by Author Y. For example, Y sings a lead melody on one of X's tracks, but isn't X's usual lead singer.

X presenting Y: Same as ""featuring,"" except that Y is generally more unknown at this point and this is their first highly-visible production with X.

X versus Y: Either X and Y are collaborating, or this is a mashup of two songs, one by X and one by Y, generally mixed by a third party, Z. I've also seen this used to describe competitions, such as rap battles.

X and Y: X and Y co-wrote or co-produced this track."

Nomopomo,Anarcho_Capitalism,1389133054.0,"A common argument for anarcho-capitalism is that markets are great for producing ordinary goods, so we should also rely on markets for producing protection and adjudication of disputes. This argument seems problematic. Our usual analysis of economic goods assumes an exogenous legal system that provides enforcement of property rights and contracts. But when we talk about private provision of law, we assume the *absence* of such an exogenous legal system. Hence, before we can cite theorems from price theory as arguments for anarcho-capitalism, we need to first show that the assumptions of these theorems are satisfied (in particular, assumptions about enforcement of property rights and contracts).

One way to show that the assumptions of price theory are satisfied is to point to informal institutions. But I worry that informal institutions do not robustly scale up, so they do not satisfy the assumptions of economic theory for large-scale societies. Hence drawing on price theoretic arguments is only permitted for small-scale anarcho-capitalism.

noc007,atheism,1389133119.0,"I read that, but at first it seemed me like it was about equality between spouses. Obviously the analogy doesn't work well for that and thus, I was thoroughly confused. Sometimes people just need blunt info or more context especially if the brain had been thinking about something completely different. For example, one may have just watched that show about the polygamist family and seeing something about marriage equality wouldn't necessarily lead one to think where it's intended. For me if there was a pride flag or an early reference to homosexual marriage, I'd understand the full context immediately.

Hopefully that's constructive and helpful.

TL;DR Marriage Equality won't always mean the same thing for everyone especially if their brain is on a completely different subject. Sometimes people just need a bit more help to get them on to the same page."

PoeticallyInclined,AskReddit,1389133137.0,"You know, you're right. I didn't mean to make it sound as negative as it did. My own suicide attempt was really recent, and to be honest I still regret being alive sometimes. What I wanted to convey is that the success stories themselves can be disheartening sometimes to people in that position. You hear about all these other people getting better and being glad to be alive, but you still feel the same, and you begin to wonder what's wrong. Many of the most prominently displayed stories have an almost movie quality to them, where the person experiences a big change of heart where they see clearly and go get help, but it doesn't always work that way. Walking home from the bridge was the most depressing thing because that's all it was--walking home from the bridge I almost jumped off of. No one to say good job, no magical epiphany, no instant cure, no new desire to live any more than before, just walking home with the feeling of one more thing I failed at. After that, crying, and then the worst bowl of soup I've ever had. There's a certain amount of 'just keep going' that has to happen before you can even get to the actively fighting stage. I don't think I've made it there yet. 

OP if you're reading this: please, do keep going. Even after all the negative things I've said, I'll share the one thing that helps me keep going. I have a friend who's also been through this, and she told me ""everything feels like crap now, but one day you'll be glad to be alive. It'll come out of the blue, maybe something small will happen, maybe something big, you won't really be prepared for it, but you'll realize that you're glad to be alive to have experienced that moment."" I don't really want to be alive right now, but I do want that feeling. I want to feel glad to be alive. I think that sounds like the best feeling, and there are people out there who experience that feeling on a regular basis. That sounds so good I can hardly fathom it. I haven't been glad in a long time, much less glad to be alive. So right now I'm living for that: to one day feel glad to be alive. When it happens I'm going to eat an orange. I've always liked oranges, but they don't taste the same anymore."

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1389133147.0,"&gt;Now I don't know much about the subjects that come up in all of this. My point is simply that I can't see why anyone would use Bitcoin as a currency today.

There are two groups of people that would want to use BTC as a currency *today*.  

First is the guy who has lots of BTC and believes BTC will start losing a lot of value.  If you own 2,000 BTC, and you believe the price tomorrow could become $1, it makes sense to try to unload your BTC savings today.  Maybe you got those 2,000 BTC for $10, and losing that new found wealth is just too intimidating.  Or, maybe they're broke otherwise.  This person has good reason to spend/convert those coins.

Second is the merchant who feels BTC will go up in value over the long term.  For a small pizza company, it may be worth 'giving away' a few pizza's for BTC in the hopes that the value of BTC will go up tomorrow (or long term).  If you feel strongly this will happen, it makes good business sense to accept some payments in the form of BTC.

Now that we have some buyers and some sellers who are both interested in trading in BTC, it just makes sense to hook those two people up to do business.  Time will tell who was wiser."

Littlereds,AskReddit,1389133166.0,"Sort of.   

The childhood homes of my fiance and I are less than 2 miles apart. Our childhood churches were within a mile of each other, in another city about 15 minutes away. I went to a private school, where he started attending the year I left, I never met him because he was 3 years older and our classes were not in the same building. My sister went to high school with his brother, she was a varsity cheerleader and he was a varsity football player, but they never really talked or anything, but both remember the other. My brother played lacrosse at his high school, where he played soccer, (not a big deal but I'm sure I was at the school or around when he was there for practice and games.) He worked at Borders which happened to be inside the local mall where I spent plenty of time with my friends. He probably even made me a drink or two at the coffee shop inside. After high school both of us thought about joining the air force, but decided on college instead.   

We both wanted to go to the same university, he instead decided to go to a different school with his buddies.  I went for a short time but ended up somewhere else. Little did I know he ended up at the same university as I did, working on another degree. We finally met when one of his buddies introduced us, but I was dating said buddy at the time.   

I feel like the real serendipitous part comes in here: When his buddy and I broke up, I was at our parents' local Starbucks (so again within a couple of miles of both their houses) and he happened to walk in, he didn't even live in this area at the time. He definitely recognized me and we talked for a couple of hours before he got my email. 2 years later we're engaged and still amazed at the dozens of times we could have met but it didn't happen. "

Made friends with a new group, met my then-boyfriend of 3 years. Things were great until he cheated on me and dumped me when I confronted him about it. After that I was all but cut out of my best friend's wedding. They claim there was no ill will and the had been trying to keep me involved but ""I wasn't returning Facebook messages, phone calls, emails, texts, whatever"" but I hadn't received any wedding updates in 6 months. The final straw was when I RSVP'd to the actual wedding and wrote my now-boyfriend as a ""plus 1"".

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1389133278.0,"Wow. I hadn't read either of those threads before, they're both messy and complicated.

Short answer, yes, it is okay to feel upset if your SO treats you differently than a previous partner. It's okay to *feel* upset about anything. What matters is what you *do* about it. 

Long answer:

In the first link, I didn't care for the tone of the male OP. The fact that he tried to leave while she was crying and they hadn't even talked about it yet bothered me. The whole part with him calling her a whore was a super low blow, in my opinion. While we don't know why she kept her gang-bang tape (maybe she was afraid to throw it away? that it would somehow not get disposed of?), it's clearly not something she's proud of. Of course he's allowed to be jealous and upset, but his reaction was pretty bad, in my opinion. I also noticed multiple comments suggesting that the whole post is a troll, and that the OP responded to critcism with things like ""that's something an ugly feminist would say"". But assuming it's real, I think it would do the OP a lot of good to have a calm, open conversation with his wife about the tape and her opinions about sex. I'd bet money on the fact that she had mixed emotions about the gang-bang or was treated differently by the people she had sex afterwards and doesn't want to experience that again. The experience *clearly* changed the way she thinks about sex. We only have OP's opinion that she *seemed* to be enjoying herself in the video. It's also pretty dramatic of him to equate ""not interested in doing porn-style gang-bang/anal/oral sex anymore"" with ""my wife's not attracted to me"". Of course he has a right to be upset by the whole thing. But leaving his wife over it might be a little extreme, and isn't necessarily fair to her.

As for the second link, it sounds like the OP's girlfriend isn't upset that he's not buying her meals, she's upset that she doesn't have her own scrapbook. I mean seriously, I don't know *anyone* who has ever made a commereative scrapbook over an ex, that is some serious high-level mushy stuff. No matter how nice he was being towards his current girlfriend, I think it's completely reasonable to be jealous over something like that. However, her being passive-aggresive by trying to guilt him into buying meals is also shitty. 

It sounds like both hurt parties in each story have the same complaint: ""Why don't you *want* to do those things with me? Why aren't you just doing them automatically, like you did with them? I shouldn't have to *ask* for this, what the fuck."" It's a natural reaction. And the answer is: it's complicated. We have absolutely no context from the first OP's wife's sex tape, no information about how or why it came to be, only that she *seemed* to be enjoying herself. I think there's probably a lot of answers in the juxtaposition of her calling herself a ""dirty whore"" on the tape and not wanting *him* to think she was a ""dirty whore"" because of it. She probably *does* believe she's a dirty whore because of it. And he certainly didn't fucking help by calling her one and acting out of anger, hiding from her, talking about seperation before she even gets to tell her side of the story. She had reasons for her actions, and the OP needs to admit that to himself before he can make any progress with the situation. And again, with the second story, there are *reasons* that the OP doesn't act so romantic anymore. He was encouraged by his family before. His ex-girlfriend also initiated romantic gestures. But he needs to understand how it's making his current girlfriend feel, and lots of the advice being given to him went completely over his head. People said things like ""Well give her romance!"" and he responsed with ""Well I got her a Christmas present. And sometimes when we go out casually I pay."" Dude, that's not romance. No, I don't think he should spend more money on her than he is, but it sounds like she's looking for *effort*. Hell, same with the first OP's wife. Both hurt parties are hurt because of perceieved lack of effort, lack of care. I think that's natural."

I don't remember the difference between apparating in the book versus in the movie, so if I'm too off base feel free to tell me and I'll edit it. Until I know exactly what it is, I'm treating it as teleportation. I'm also going to assume that Kreia's mind control doesn't work on them and that her force powers will function as if the wizards pass all of their saves. I'm also going to say that the killing curse can be blocked by lightsabers, which have been shown to be able to block force techniques (and, due to the set up of this fight, magic by proxy).

The long and short of it is that Kreia wins.

First, she has force precog. Apparating becomes somewhat pointless, and only really makes the user more vulnerable. Second she has force sight (she's physically blind). That renders pretty much all invisibility/stealth skills useless. She can force choke, plague, cut others off from the force (which, for this fight, means no magic), drain someone's life away from them. None of these force techniques have any casting time.

Her floating lightsabers thing is a massive threat. They'd kill a wizard pretty much instantaneously and both would would have to constantly dodge. Outside of that, her AoE is just too fucking good. 

The way I see it, Kreia seriously wounds one within the first seconds of the fight and summons her lightsabers, which force the two to jump around. She monologues the entire time, talking about how limited their power is and how weak they were for not trying to understand it's nature. She goads Voldemort into a full-on attack, and the moment he tries to respond she wounds him. If he was wounded in the first seconds, he dies here. Dumbledore does a better job of ignoring her but just finds himself too outclassed by the force. He tries to sneak up behind her but fails miserable, and is stabbed through by one of her autonomous lightsabers.

So yeah. Kreia 8/10."

Forgoing the utter insanity, she's not hot. She's average.

She probably knows this. I'd put *good* money on her having very low self esteem, and having built up this wall of hype around herself that is so very fragile she has to be hostile to everyone because if it's *their* fault then nothing they say about her can be correct.

Basically, and I'm not into psychology in any way so if someone is and wants to correct me *please do,* she's constantly aggressive because if all her targets are external she won't have to take a look at herself."

Sabu113,reddevils,1389133787.0,"There's this over-fetishization of people running around and assuming that means something is happening. Hence the general preference for Valencia over Nani even though Nani does more on the pitch and gets into better positions. 

Kagawa isn't pacey. He's never, ever going to beat a fullback for pace. Yeah He's fucking limited. You wouldn't play Scholes or Pirlo or Schweinsteiger on the flank and expect the same performance [Hell Gerrard on the wing rather than in the center; Ramsey/Wilshire off their choice spots a decent shout]. This adapting bullshit is complete fucking idiocy. Characteristics and knowledge of the role entirely dictates effectiveness. Players can look radically different in different tactical roles.

Kagawa's game is all about using crowded areas and quick passes to make space and get a shot/through ball in. Being in the center puts him in that space, gives him more options and more to the point it's his primary role. You can see that in how he's transformed as a player every time he's in the center.

Rooney isn't the better 10. He's better in our system because our midfield is shit and he ends up being a third midfielder rather than a 10. As far as missing, it depends. I think he looks mediocre on the wing but I also think a ton of people here are on a reactionary circlejerk judging by the comments after the last game. 

Yeah he should be sold because he's a limited player and he relies on a team that plays semi-modern passing football. He is never going to be CL grade on the flanks. He is never going to be running the ball up the pitch like Rooney."

But we should never be ruled by our fears.  Talk to him.  It will almost assuredly be a process.  But remind him the effectiveness rate of condoms, of birth control, etc.

What the other posters here don't seem to get is there's a piece where it's important to you that he finishes inside of you.  And I think that's legitimate.

I would recommend potentially asking him to let you help him finish, with your mouth, hands, whatever as a way to build toward him finishing inside of you.

But he has a fear he needs to deal with.  And his fear is not unwarranted based on his past.  So, don't belittle his fear or trivialize it.  And I don't think you are, you appear to be approaching this in a thoughtful, considerate way.

Lokikong,conspiracy,1389133954.0,"No, you proved that they began a consideration for stockpiling in '02 and that they didn't start until after Fukushima.

Article 1 states, that in march of 2011 they bought a Billion dollars worth of dehydrated food and an unspecified amount of iodide(After Fukushima where apparently they didn't even give it to there soliders that needed it http://www.ibtimes.com/uss-ronald-reagan-crew-members-sick-cancer-three-years-after-fukushima-contamination-photos-1519170 and they decontaminated correctly but they ended up using radioactive water from the ocean for the ship)

Article 2
&gt;Governments world-wide are now stockpiling potassium iodide. Amongst them are Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Sweden, and Russia, but, amazingly, not the U.S.

***NOT THE US*** given this is 2000 

Article 3 
&gt;The NRC has offered to make potassium iodide available to states that want it, but only four states currently maintain stockpiles. The Illinois Department of Nuclear Safety maintains that distributing potassium iodide would be logistically difficult and may give people a false sense of security that could hamper evacuation efforts.

this one from 2002 but it was only for consideration

Article 4 states that in 06' the NRC offered a planned to replenish existing stockpiles in 21 states. 

I'm guessing that last one is what you were trying to point out. This isn't the same. The government resupplies ammunition for training supplies but it came out when they tried to use that excuse for the massive bullet buyout in 2012-early'13 that it was to save taxpayer money but if you did the math it worked out that they'd have enough for training purposes for almost a century not to mention most were hollow point. Now we have a huge, I mean massive order of Iodide. Exponentially bigger than that of the regular stock pile. Now don't get me wrong. I think it's a good idea for the government to be able to offer relief from radioactivity during a crisis (even if the form of iodine, (KI) isn't really the healthiest or most effective derivative of iodine for a nuclear crisis) but during an age of false flags such a large purchase demand so quickly and without much noise should certainly be looked at with suspicion and much scrutiny. You understand what I'm saying? If the government stockpiles bullets but says you shouldn't be able to use a gun isn't that a bit hypocritical. Isn't a gun a best defense according to the governments standards why shouldn't we be able to carry this form of defense. If the government knows of incoming radiation waves hitting the west coast but not telling anyone about the 500% increase of radiation, along with the increase radiation in the jet stream and begins a large stock pile of radiation cures, isn't that a bit hypocritical. Shouldn't you get some nascent iodine? What do they know that we don't?

However, many do deal with Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, etc. They would probably take offense to you saying that their disorders ""don't amount to real mental disorders."" I'm of course not talking about those who self-diagnose their particular brand of crazy like the subject of this post, but rather those who seek professional help, take meds, and have to deal with a crippling disorder every day.

Pros
* access to Central Park, Carl Schurtz, etc - great for runners or people with dogs!

* (as far as I know) the cheapest neighborhood in Manhattan for recently graduated students to move

* good bar scene, especially around 2nd Avenue

* nice choice of grocery stores (plus can get to Target/Aldi/Costco fairly quickly on the M15)

* it's fairly quiet at night (unless you live on 2nd), while still being relatively safe

* close to the library and some of the best museums! (or maybe I'm a dork)

Cons: 

* long commute if you don't live close to Lex
* the 6 train on weekdays. IS. HELL. 
* restaurants aren't as plentiful/cheap as they are downtown, and they don't stay open as late
* increasing property prices near the new subway line

My boyfriend and I are pretty quiet and don't treasure living among a lot of other young people, so overall I wouldn't move anywhere else in Manhattan.  If I were going to move, I certainly would check out Hoboken though! ;) "

Occasionally some aspect of the new universe/world will power it up. Superman grows more powerful depending on the color of the sun he's exposed to, if he were sent to a universe in which the star that makes him the strongest is the only type in existence then he would be more powerful in that universe.

Another example would be a character that grows more powerful when those around them experience negative emotions. If you were to drop that character in a grimdark universe, he grows stronger. Drop him in the Care Bear's universe and he dies."

&gt;The back squat is literally the only exercise in the entire repertoire of weighted human 
movement that allows the direct training of the complex movement pattern known as hip drive. The 
posterior chain is a term that refers to the muscles that produce hip extension – straightening-out of the 
hip joint from its flexed (or bent) position in the bottom of the squat. The muscles that accomplish 
hip extension are the hamstrings, the glutes, and the adductors or groin muscles, and together these 
are referred to as the posterior chain...

&gt;The squat is the only exercise in the weight room that trains the recruitment of 
the entire posterior chain in a way that is progressively improvable, and that is one of the things that 
makes the squat the best exercise you can do with barbells and, by extension, the best strength exercise 
there is. These important muscles contribute to jumping, pulling, pushing, and anything else involving the lower body."

These men swallow TRP, see the world for what it is, then decide their purpose in life is so far beyond a woman, there is no room for one.

It's not that they've ""given up"".  It's that they see reality and choose not to abide.

I totally get that.  I love writing.  Making music.  Snowboarding.  Surfing....  If my life purpose is to love me and be me, how does a woman in anyway fit into my life given the reality of who they are?  

If your life purpose involves getting laid or procreating, then woman in necessary.  Otherwise, go your own way."

After we sat down and started talking to our table mates, my boyfriend threw up in his lap (at least it wasn't on the table?). He wiped his face on a napkin and got up and left. Everyone at the table knew what had happened and probably saw me wipe puke off of his menu.   I ate half of my dinner and returned to our cabin to see him passed out on the bed.

The argument could be made they were more willing to die for service of their country and fight for their country , along with today's youth being lazy and unmotivated.  Couldn't the same be said of Enterprise vs Voyager. Enterprise you had real explorers people that were willing to give up everything to explore and in uncharted space.

Except she doesn't.  Because there are no average women.  Do you think the Muslim woman born in Trinidad cares about diamond rings?  What about the Amish woman who isn't allowed to wear Jewelry, don't you think she'd be upset at the offer of a fat diamond ring?

Let's say we have two women in Scenario 2, one of which comes from a poor family, the other from a well-off one. Is it not excessive for the rich family to pay for the treatment? What might be extraordinary care to one person might not be to another, and vice versa.


Compound this with varied financial situations from person to person, different moral/ethical values, and even different religious values and what's excessive seems less and less objective. 

If ""common sense"" dictates who does and doesn't get the short end of the stick in situations like brain-dead/disabled cases wouldn't it be ""common sense"" to not have children you can't afford to raise? or even bring to bear? Everyone has a right to live, **but** sometimes you have do draw the line at extraordinary/excessive care seem to clash with each other for people (like myself) who would view bringing a fetus to term (let alone raising a child for 18+ years) as the most ""excessive"" care of all. 

Edit: That's poor phrasing. I mean to say that this is excessive/that isn't excessive is a gray area and ""you're pregnant, you must bear that child"" seems to be a line that is just plopped into the middle of this fog."

&gt; 1) Do other people know about your relationship? When you spend time together in public, are you seen as a three person relationship, or as a couple and a good friend? 

Some do, some don't. I am open and out, but my primary partner isn't (for family and work reasons), so only a select few of his friends know. When we spend time together in public, we don't make a huge effort to *not* seem like a three-person relationship, if that makes sense. I think to most people we probably seem like a couple who is **very** affectionate towards their friend. 

&gt; 2) Where do you see the relationship going and where does she see the relationship going? Is it a long term thing (or open ended just as most relationships would be) or is there a general understanding that at some point it will end?

Our third is free to pursue relationships with other people, and I expect (hope) she will find a primary relationship at some point. The hope is that she will continue her relationship with us even then, of course, but we'll deal with that when it's actually a thing.

&gt; 3) Have you come across any imbalances in attraction between you all, and if so - how have you dealt with it? I ask because I am conscious of the fact that I am definitely more attracted to the wife than the husband and am not sure if I should try to show each equal affection anyway, or just be open with them about it (i'm sure they know anyway!) and figure out how to make it work

We are fans of explicit communication about everything! For us, it's always better to just say something, than to wonder if the other person knows/should know. Obviously, you should be careful in how you word things (and you seem very thoughtful and articulate, so I don't anticipate problems there) so as not to make the husband feel excluded or unwanted, even a little bit. But you should definitely express that you feel a bit more comfortable sexually with women, and let them know that you would enjoy starting out with foreplay with her or watching them with each other. You could also have her do things to you while he does things to her.

I don't think you need make too much effort to ensure that your attentions are ""equal"" (unless they are significantly imbalanced, and it doesn't sound like they are)--just be sure you give him regular, focused attention, too. It doesn't all have to be sexual, either. You and the husband could ""gang up"" on the wife--then you are interacting with both, but the primary sexual focus is on her. Our third has a preference for men, and our favorite thing to do together is for him to take the lead, with me ""helping""! ;D

Make sure you talk about what kinds of ""normal"" intimacies are okay and which are not. For some people, seeing their partner fuck another person is all fine and dandy, but if their partner kisses the same person, all hell breaks loose! (For us, it's all okay.)

&gt; 4) I'm assuming that you guys still have sex with each other, just as an mf couple without your third f? If so, I would really like to know - does either one of you in the couple ever exclusively have sex with your third, or is it always together?

Yes. Most of our sex is with each other. So far, we have always been together during threesome sex, but actual involvement varies. For example, there was one time when he had PiV sex with her, and I mostly just rolled around and watched, and occasionally touched one of them.

Corbenik,whowouldwin,1389134920.0,"You said that in your other post that her ripping their wands out could be resisted due to force = magic. Same thing in reverse. Legilimency just wouldn't work. If it did, we'd have to let Kreia use her retardedly powerful mind hacks on them. Feats include erasing herself from the memories of Jedi Masters. 

&gt; Also since force=magic the wizards have a chance to release the hold Kreia has on them through their own magic.

Definitely. The problem is that Kreia isn't just holding then, she's crushing them. Yeah, they break it, but in the meantime she's caused some internal bleeding.

&gt; I would also have to say that Voldemort doesn't get immediately get goaded on attacking someone probably with Dumbledore or Harry but with someone he doesn't know....I'm not so sure.

Voldemort has one of the biggest egos in the series. If anyone gets goaded into anything, it's him.

Kreia's biggest strength is her skills in manipulating others, but she's in the top ten of the most powerful force users of her time."

Slukaj,conspiratard,1389135279.0,"1) Neutron ""blow-up"" is not the same thing as an explosion. It just denotes an increase of neutron collisions during periods of high heat.

2) This is purely hypothetical. The document makes it clear from the get go that it's based on a few assumptions from the accident. 

Neutron spikes aren't unheard of in reactor accidents. The SL-1 reactor and Chernobyl both experienced similar events for different reasons (the removal of the primary control rod and the insertion of cobalt-tipped control rods respectively). The only thing this document would indicate is that the same event can occur under high heat events, which would be rather intimidating all things considered.

Now, I do find it interesting that you're going on about how the BWR MK1 containment had known defects when you turn around and present this document as evidence, when we were unaware of this phenomena until after the Fukushima accident. 

If it is indeed the case, then I'd certainly expect safety systems designed with it in mind with the GEN-IV and GEN-V reactor designs. But expecting that of a GEN-III design, when it was installed forty years before we knew about this, is asinine. "

Of course, many places will fire an employee if they are arrested for such a serious charge, but that is their decision. For the police, as it happened in the line of duty, they must determine whether or not it was justified or not. In this case, I see very little chance it will come back to be justified, but hypothetically speaking what if the the evidence came back that the deceased had presented a firearm and attempted to shoot the officers, and this was not reported by the media. Of course this didn't happen, but the media doesn't always portray the full story, nor does the testimony of the officer. But while the department determines whether it is justified or not, they do not want to penalize the officer or his family on the chance that he may be innocent.

Madblood,personalfinance,1389135346.0,"Similar story...I refinanced with a local bank, mortgage got sold to Countrywide, then became BOA.  They stuck me with flood insurance without ever warning me.  I live on a hill, the highest goddam point of land in my county.  If flood waters reach my house, it means over 30K people have drowned before the water gets to my door.  They never consulted the FEMA flood map, but near as I can figure they used Google Maps, because they used to show my house in the middle of a creek when you looked up the address.  The creek is about 1/4 mile away, and about 100 vertical feet below my property.  To get the insurance removed, I had to get FEMA to write a Letter of Map Amendment and send it to BOA.  After several months BOA notified me that they had removed the flood insurance.  The they charged me for it on my next statement.  I sent them a very polite, yet very unfriendly e-mail requesting that they re-issue said statement minus the flood insurance amount, which they did.  As soon as I could, I refinanced again, with the main reason being getting away from BOA.

Side story: BOA owed me $5k, which they were supposed to direct deposit.  Instead they sent me a paper check.  Okay, whatever.  My bank said they would have to hold the funds for up to 2 weeks, so I was better off going to BOA to cash it.  The local BOA branch scanned the check and said it was invalid.  Several phone calls later, the idiots finally decided to do the direct deposit.  Never again."

Traunt,AskReddit,1389135366.0,"This probably get buried, but if anyone can give me some advice for my problem, it would seriously mean the world to me, but I'm a tad confused and flustered as hell right now.

So basically, I graduated with a biology degree last month, in a place where there aren't biology jobs, no labs, no nadda, which requires me to move, which is perfectly fine. I live in NE Indiana, and I've applied to places in Indianapolis south to me where there's jobs, and a company or two in MI to the north in Kalamazoo, both areas about 2 hours of where I'm at. Most of my family has moved to CO or south past Indy for jobs, so I'd be kind of alone wherever I go. For reference, I'm 24.

As an aside, I've been talking to this girl in MI in Kzoo for about 5 months now. We've met up once in October, had an amazing time, and have talked/chatted on FB/skyped (mainly FB/texting) otherwise. Low and behold, the one place I applied to as an afterthought (I only found out about it through her because she applied) calls me back for an interview. I have the interview and trip up there this Friday.

It's a bit smaller than the city I'm in (2nd largest in Indiana) but I'm worried about getting up there and either not having enough money or not making friends and yadda yadda, especially with loans kicking in. I'm not in any way moving up there for the girl (even though I'm still crazy about her) it just happened to be the only place that called me back, and it seems like a decent place to work. I guess my question is, should I look for apartments now and get on waiting lists just in case?   

The other thing is that the girl's been distant lately, saying she's just been busy. I don't think she's pursuing anyone else (which would be perfectly fine, I wouldn't blame her) but we have talked about getting together if by some grace of god I would move up there (not for her of course), maybe I'm also asking about how to handle this situation too? I've been obviously flirty and showing interest, but when I told her I'd love to see her Friday when I go up there for the interview, she kinda seemed uninterested. 

Maybe I'm over-analyzing it and she just doesn't want to get attached unless she can well, actually get attached. My main point is nailing the job interview though, so what should I do now or if I get an offer as far as priorities? I probably have a room's worth of stuff to move, not much else.

In the event I wouldn't get the job or anything relatively soon, I'd probably move out to CO for better job potential, so this would be moot."

So then that's a *you* problem, not a problem with the franchise or targeted theme. Alien, and to a lesser extent Aliens, were all about being afraid without being able to do anything about it, not just having a good time. 

I can appreciate that you'd want something different, but the expectation should be that CA, Gearbox, et al stick with the source material and theme. 

What you'd like makes about as much sense as a Halo MMORPG or an Angry Birds FPS.

littlestray,AskReddit,1389135499.0,"My godfather's speed boat was moored far off the rocky shore and I was repeatedly jumping off of it and swimming. I'm a very good swimmer but very skinny, I don't have enough surface area to successfully float if I lie on my back. It was high tide and I decided to swim back to shore. I became exhausted and tried to touch my feet down to the bottom but the water had gotten too high. There were plenty of people around, but my sister's godmother was the only one who recognised that I was drowning. She swam out to me and pulled me in. I still love swimming, but now I have to keep in mind I can't put myself in a situation where I could run out of energy and not touch down.

I have no memory of being scared, in fact I can't summon up any emotional opinion of it at all.

It really helps to read this and the other drowning stories in this thread, because my mother's two best friends suddenly drowned in the ocean in Mexico right in front of her last year. She gets upset about the idea of them suffering or being scared, and I've tried telling her that drowning can be very peaceful…sometime if she brings it up again I think I'll let her see these stories, in the hopes that it'll bring her a small bit of peace."

I think you got stuck on the word ""replay"". Nobody talked about replay files. ""Replay system"" just means the system that stores the state and applies a sequence of events to deduce the next state. So when /u/Sumadin says:

I think it's great that more men are going into the nursing field...just like I think it's great that more women are entering non-traditional roles in the medical field. 

I mainly care about the nurse or doctor listen to my concerns about my health and just not assume they ""know better"" than me or just brush off or minimize my concerns. I'm dealing with this my current doctor (to the point that I bring my husband with me to appointments so the doc doesn't talk over me) and as soon as I get on an insurance plan, I'm leaving the current doc super quick. The current doctor happens to be a man but I've dealt with this with women doctors too.  

**general health issues stuff like back pain, weakness, dizziness?**

No problem at all 

**critical health issues like difficulty breathing and trauma?**

Nope. I'd just want to be ""patched up"" and taken care of by the best person available. I'm not gonna care if it's a man or woman as long as they don't make me worse off. 


**Gyno issues like excessive bleeding, deformities, swelling, STI's? (we all have the same training but i can understand someone who can relate to what is going on down there)**


No problem and I've actually had more men gynecologists vs women gynecologists throughout my life. Not by specific choice but just who was available in my area and insurance plan. As long as you have the training for the job, are competent and have a good bedside manner, actually listen to my medical concerns and questions, and know to heat up the damn speculum before the exam I'm ok with you as a doc or nurse. Whether you are male or female doesn't matter to me as long as you are good at your job and listen/interact with me as a patient and person.

**Pregnancy issues and labor and delivery?**

Haven't had a child but if I were, I think it's safe to assume I'd have the same answer as the gyno answer.

wagerhope,ak47,1389135623.0,"Big answer: Lurk the sub a little bit and check out the sidebar.

Summary: AKs and ARs are quite different animals. AKs are generally imported from different countries and then brought up to spec with US regulations, including 922r where they install US parts to meet minimum thresholds. The big differences are in how the various importers deal with the receivers. CAI (Century Arms) has recently been messing up their receivers where they're super finicky with magazines. WW (Waffen Werks) was making their barrels too narrow when they added chrome to them, causing headspace issues.

If you're into gun building, you can buy a Saiga sporterized AK47 and then convert it yourself, which is doable with a dremel and some other basic tools. (If you want a more authentic conversion, you'll need some bigger tools, but still it's not crazy.) Google that if you want more info, as I haven't done it. These can get you a great gun well within your price range and you can put whatever furniture you want on it.

More precisely- read up on any gun you'd want to buy. Be sure to know what that particular manufacturer may struggle with (canted sights, poor headspacing, bad mags, etc.) and know what to avoid.

Hope that helps- I just went through the whole process and ended on the M10-762. I'll probably get wood furniture eventually, but I want to see what it looks like with the tan synthetic furniture first.

A drinking game can be fun but if anyone ever tries to get me to 'ride the bus' I tell them to fuck off, I'll control how much I put in and not some silly game.  I honestly haven't played a drinking game in so long either though.  I prefer imbibing to a show/movie or with some good discussion with friends/family rather than a competitive nature of it, but I sure used to be competitive about it, now that just seems stupid.  

I certainly not in favor of any kind of controls though.   I guess I think people should make their own choices/mistakes and learn from them.  I know I have.

We get along really well because we're a lot a like, not just in terms of interests, but to the point of finishing each other's sentences and having the same thought. So it's crazy easy for us to be on the same page and hatch a plan in seconds.  Although we are definitely kindred spirits, we don't always agree (in fact we've had some fairly heated arguments about things in the past like healthcare or gun control), but we always move past it."

Ekotar,AskReddit,1389135785.0,"How to act to someone struggling with Depression (I'm depressed and in therapy wheeee!)

1- Be affirming: ""It's okay to not know what to say when you're upset""
""It's okay to cry"". ""I still care about you, I think you're great"".

2-Make them promise you not to give up. The other day my ex (who is a huge benefit to my struggle, and one of my closest friends) reminded me I'd made a promise not to give up when I complained my depression was too much and I was just going to spend the day in bed. 

3- Know what they like, even when they're too sad or upset to tell you. This is HUGE. Decide for them, in a gentle way. Don't make them, and don't tell them what you're doing. It's like being on a date when it's cold: You don't offer your jacket, you just put in around their shoulders.

4- This is actually huge: there are 5 primary ways humans express and receive affection, or 5 ""love language"". Figure out what you and your SO like, and when you're trying to support them, don't give how you like to give, give how they like to receive.

* Physical touch: being held, kissed, hugged, massaged, snuggled, caressed, and anything sexual. When really upset some people don't want to be touched, but all I want is to be held while I curl up in a ball.
* Gift giving: Pretty self explanatory, have something you've put thought into, something that's a personal joke between the two of you, etc, and keep it in your car in case they're having a really bad day with their depression.
* Acts of Service: Again, pretty self explanatory. Do something for them. They're overwhelmed and can't motivate to do the dishes? Do them for them. Sometimes organizing things and my room looking nice will help. My momma tries to express affection this way, even after I've moved out. I love my momma, and although this isn't how **I** best receive love, it's clear to me it's what she can do to feel like she's providing.
* Quality Time: Netflix, pajamas, hot cocoa, blankets. Hike, picnic basket, camera, selfies. Dinner, wine, conversation, laughter. Spend quality time talking about things that matter, alone, and connected and bonding. You never stop bonding.
* Words of affirmation: ""I love you! You're great! I believe in you. You know your smile? How your lips curl up and get smooth, and the wrinkles form at the corners of your eyes, and your eyes light up? I LOVE that! That's why I make so many dumb jokes, to get *one* of those smiles from you!"" Just say nice shit. Mean it. Notice things, little things, and describe them. 

Use those things to interact with your SO in day-to-day life too, obviously, but particularly when they're having a bad day it'll help to have had a distinct conversation with them and know that that's what they need. Ask how they feel: When I'm sad, my feet always feel cold (certain fear-related hormones, including norepinephrine, a precursor to adrenaline, draw blood away from your extremities, which makes my feet cold). MY XSO's response? a $12 4-pack of wool socks from costco. Worked like a charm, I wear them on my bad days. Figure out what works for your SO. 

If you need more help, or want to read more, PM me and I'll happily share more stories and send you links to a book about the 5 ""love languages"". I hope your SO bucks up, I'm figuring my things out after years of therapy. Encourage them to not give up. Maybe they have to climb a mountain to find it, but their green pastures, and their home is somewhere. Good luck to you both &lt;3!"

The former is entirely reasonable, the latter is ridiculous.

If he himself has behaved promiscuously in the past and now wants a woman who has not done the same *because he considers women who have done the same to be vulgar, worthless and whorish,* then screw that guy, not literally, ESPECIALLY if he thinks that having slept around a huge ton makes him super special and awesome.

Maybe it's the cut of the jeans that isn't right? I just bought some high-waisted jeans from American Apparel (the pencil pant, actually) and they fit pretty amazingly after stretching them out a little through daily wear.  They also don't seem to do the weird knee foldy thing but they're still pretty new so who knows. It does seem like my lower-rise skinny jeans make my quads look extra huge because of the way that the seams lie and the fact that they cut across my hips at the widest part, whereas the high waist on the pencil pant helps give the illusion of a longer leg (though, admittedly, my quads still look hyooge, but I'm okay with that). 

Knee-high boots and crop leggings are both terrible, though, and I haven't figured out a way to make them work.

2. they were insisting I go RIGHT NOW because they had the money to pay for it and might not later (economy was tanking and their jobs were going out the window).

If you really wanna narrow your focus then I would say pay attention to who you tend to play as the most. My main is Link. That's been set in stone for generations. I play a bunch of characters too but if I had to chose, I would say Roy and Ganon are my secondaries because I tend to play them more, I have more fun with them and I know them better than the other characters I play. Truth is I don't really define who my seconds are. I just main Link and play a lot of other characters. So you could also do that.

How to act to someone struggling with Depression (I'm depressed and in therapy wheeee!)

1- Be affirming: ""It's okay to not know what to say when you're upset"" ""It's okay to cry"". ""I still care about you, I think you're great"".

2-Make them promise you not to give up. The other day my ex (who is a huge benefit to my struggle, and one of my closest friends) reminded me I'd made a promise not to give up when I complained my depression was too much and I was just going to spend the day in bed.

3- Know what they like, even when they're too sad or upset to tell you. This is HUGE. Decide for them, in a gentle way. Don't make them, and don't tell them what you're doing. It's like being on a date when it's cold: You don't offer your jacket, you just put in around their shoulders.

4- This is actually huge: there are 5 primary ways humans express and receive affection, or 5 ""love language"". Figure out what you and your SO like, and when you're trying to support them, don't give how you like to give, give how they like to receive.

* Physical touch: being held, kissed, hugged, massaged, snuggled, caressed, and anything sexual. When really upset some people don't want to be touched, but all I want is to be held while I curl up in a ball.
* Gift giving: Pretty self explanatory, have something you've put thought into, something that's a personal joke between the two of you, etc, and keep it in your car in case they're having a really bad day with their depression.
* Acts of Service: Again, pretty self explanatory. Do something for them. They're overwhelmed and can't motivate to do the dishes? Do them for them. Sometimes organizing things and my room looking nice will help. My momma tries to express affection this way, even after I've moved out. I love my momma, and although this isn't how I best receive love, it's clear to me it's what she can do to feel like she's providing.
* Quality Time: Netflix, pajamas, hot cocoa, blankets. Hike, picnic basket, camera, selfies. Dinner, wine, conversation, laughter. Spend quality time talking about things that matter, alone, and connected and bonding. You never stop bonding.
* Words of affirmation: ""I love you! You're great! I believe in you. You know your smile? How your lips curl up and get smooth, and the wrinkles form at the corners of your eyes, and your eyes light up? I LOVE that! That's why I make so many dumb jokes, to get one of those smiles from you!"" Just say nice shit. Mean it. Notice things, little things, and describe them.

 Use those things to interact with your SO in day-to-day life too, obviously, but particularly when they're having a bad day it'll help to have had a distinct conversation with them and know that that's what they need. Ask how they feel: When I'm sad, my feet always feel cold (certain fear-related hormones, including norepinephrine, a precursor to adrenaline, draw blood away from your extremities, which makes my feet cold). MY XSO's response? a $12 4-pack of wool socks from costco. Worked like a charm, I wear them on my bad days. Figure out what works for your SO.

 If you need more help, or want to read more, PM me and I'll happily share more stories and send you links to a book about the 5 ""love languages"". I hope your SO bucks up, I'm figuring my things out after years of therapy. Encourage them to not give up. Maybe they have to climb a mountain to find it, but their green pastures, and their home is somewhere. Good luck to you both &lt;3!

Having the expectation of NOT being the point of focus, feeling that you SHOULD focus on your partner... you're forgetting YOU. I'm not saying to forget who you're with, or to focus solely on yourself... me, my view on it, is that you are BOTH there, but you KNOW yourself--again, being the sole variable that you have control and knowledge over. It's not a matter of who's first or who's second--it's a matter of taking care of BOTH of you. Yes, if you focus on each others' needs, then yes it goes smoothly. But, I've been with people who don't know what they want, who don't know how to communicate what they want, and in addition, they don't know how to communicate that they don't know how to do or even *what* to do about what *I've* communicated what *I* wanted--and can't communicate *that*.

""Tit for tat"", in the bedroom. Yes. Agreed. And the more disparate the sides become, the more resentment grows--again, I understand wholeheartedly.

When it comes to a partnership and sexuality, I speak strictly from the perspective of a New Relationship/New Sexual Relationship. Of course, later in either relationship there is a level of trust to which I would happily go last, or not even at all. 

And to respond to the swallowing... I've always offered something. Mints, gum, definitely water, some tissues, et cetera. I don't go in saying she should swallow, straight off the bat--that'd be like meeting someone on a first date and demanding they pay for everything. Not sexy, and definitely not cool. No, that's more of a ""later"" thing, and certainly introduced slowly. 

Regardless, there should be some amount of reciprocation there, though: while sperm and vaginal juices ARE inherently chemically different, juices of either are still being swallowed and both are not exactly pleasing (specific personal tastes excluded--there are a few who find semen exquisite, and a few who find female juices to be the finest nectar--but I think that they aren't the majority, wouldn't you agree?). Women only have a teaspoonful (or a little more) to swallow in perhaps a few seconds, versus the hour or two of sucking down juices (which I'll estimate to be at least--*at least*--a teaspoonful and more) that men endure. Yes, there is the whole ""throat"" and physical bobbing to look into (plus tongue/muscle/jaw aching), to which I'll agree there is a disparity. But, we are merely discussing the liquids themselves, not the act that goes into procuring them. 

As someone once said here on Reddit: ""You are responsible for your own orgasm."" So, while it may appear that I am writing solely from a ""Me First"" point of view, I am simply acting based on my experiences in the bedroom. "

How to act to someone struggling with Depression (I'm depressed and in therapy wheeee!)

1- Be affirming: ""It's okay to not know what to say when you're upset"" ""It's okay to cry"". ""I still care about you, I think you're great"".

2-Make them promise you not to give up. The other day my ex (who is a huge benefit to my struggle, and one of my closest friends) reminded me I'd made a promise not to give up when I complained my depression was too much and I was just going to spend the day in bed.

3- Know what they like, even when they're too sad or upset to tell you. This is HUGE. Decide for them, in a gentle way. Don't make them, and don't tell them what you're doing. It's like being on a date when it's cold: You don't offer your jacket, you just put in around their shoulders.

4- This is actually huge: there are 5 primary ways humans express and receive affection, or 5 ""love language"". Figure out what you and your SO like, and when you're trying to support them, don't give how you like to give, give how they like to receive.

* Physical touch: being held, kissed, hugged, massaged, snuggled, caressed, and anything sexual. When really upset some people don't want to be touched, but all I want is to be held while I curl up in a ball.
* Gift giving: Pretty self explanatory, have something you've put thought into, something that's a personal joke between the two of you, etc, and keep it in your car in case they're having a really bad day with their depression.
* Acts of Service: Again, pretty self explanatory. Do something for them. They're overwhelmed and can't motivate to do the dishes? Do them for them. Sometimes organizing things and my room looking nice will help. My momma tries to express affection this way, even after I've moved out. I love my momma, and although this isn't how I best receive love, it's clear to me it's what she can do to feel like she's providing.
* Quality Time: Netflix, pajamas, hot cocoa, blankets. Hike, picnic basket, camera, selfies. Dinner, wine, conversation, laughter. Spend quality time talking about things that matter, alone, and connected and bonding. You never stop bonding.
* Words of affirmation: ""I love you! You're great! I believe in you. You know your smile? How your lips curl up and get smooth, and the wrinkles form at the corners of your eyes, and your eyes light up? I LOVE that! That's why I make so many dumb jokes, to get one of those smiles from you!"" Just say nice shit. Mean it. Notice things, little things, and describe them.

 Use those things to interact with your SO in day-to-day life too, obviously, but particularly when they're having a bad day it'll help to have had a distinct conversation with them and know that that's what they need. Ask how they feel: When I'm sad, my feet always feel cold (certain fear-related hormones, including norepinephrine, a precursor to adrenaline, draw blood away from your extremities, which makes my feet cold). MY XSO's response? a $12 4-pack of wool socks from costco. Worked like a charm, I wear them on my bad days. Figure out what works for your SO.

 If you need more help, or want to read more, PM me and I'll happily share more stories and send you links to a book about the 5 ""love languages"". I hope your SO bucks up, I'm figuring my things out after years of therapy. Encourage them to not give up. Maybe they have to climb a mountain to find it, but their green pastures, and their home is somewhere. Good luck to you both &lt;3!

Tell me if any of those seem like good ideas to you."

0xc000000f,aww,1389136263.0,"&gt;In comparison, an outdoor cat’s life expectancy is less than five years.

**Edit:**  Also want to see a primary source on that stat.

**Edit 2:** http://www.rspca.org.uk/allaboutanimals/pets/cats/environment/indoors the RSPCA is the largest animal welfare charity in the world. 

&gt;Currently there is no definitive knowledge regarding whether being an indoor-only cat is any better or worse than being one who has access to the outdoors. It is important to make sure that you are meeting all of your cat's needs whether they are an indoor cat or not. However, compared to cats who have the freedom to go outside, indoor-only cats will have additional needs that must be met to keep them healthy and happy.

&gt;Cats can adapt well to an indoor life if they are kept in this environment from an early age, but cats that have been used to going outside may find it more difficult to adapt. We would not recommend keeping a cat that is used to going outside, as an ‘indoor-only cat’, unless it is for health reasons. If you rehome a kitten and intend to keep it indoors, you could consider adopting a sibling-pair so that they can keep each other company.

&gt;For an active animal like the cat, an indoor environment can become predictable and boring, and can lead to stress, inactivity and obesity. So it’s important that you provide your cat with everything it needs.


This stat kind of highlights how pointless this argument is.  This is an Aussie website so there'll be a shit tonne of dangers for cats, like larger predators and a less forgiving environment.  The biggest biggest predatory threat here (UK) is probably foxes, but having seen my cats chase a few out the garden before I'm not too worried. And there'll either be trees or fences to climb if a fox does decide to give them a chase.

My cats have all been free to roam indoors and out.  I was born in Wales and we had two cats, one got hit by a car at 8, then we moved to a typical busy English town.  The other cat from Wales was put down at 18 due to hyperthyroidism.  We've had four cats since then, one died at 14, presumably of old age, and another had to be put down at 17 with hyperthyroidism too.  The other two are doing well, and will be 10 this summer. 

My cats were all rescue cats too, either kittens of strays or animals that had been dumped somewhere so to keep them indoors would be like imprisoning them.


Sure, one cat may have lived longer if we'd shut him inside all his life but cats are animals and it seems as cruel to me to keep anything in a completely artificial enclosure so different to it's natural environment.  

  The only time I can see it being necessary here is if you're in a dense city and there's just buildings and no gardens or parks about."

When you are an adult and train to punch (or kick) you can generate a lot of power. So much power, in fact, that it's easy to break your own bones. This is why MMA has gloves -- **not** to protect the face, but to protect the hands.

That being said, shins are harder then feet. The ligaments can be relatively easily damaged with minimal pressure (See: heel hooks+,  toe/foot locks and straight ankle locks). The exception being the front kick, which follows the foots natural pattern (straight down). 

+these actually tend attack ligaments in the knee, but the point of leverage is the foot. 

&gt; Or maybe one of those karate-style kicks, which seem to work fine in the movies at least.

a local loan officer or bank didn't give a shit if you could make your payments. they weren't banking on housing prices going up; they were banking on Goldman or similar buying up thousands of mortgages and selling them to pensions.

People to this day have no idea who actually hold the mortgages on shitloads of property because unwinding them was so complicated. 

Oh, and defaulting worked in, guess what, Wall Street's favor! plenty of hedge funds and investment firms *bet on the securities failing!* In fact, Magnetar:

Anderson Silva has been watched by MMA fans for the past ~7 years as UFC champion and even some are familiar with him beforehand so some attachment whether is positive or negative is only natural. He's been fighting 5 years before I even watched my first full MMA match."

Except that's not true at all. There were plenty of matchup threads across many servers that were completely fine with no issues at all. The ones who stoked the fire were often repeat offenders and obviously worthless idiots who would benefit from being suspended for a few weeks.

I am not saying people should be instantly permabanned for a few small things, but harsher moderation with repeat offenders would have gone a very long way towards fixing the few servers that were always an issue without ruining it for all those that were not.

Edit: 
    Prologue:

    I remember years ago when I first started working out and posting here I went out and put together a program all on my own. I thought it through very thoroughly and was very proud of myself when I'd finished. I made a new thread about it and asked for people to critique it in the title. I expected for the most part people would approve of it and might offer tiny suggestions to improve on it.

    What I got was people telling me it was awful and I needed to scrap it completely and pick up a pre-made program which was created by someone who was an expert in the weightlifting/strength training or bodybuilding field.

    I was upset and annoyed at the time, however it was sound advice. They were right. My program sucked, I did not know what I was doing and if I'd followed it I wouldn't have made any significant long-term gains.

    Ask yourself this: Do you know more than Mark Rippetoe, Bill Starr or anyone who has studied strength and hypertrophy training for years and has had countless more years of empirical evidence to refine their knowledge on how to make progress in the gym? (The answer is, of course, ""no"").

    Then why would you use some program you've made over one of theirs?

seanomenon,stopdrinking,1389136805.0,"&gt;Turns out, just one alcoholic drink could make you feel warmer, but it actually lowers your core body temperature.

[Source: The Mythbusters!](http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/alcohol-warms-up.htm)

With continued sobriety, you will probably find it easier to take action on problems in your life. Problems like poor heat. Getting drunk just numbs your pain, calling the landlord can get your heat fixed. Or you can move.

You made it one day sober, that's huge. Do it again.

I also used to live in an apartment with very poor heating. Lots of layers on the bed helps - layers on you, and layers of blankets. If you have a sleeping bag you might consider breaking that out. Good luck, it is getting warmer this week."

Sign a LB and a big name Creative mid, then over a window or two bring in promising talent, especially in midfield, Granit Xhaka and William Carvalho would be my suggestions. While doing this we should also try to brig up youth players and sign a relatively big name winger like Reus or Di Maria.


Finally Moyes needs to appoint a Quieroz type figure to assist with tactics. I love Phil Neville but it was suicidal to bring him in as a first team coach and sack Rene."

calrebsofgix,Foodforthought,1389136818.0,"I've had a very similar experience. I have a very high IQ (and perform well on other tests, also, but that's unimportant) and was told from a young age that I was a ""genius"" and that I had ""great potential"". When I was a child (elementary), I was moved into a talented and gifted program at my school in which kids were expected not to complete specific coursework but instead to move at their own pace. 

When I left that school system and moved on to highschool, I found that I received no positive attention from my teachers. I would go to my AP classes, sleep through them, and get C's in the classes not because I didn't understand the coursework but instead because I refused to complete any assignments. I passed my collegiate level physics class without ever attending a single ""lecture"", despite the fact that attendance was ""mandatory"". 

Fast forward ten years: from graduating highschool at 16 and going directly to college I dropped out after my first semester. I took jobs all over the country in sales, food service, telemarketing, and many other fields. I surpassed expectations at each of these jobs but always hit a ceiling. I moved more quickly than my superiors were comfortable with... and I was an asshole because I thought I was smarter than them. Whether I was or not is immaterial. I had my nose in the air. I remember one boss specifically asking me to stop finishing her sentences for her - even though I was almost always right. 

At the end of the day? I'm a 27yo college dropout who won't complete his bachelor's until the end of next year (I went back). I hate school. I feel old. I haven't accomplished anything of note and even though I'm the sort of guy who takes advanced mathematics as electives I'm not going into a STEM field. I'm the poster child of America's failure to educate and motivate math-minded individuals into the technology sector. Sure, I compose music and write books and invent things in my spare time but, frankly, in some other world I'm off doing research in a lab somewhere inventing a new kind of math or making breakthroughs on sustainable fusion. Somewhere I'm Elon Musk on his way to Mars. I'm happy with who I am. I'm glad to do the things I do. At the same time its hard not to spend your idle days wondering what you could've been if you'd lived up to your (much-touted) ""potential"". 

And, honestly, I feel like my intelligence is a burden to me. It's yolked me with some great purpose. If I don't get at least a Wikipedia entry before I die I'll always feel that I'm a failure. Nothing I do can live up to the high standards I've set for myself. It's horrible. Sometimes, when I'm alone I wish, very secretly, that I was average... or even just a little above average. I think I'd like people more. I think that maybe I wouldn't think so much about everything. But I don't know. It drives me crazy."

""This is your initial foot in the door to eventually controlling said person or at least influencing them enough to be useful through their psychological soft spot, the ego. You validate them by making them feel good for improving you, this creates a positive feedback cycle where they work for you and help improve you because it feels good for them to do so, you could call it benevolent exploitation – it becomes positively reinforced for them to help you so you can utilise them in absurd amounts...""

So basically, LET them praise you and condemn you.  Just don't take their words seriously.  Just let them THINK you take them seriously. 

Then, tell them you're life is improving because of their ""manipulation"", maybe even finds ways of demonstrating it so they both further believe you and feel even better.

Then BOOM, become their master.

Not sure if all this can be accomplished in one night meeting at a bar...  but if women are going to be manipulative (one way or the other), might as well use it to your advantage.

I agree with that.  Being proud of your height or embracing your height as a short person is a simple way to challenge heightism.

A lot of recent posts on /r/short have this sort of mentality.  

To me, if you really accept your height, you'll HATE heightism even more.

Our second cat turns into a terroristic asshole if he doesn't get outside - he starts pulling books &amp; games from their shelves, one by one with a single claw, begins shredding any paper that's around the computer, starts pulling on random computer cords while I'm working, purposefully steps on the remote to change the channel or volume... But, let him outside for a short while every day, and he's calm, sweet, cuddly and happy when he's in. 

If I go for a while without my feet touching the earth, I start to feel ungrounded (ha) and disconnected. I think it's the same for our jerk of a kitty (whom we absolutely love).

Every cat's needs are different. Like [/u/gogoluke said](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1umuda/shes_too_little_to_let_outside_yet_but_i_still/cejtrfy), assess your cat and your situation, and decide accordingly.

Take the metal tip of the coil to your mouth and blow out the juice inside there.  Let dry for a few minutes.

After all that screw the coil back onto the metal ring, and screw that back onto your protank base.  Flip back over and let the wick saturate again, and screw back onto battery-and this is the important part- do not screw all the way down.  Take that beauty ring that came with it and keep that screwed on, but not all the way.  That way your protank can securely screw into the 510 threads and be supported by the threads AND the beauty ring.  DO NOT screw the protank on all the way.

Setting my home up in such a way that the important things are at the 4' mark or higher means that I'm constantly aware of what needs to be done.

Bills: I've been in the habit of paying bills each pay day before doing anything else with the funds. It's like a knee-jerk reaction now.

Vaguely_Reckless,fasting,1389137262.0,"I can only give you a few answers and take them with a grain of salt because I'm new to this too so I can really only tell you what I've read.

*  Technically a water fast is just water and only water. However some people consume other liquids during their fast, there is technically no hard set rule. I've decided to do a water/tea fast because I like to have green tea in the morning before work and I never add anything to it (like milk or sugar) so, for me, that's ok. But others might disagree.

*  Just because you fast now doesn't mean you can't ever have a cheeseburger again. Many people revisit fasting on a regular schedule once or twice a year to ""reset"" their bodies because lets face it, nobody can eat perfectly clean and healthy 100% of their lives (and ""clean and healthy"" is a completely relative term depending on who you're talking to anyway).  So go ahead with your fast, knowing you'll have a cheeseburger at some point, but at least wait a few weeks after the end of your fast and when the time comes, don't pig out on it, just do a small one. And also I recommend gong to the grocery store and getting the ingredients to make a delicious cheeseburger yourself because a fast food burger is filled with WAY more crap than just beef!"

These masks are actually made for gravely wounded soldiers.  Plastic surgery back then was capable of restoring some shape and use, but paid little attention to aesthetics.  That's where these came in (if you've seen [the guy on Boardwalk Empire](http://static.phx2.tvgcdn.net/MediaBin/Content/101101/News/1_mon/101101mag-jack-huston1.jpg) with the masked piece over his eye, it's like that).

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1389137280.0,"That's a really good question. It's also a highly guarded answer. The fact is, no one knows how search engines *specifically* work except some high level people in the company. There is, of course, lots of speculation. 

Generally, what we know is this:

* Crawlers search the internet and download text from the website
* The search engine then displays this text; text that seams relevant to the topic the user is searching for gets elevated based upon how others view it. 
* It also displays custom results for things it know interest you.

So basically, if I'm Joe Blow, and I do a lot of searching on google for ""kids products"" and click on diapers, google will figure out that I'm interested in Childrens Products and not salt licks for goats. It'll also figure out that I (probably) have a baby. It will display things more relevant in that regard.

Additionally, if Jim Blogger is a known blogger for Children Products, and he references a website in his blog, google will rank that site as related to childrens products.

There's muscle there, and calluses too.  Usually they have a lot of sticky-out veins.  They're often a bit grey or brown, from years of getting dirt, oil and other detritus stuck in cracks so fine it'll only come out a hundred washes later.  Put those hands on me and I go all wibbly.

tjejen,polyamory,1389137315.0,"Ok, so I've been in a very similar situation, and here's my thought for you:  Give your hotel/booze/smoke-fest an end-date.  It sounds like you kind of already have, so that's cool.  You seem to be very aware of what you're doing, and why, so just pick a day and rough time (ex: Thursday afternoon) to be done, sober, and showered by.

That's all.  You'll probably be done before then anyway.

Everything else will fall into place afterward.  You seem to already know what's going to happen, so really it's just sorting out logistics for the immediate future.

It's okay to walk away if your situation is too painful.  It's very possible that in the future, in a few months or a year or two, that you and she will reconnect in a slightly different way and be able to have a good relationship, but assuming that will happen, *planning* for it to happen, will make you crazy.  Focus on being a healthy person, and practice thinking of GF as just a friend or acquaintance.  It's okay to be solo and find your own future."

seanomenon,stopdrinking,1389137374.0,"It's very simple: don't have a drink. If you don't have that first drink, you can't have the 5th or 8th or 10th drink. It won't make you sick if you don't have any. So don't have any. It isn't like a diet, where you need to carefully control your intake, because you don't need alcohol to live. Simply don't have any.

*Simple* does not mean *easy*, though. Not by a long stretch. It's gonna be tough. It's gonna be a battle. The alcoholic part of you will do anything it can to convince you to drink. ""Just one, it can't hurt, everyone does it, just take it easy!"" Lies. All lies. It might switch tactics and make you mourn over never drinking again. Well, you don't need to worry about the rest of your life: you just need to not drink today. Go to bed sober tonight, and know that you've achieved something. Then worry about tomorrow, tomorrow.

I personally found the support of other sober drunks to be invaluable when I first quit drinking. They helped me to learn to live sober, which is another challenge. I find that support here, in /r/alcoholism, and at AA meetings. [This link lists AA meetings near you.](http://www.aa.org/lang/en/subpage.cfm?page=28) I highly recommend trying a few.

People who are unaware that they are committing a rape, either by a lack of education or a different moral upbringing are not necessarily psychopath's. It depends on how they react to finding they they have hurt and destroyed a fellow human being by their actions. If they feel remorse, regret or sadness, then obviously they have *some* empathy, But if they shrug it off, after hearing what consequences their actions had on the victims life, if they try and blame the victim because they don't think its their fault, well IMO, they're a psychopath because they have no regard for human suffering they caused."

That is with the given caveat that it is important he gets the nutrients he needs. However, if he has problems like diabetes or heart disease, then diet is much more important.  

It's really positive that you and your husband want to take an active role in your FIL's health. Just remember that it's a delicate situation. Sit down and make a plan with your husband, and then sit down and make a plan with him. Come to a consensus together. Express your feelings in productive, nonjudgmental ways. Accept your FIL's decisions, but make sure he understands your needs. It seems like there's some sort of disconnect there right now.  

In medicine, your FIL is in the driver's seat. There's not a lot that you can do to change that, since it seems that he has his mental faculties.

So when we turned 10 we read the 10 year old's book, then at 11 we read the 11 year old's and so on.

The interesting part is that the books encouraged boys and girls to read the books together and ask each other questions. Then of course we would ask our parents when we didn't get something and no amount of talking between us would produce an adequate idea.

Should black women be less black?

ValarDohaeris,introvert,1389137846.0,"I used to be a doormat. I'm not now.

The key that got me to speak up for myself was to get the other person in private to speak to them. That way there aren't a million distractions, and you are free of the weight of others' eyes (and unhelpful comments). The sooner, the better.

Conflict resolution all boils down to a lot of the same things. Explain the situation as you understand it, explain how it impacted you and what you feel went wrong, and explain the consequences/results that you want. Don't make it about them. Someone I work with apparently never learned how to have an argument, and when she gets upset she lashes out with ""X always ________!"" and such. No. Another person I work with gets sarcastic and uses it as a bludgeon, while trying to maintain a posture of being purely logical and emotionally distanced from the issue at hand. No. Don't frame yourself, and don't frame anyone else. Just focus on the issue.

Confrontation is mandatory in your life, or else you're living your life on **EVERYBODY** ELSE'S TERMS except for your own. You have to make the decision that it's time to live your life on your terms, and that others have a duty to respect those terms if they want to be around you.

It takes time to learn. Don't think that you're ever going to be completely proficient at it, because interpersonal interactions run the gamut on difficulty to approach. That's why there are so many requests for advice on how to approach situations from relationships to parenting to everything else - and why there are so many varied responses.

There are other things you have to consider too. You have to learn to lock down your emotional response and use your thoughtfulness to produce meaningful, expressive statements that can provide a clear message to someone else. Your emotions are absolutely valid, but when you're deep in the weeds with an issue, you need to contain negatives like rage and hurt if they're overpowering the content of your message. 

That said - if someone tries to undermine what you're telling them because you're being ""emotional"", or if they tell you to ""calm down"", you need to nip that in the bud and tell them to LISTEN. Because again - those are your terms. You want to be heard, you want to right the wrongs, you don't want to drown in a sea of regret. I think you deserve those things. "

wiseblueberry,AskReddit,1389137854.0,"I've kinda got 3 shitty things in the running, so I'll list them all.

1. I desperately need dental work done.  I've had no dental insurance and no dental care for the last few years.  I broke a tooth a year or so ago and could not afford to do anything about it.  In addition to that, I have at least 3 cavities that I am aware of (possibly more).  I finally have dental insurance again as of January 1st, but am stretched so tight financially that I still can't do anything about it.  I brush, floss, and use an antiseptic fluoride rinse, but my enamel is weak.  Last night my teeth hurt so much that I couldn't fall asleep.

2. My bf got into the nursing program, which is amazing, yay, good things to come and all.  However, the things he has to do before school starts are *so expensive*.  We've been muddling through it, he had to have health insurance, and because of his income, he should be eligible for Medicaid, but they take forever to process, so to maintain his spot in the program, I had to buy him short term coverage while we wait for a decision from medicaid.  He had to get proof of his childhood immunizations, which was a giant pain in the ass.  He has to get boosters for some immunizations.  He has to get a TB test. He has to get a physical (thankfully we found a doctor that takes his short term insurance so that will only cost $50).  He has to get a varicella titer to prove he had chickenpox as a child.  His books are going to be around $1200 and I don't know how we will pay that if his financial aid isn't disbursed before class starts (he already completed all of the appropriate paperwork back in the fall, but has no clear answers to when his money will be available and how much will be left after tuition, program fees, etc).  He has to get CPR certified, and not community CPR, some higher level that evidently only one person in this area can schedule him for and she wasn't answering her phone or checking her voicemail until yesterday (he's been calling since fall semester ended).  He also has to get a couple pairs of scrubs, a waterproof watch with a plastic band and military time, slip resistant shoes, and specific uniform scrubs that will only be worn certain days.  It's a lot of stuff to do/pay for, and they really didn't give him a lot of time to get it done.

3. I was supposed to be able to get health insurance through healthcare.gov but am unsure how I will afford the $200 premium by 1/10/14.  I need the insurance, but don't have a way to make it happen.  I didn't have health insurance last year and had some medical problems that ended up costing me quite a bit of money (I'm unmarried with no kids and ""make too much money"" for sliding scale payments anywhere...nevermind the college student I am supporting....he doesn't count because there's no piece of paper binding him to me).

TLDR: Teeth cost money, school costs money, health insurance costs money, money, money, money.

TtWD is part of Nightmare's defining set because it sounds so subdued and melancholy while still delivering a lot of emotion and feeling - this seems to be Nightmare's big trait.  I love the timbre of the opening with the simple acoustic chord progression and Johnny's mild soloing on the bass.  Obviously Matt's singing is some of his most powerful on any album and the lyrics match the emotion."

Ok, best place to start is the voltage if you aren't changing the clearomizers out too often and want it to be easier.  If you plan on switching between a lot of different clearomizers with different resistances then changing wattage is better.  Start low and move up until you get a good strong vape (cloud and flavor production).  Personally when i use mine i set it at 4 volts in the morning and work my way up through the day if i need to.  

Each ""sweet spot"" is different for each kind of ejuice, not just the tank type and resistances.  It is fun playing around with the numbers until you get that perfect vape."

A just God would reward the good and punish the bad. And when those sins are punished (by death as per your example), the punishment is paid.

If you say each sin has infinite punishment, then each deed must have infinite reward.

atrain728,civ,1389138431.0,"Civ 2/3/4 were pretty linear in the resource development gameplay. Cities produced food, gold, and hammers pretty much exclusively from tiles. Population of cities determined the number of tiles you worked, which determined the amount of gold you earned (thus science, since science was worked into the finance system) and also the amount of hammers you created. And gaining food meant gaining growth, thus gaining tiles, and so on.

The only thing limiting your height is your relatively small city borders and the only thing limiting your width is the gone (but not forgotten) corruption penalties (this is replaced by happiness - more on that later).

Stop thinking like that.

You still need population to do things, it's the basis for everything else. And all other things equal, a bigger city *is* a more productive city. But that's just the thing - all other things are probably not equal. You still need to work tiles, but your specialists - while they can't produce food - they can produce everything else. And if you get them lots of bonuses, they'll produce *lots* of it.

As for food, keep in mind that buildings like granary, aqueducts, etc take on a different form now: no longer do they raise artificial gates, they just make growth faster. So if growth is the key, these buildings are better than any mere tile. And heck, if you're running BNW, you can really accelerate growth with a Caravan of food to the city of your choice. Production the same way.

But forget growth, because very quickly growth is going to be limited by happiness. So, to answer your question, your cities are big enough when they naturally cannot grow any more. You'll find, at least, in the upper levels of the game - a lot of the game is fighting the happiness wall. So the goal, in that respect isn't necessarily having the most population but ***the most efficient population***.

Specialists don't have to factor into having an efficient population, they're just one of a myriad of ways you can tailor your empire. There are many perks that give benefits to specialists - through wonders, leader abilities, social policies. If you decide to make specialist production a focus of your Civ's economy, you aim to collect these things. In time, you'll see your specialists spewing tons of added effects.

Better or worse than a traditional economy? That's measured only in the comparison of the specialist effects to the tile effects. UA, Social Policies, Religion choices, Wonders can affect tile benefits as well. And there's room for mixing and matching.

Try a play through as Korea, and aim for running specialists/specialist benefits whenever you can. You'll quickly discover you're dominating in several categories(provided your skill level is set appropriately).

Also, don't think of cities in terms of their size as their strength - think of cities as individuals with talents. Your Capital is going to naturally be a super strong city, but each city you found should generally have a purpose. Think ""this is a science city"" and ""this is a production city"" ""this is a gold city"" and so on. You'll really want to tailor the cities to their purpose, because there are far too many buildings to build and they aren't free. You can and will add some complementary buildings to the other cities - all cities in my games generally get a library, some times they all get monuments, they all get markets - but my science city will be timed to start building a university as soon as education completes. Moreover, there's lots of buildings that require a specific tile - observatories require mountains, and jungles produce science after some tech. Mountainside jungle city? I know what's going there. That kind of stuff comes with experience, and they aren't hard and fast rules (I've won plenty of games without an observatory) but it's a nice consideration when planning your empire. You still want to focus on luxury resource acquisition when founding cities, IMO - so certainly don't neglect that. For me, it's the *other* features that determine what *kind* of city will go there.

seanomenon,stopdrinking,1389138432.0,"You can't change your past, but it doesn't have to control your future. 

The only person you can control is yourself.

I like to remind myself of these things. They're both great ideas, I'm just very shaky on the practical applications. 

I also find it helpful to remember that I don't need to decide most things right away. Sometimes sleeping on it is a good idea, sometimes deciding to postpone a decision is a good idea.

I'm very glad to hear you're seeing a therapist. I am (finally) dealing with a lot of childhood problems I'd buried. I put off seeing a therapist for my entire adult life, but now that I'm doing it I can't imagine how I could have ever dealt with it on my own. 

You're strong and self-aware. I can tell that from your post, and also know it because you made the decision to quit drinking. That takes strength and self-awareness. Keep your strength and self-awareness up.

Also know that early sobriety has a lot of emotional minefields. Alcoholics aren't used to actually experiencing our emotions when we first sober up. Keep sober, and you will learn to deal a little better. 

Good luck to you."

This can be either putting as much damage on a turret as safely possible, or using the opportunity to force a dragon if their mid has roamed top.

The one thing a lot of players struggle with is reacting too late. If you roam late, you waste your time and give the opposing mid laner no penalty for roaming. If you push late, the opposing mid laner might be able to get back in time to still get his farm, or might catch you out in a bad position."

 Hopefully Kishi will actually tell us the Uchiha's side of the coup (but I'm not keeping my hopes up) as it would fill in a huge gap.  We need to know why the Uchiha started the coup, what Tobirama meant by ""I knew Madara's will was secretly shared by a few"", and where Fugaku and Mikoto were on the night Kurama attacked the village.  Was Tobirama refering to Zetsu thinking he was with the actual Uchiha clan?  That would be suspicion on an innocent man.  Did the Uchiha actually want to take Kurama back and claim it as their own?

Corbenik,whowouldwin,1389138724.0,"&gt; Can I argue that Force Precog is an ability to predict and the ability to predict ones opponent or a battle can be learned through experience or some have the natural gift of doing so...wouldn't you say that DBdore and Voldy have such gifts also?

No. Force precog is something that some force users will develop naturally (such as the Exile), but most force users need large amounts of training. If they haven't exhibited that form of precog by their age, then they need training.

Essentially, force precog is similar to spider sense, except that it's more effective when powerful force users are using it. Dumbledore and Voldemort might have a vision of the future, but in Star Wars lingo that's a force vision. The major limitation of force precog is that someone has to have intent to attack the force user, and neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort have any prior knowledge of the force (otherwise they'd be using it instead of magic) so they wouldn't be able to take advantage of this limitation.

&gt; Agreed but that would also mean that the moment Voldemort &amp; Dumbledore wraps and crushes Kreia with flaming ribbons she would experience 3rd degree burns and internal bleeding.

They wouldn't be able to reach her. Kreia in particular is known for simultaneously hold several objects telekinetically, as seen with her lightsabers. Kreia's biggest advantage is that she can attack instantly and that none of her powers require time to seek out a target or cross over some space. While in the body of an old woman, she's exhibited force-speed and force-strength. Also, she's retardedly hard to kill through physical damage.

&gt; Voldemort doesn't simply get goaded and attack, he studies and researches before he even attempts something. This can be seen when he asked Ollivander and borrowed and wand of Lucius before attemping to attack Harry again or when only attempted to take over the Ministry of Magic only when the senior ministers were under the imperius curse. He needs info before he attacks.

Only if he views them as a threat. And there's no one in the Harry Potter universe as manipulative as Kreia. There are very few people in any universe as manipulative as Kreia. We're talking about someone who manipulated some sith into killing the entirety of the jedi and then manipulated the last jedi into recreating the order in her prescribed image.

I can tell that you really want Voldemort and Dumbledore to win. Here are some things that need to be true for that to happen. One, prior knowledge of her powers. Two, they would have to take her by surprise (impossible due to force precog). Three, lightsabers would have to be unable to block the killing curse. Four,  they would have to be made immune to her mind hacks despite being able to use their own. Five, and one of the most important ones, her telekinetic powers don't work on them. If you did all of that, Kreia would lose. But that's a *really* biased fight."

shogi_x,AskReddit,1389138735.0,"At my office, the upper floors are unused.  One of them used to be an office, which is now dark, quiet, and ""spooky"" (other's call it that, I like it).  Whenever I want to just be alone for a bit, I go up there into someone's old cubicle which is kinda tucked away.  Usually the same one every time.  It's a bit funny to me that someone with a completely separate life used to sit there and toil away, but now it's vacant and I use it to get away when I can.  No one else goes up there for anything, except me.  If the heating and plumbing up there worked, it would be perfect.

When I'm at home, my room is my sanctuary.  I can sit there in the dark for hours without being bothered by so much as a text message.  Most of the time no one bothers me, but when they do I just turn on my headphones and pretend no one is there.

Above all else though, my solitude is in my head.  I'm quite prone to zoning out and daydreaming.  I keep my earbuds with me all the time to block everything out.

ShotgunWedding,snowboarding,1389138756.0," Could be a couple things!

* **You aren't following all the way through with your head**, and thus stalling your rotation mid-air.  This was a *huge* problem for me, and it still crops up if I haven't thrown a 3 in a while.  Basically, you prime the spin with your arms by loading, but your head is what ensures that the body follows.  While you're in the air, keep your head PINNED to whichever shoulder you're looking over until you've completed the rotation.  My eyes would always catch my take off point once I got halfway around, and my head would keep looking at it which then killed my rotation.


**Solution:** I reverted to flat spinning (this will probably also help with learning to butter, but you need to press to go in that direction) while I was on a gentle slope. Wind up and release like you would normally, but without the pop.  As your arms start the rotation and you feel your edge break loose, carry your head around and look over your shoulder.  If you keep your head pinned and with a little bit of edge control, you shouldn't have any problem with catching an edge.  Keep doing this till you can spin around comfortably.  You can use this to practice spins in either direction!  If all of that's coming together, and you have enough airtime from the jump, then your next 3 attempt should be a success or much closer to one! 

 
* **You're killing your rotation with your arms**.  If your head isn't the problem, you might be getting too relaxed in the air with your arms (I doubt this considering you can get almost around flat).  Once you start the spin, your arms shouldn't move much to conserve the angular momentum they imparted.  If you're moving them counter to your rotation at all, or get lax about carrying them around with your body, then your rotation will slow or stop. 

**Solution:** I'd just keep throwing down flat ground spins and focus on keeping your arms going in the same direction, and in the same place relative your body on take off.

* The addition of forward motion to the trick is doing **squirrel-y things with your brain's internal physics department**, and you're not unloading with as much force (this was also an issue for me at times). As with any new trick, the thought of not being certain what's going to happen makes us cautious, and hesitant to fully commit.

**Solution:** Keep trying, and huck it harder! 

* **You're not giving yourself enough airtime off the jump**. Unlikely, but possible.

**Solution:** Pop harder, find a better jump, or go faster. Possibly get stronger"

sjhill,unitedkingdom,1389138905.0,"Right, let's see how much it actually costs to shoot one badger...

Start-up costs - couple of hundred quid for a FAC - paperwork needs done, copies of documents and so on.

Rifle, [according to this doc](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/200909/pb13922-shooting-guidance-20130517.pdf) it has to be .22 centrefire, sadly ruling out most .22lr rifles for £150 quid or so... so we're talking something like [this .308](http://www.gunwatch.co.uk/guns/8805-Savage-Arms-111-for-sale) which is overspec for badgers, but you could also hunt deer with it... so that's £300. In addition, let's say £50 for a couple of boxes of ammunition, to get you comfortable with the weapon, so we're up to about 6 or 7 hundred quid.

Now, I can't just go busting caps one someone else's land, so I need (ideally, written) permission to shoot, usually this is free, but let's say it costs a bit of money for their time and my time to arrange this... £30 an hour, each, because we can, and I'm pulling numbers out of my arse, so we're up to £800 tops (I've thrown in a bit of petrol there too). 

Any half competent land owner will know where badgers tend to live, so it should hopefully cut your canvassing times down, so let's say you charge a day rate of £300 - obviously you're not guaranteed to get a badger on your first visit, so let's say 3 days... £!000 or so, including travel, some pies, some more ammunition...

One badger, plus startup costs £2k tops, with subsequent badgers at, say £1000 a head, would still be cheaper than whatever the government have come up with.

I should also say, as a scientist, and farmer's grandson, the badger / cattle tb thing is mostly bullshit, and foxes are more of a menace to livestock than badgers."

I'm about to get my hands on a Bubba'd Gew98, the stock has been hacked up but the sights, barrel, receiver and other guts are unaltered. I know how to fix most problems that are seen with surplus rifles, so I simply need a stock, but its been very hard to find a stock, literally none of them are for sale anywhere that are original, all I find are either Persians, Turks or repros. 
To address you other reply, I started about the same time. Saved my allowance money and did people's lawns until I had the money to buy a Kar98k, I still have it years later and I'd eventually like to get one of every Mauser. Chillian, Belgian, Persian, Czech, Chinese, etc. But with the way prices are going I wonder if I'll ever be able to have such a collection. I'm not going to lie to you, I am very jealous of your collection and your ability to get all that before it was expensive. 
I'm glad to hear that you can still get things though by talking to people. I've encountered that only slightly, an older gentleman at a gun show gave me some 1920's Izhevsk stripper clips for my Mosin just because I was willing to sit and chat with him a while. But I've never gotten anything major in that way. I find that most of the time when I talk to people at shows they either aren't friendly because ""what does a college kid know about guns"" or they flat out lie to me about the rifles and try to rip me off. Thankfully though the older military veterans are always very friendly and love teaching me the ropes of collecting and repairing military surplus weapons.
But anyways, thank you so much for looking and at least being willing to help me out! Its nice to talk to someone who appreciates the historical stuff, so much of this subreddit is dedicated to the tacticool guns I feel like quite a minority at times.  

If you have any other tips for building my collection I'd love to hear them :)"

&gt;But in the eighteenth century something changed. For reasons that are so far obscure, men stopped wearing beards and, more than this, the beard even became socially unpopular. The eighteenth-century culture of politeness certainly played a part in this. The ‘man of letters’ was clean-shaven; the beard was seen as hiding the face, whereas shaving it left it clean and smooth and, therefore, more aesthetically pleasing. Having an ‘open countenance’ was also a metaphor for an open mind – the keystone of the enlightened thinker.

&gt;New shaving technologies also played a part. The invention of cast steel in the mid-eighteenth century meant that sharper and longer-lasting blades were available, making shaving a less uncomfortable experience. As newspaper advertising expanded, so razormakers capitalised on this new vogue for shaving, offering not just new types of razors ‘on philisophical principles’, but also a range of other goods. These included ‘razor strops’ to keep your shiny new razor sharp, to other things such as face creams, shaving powders and scents."

7fw,fantasyfootball,1389139407.0,"Now you are asking for it. I have an amazing league that I have not found someone who has something like it.

It is a keeper auction league. $200 base cap. You draft your players to a specific dollar amount. You are able to keep that player for two years at that ""salary"". If after the first year of the ""contract"" you can extend the contract for one additional year (making it a brand new two year contract). The price of the extension is based on a tired system of points scored the season before. $5 additional if they sucked. $10 if they scored more than 150 points. and it escalates from there. If you dont want to extend, you can keep them for only one more year and must put them back in the draft pool at the end of the year.

When you trade someone you drafted, that salary is transferred between owners. There are 16 spots on the roster and your $200 salary MUST be below or equal to the salary on your roster. 

There are more nuanced points to it (additional salary cap based on placement in final rankings, auction free agents, etc.) but the above keeps things really interesting. Because of the short keeper timeline, and escalating contract extension costs, people get thrown back into the draft pool a lot, which makes each year far more exciting than a dynasty league. 

We have been doing this since the mid 90's and the core group is still together. If you are interested in seeing our league charter, let me know. It is really neat. "

Why did he say that?  There is no reason for him to say ""I am still Uchiha of the Leaf"" instead of answering Sasuke's questions.  

I'm convinced (or is it headcanon?) that Danzo wanted Itachi to kill ALL THE UCHIHA but it was his love for Sasuke that saved him and broke the Kotoamatsukami on him and him alone.  There is something unique about Sasuke beyond his lotus-sharingan that I predict we will find out.

KosherDill,AdviceAnimals,1389139489.0,"The funny thing pregnancy symptoms and period symptoms are very similar. Sore boobs, cramps, constipation and even craving can be linked to both. In cases like your wife, some women actually do experience a full fledged periods while other women get ""spotting"" which looks a lot like a period but isn't. 

To break things down even a little bit further (I won't get gross) during each cycle when a woman gets her period she gets cramps because her uterus is adjusting and moving things around to get the period out of there. Now when a woman is pregnant she may also experience cramps but that is because her body/uterus is starting to make room for a baby. In both instances the uterus is adjusting for two different but important reasons.

I'm assuming OP knows her body well enough that she knows she is not pregnant.

I had some insomnia troubles when I first quit drinking too. I think there are a few reasons, any of which might apply to you. You could be used to *passing out* instead of *falling asleep*, so you body and brain need to adjust. You could be drinking more caffeine than is healthy. (Either for something to drink, or because you are used to coffee-ing your way through a hangover.) Are you a smoker? That might be keeping you up. If you can limit your intake of caffeine, nicotine, and sugar, especially in the afternoon and evening, it will help you sleep better. Its easy to get in a bad cycle of sleep poorly-&gt;drink lots of coffee-&gt; repeat. Getting a little direct sunlight and exercise (even light exercise) during the day helps a lot too.

ShamelesslyPlugged,books,1389139667.0,"Okay, I'm going to start with the ""opposite"" of what you want.  

[Myke Cole's Shadow Op's series](http://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Ops-Control-Myke-Cole-ebook/dp/B005ERIJ2U/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389139683&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=control+point) is the modern US military if magic suddenly returned. I've linked the first book in the series.  

Now, you didn't like Starship Troopers, so you're likely to not like John Ringo. If you go to http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/ you can find a bunch of his books for free there. Look for A Hymn Before Battle, Into the Looking Glass, or There Will Be Dragons.  

Also on that website is David Weber, who does Space Opera. Although not a dark setting, it is constantly at war and has any number of political strawmen dystopias. Start with On Basilisk Station.  

If you find you like Weber and Ringo, March Upcountry is a joint work you may enjoy.  

Also on that site is David Drake. Hammer's Slammers is futuristic tank mercenaries and is a bit gritty. The RCN series is probably more lighthearted than you're going for, but is loosely based on the British Imperial misadventures from history. Starts with With the Lightnings.  

u/LaoBa suggested Scott Westerfeld. I second said suggestion. I think it fits what you want, and he does create a fascinating universe. [Books start here.](http://www.amazon.com/Risen-Empire-Scott-Westerfeld-ebook/dp/B004JF5YQ2/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389139087&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=risen+empire) I think.  

Another series I really enjoyed that is in the Space Opera genre is Walter Jon William's Dread Empire Falls. I would call it neither depressing nor optimistic. [Start here.](http://www.amazon.com/Praxis-Dread-Empires-Fall-ebook/dp/B000UOJTRQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389139167&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dread+empire%27s+fall)  

[John Scalzi's Old Man's War goes without saying as being excellent.](http://www.amazon.com/Old-Mans-War-John-Scalzi-ebook/dp/B000SEIK2S/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389139231&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=old+man%27s+war) It does have an optimistic tone, but that depends in part on your perspective.  

[John Steakley's Armor](http://www.amazon.com/Armor-John-Steakley/dp/0886773687/ref=la_B000AQ0U0Y_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389139294&amp;sr=1-1) is also considered a classic, in the same spirit as Starship Troopers and Forever War.  

The Warhammer 40k books are an options, if that's something you like. Gaunt's Ghosts and Ciaphis Cain are the best of it. The former is darker, but the universe is the grimdark trope.  

I thoroughly enjoyed Ian Douglas' USMC books. [Start here.](http://www.amazon.com/Semper-Mars-Heritage-Trilogy-Douglas-ebook/dp/B0012GTZEI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389139486&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=semper+mars) Starts in the near future on Mars, goes on to becoming an interstellar crusade hundreds of years later. Some of the revelations could be considered depressing.  

Steven Kent's Clone Republic is about a US interstellar hegemony based on the use of clone soldiers. Then stuff just spirals. [Start here](http://www.amazon.com/Clone-Republic-Steven-L-Kent-ebook/dp/B001JJWIBA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389139631&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=clone+republic)  

I can find more, if you'd like, but hopefully this is a place to start.  

EDIT: As with every lengthy endeavor done hastily, mistakes were made and certain things forgotten. I can personally vouch for some other recommendations such as Peter Hamilton's stuff (all of which I thoroughly enjoyed), James SA Corey's Expanse series, and Jack Campbell's Lost Fleet. Morgan's Altered Carbon and Birmingham's Weapons of Choice are on my lengthy to do list. And I can still think of 3-4 more series that I left off this list that I'm tempted to add, but won't."

riseandrise,AskWomen,1389139742.0,"I think it depends on the particular circumstances.

But then he explained that he'd slept around a lot trying to find validation, and all of the meaningless sex showed him that he didn't find sex without an emotional connection fulfilling. That aligns pretty well with my feelings about sex, and is very different from someone sleeping around because they don't place a high emotional value on sex. 

People's feelings and motivations change, and I don't think it's fair for either sex to ignore that when judging potential partners. "
SirJefferE,AskMen,1389139742.0,"That ""Love him the way he is"" thing always confused me. You don't have to love every single thing about a person just because you love the person. You can live a perfectly happy life with someone and still be mildly annoyed by things they do or wish to change small parts of them.

For example, what if 'the way he is' includes the cleaned up image he wants to present you? If you want to dig past that cleaned up image to find out who he really is, you're not actually respecting who he is in the slightest.

There are a lot of things that it's perfectly natural to want to hide, and there should be no shame and no ""But we should know everything about each other!"" Involved.

Still, I don't think there is any harm at all in asking. Something like, ""Hey I was just curious about what kind of porn you watch. Think I could watch some with you some time?""

If he's receptive to the idea, go for it. If he seems like it's something he'd rather do on his own, respect it."

JustinJamm,TrueChristian,1389139749.0,"Perhaps some would, but I would not, as speech is not persecution. The use of force is persecution -- such as that executed by the *force of law*. But a vilifying criticism? If it's true, let's learn from it and change -- and if it's not true, this simply lowers the credibility of the critic.

If a conservative org was trying to *ban gay-rights groups from posting ads like ""Some people are gay; get over it!"" I would say the conservative org is the one doing the persecuting,* since rather than respond to speech with speech, they are resorting to force to silence their opponents. This is precisely what social liberals do when they attempt to use force to silence their own opposition.

Individuals (and groups) are free to have opinions/beliefs about themselves and to express those beliefs. Others are not required to agree with them. But when *ANY* group simply has ""other views"" on an issue *silenced*, rather than simply disagreed-with, then injustice wins automatically.

Moreover, I believe your understanding of the ad is off. The ad did not say ""some gays got over being sick twisted humans. You should too."" Those are entirely your words, and they do not paraphrase the ad. Attacking such a strawman only makes people sound accusative, even though I'm sure this is legitimately inspired by *very real hatred and contempt* many people have shown to homosexuals. Having legitimate anger towards real oppression just not justify silencing anyone; it only justifies disempowering the oppression itself.

Consider, for example, whether it would've been ""honest"" of me to assert the *pro*-gay ad had said, ""Some people are just sick and twisted. Get over it!"" See? How absurd and dishonest of me.

Rather, the original ad was essentially saying, ""Many gays experience their orientation as being 100% biological, intrinsic and unchangeable. Stop ignoring their stories."" And the response ad was essentially saying, ""Then why do people ignore the stories shared by ex-gays? Their stories would be impossible if homosexuality was simply intrinsic. We're simply listening to *both* sets of stories. Why don't you?""

See, it's really a mutual accusation of denial by both parties. One group (social conservatives) refuses to believe active-gay testimonies insisting that attempting to change has been hurtful/impossible for them, and one group (social liberals) refuses to believe former-gay testimonies insisting that attempting to change has been helpful/possible for them.

I believe this is a non-strawman, honest portrayal of both sides backing the ads. And I believe they both have strong points to make, and using force to silence either one of them is both immoral and oppressive.

(This is part of the problem of ""hate speech"" arguments. It's all-too-often a magic wand people wave to silence their opponents instead of exposing the real problem with their opponent's argument.)"

Lyte_theelf,lifeinapost,1389139790.0,"Okay! Now, I'm saying this without knowing your history or current eating habits, so bear with me.

First, I'd suggest cutting out generally[ inflammatory foods](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/inflammatory-foods-worst-inflammation_n_2838643.html) (particularly those both high in [omega 6](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/omega6-fatty-acids) and low in omega 3). Vegetable oils top [the list](http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000141000000000000000-w.html) with stuff like Soy, Safflower and Sunflower oil-- all commonly used in fast food, fried food and ""standard"" American fare. 

Then look to the common food allergens and intolerances. You can be totally unaware of a food intolerance because it might not even act like one-- no stomach troubles that you notice. That was how my intolerance to dairy was; I cut it completely out of my diet for a few weeks and then had a small tub of sheep's milk yogurt (supposed to be easier to digest). I woke up the next day with my joints on fire (which I had not noticed with dairy before) and deep depression that felt just like the depression that had been dogging me for a long time. My chronic inflammatory reaction to dairy didn't reveal itself to me in a noticeable way, but when I let it completely out of my system and then reintroduced it, my body responded with an acute inflammatory reaction, clearly revealing the intolerance. 

Have you ever tried cutting out wheat,[ grains](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-to-quit-grains/#axzz2perTWLY2), dairy,[ nightshades](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/nightshades/#axzz2perTWLY2) and soy for at least 30 days? As hard as it likely sounds, once you get used to it, it's not that bad (I'm on a strict version of the [Paleo diet](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/primal-blueprint-101/#axzz2perTWLY2) and have cut those things, alcohol, carbs and sugar out of my diet for a couple months now).

So, let's say you cut all this stuff out and you're wondering what the hell you can eat now, lol. 

You'll want to increase your intake of omega 3 fatty acids by a great deal-- raw or baked [fish](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=104), and raw flax seed oil (as a dressing, not a cooking oil) are the way to go for that.

Other things I would recommend eating basically follow the Paleo strain of thought... tons of low starch vegetables and leafy greens piled high, with [organic pastured eggs](http://authoritynutrition.com/pastured-vs-omega-3-vs-conventional-eggs/) or fish [cooked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_point) in [extra virgin coconut](http://authoritynutrition.com/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-coconut-oil/) or olive oils (with a healthy dollop of raw coconut oil on top). Add some [garlic](http://www.naturalblaze.com/2013/04/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-garlic.html), onions and leeks for the unbelievable health benefits, [prebiotic fiber](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/prebiotics/) and delicious taste. Toss with plenty of anti-inflammatory spices like turmeric. 

Here are some more links to expand on above: [One](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/top-6-anti-inflammatory-foods/#axzz2perTWLY2), [Two](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/gut-flora-healthy-immune-system/#axzz2perTWLY2), [Three](http://www.whfoods.com/foodstoc.php), [Four](http://www.rd.com/slideshows/10-healing-herbs-and-spices/#slideshow=slide1)

mariesoleil,rollerderby,1389139796.0,"Note that she can't ""get started"" in roller derby without buying all of the safety gear. No roller derby league will let her start practicing without all the safety gear as well as insurance. The required safety gear includes knee pads, elbow pads, wrist guards, mouth guard, and helmet. $150 will get you some low-end safety gear.

I recommend **against** shopping online. If you don't know *exactly* what you need, you'll end with with the wrong stuff that doesn't fit. For example, the skates you linked in your OP are very low quality. Although labelled as ""derby skates,"" they are not appropriate for roller derby. The [Riedell R3](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Riedell-R3-Senior-Roller-Skates/dp/B009ZCJOC4/ref=sr_1_2?s=sports&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389138876&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=riedell+r3) is a skate that you will actually see beginning skaters play roller derby in. However, do note that cheap skates like these ones don't come with wheels appropriate for learning roller derby. Despite the marketing drivel including on the page, they don't have any grip and are not suitable for any kind of surface. Acceptable wheels cost at least $50 for a set of 8.

Again, don't shop online. Drive to a skate shop and get fitted properly. The fitment of skates is very critical. I've seen a lot of girls that need to tape up their feet every single time they skate because their skates don't fit well.

But even before getting gear, I recommend that your girlfriend check out the local derby league. Maybe she can watch a practice, ask questions about their fresh meat (beginner) program, buying gear, etc.. They will also tell you where to go to buy gear. Sometimes they will also know where to get used gear, which is okay for someone just wanting to try it out. In my area, for example, there's a facebook group just for buying and selling used derby gear. It's a good idea to check out the local leagues before spending £300 on gear only to learn that she'd have to travel a hour for the closest practice, or that they practice on days where she has to work.

I don't like us not resigning some of our own though.  If Sam Shields isn't signed, I will be very upset.  I think he's the second best defender on our team.  Letting Cullen Jenkins go will always stay with me as a huge mistake - we have only had Matthews as a good pass rusher ever since.  I wasn't concerned with Steven Jackson after his previous year with the Rams he clearly was no longer the beast he once was.  I wasn't and still am not a fan of our drafting 2 RBs in a row.  Given our defensive problems, Franklin better turn out to be something special too, or I'll continue to view that as a mistake.  Lacy was a fantastic pick.  I wanted defense or O-line rather than any RB as I felt (and still do) that Starks was capable and DuJuan Harris (who I didn't expect to miss the entire season) would be a good backfield.  Glad we made the Lacy pick in hindsight though, he's clearly a great RB.  I still think they need to give Starks more carries during games though as he's more explosive than Lacy.  Not sure what we do with DuJuan Harris come next year.  If we have those three though, Franklin better become a special teams ace or something (and then we can finally let Bush go too...).  Raji is most likely not coming back, and Pickett is pretty old.  We are going to be seriously hurting at DT next year if we don't find one in the draft or FA, hopefully the draft.  "

MrVuule,Warframe,1389139894.0,"Max out Stomp and Iron Skin. Charge you can keep or ditch, but since it won't take any mods points if you don't upgrade it, you can easily keep it (until you might remove it and forma that polarity for something else). Roar.. While a 50% bonus is nice, it's only for a short duration and it's just a waste of energy. Unless you're going to upgrade your abillity duration, but you would waste a mod slot for just that ability.

As for other mods. Ditch vitality and Steel Fiber. There's really no need to increase your base health, since you'll be using Iron Skin all the time. Armor is health related, meaning it will only reduce the damage done to your health. Do increase your shield with Redirection, just in case your Iron Skin wears off at the wrong time. (There's no real need to max Redirection, this will take a butt load of fusion anyway.)

The rest of the mods really come down to your own preference. I would slap on a Rush mod though, since Rhino is slooooow. Pay attention to the Alerts, they may reward you with a Vanguard helmet that increases Rhino speed. When equipped with this and Rush, you'll be one of the fastest Warframes I believe. You can also ditch Rush if you have this helmet.

The mods I currently use: Redirection / Streamline / Focus / Quick Rest / Stretch / Rush / Flow and the Energy Siphon Aura. 
Streamline, Flow and Energy Siphon makes it easier to use Stomp more often. Iron Skin only has to be used so often. 

Focus is used to mainly increase the damage Iron Skin can absorb, but it also increases Stomps damage output. This can be pretty nice since you can 1 hit kill an entire group. (At later levels you'll use Stomp more as a Utility to immobilize enemies though). 

Stretch increases Stomp range. At first I thought this would be a waste, but once you slap on a maxed Stretch, you'll quickly see how handy this can be. 

Rush I will swap out if I can get the Vanguard helmet. 

I used to have Fast Deflection instead of Quick Rest, but since you're pretty much using Iron Skin all the time anyway, it isn't really necessary. 

[This is my current build](http://i.imgur.com/3v4o0Po.jpg). (Not all mods are maxed yet. I'll slap a Forma on Rhino pretty soon.)

I might try out a build with a Blind Rage mod some time. This will increase the Energy cost, but it will greatly increase the amount of damage Iron Skin can absorb.

Also if you're very horizontal (most people who are relatively bad at short distances are), a couple of plyos once a week might help. I do box jumps every week. Also adding calf strength (weighted calf raises) helped my speed as well.

But for your original question. It might eventually be important, but with the amount of volume you're doing right now I don't think it's really time to bother yet. But the plyos are pretty easy to add in without any other changes.

Eventually you can add in another workout every week that is a bit faster. I just don't think this is the most productive thing to do right now based on your description of your training. "

I got there, first time ever meeting the doctor, and she says ""why have you got crutches?"" I start with ""well that's one of the reasons I am here, I have pain and weakness, the crutches enable me to maintain daily activity and stay fit"" she then says ""but you have no fractures, no broken bones, you don't need those, you are a healthy young girl"" 

I wasn't very impressed that within the first 2 minutes of the consultation she has assumed I was healthy, I hadn't yet told her anything of my history, my symptoms, my previous tests, for all she knew I could have leukaemia.

She proceeded to tell me my rheumatologist was an idiot for trying to treat my fibromyalgia with massage and exercise and what I needed was a high dose mood stabiliser and a psychiatrist to treat my ""severe depression"" that she also diagnosed me with in the first 3 minutes of the consult based on the fact that I ""looked sad""

She told me I need to stop using the crutches and get out of bed when I am having a bad day, I asked for some advice on how to get out of bed, if there were some exercises I could do to reduce the pain enough ti sit up or gain the strength to put my weight on my legs and she said ""huh? no, you are not sick, just stand up"" 

Not gouing to that GP again.

The problem was that that GP was refereed to me by my case worker at the welfare centre. I'm not surprised they acted the way they did, but I am upset, I want to work and I have been trying so hard to get better, I wish my case workers and doctors could understand that I'm at least a thousand times more willing than they are to get better, I don't enjoy being in pain. I'm there because I want to get better, not because I want free shit, there are a billion easier ways to get free shit than to be in agony 24/7."

Fun statistic: In America, every day for the next 25 years, there will be 10,000 more seniors.  I think this is going to bring an increased awareness of Adult Protective Services, and hopefully an increase in funding. Right now, best practices entail a caseload of no more than 28. My agency is wonderful and I've only gone above that for a few months while a coworker went on maternity leave. I can see the increasing amount of elderly either driving up caseloads, or freeing up funding to hire more caseworkers.

On top of that, in my state, just in July, 2013 the Illinois Department on Aging took responsibility of investigating abuse of disabled adults (18-59 y/o)from Department of Rehabilitative Services. So that's when ""Elder Abuse"" became ""Adult Protective Services"". Its a fascinating time, because we're kind of figuring that out as we go.  You see a *lot* more sexual and physical abuse when its disabled adults, and we're seeing our number of allegations increase by 40-50%."

Part of it was just the shitty lighting in the room, I'm sure; the shadows being cast on my body were ridiculous, but just looking at myself in that mirror, in that shirt, feeling like a whale, I couldn't take it anymore. When I got home I immediately signed up for a gym nearby and started going at least twice a week (though I started to lose steam come November/December). 

My goal is to lose another ten pounds by the middle of May, which is when I graduate college, not for any specific clothing but because I feel like it would be nice to start my ""new"" life at 145 lbs or less.   "

So my routine is Cerave Hydrating (instead of Foaming), wait 20 minutes, apply RetinA cream, wait 15-20 minutes then apply Cerave Cream/oils. I do this at night.

The porn he watches doesn't define him any more than the fact that you don't watch porn defines you. Imagine you told him you never watch any porn and he looked at you kind of funny and said, ""Wait...Really? That's weird.""

It would be a little judging, and you might even feel uncomfortable to be thought of as unusual, but is it a reason to leave a guy just because they think a small aspect of you is a little unusual?

People judge things whether they mean to or not, there's no reason to make a big deal with it unless it's one of the most important or defining aspects of your life.

If for example, one of you were religious and the other was an Atheist and you both felt uncomfortable about the others faith, and had unanswered questions about how you would raise your kids or whatever. *Those* are defining attributes that might actually cause problems down the line, they're things that you're going to have to seriously think about and work out if you want the relationship to work.

If either of you feel uncomfortable about the others porn habits, though? You get over it, it means nothing and you'll be able to get along and live a perfectly happy life regardless of whether or not the other person ever fully understands your porn habits."

Oh, no, you know, I *will* ask a question! You said below that you think of yourself as born female with a birth defect. Me too :D! Do you also find yourself annoyingly envious of intersex women, given that they can say this and not have people question your intentions?"

Basically they can acknowledge a sexy sister, someone they know very well (better than a girlfriend), and say that the idea that someone might develop a crush on their sister is not outside of possibility.

Supershinyface,xxfitness,1389140796.0,"Since I'm not a doctor and don't know these folks (and, presumably, at least the olympic-level athletes are receiving some kind of medical care), I'm not going to get into the ""but is it *healthy?!?!*"" debate. 

Here's my deal. How often do we see thin &amp; athletically capable people represented vs. fat &amp; athletically capable people? 

I think there's a perception that fat bodies cannot perform capably, and that in order to become *fit*, the order of operations for a fat-bodied person must be:  become thin -&gt; acquire fitness. 

And I think that upon failing to adhere to the conventional wisdom of god-awful calorie restriction and mind-numbing physical activity for the sake of dropping pounds, any number of people give up hope of ever finding any happiness in their own physical capabilities. 

What if, instead, we focused on what you could do, no matter how you are built, right now? Because that heavy woman who can dance and get herself on pointe is probably a damned sight more active and fit than her hypothetical identical twin who sits at the computer all day. 

And so. Maybe she's not as perfect a representation of ideal fitness as someone else, (or maybe she is - other representations often have their own hidden dysfunctions) but she IS an excellent representation of possibility and potential, and for that reason I find her, and the others in the post, to be quite adequate fitness-inspiration.

Omega037,changemyview,1389140817.0,"Honestly I wasn't going to do this because it has nothing to do with whether your points are valid or not, but you have made the same spelling error a few times and I just wanted to correct you for your own future notice.

The act of withdrawing from an organization is ""secession"", not ""succession.""  The latter is a word that is pronounced the same, but it means something happening in sequence.  Similarly, the past tense of the word is ""seceded"", not ""succeeded"".

Moving on from that, I am not really in disagreement with you on your points.  

We agree that slavery was the backbone of the South's economy and culture, it was the main point of contention between the North and the South, and it *absolutely* is what led to their decision to secede (not states' rights).

My only point was that when we talk about causes of the war, there is often an incorrect (or perhaps incomplete) notion that the war happened simply because the South wanted slaves.

There were really two components:

1. The South's desire to have slavery and willingness to secede in order to maintain it. (We agree on this one)

2. The North's desire to keep the South from leaving the Union and willingness to use force to prevent it."

JustinJamm,Reformed,1389141240.0,"The ""farmer"" is literally anything other than God's direct choice or the individual's direct choice. Literally anything else.

Examples:

* harsh circumstances that humble a person
* a believer who disobeys God's leading to become a missionary, and several people who would've heard the gospel *now don't* hear it
* betrayals that harden a person against all things religious
* exposure to loving believers who make the gospel attractive by their lives

Etc. It can be anything. But the net result is the same: *the sinner cannot take credit for their faith, as their softened heart was produced by a host of influences, not by their own choice.* But it also would not mean God *unconditionally chose* those people to become believers.

Scriptural support (I'm literally building this as I go, since I'm making a point, not advancing a doctrine):

Jude 22 ~ ""And have mercy on those who doubt; save others by snatching them out of the fire."" *What?* How can we snatch someone else out of the fire? Either God entirely does that Himself (Calvinism) or the believer's belief/unbelief choice fully determines that (Arminianism).

Matthew 11:20-24 ""Then {Jesus} began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent. “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.”

Evidently, if some external events had gone differently (seeing mighty works -- kinds of works not only done by Christ, but also by OT prophets, keep in mind), there would have been sincere faith on the parts of Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom. Jesus doesn't say, ""If only my Father had chosen to give those cities faith!""

Likewise, all images of the fields being ""ripe for harvest."" Seems at least somewhat conditional on the cooperation of the workers -- and if not, why talk as though it is? Same thing for Ezekiel as the watchman:

Ezekiel 3:20-21 ~ ""...if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice...because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds that he has done shall not be remembered, but his blood I will require at your hand. But if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and you will have delivered your soul.""

People appear to face the consequences of unbelief regardless, but they are not *blamed* equally, since not all of them had farmers trying to rescue them.

Any thoughts?

(Again, keep in mind I'm not claiming this is doctrine -- simply that is neither Calvinism nor Arminianism.)"

I do enjoy all the events and little doohickeys they've added and wish they had them in Civ 3, like the random events with responses in Civ 4. But the only real way to expand is militarily. And that's more realistic in civ 3 you can effectively siege or defend a city, I always turn it into Stalingrad rush in defenders to outlast the attackers while working on cutting off the advancing army. Unlike in Civ 5 where you can only have 1 unit per square and it seems pointless. 

Oh? I have 5x as many soldiers as you have but because I can only have one per square and you're defending a valley means I cant get to your cities, shoot if only I could stack and attack your unit with multiple of mine at the same time.

Also I really enjoyed destroying infrastructure in civ 3. Bomb all the railroads leading into a city to prevent reinforcements and blitzkrieg it with artillery. I wish ICBMs still did this, destroy everything around the city kills units and pollutes everything? Awesome! 

What I hate about defending a city in Civ 5 is no matter how many soldiers you have in a city it can be taken just by reducing that little meter.

I mean I still enjoy Civ 5 and play it because my computer is too good for Civ 3, I wish I could still play it. Also it was my first civ game and I spent days playing it."

Now you might think I would have loved this party, but it was pure sadness. I had to watch her open up troll after troll after troll. But the worst was watching her open my gift, the bride troll with pink hair. For a short time that bride troll was in my possession, but it was never really *mine*.

KingQajar,worldnews,1389141514.0,"The Wahhabist movement. This movement, started in the early 19th century, is the main force behind radical Islam. They worship Muhammad as a god-king, commend those who suicide bomb and kill civillians, and hate other creeds. Essentially, in the name of Muhammad, they defy Muhammad's teachings.

Christianity has this same kind of movement, but it hasn't took off quite like Wahhabism has. Wahhabism is primarily advocated by Saudi Arabia, a massive gulf power. Also, right-wing populism is always prevalent in poverty-ridden lands, which is common in Afghanistan and Pakistan where this movement is popular.

Always, these kinds of people are going to be extremely violent. As such, they will get more attention.

In any case, the Wahhabists do not make up the majority of Muslims, and are looked upon by said majority as a backwards community. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."

I think the Packers had a pretty good excuse for underachieving, though, with Rodgers being out.  But that's no excuse for losing to San Fran when our defense only gave up 23 points.  Rodgers was right when he said that's a game we should have won.

I think the North will compete with the West for the best division in the NFC (or NFL) next year."

Esoteric_Indulgence,TwoXChromosomes,1389141738.0,"&gt;""I just couldn't find the energy and motivation to wake up and get to class/study/homework. Towards finals I was seriously considering not coming back next semester and just taking a semester or two off to just work and breathe, so I just ignored all the emails telling me to register for next semester.""

I just want to point out that this right here is not considered laziness, procrastination, or failure. You were at a point where you were considering taking a break from college, in which case registering for classes would not have been necessary. I actually think it's fantastic that you took the time that you did to consider this option, even if it squeezed you tight at the deadline here. It's the kind of decision that requires you to give time and thoughtful consideration so that you can make the best decision for your life. I considered dropping out of college multiple times throughout my 3 year experience. I never took that option, but it was something that I always gave time to think about as a very real and valid option.

All that being said, the deadline isn't here yet, so regardless of what an ill-mannered assistant may tell you, you do still have time. Hey, I knew people that registered even after deadlines had passed. It can create some more work for advisors or student service staff, but that's their job and it's not something you need to feel guilty about. This is what they're being paid to do. Chances are you're not the only one in this situation either, so don't beat yourself up about it. Once you get the hold taken care of, registering is going to take you like an hour, tops.

As far as this professor that you're anxious about, I have to say that I've never met a single college professor that wanted any of their students to fail. They've seen many freshman come in each year and they've seen freshman in your situation before. You don't have to be concerned with his/her opinion of you, but if it's a big deal, just be honest and say that you weren't sure last semester if college was right for you at this point in your life, but that you've decided to stick it out and schedule your classes for the upcoming semester. I don't think you need the approval of this person to validate you; this is your college experience and your path to travel. If someone takes issue with it, that's their problem and not yours. You just do what works for you."

I think it has to do with preconceived notions about people playing video games and not wanting to engage in any other hobbies or my fear that it will become an all-encompassing, borderline addiction. Another reason is that it really bothers me when people become so enthralled in electronic media that they enter a zombie-like state and have no concern for what's going on around them. I've seen this happen with video games way too many times. Maybe if gaming was done casually (2-3 times a week) I would be okay, but even then, it's iffy. Hardcore gaming would probably be deal breaker.

Don't ever have sex without a condom. It doesn't matter how ""in the moment"" you are, it is not worth risking getting pregnant or a potentially permanent communicable disease. 

If you're going to be with multiple people or your partner is, it is very commonplace and highly recommended to get tested every six months or before getting with a new partner. 

You can transmit an STI or STD from oral sex alone so don't think you're safe with/as a virgin. 

Not every STD or STI shows obvious symptoms. Chlamydia is the most widely spread STI among youth and you can go years without any sign of having it and cause permanent damage to your sex organs. That is why it's so important to get tested regularly even if you think you're fine.

God_Wills_It_,cowboys,1389141947.0,"The one bright spot among the Jason Garrett era has been better drafting.  His being patient and investing high draft picks in the lines is starting to show up.  (I'm assuming we go DL heavy in this upcoming draft).  The OL is looking like a real strength going forward and our 1st round LT &amp; C are the main reasons why.  Hopefully a couple young high draft picks on the other side of the ball will bring about a similar change.

I've always thought the biggest reach or most misused pick was Escobar.  I hope he develops into something more but I just don't see the point of investing that pick in another TE.  As long as Romo is the QB no other TE will replace Witten and Hanna is/was fine as a #2.

I've said a few times that Williams was the steal of our draft.  I have no idea how he was still around in the 3rd and the fact that we were able to pick him by moving back and still hitting our on 1st round pick was sweet.  

I agree with you on Wilcox.  Nothing close to the bust many are calling him.  He was a young developmental prospect anyway so we knew there would be some hiccups. Plus remember that during training camp [his mother died](http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4712448/j-j-wilcoxs-mother-passes-away).  So I can understand if there was a bit of a difficult transition.  I think next year he takes a big step forward.  

You've forgotten about Webb who I think has the biggest chance of not panning out.  But again...you don't draft a midround prospect out of a smaller school thinking he comes in and starts like a veteran from day 1.  You take him because you see athletic talent ([Webb had a 40.5 inch vertical leap which topped the performance chart at the combine. He was also the combines top performer in both the 20 &amp; 60 yard shuttle.  Broad jump too.](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2013/profiles/b.w.-webb?id=2539338)) and you want to coach him up in your system over the next 2-3 years.

So Wilcox, Webb, &amp; Holloman join Tyrone Crawford, Kyle Wilber, &amp; Matt Johnson in the ""young defensive prospects who hopefully can put it together"" category that makes up most of our defense.  

Now we add in a few more prospects, pick the right coordinator to coach these guys up, and then hope we stay healthy.  "

thro_way,changemyview,1389141953.0,"It isn't the act of negging itself that's the problem so much as it is teaching negging to men to whom it doesn't come naturally.  

Who would you rather date- a woman who has naturally flawless skin, aesthetic features, etc, or a naturally ugly woman who achieves the same look by caking herself in make-up every morning?

Similarly, women want men who *naturally* know to tease them, not men who have learned it through PUA articles online.  Teaching men ways to fake confidence only adds impostors which women have to work to filter out- it's obvious why women would be opposed to this.

val_hollaaaaa,rollerderby,1389142188.0,"Do NOT buy those. In this case, I believe the only thing that makes these skates ""derby skates"" is marketing. They look very poorly-made and likely won't withstand much wear and tear.

Generally speaking, skates made specifically for roller derby combine attributes of skates designed for hockey (agility) and speed skating (uh...speed). Some people play on hockey skates, others on speed skates, and some on derby-specific skates. All are acceptable and it's a matter of personal preference. 

She basically has two choices: invest a lot of money up front on gear she can use for a few seasons, or go cheap now but expect to upgrade soon. Either way, I would not recommend anyone start with a skate of lesser quality than the Riedell R3 or Dart, or SureGrip Rebels. $100 is a good starting price for first skates if bought new. I know very skilled, veteran skaters who choose to continue skating on those type of skates, but they only last about a season or two before they wear out and have to be replaced. 

If at all possible, she should try on other peoples' skates or even borrow them if that's an option. Don't forget about used skates. Many, MANY people decide to try out roller derby only to quit after their first injury or just lose interest, and then their gear ends up on eBay or craigslist, only lightly-worn. "

People have their preferences. Women cannot complain that men rejecting promiscuous women is unfair and then reject men for things even more shallow. 

Furthermore, the amount of men women sleep with tells you just about everything you need to know about a person. Much can be inferred by looking at their sexual history, like their likely morality, their likely opinion of men, their likely opinion of themself, their outlook on life, their sense of willpower (or lack of it), etc. 

A woman who's had 150 men within a few years is not the same type of person at all as the woman who's had 2 partners in all of her, say, 25 years of living. Anyone who claims sexual history means nothing or has no reflection on the indivual is sadly far out of their element."

JustinJamm,AcademicBiblical,1389142283.0,"Sorry it took me so long! Got caught up in holidays and such, and I wanted to have a clear head. =)

&gt;With that said lets throw ""air"" into the mix with Ephesians 2:2.

Common thought at the time was that spirits filled the air, like ghosts traveling around invisibly, tugging at people's consciences. Accordingly, Paul almost certainly *literally* meant the air.

&gt; &gt; Yes, and a vision is something you see. That's the very nature of a vision is. Jesus' other statements indicate that some among His followers and the High Priest will see this. ""You will see..."" / ""...will not taste death until they see..."" / etc.

&gt; Wrong, In Matthew 16 it was not see it was taste.

""Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will **not taste death** until they **see the Son of Man** coming in his kingdom.”

So no, not wrong. Jesus certainly didn't talk about them *tasting* the Son of Man in the clouds.

&gt;Is this really talking about vanishing? 1Cor 3:5-9

I see nothing at all in 1Cor 3:5-9 relevant to this topic.

If you want examples of what I was referring to, consider Matthew 24:37-41 ~ ""For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. *Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.* Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.""

It is this imagery many think of as being so rapture-like, so unexpected and instantaneous. Two people are side by side, and POP! One of them suddenly vanishes.

There's nothing ""pre-tribulation"" about this at all. It's just a future-coming-of-Christ doctrine.

&gt;I am saying that this already took place, when Christ was on the earth. One of the key verses to Revelation is in fact what the spirit of prophecy is all about.......... Jesus Christ.

So you're saying you believe the whole of Revelation already happened? ~.^ That sure seems an awfully big stretch.

I likewise still don't the connection you were drawing between the Revelation bowls and Paul's ""absent from the body = present with the Lord."" I frankly see no connection there. =\

Long story short, I never knew real pain. sure I was achey and sore while on the pill. But since stopping, what I have experienced is agony. It seems the pill was really helping to reduce or mask a lot of my pain.

My armpit tender points have taken the worst beating, as my breasts have changed size, shape and density they are more tender than ever and I can't lift my arms.

My abdominal pain is also worse for wear. I had terrible period pain before the pill, which the pill helped reduce slightly, But since stopping the pill I have had cramps every single day of my life, heavy ones, I feel like I'm giving birth!

The migraines are back with a vengeance, and there are a number of other minor issues like acne, which is no big deal but with an allodynia flare-up, acne becomes very painful.

Shit_The_Fuck_Yeah,AskHistorians,1389142366.0,"&gt;It should be noted that Franco wasn't a fascist and Spain was never a fascist country.

Well I think that's up for discussion.  

He clearly exhibited some fascist values, as well as Spain did under his rule, and he aligned himself with the other infamous fascists of his time (Moussolini, Hitler, Pinochet).  Even if he would not be considered text book definition of fascism, he could easily be classified as fascist when generally speaking about fascism and WWII era Europe. 

Of course every ""fascist"" country had their own nuanced version of it making it somewhat unique, so I think that this is an interesting discussion for any supposed fascist country... Except Italy which would serve as the benchmark.  You could argue that any famously fascist country lacked some element to make it truly fascist, but Spain was much more fascist than democratic.

He is a pretty good comboer but his speed is pretty average. You could also be a pioneer and help to expand Sonic's combo game. He hasn't been around that long, who knows what he's capable of?

As for how I chose my main, I don't think it'll help you much. I main Link because Zelda is my favorite series. He's been my main since SSB for that reason. It was pure coincidence that he turned out to be a perfect fit for my play style. I like Link's style because you can't play him well by simply learning tech. In fact, if you don't have the tech skill, you can still play well by simply fighting creatively. You always have to be thinking and you have to be super flexible and in Melee he was always at a huge disadvantage which made the fight even more interesting. If something doesn't go your way... well you're playing Link, things weren't going your way to begin with so think of a way to make it go your way. Every bad situation can become a good situation if you think creatively.

If I didn't main Link I would probably main Roy for similar reasons. He is super fun and used to require a lot of outside the box thinking before Project M but one of my big things is that I hate rigidity. I hate when someone can say ""This is how you play this character."" or ""You're not playing him right."" So Roy is perfect because he's always ranked low to mid tier which means no one can really tell me what to do. If I win I'm the best. THE BEST. And if I lose, well I'm playing Roy."

Most people here are pale and male and they luckily can live their lives without discrimination. Unfortunately for us ""others"", we don't have that privilege and you simply cannot empathize. 

I said I see no evidence that it is discrimination, because there is none.  There are other students of color and women going to that school, I absolutely guarantee it.

If there's a reason they are unwilling to do extra work to help you, it's probably because you come across as even more of a ""problem"" in person than you do on the internet.

Of course every ""fascist"" country had their own nuanced version of it making it somewhat unique, so I think that this is an interesting discussion for any supposed fascist country...

If you are using terms like ""big ole bear"", try [ DDP Yoga] ( http://www.ddpyoga.com/) or P90 X Yoga.  These programs are pretty good workouts especially if you have no prior Yoga experience and are more fitness oriented.

Omegaile,AskHistorians,1389142657.0,"First you have the [Lorenz curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Economics_Gini_coefficient2.svg). In the x-axis you have the people distributed in crescent order of income. In the y-axis you have the proportion of national income* accumulated (i.e. how much money people have up to that point). That means that if the 50% poorest people have 10% of the national income, then the point (0.5,0.1) is in the curve.

Realize that in a perfectly equal country, the Lorenz curve would be a straight line from (0,0) to (1,1). Below this straight line there is a triangle.

**The Gini index is the area between the Lorenz curve and this straight line divided by the area of the triangle.** In [this figure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Economics_Gini_coefficient2.svg) that is A/(A+B).

(*) I say income because it's what's usually measured, but you can do analogously with wealth, or anything else you want to measure the inequality of(friends in a social network for example, Gini index has applications in lots of areas).

Few things to realize:

 * The Gini index is a number between 0 and 1, but usually showed in percentages;

 * A Gini index of 0 would be a perfectly equal society;

 * 1 is theoretically unobtainable, but you get closer to 1 the more unequal society gets.

Some limitations:

 * Many people are pointing out, but I don't see as a limitation at all is that the Gini index measures only inequality, and not wealth or quality of life, or anything else. So a very poor society could also be a very equal society, and a very unequal society could be very good to live even as poor. The Gini index measures equality and nothing more.

 * The Lorenz curve is the curve of inequality. The Gini index try to capture the essence of the curve in a single number, but that sometimes can be tricky. It's like trying to get a feel of something by looking at it's average. The average is a good number, but it's not the whole picture. But I don't think this is generally a big problem though."

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1389142912.0,"I had a lot of teachers (and principals) like him. In a plot twist that I'm sure surprises absolutely fucking no one, the bullying was always worse in those classes.

The problem is, he's not *entirely* wrong. Weird kids need to learn to hide their squishy spots a bit better instead of letting it all hang out. But the problem is, no responsible adult or human being should tacitly endorse what amounts to intense social agony to ""correct"" weird kids.

Because that's the thing -- they're really not ""correctable"" in that way.  You grow up and you stop being weird all by yourself. It doesn't happen because people bully the shit out of you. It happens because you decide, little by little, you give less of a fuck about what other people think. That you're going to be happy in your own skin.

Problem is, you can't be happy in your own skin unless you have *some sort* of outside validation. It's literally fucking impossible. Human beings are social creatures. And if you're a kid, and you know that the task of adults is to protect you, and they deliberately *fail* to, you're going to internalize that as evidence of your own lack of worth. Not that the adult is a shitty teacher (and shitty person), but that you're not worth protecting (because I highly doubt that this teacher hates all his students... probably just the weird ones).

I grew out of being weird because I found a peer group even weirder than myself. Their friendship, and the tutelage of teachers who encouraged my bookishness because they were just as bookish themselves, improved my self-worth enough that I stopped giving a fuck about what people thought.

I went from literally being less cool than the disabled kids in middle school to being elected student body VP in high school. Not because I had teachers that were shitty, but because I had teachers that were amazing and didn't put up with bullying in their classrooms... *at all*.

So, OP is not wrong. But he's right for all the wrong reasons, and totally wrong about how bullying is the fault of the bullied. Fuck that noise."

Esoteric_Indulgence,TwoXChromosomes,1389142935.0,"I'm currently on Nexplanon after switching smoothly from combination pills. This was an option that I wanted because originally I was interested in sterilization, but because of my age (I'm 22) and because of the discussions I had with my gynecologist on the topic, I decided to go with an extremely effective long-term BC option instead. 

The insertion is quick and easy. Lidocaine was the numbing agent used with my insertion and that was the only part that was uncomfortable. I hesitate to say painful because I didn't think it was that bad. It's one prick for the needle and then a tingly sensation as it numbs the area (they call it a burning sensation, but it was more like when your foot falls asleep or something). Apparently the gynecologist that performed the insertion, who wasn't my normal doctor, was a pro because I didn't really bruise at all. There was a small yellow line of bruising along the rod and that's it. If you do bruise badly though, you can just treat it as you normally would treat a bruise (ice or whatever). 

I would consider the healing process to be more about soreness than anything else, but it's not like your arm is out of commission. My only concern was whether or not I would accidentally roll over my arm in my sleep (which didn't happen lol). 

My body does fairly well with birth control hormones. My side effects were primarily mental-related since I'm already predisposed to increased anxiety and moodiness (I have a mental disorder so nothing new for me). Since the insertion was scheduled to coincide with my placebo pill week, I did have a light period, but it didn't last long (which could just be because I was already on a hormone schedule to start with). I guess my only recommendation would be to tell your partner that moodiness is a potential side effect. That way they can prepare themselves for it and they can also keep an eye out for you and make sure any mental effects don't become too severe.

If you were to look up reviews online, you will see some bad reviews. Even if you read the full medical details enclosed with it, it will acknowledge the chances of having less desirable side effects. BUT, it should be noted that there's only a 10-20% chance of that happening. Most people are not outliers; for the average person, Nexplanon works out okay and the side effects are manageable."

chriswen,litecoinmining,1389143160.0,"I'm not sure why you have a high estimated payout.  Payout is based on pool payout structure.

Blocks finished, do you mean luck?  Because the chance of finding a block is just luck.  100% luck is if you find the block in the estimated amount of time.  It will be earlier if you get lucky.  But sometimes you're unlucky.  Overall your luck should gravitate towards 100%.

Or you might mean time before the block can be payed out.  Blocks can only be payed out after a certain amount of confirmations.  This is a security feature of the litecoin blockchain.  But its also implemented in Bitcoin.  It needs to be confirmed before they can have the litecoins available in your balance.  The confirmations needed is unlike transaction confirmations.  Also, it is just to make sure your block doesn't get orphaned.

Well, I don't think there are any other ramifications.  Still you are seriously underlooking how bad it is to keep restarting your miner every 10-15 minutes.  It's a bad idea and you're hurting  a lot of your hashing power.  And if its because your utility lowers,  I hope you realize now its normal and its just the VARDIFF from the pool.

Well sometimes you need to restart but you shouldn't be restarting every 10-15 minutes.

One commonality, though, is that almost all such couples I've encountered want a man with a large penis. In fact, I've never encountered a couple who weren't focused on that.

MaximilianKohler,humor,1389143663.0,"You know, from my experience with internet dating websites it's a self perpetuating problem.

As a male, when you first go on those websites and start being normally choosy and decent and you send some people you really like some nice messages and get no replies (because those girls are inundated with hundreds of messages), you lower the bar and send some more messages.

Well you keep lowering the bar and get increasingly frustrated and the quality of your messages decreases significantly. Some people resort to creating generic messages which they send to every decent looking girl they see, which perpetuates the problem even more.

At one point I realized that my messages had hit the point of quality as poor as ones you see on various subreddits where people complain and/or facepalm at such things. So I deleted my profile and gave up.

The point is that many if not most men probably sign up thinking that's ridiculous, I'd never do that; only to finally be brought to that point.

The core problem is that men outnumber women on those sites maybe 50:1 or more."

small_havoc,pics,1389143712.0,"This post might sound totally sugary, preachy and/or completely stupid. But it's been a long crappy day and I'm a lil high, so I went with the flow~

I wanted to give this to a guy I was so into last year (but I didn't - it was only linked to imgur and not the page) and this year we'll be celebrating our first anniversary together in our flat. Slightly less confused twentysomething, but of course, no one can predict the future. 

Anyway, what I'm saying is, if you have that person in your life then g 4 it. I was very close to not choosing the path I went just from being too down on myself and thinking there was no way he could feel the same to the same extent.


And if you don't have that person in your life - fuck it. Yes it's lovely to be with someone for certain perks, but you know what else is lovely? Not being with an asshole. Lots of people settle for what might be happiness, because they're worried that what they'd really like (for example; a partner who listens, shares chores, doesn't care when you want to play video games all weekend and stuff your face with discounted birthday cake) is beyond what they deserve - or even that it simply doesn't exist. I thought this for so long. By and large, the biggest source of stress my friend's approach me with is based around relationships and missed expectations. Relationship stress, even minor, can be so insular and self perpetuating that it can even affect work/study and social life. If you don't have that source of stress, at least you can focus on bettering your world so that if and when you do find someone who's worth the L word, you can feel rooted in yourself and will know and manage your expectations better - you'll have been with yourself and your own inner monologue longer, and your own voice will be the one which tells you what is right for you, or what you want to do. I flop from one long term relationship to the next, and as a result, it has taken me a lot longer to become aware of what ""I"" want, and not what ""I should want"" based on the endless chatter of people emotionally close enough to influence my thinking. 

So you want someone? Tell them. You have someone? Fuckin A. You don't have or want someone? Fine - you're not missing anything right now, you just have yet to experience something. There's no ""lack"" of someone. You're complete in yourself - and if you get lonely, I highly recommend having a cuddle buddy. My best friend is the best cuddler I know."
TofuRobber,Foodforthought,1389143714.0,"I agree. That's why I don't condemn MIT for their choice of action. It's easy to say that they could have done something but exactly what it is that they could have done is not certain. And even then there's no idea what the repercussions of those actions would have been. It's far too optimistic in thinking that one simple move would have completely changed this case around. It's really much more believable to consider that if MIT openly supported any side it would have really been much crazier than it already was. So when they said supporting Swartz might have negative impact on the case, they probably weren't just trying to shield themselves. I don't think outsiders are justified to pick sides because there just too much that we don't know about that was going on. All we can say it that it was a terrible thing that happened. Nobody is a villain in their own stories."

katharinekay,photography,1389143775.0,"I have an interesting perspective on this, and it's semi-related.

I interned for HuffPost weddings (and started this account to contact people with interesting wedding-related stories on Reddit -- check my history). I'm a photojournalist, but I didn't do any photography for them; I just wrote and created those slideshows (ugh). You bring up an interesting point about wedding blogs bring more business to the photographer, and with that, I agree. It's a huge benefit and practically free advertising for the photographers.


I cannot speak to their practices now, but when I interned there, we had accounts with Getty, AP, iStockPhoto, etc., and got nearly 100% of our photos from there. Every once in a while, a smaller, local newspaper somewhere in the world had photos that weren't in our database, but they were something we wanted to run. I would have to email the newspapers and ask about running their photos on our website. Now, you'd think a huge, corporate website like HP would also pay the small fee (usually around $25) to run a few photos of a unique wedding featured in a tiny, probably struggling-to-get-by paper since they paid for Getty, AP, and iStockPhotos by the thousands daily (for slideshows), but every single time, we did not purchase the photos if the paper asked for money. We didn't run them either, but it made me, as a photojournalist and photographer myself, feel really...gross to say ""No thanks, we're going to pass on featuring your photos because we'd rather not paid,"" and then I'd start to work on putting together a 50-image slideshow."

___

1. Bounce all instruments to a single track

1. Bounce all drums to a single track

1. Tracks with effects on them (not on a send track) need bounced to their own tracks (i.e. drum break, flanger instrument, etc.)

1. Bounce your send track effects separately (i.e. reverb, delay, etc.)

___

Now you should have all of your tracks bussed to audio (no more midi - although you should save the midi files just in case you need them later). You should have something like this: 

* Drum Track

* Instrument Track

* Drum Effects

* Instrument Effects

* Reverb Track

* Delay Track

___

Now that you have these audio files, you should be able to go in to your project file, copy them, and paste them in to the new file that you will be sending.

Once you have put all of your audio files in to your new file, you may add a readme file to explain anything that might seem out of place, errors, etc.

___

Now you compress your file, and choose a file-sharing service provider. Here is a short list of ones to choose from:

* https://www.dropbox.com/‎

* https://www.wetransfer.com/‎

* https://www.fileswap.com/‎

slockley,AskReddit,1389143884.0,"&gt; I hope you understand that there is no inherent reason why people should de-value their own opinions in favor of your own.

That's absolutely true.

&gt; If guys want to marry, then let them.

I understand this idea to a point.  If someone wants to lie to another person, should I let them?  Well, it's unenforceable to prevent all lies, but can't someone assert that it is wrong?  And in certain contexts, lying is a punishable crime, even if the liar feels perfectly justified in their error.  Is that bigotry against liars?

Furthermore, the contemporary debate on the ""legality"" of marriage is not about crime and punishment, but rather whether or not two arbitrary people can receive tax statuses, death benefits, and be called ""married.""  In other words, nobody's stopping anyone from getting married, except in a paperwork and benefits sense.

&gt; If it is truly an immoral act than any self-respecting gay person should be able to see it for themselves eventually and know the right choices to make in turn.

Couldn't that same argument be used to justify any activity?  Lying, music piracy, or shoplifting are immediate candidates.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389143980.0,"&gt;conclusion: stop blaming your height and work on improving other aspects of your life that will build confidence or make you feel more attractive. Get better fashion sense, work out a lot, start doing public speaking, i don't know. Anything. But continually posting on reddit about how awful it is to be short is not going to change anything. There are plenty of women out there who will accept you for your height (it's not like you're foreign or something), but you'll never find any if you spend all your time trying to soapbox reddit and get sympathy for not being able to pick up women in clubs.

Who are you talking to?  I'm certainly not the scarecrow you were just attacking. 

&gt;That would be pretty racist to say, but some people to have to overcome discrimination against their race which is a lot worse than girls just not liking you as much because you're short.

Heightism isn't about girls not liking you.

Monosentence,ShouldIbuythisgame,1389144368.0,"No worries, just thought I'd let you know just in case so you didn't feel pressured to get it **right now** or something.

Well, I had gamefly a couple of years ago and liked it. I had the two games out at a time plan, and I'd usually get one party game/game to let my little nephew play (Basically, those disney/movie games that are terrible and not worth buying, ever) and then one flavor of the month type deal like Call of Duty or some one-shot game to try out.

I think it's perfect for a few reasons. One- You don't have to leave your house to rent games, which rocks. 2- As long as you're quick enough to have something new/pre-ordered on your list, you can expect to get new releases asap. Three- It lets you try things without a commitment to purchasing the game for 60 bucks to find it has 10 hours of gameplay and 10 packs of DLC for an hour a piece.

Then again, it was only like 14.99 or something for 2 games back then. Not sure why its over 20 now...kind of disgusting inflation.

I've been considering getting it again, but with being tight on money I haven't stuck to finishing my registration yet.

It comes down to this...Can you afford 275.88 per year? Would that be best spent on owning games outright, or used for other expenses?

If you get one game out at a time, can you afford the cumulative amount that'd be? 

Ask yourself if it's worth the convenience and availability, for the price. Basically. Oh, and as far as availability of titles goes, I'm sure it hasn't changed much (At least, last I read people were saying this as well, which wasn't too long ago) in that only the hottest, newest games will be limited in supply due to high demand. The time it takes to get games...I'd ship one out, and it'd take 2-3 days to get to em, then 2-3 days for another to be sent to me. With two out at a time, you ought to be occupied quite well during that time."

thiscommentisdumb,AdviceAnimals,1389144490.0,"I'm going to preface this by saying that this is just my experience. If she's feeling you and you're feeling her, it just kinda *happens*. I know that's not super helpful, which is why I've outlined the steps below. Also, don't be drunk. Being drunk is bad. I know it's a social lubricant and you may feel more comfortable around her when you're drunk. But she knows you're drunk. It's not attractive.

Step 1: Break the ""touch barrier"". If she's into you, she's gonna take care of this part for you. In which case, you just need to be interesting for the remainder of the date. If she doesn't do it, touching the arm, shoulder, knee, even high fives are the way to go. If she recoils, ABORT. Seriously. If she doesn't want you touching her, DON'T TOUCH HER. That's stranger danger 101. If she's comfortable with you breaking the barrier, it's now time for...

Step 2: Escalation. OK, she's alright with you touching her. Great! But let's settle down there, hoss. It doesn't mean she's OK with sexy time. She finds you *slightly* more attractive than the random people she sees on the street everyday. BUT maybe she lets her hand linger on yours after that high five. Maybe she puts her hand on top of yours when you touched her arm or shoulder or whatever. These are good things. Keep it up! Maybe you're walking down the street and she's cold and you put your arm around her. Just don't be creepy. Maybe, *just maybe*, she doesn't mind...

Step 3: At the end of the night, open her car door for her, be a gentleman. Attempt to put your mouth onto her mouth. Not gonna lie, theres like a 75% chance this is gonna go south. But, nothing ventured, nothing gained. If you get the cheek, just say you had a lovely time and GTFO. It's awkward for everyone. Don't drag it out.

Here's the thing: If you're on a date with this person, something about you or your personality has made her willing to spend one on one time with you. So just be you. That's what convinced her to be comfortable with being alone with you. If she doesn't like you being you, she's not right for you. So don't worry about it. Have fun out there."

TheLastHayley,AskReddit,1389144621.0,"I'm pre-op, but not for much longer. Done pretty much the rest - more than enough to substantively answer the thread's question I'd think.

Before transitioning I was very much an outlier. I was an unusual character, and it led to me being a social pariah, and a frequent target of bullying. I was decidedly considered repulsive and finding love was extremely difficult - moreso because any males I loved I could not express to due to fear of homophobia. My only plus side was I felt somewhat respected for my skills in Computer Science. Especially from my superiors, the presumption was that when I gave my credentials, they were genuine and a sign of autodidactic imperative.

Now that I'm female, however, people are defaultly more kind to me. My eccentricities, which had me being perceived as repulsive by society as a male, instead seem to make me desirable - my ginger hair, for example, had me ostracised heavily as a male, but as a female this is apparently the epitome of envy and a trait people love. Following this, I've actually had people compliment me on my looks and ask me out. I have friends, and a social life. Likewise, previous homophobia is less prevalent - loving another woman as a woman is significantly socially easier than loving a man as a man it seems.

However, there have been downsides. Being a Computer Scientist, everyone around me is male, and I routinely get outgrouped by my peers. It also seems difficult to be taken seriously in my subject - people definitely seem to value my opinions on the subject less than before, and presume I'm outside of the intellectual paradigm within the subject, so-to-speak, so I find myself having to go extra yards just to be interpretted on the same level as I was before. It's also interesting that I appear to get objectified a fair bit too - whenever I put on makeup, people genuinely seem less dismissive of whatever I say than when I do not.

As an amusing aside, whereas before if I went into the women's toilets people would presume I'm a pervert and either scream or look horrified, if I now go into the men's toilets people presume I'm lost or just had sex with a male who picked me up or something, and people there wolf-whistle or laugh.

I would say on the whole I'm treated better being female. But this isn't saying much at all - I'm transsexual, so I was never treated properly as a male to begin with because I never fit in."

Actually, arguably more normal. Risking STDs or worse and engaging in extremely taxing behavior to get drunken inept sex from a stranger makes less sense -- if you're aiming at both quantity and quality of sex -- than having a monogamous relationship where you hang out and fuck all the time.

Nobody has so much ""game"" that they can have as much good sex as a monogamous couple. Unless they're a prostitute or they devote every waking hour to trying to get laid. And that shit isn't normal. Not by a long shot. Monogamy is."

Intel/AMD/EVGA/ect.. aren't going to pay because you promised consumers who cant build their own computers that they can overclock their components so that means razer has to cover the warranty which they will remove after a year and they get thousands of return fried parts. Overclocking isn't easy shit some one who can't build their own computer can do, it takes precise math and constant testing or you'll break your machine. I also don't understand how they plan on automating the motheboards bios, half the time I add a new drive to my MOBO I have to go inside and change the boot priority back to my main drive. How do they plan do achieve that when you can swap out every drive and change them slots/add new ones constantly.

jaynay1,nba,1389144837.0,"Not really.

This year's Wall has the same number of win shares as last year's Rondo, despite having played 270 fewer minutes so far.

Wall is a better scorer, both by efficiency and volume by a margin approximately equal to the gap in their AST%'s.

Rondo's defense, having been perenially overrated, is worse than Wall's by xRAMP but not by DWS so lets call that a wash.  

But the reason why I consider Wall better is that he's doing all this on a much higher usage rate.

I covered this in another post somewhere, but it's generally accepted that Usage rate and WS/48(And, by extension, efficiency) are inversely related.  This generally tends to be true, and as Damian Lillard's usage rate has gone down this year, his efficiency has gone way, way up.

So Wall, having maintained better efficiency than average night Rondo, if only marginally, is a better player for having done so on a much bigger usage rate.

And heck, Rondo can only have that low usage rate because of who he was surrounded by, so there's a chance that in the next couple of years we see that Rondo really is that good, but right now, no, the numbers support Wall over Rondo."

As for the implied ""why...""  I'm not 100% sure why, but they make me feel safe.  Like, here's this strong guy, with these big strong hands, and yet those hands are so gentle with me.  It's not a case of ""ooh he's so dangerous"" so much as the show of gentleness through strength.  This probably comes from my slightly submissive tendencies.  I like being smaller than a guy, and I like him having the ability to dominate me if we both want.  The fact that they can fill me up better than my fingers doesn't hurt.

And it probably *does* have to do with my dad, too.  I was really emotional as a kid - I'd cry at the drop of a hat, or throw a tantrum over something small, and he'd always be there to calm me down.  

I don't know why other women like big hands, but that's my take anyway."

Can't chew hard foods, can't go a day without pain shooting from my jaw. No painkillers to numb it, not enough income to get the problem teeth fixed. Pain leads to annoyance, which causes me to basically piss off everybody who I don't really care for. Though I've got my close net of friends who I make sure I make laugh at least twice a day, but I'm alone otherwise. Loneliness, leads to depression, which is obvious just a big vicious circle-fuck on your mind. I may not be as depressed as I was a few weeks ago(Another New Years alone while everybody else wasn't), but I still don't feel happy.

by_a_pyre_light,technology,1389145345.0,"&gt; There's a great deal of home team pride in the USA which has given Microsoft the advantage to. 

Maybe in some things, but definitely not in others. Cars, for instance. Many people will swear on American pickup trucks like For F-150s and Chevy's, but will pick Toyotas and Hondas every time over Ford and Chevy sedans.
Don't even get me started in the luxury segment, where both Japanese and German luxury vehicles grossly outsell their American counterparts from Cadillac and other brands.

In videogames, I can assure you, there is no such thing as ""home team loyalty"" in America. We can see this with total systems sold from every generation, and the fact that the Xbox was absolutely squashed by the Playstation 2. No, the reason why the Xbox 360 dominated the last generation for so long was it simply offered a better package, with better graphics, at a lower price. This is the same reason the PS4 is outselling the Xbox One right now. It's not a mystery. 

&gt; it's naive to think of Japan as anymore xenophobic as the USA. 

[This is flat out incorrect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_issues_in_Japan#Ethnic_issues), making you the naive one for not understanding history and culture. There are many [anecdotes](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/05/26/national/xenophobia-stretches-from-the-street-to-the-dinner-table/#.UsypJ7QexM0) and [studies](http://economicstudents.com/2013/03/japans-economic-woes-and-xenophobia/) conducted on Asian cultures that show that they are generally much more secluded and [less accepting of outsiders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_ethnic_nationalism) than Western nations. 

Now, every culture has in-built resistance to outside cultures influencing them. Pointing out that there is xenophobia within the US, while true, does not negate Japan's xenophobia, nor somehow make their levels ""equal"". It's simply a fact that Asian cultures are more reserved than Western cultures, and part of that net effect is that [domestic brands](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-s-korea-the-republic-of-samsung/2012/12/09/71215420-3de1-11e2-bca3-aadc9b7e29c5_story.html) do [significantly better](http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/02/editorial-htcs-departure-from-south-korea-proves-a-tough-fight/) in their home countries than do foreign brands. 

From an Engadget article on the issue: 

&gt; ""When I asked why South Koreans aren't so hot on foreign phones, the boyfriend, holding a Galaxy Note, simply said** ""Samsung is Korea.""** And while ""LG is always number two,"" the couple are **strong supporters of their national brands**, and it appears **the same goes with the majority of their country. Such nationalistic pride is no surprise** -- there was a time when tens of thousands of South Koreans queued up to donate their jewelry and medals, in order to help bail their country out of the economic crisis in 1998. You don't get this large-scale selfless patriotism anywhere else these days.""

&gt; ""Motorola is ""dying"" in South Korea, whereas Sony isn't as popular purely because it's from Japan.""

Please, tell me again how Asian cultures aren't much more nationalistic in their consumerism and xenophobic in general than their Western counterparts. "

This just isn't true. It affects how shorter people are perceived. It has an effect on interpersonal interactions generally. And it affects how shorter people perceive themselves (self-esteem), which also has huge effects on social and financial outcomes. In fact, heightism affects short people in the same ways as other types of prejudice affects people. 

Now, you can argue magnitude, but you can't really argue mechanics. In fact, heightism may be uniquely corrosive in that it's never challenged and even encouraged. "

Honorable mention:  I moved the puck to the point and slid in front of the goalie to screen.  The D-man took an arcing shot that I ducked.  I'm not sure if the puck tipped off my helmet or not, but the shooter thinks it did.  I spun around after it passed me to pick up the rebound.

marco262,Pathfinder_RPG,1389145681.0,"&gt; It is bad because you have so many less options and combat is boring.

I'd like to point out that this is a completely subjective point. If you're the kind of person who only enjoys combat that's played strictly by-the-rules, and prefers throwing numbers against numbers for combat, then yes. D&amp;D 5e is more boring.

However, from what I've seen of the playtest documents, it seems like 5e is designed to support a more abstract mode of combat than 3.5. They've stepped back from the simulationist tendencies that previous editions have had, and are focusing more on abstracting the rules for simplicity and getting out of the GM's way.

So, if you're looking for something particular out of your game, below is what I'd recommend:

* Simulationist, or number-crunchy with lots of splat support ---&gt; 3.5/Pathfinder
* MMO-like, with healers and tanks and DPS ---&gt; 4e
* More abstract, more open to loose GMing style ---&gt; 5e/Next

Edit: I feel like I didn't get my main point across. D&amp;D Next's combat is boring only if you don't enjoy using creative battle tactics. You don't have a bunch of different feats or rules to use when making a swing to spice things up. Instead, you have the freedom to define your attack purely in your own imagination, more than ever.

Dinaroozie,FeMRADebates,1389145773.0,"I'm not sure either, but it's worth noting that it's clearly not just the literal meaning of the word that determines how 'severe' it is as a swear word. For instance, it's more severe (in my part of the world, at least) to call someone a cock than it is to call someone a dick. 'Cunt' is considered more offensive than 'pussy'. There is no shortage of similar examples for words that aren't related to genitalia, too - saying 'fuck you' is generally considered a more severe thing to say to someone than is 'screw you'.

Given all that, it seems that severity of a swear word can be divorced, at least to some extent, from the real-word concept it comes from. I don't know why 'fuck' is more severe than 'screw', but I suspect a linguist might be able to answer that. Likewise, it seems that if 'dick' is a mild insult and 'pussy' is a severe one, it's not necessarily for gender reasons as much as some other linguistic reason. To tease out a gender-based explanation for differences in severity of genital-oriented swear words, I feel like we'd have to compare every swear word based on male anatomy and every swear word based on female anatomy, rather than a single pair (like dick/pussy)."

JustinJamm,Reformed,1389145895.0,"&gt;Thank you for taking the time to thoughtfully reply. I enjoyed the perspective.

Yay! =) This is fun.

&gt;sovereignty

The word ""sovereignty"" designates kingship. How ironic that we object to the use of the image of a King because the image is insufficient, yet we continue to use the word Sovereignty anyway. Our primary word used to describes God's ""active control of all things"" uses the image of a king who commands all subjects and can UnMake any who oppose him -- rather than, say, the image of a farmer tilling the dirt exactly how he wants it, dirt which has no say in how it responds to the farmer.

&gt; He chooses not to use that power for salvation. That is an Arminian perspective.

Actually, Arminianism would say God allows an individual to *individually resist the Holy Spirit*. So it is not Arminianism.

In my allegory it is not up to the child whether they are saved, (Arminianism) and neither to the king (Calvinism) but up to the farmer.

If we look at a dozen ways to deviate from TULIP, not all of the deviations suddenly result in Arminianism. It seems you have a Calvinism-based analysis of all things, as though the *definition* of Arminianism is ""different in some way from Calvinism."" That's just a bogus, oversimplified definition of Arminianism.

If Calvinism says ""God picks who will believe"" and Arminianism says ""Each individual fully chooses for themselves whether to believe,"" these both say a *single factor* determines belief. Arguing for a *third factor* or arguing for *multiple factors* are each distinct from Calvinism or Arminianism.

As another example, Universalism is totally different from both as well, because in Universalism, *all people* are eventually saved (which grossly violates Calvinism's TULIP) but people don't/can't resist God forever into irrevocable apostasy irrecoverability (which violates Arminianism).

---

I wonder if you think Arminianism just means ""heretical rejection of God's sovereignty."" =) Is that possible? Because open theism also does that, but open theism is not Arminiasm either."

This doesn't mean you shouldn't strive for a larger audience; it means you should be so focused on your artwork that you don't even notice the audience. Zone in to it.

There's nothing wrong with putting up some pictures or videos to promote yourself, but when you're spending more time promoting than you are producing, that's not going to yield the best results - in-fact, it might even hinder you.

Fluttertwi,baseball,1389145902.0,"I guess I'm the only person who doesn't think this is so awful. Do I disagree with Ken Gurnick? Absolutely, 100%. But I DO think his opinion has a place in the game. His opinion, as silly as you or I may think it is, does not make him an idiot. 

Edit: I don't mind getting downvoted, but would you please leave a comment so we could discuss it?

Edit 2: Well, since it's been 5 hours I suppose I'll just elaborate. 

The only value that things like ""first ballot"" hall of famer or ""unanimous"" hall of famer have is what we assign to it; practically, a hall of famer is a hall of famer is a hall of famer. The difference between them is their legacy. Ken Gurnick's hall of game vote will not change Greg Maddux's legacy at all. We won't say ""Maddux was great, but that one voter didn't vote for him so I guess he wasn't THAT good."" Maddux is also going to make the hall of fame, and Gurnick can't stop that. So as far as I'm concerned, there is no effect of Gurnick's vote that matters much. 

However, I DO think that Gurnick's vote has some value. Hear me out here. There are lots of people who think the way that Gurnick does. Lots of people think that nobody from the so-called ""steroid era"" should be in the hall of fame. Do I agree with them? Hell no. I think it's silly, and frankly, kind of stupid. That said, they DO exist, and pretending they don't won't change it. Those people have just as much right to be heard as you or I do. They shouldn't be allowed to keep players out of the hall that deserve to be there, but they should be heard. Now they have. "

Cathy Brennan seems to be describing how gender roles are super fucked up and viciously imposed and policed -- which is something that tons of trans people fucking agree with--and I agree with. It doesn't make a woman a man because she wants to be considered competent and tough. Jesus fucking Christ. Do I really have to say this?  But per the patriarchal gender roles, Cathy ""felt"" like a ""boy"" because the gender role for girls was misogynist and based on 'weakness'. 

Jesus Christ. I'm not a trans man because I am a ""tough, competent female"" -- I am not tough, and rarely very competent. I am a man because that's my identity. 

This argumentation is not at all feminist and it's FUCKING TRANSPHOBIC TOO. And honestly, as a much lesser complaint I hate it because it makes the oft-described ""border wars"" between women and gender nonconformists/butches and trans men seem like *trans men* want to claim people as men who aren't men.  It's not like we are 'recruiting people for a bigger team' or trying to be like ""GOTCHA YR A MAN LOL"". I am for gender freedom for everyone. That includes cis folks. fucking god.

A woman can hate the gender role of 'woman' and still be a woman. While it's true that women who judged 'unwomanly' are often called men, it does not make a feminist, trans positive argument to claim those women as men.

I always feel frustrated when I'm doing any type of manual labor and men constantly ask me if I need help and can't take ""No"" for an answer.  It's both unfair to women to just decide that we are incapable of using our muscles and unfair to men to just decide that they must do all the heavy lifting.  Similarly, I've always loved building things and putting things together, so whenever a bookcase needs to be built or whatever, I do it and people ask why my husband doesn't do it--as if he's less of a man because *I* did it and I find myself trying to convince them it's just because I *like* doing it.  And that's ridiculous.  I didn't grow up with parents who allowed me any more emotional space than my brothers, so that's one thing I can't relate to, but I do recognize that in most cases men aren't allowed to express emotions the way women are.  Again, it's terrible for both as it forces men to hold in emotions that they should be ""allowed"" to get out and it causes people to perceive women as being more emotional.  Near all if not all of our current gender norms are harmful to both sexes (though one more than the other in various cases).  I remember, as a kid, thinking that I needed to ""change into"" a boy because that's what I really was.  I would try to act more like my dad, hoping that I might just magically transform.  And it was because society told me that being the way I was meant I wasn't a real girl.  What makes me sad is that people are already doing this to my ten-month-old son; when he wore a pink sleeper several people asked why we would do that to him.  They're already teaching him about the limits to what he can like as a male.  At least, for him, he has two parents who couldn't care less what he likes or what he identifies as, as long as he's happy.

It's sad that the feminist movement hasn't been as welcoming to transgender people in the past, though the same problem happened (and continues to happen) with women of color.  I have noticed that it's becoming more open to the trans* experience, and I hope that as more trans* people are able to feel comfortable and accepted in society, they will feel more comfortable voicing their own experiences within the feminist movement.

Here's the thing - what do you like? Now is the time (when education is free or cheap) to explore things that you like, that you enjoy doing.

If you can, work that into your plans for employment. 
If you can't, understand you'll have a hobby that brings you great enjoyment.

Also, if you have Senioritis I absolutely understand. 

I don't know or hang out with anyone who said that High School was the best. All of my friends were significantly happier when they hit college and met other smart kids who had similar experiences. 

Being Valedictorian is a smart financial move, because it will open doors to scholarships. 

Consider - is what you want to be going to take all A's in college? Are you sure and certain someone is going to care about your GPA once you graduate college? If just pulling Bs is enough, aim lower. 

Meet people, do things, learn outside the classroom. Take a pottery class, or an archery class, or learn to ride horseback. 

Do what most of us have to do - pretend to be confident. Hide your fear. Try stuff, see what happens, and learn it's okay to fail. 

That last paragraph is also excellent dating advice. 

Do things that YOU want to do. That excite YOU.

We only have one life on this little rock, and it would be a damn shame to waste it doing things that others think we should.

IndieLady,videos,1389146235.0,"Because sex is absolutely nothing like going to a gig with mates or helping someone move house or performing publicly. And I'm shocked you think that these are acceptable analogies.

Sex is intimate. Sex for many people is very private. Sex is being vulnerable and, for many people, literally opening yourself up and letting yourself inside them. This is why most (but not all) people only have sex with people they care deeply for or have an emotional, committed relationship with. Sex, ore often than not, involves a certain level of trust and good communication.

The stakes are higher in many ways: when it's good, it's great. When it goes wrong, it can go horribly wrong. Sex also means you are opening yourself up to certain risks (with your health, your safety, your social standing). Sex is, in fact, *so* different to the examples that you gave that there are laws about who can do it with whom and when and where. There are also extensive social and moral codes surrounding it. Sex is *very* different to helping people move house.

When all partners demonstrate mutual, enthusiastic consent, most of these issues become irrelevant. 

When it becomes far more complicated is when there isn't mutual, enthusiastic agreement. When all partners don't *enthusiastically* agree, you open up a can of worms, a whole bunch of blurred lines if you will.

Not all people are the same and not all sexual relationships are the same. Perhaps a couple has been married for 20 years and they are intimately equated with each other's moods and microexpressions. Perhaps a couple features a sexually experienced person and a sexually inexperienced person. What if they are strangers and don't know each other at all? Perhaps one or both parties is inebriated and not demonstrating as much logic, empathy or comprehension as they usually do.

When does ""convincing"" someone just become pressure or coercion? What level of consent would you accept after ""convincing"" someone: a lack of a no, a yes, or an enthusiastic yes? Why do you not accept their lack of enthusiastic consent in the first place? What if you have mis-read the signals and they are not interested at all and don't want convincing? Why exactly did they need convincing? What if they ""give in"" to appease you, but actually don't ""want it""? What if the person who needs ""convincing"" is sexually experienced, naive, lacking in confidence? Are you comfortable that you are not pushing them to do something that they may not be comfortable with? Why do you think they aren't being sexually assertive, yet you think they ""want it""? Are you being objective or are your hormones surging, convincing yourself that they ""want it""?

And I should add here that there is a difference between asking someone and ""convincing"" someone. Asking a partner ""do you want it / would you like to do x / can I do x"" and then accepting their answer, is different to ""convincing"" someone. Convincing someone means you don't accept their answer, and chose to persuade them to do what you want them to do. I would rather they talk to me about their concerns and I respond, without an agenda.

If you are talking about someone calmly and rationally convincing someone who does ""want it"", but for unclear reasons isn't being sexually assertive, then of course in that scenario that's fine. But my point is, how do you know that? There are numerous instances in my life where my partners were confident I ""wanted it"" and I most certainly didn't. 

And again, I refer to my earlier point, I don't really want to have to ""convince"" people to sleep with me. I want people to want me, to desire me, to be assertive with what they want. That's awesome, healthy sex. I don't want to talk people into sleeping with me, it's sad and desperate.

I would add that, if I asked friends to come to a gig with me and they said no, I'd probably respect their decision and leave it at that. I wouldn't feel the need to talk them into it. Because I respect my friends and don't feel the need to assert my wants and desires onto them. If you find that you're having to convince your friends to spend time with you, or help you, perhaps you need new friends. Or perhaps you need to think about why people aren't enthusiastic about spending time with you, or sleeping with you."

I'm queer and was raped for a couple years by a boyfriend of my choosing (17yro) and I knew I liked girls beforehand (15yro). The rape didn't change my sexuality. It did change my approach and reactions to sex, but not *who* (boys, girls, trans) I wanted to have sex with. 

I found this article at lez/queer site AutoStraddle super helpful and validating: http://www.autostraddle.com/on-being-a-queer-survivor-144496/

To a lot of people being raped by your SO is some kind of fiction. Like stranger rape is the only real rape rape. When in reality there are more of us who have been raped by our so called friends &amp; lovers. So these sheltered friends of ours don't want partner rape to be real so we must just have buyers remorse or some other bullshit minimizing rationalizing excuse that let's the rapist off the hook. When I'm around these people I tend to share graphic tidbits with them with a dual purpose. If they're stuck in their thinking and don't want me to share they learn to STFU or hear more gruesome details, or if they truly don't understand shocking them with the brutality of partner rape can clue them into reality.

beanfiddler,AskReddit,1389146379.0,"I wonder how much of this translates into adulthood and how willing men and women are to offer their advice and expertise on matters. I know that I often have to work myself up to offering my expertise on things that I know back-to-front. It's taken me six years at the same company to achieve the sort of comfort when I can freely speak my mind. And I'm in a management position. Obviously, I'm a woman.

Yet, one of the biggest problems we have with new hires is that they're too mouthy. This is hardly ever a problem with female hires, just male hires. They correct their managers (our management staff is nearly 70% female, it's an industry thing), overturn company policy, and mouth off to customers instead of calling a manager.

It's so bad that any guy that lasts a year is almost guaranteed at least assistant manager. It's like a form of reverse affirmative action, because we end up firing something like 50-75% of the men we hire almost immediately (i.e. before they're eligible for unemployment).

We've had to fire women for being alcoholics, for being over-emotional wrecks, and not being committed or just plain lazy. We fire men for those reasons too. But for being mouthy, insubordinate, and rude to the customers? Only ever men.

So I wonder how much of it is that there's some guys out there that think that everything they think and say is gold, precisely because people praise them a lot. And then there's women like me, who turned down a management position before finally taking it a year later, because I'm underestimating my own expertise."

The most important thing is just to want it bad enough. Acknowledge that it's going to be really difficult, but insist to yourself that you're going to do it anyway.

&gt;We've talked about ATI's physics, and we were quite surprised when Godfrey Cheng, AMD's Director of technical marketing at Graphic product group confirmed that Nvidia never really offered PhysX to ATI.

&gt;Despite the fact that Nvidia said many times that it wants to give PhysX to all that want it, they never contacted ATI through proper channels. Nvidia did voice out, at least to our journalists, that if you want to embrace PhysX you need to adopt Cuda. Cuda is not an open standard and AMD / ATI are really not big fans of such proprietary standards.

The problem is that PhysX has been changed to fit Nvidia's architecture. Even if AMD adopted it, it would never run as good on Nvidia. Accepting Nvidia's ""offer"" would just legitimise PhysX as a standard making it even less competitive since Nvidia would always run PhysX better than AMD."

I was lucky enough to test one of them during gamescom last year, and I was blown away! The game I tested was Hawken (mech-game), and I've never been a fan of that genre until trying it with the rift. You almost forget that you are in a game, and it all seems like reality. When I flew the mech up in the air, and started falling down while looking down, I felt the same feeling that you get while falling down incredible heights during dreams. The rift will be a game changer for the PC-FPS market.

Other than that, my dating life is a mess.

QuizB,WritingPrompts,1389147294.0,"John filled up his mug from the percolator in the hallway.

He sipped his fourth coffee that morning.  He had moved onto strong blacks to help with the headache of staying up all night.  

“*Bloody yanks.*” He thought.

He sipped the coffee again, staring into the blackish liquid before giggling internally.  The Ambassador from the U.S. still thinks we all drink tea, all the time.  

He sipped from the mug again.

“*Bloody yanks*.”

He stumbled back into the marathon meeting being held in the EU.  It was reaching its eighteenth hour, but nobody in memory could remember a meeting that was as exciting, terrifying and wondrous as the one he was currently in.

At the podium normally reserved for heads of state stood a being with far too many appendages, far too many eyes and far too many opinions on the occupation of the United States of America.

John walked in while there was a lull in the talking.  The explosive arguments had died within the first four hours, the philosophical ramblings a few after that and now people were just mopping up and getting prepared for the mess that was happening.  

“*Immigrants…no*” thought John, “*refugees, industry issues, trade deals…everything will have to be fixed*.”
John sat down as the Chair, the Ambassador from Germany, addressed him.

“Does the Honorable member representing the United Kingdom have anything he wishes to add to this conversation?” 

John looked at the being behind the podium. Later, he would argue with himself that it was the coffee or the lack of sleep or some other thing that caused his words, rather than own up to the truth – that John, in some weird way, was *jealous* that the aliens had chosen the United States to invade.

“Why the U.S.? Why not Europe? Why invade over there?”

The being shifted uncomfortably behind the podium. “Du yuu memory our rular?”

The various delegations had quickly caught on to the odd way the aliens spoke English.  By this stage of the talks, they could decode the fractured English quite well. They had managed to set up a translator about three hours ago that had sped everything up to an acceptable level when the language got too complex.

“Well, yes…he’s” John was interrupted by the German representative coughing politely. “Sorry,” John continued, “‘They’, being the will of the people manifested in one singular body, are what we would call here on Earth… mentally unbalanced.”

The alien attempted to nod in an effort to mimic human behaviour. “Yeeeees.  Seeence ssso marny opionions arr en one body, they arr insssene.”  The alien flailed it’s appendages like a human waving hands in a physical effort to conjure words out of thin air, before it turned to the computer translator. It quickly tapped away at the alien keyboard it had personally integrated into the computer.

The computer beeped once before a robotic voice haltingly cackled through the speakers.

“I share with you this knowledge as we have come to understand each other and perhaps you can help my race. Know this. The Great Ruler is not insane, simply that the Great Ruler literally has the opinions of the entire race running through their head at once. The *entire* race.  When we looked at a map of Earth, the decision was made to invade the United States because…it was yellow.”

The ambassadors quietly looked at each other. John spoke first. “Yellow? Like, the colour of the country on a map? You’re using a British based map? You realise it isn't actually yellow, right?”

Furious tapping.  Robotic voice.

“The populous hate the colour Pink, which your country and all the countries in your Commonwealth are.  We ignored Europe as the yellow countries were too small.  We invaded the United States because it was yellow.  The majority of the populace like yellow.  We now realise the country itself is not yellow. The military knew the country was not yellow, but the populace over ruled us. We do not like the populace. They are what the British call…personal sexual appendage heads.”

There was stunned silence around the room, as the alien continued tapping.

“The military will continue to spread the lie that the country is yellow in an effort to lure the populace there.  Once there, we will over rule the populace and place them and the Great Leader on that land and strip them of all technology.  We will rule our race and go forth to the stars and they will be locked away on the land.  Your United States will be a prison.  We must lock them all away for the sake of our race.”

After minutes of silence, John quietly stood up.

“As the official representative of the United Kingdom, I wish to propose a mutually beneficial agreement with your race regarding this.”

The entire room looked at him. John glanced around the room as a smile broke out on his tired face. But this moment was the chance for good old Britannia to flex its ancient claws one last time. He sipped his coffee.

“Can we rule them?” The Ambassadors looked horrified, except for the Chair, who politely coughed.

“FINE!” John shouted at her.  
“Can we rule them again?”

As the alien nodded, John thought to himself “*That’ll show them.  Bloody Yanks*.”"

einafets,AskReddit,1389147301.0,"&gt;I was brought up to think, not emote. I feel girls are quite the opposite when growing up. 


For preface, I'm female and identify as such. This point here drove me bonkers growing up. I am not an emotional lady and I never have been. I'm a massive thinker and a listener and I don't talk much at all. Growing up and having my thoughts invalidated due to being a female has played a massive role (I think) in why I don't talk much. I never got asked 'why do you think that is?' to anything I commented on. 

While I think a lot, I was never taught to express those thoughts. Every time I burst out crying I'd get more attention. I'm glad I grew up to be a rational thinker and didn't use my emotions as a fall back to express myself. Now that I'm older I can explain my emotions very well, which I guess is a good part about being female and being able to be emotive (not saying men are not allowed, obviously they are, but it's more socially acceptable for females). So while I'm not a good talker with conveying my thoughts and ideas, I'm great at conveying what's bothering me and how I'm going to fix it.

Pros and cons to each gender, but I hope society moves a bit more forward by the time I'm potentially having kids myself."

Hey, there's kind of psychological trick you can use here.  
When people look at each other, they see from the height of their eyes but they percieve the height of the top of the other person's head.  This means that most of the time you get several inches worth of apparent bonus height.  
If you're the same height as someone then they'll probably see you as being a little taller than them.  If you're a little shorter, they'll see you as the same height.  The trick is to walk with the confidence of a taller man.  Angle your head up a little so that your eyes seem to be looking down just a bit.  
If you move as though you own the space around you and stand as if you're the tallest in the room, people will form a mental image of you as a big guy even if you're really quite small.  "

Once this occurs the person will likely stop talking down to you, start treating you like a person, and a genuine conversation can occur. You wouldn't do it if the person you're speaking to already thinks they're on the same or lower value level as you,

There's not going to be any single way to get yourself sounding really good - all you can do is practice. Yeah, you could read every book/article and watch every tutorial in the world, but nothing will make you better except sitting at your DAW and working.

Remember that the only limits are the ones you place upon yourself. You can do anything you want, but you have to know how to do it first. That is why you practice. You play with every little thing you can. Throw those effects on! Turn those knobs - see what they do! Open up your modulation track and just start drawing everywhere!

Seriously. There is no set method; just fuck with everything. You'll learn what it all does in good time. Once you get your head around it, it really doesn't seem like all that much stuff you just learned!

And don't forget the online communities! This is an ***awesome*** place to get started - I wish I had known about Reddit (and /r/edmproduction) when I had started!

by_a_pyre_light,technology,1389147557.0,"&gt; HAHA 360... BETTER GRAPHICS.

Look, I'm tired of wasting *my* time doing *your* research. There are numerous articles about how multiplatform games ran significantly better and looked better on the Xbox 360 than the PS3. Educate yourself. As for either of them, I am PC Master Race, so neither of them concerns me, but the point stands.

&gt; I'd just like to say the United States is hardly less xenophobic.

Good for you ""liking to say"" that, but I've already proven you wrong and ignorant, so your conjecture is wrong and ignored. 

&gt; that German and Japanese cars are much better

Yes, that's a possibility. I know for a fact it's not the truth in [some types](http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0907_bmw_m5_cadillac_ctsv_comparison/) of [cars](http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2013/11/8/Cadillac-CTS-Vsport-vs-Lexus-GS-F-Sport-7717035/), but overall it may be true. That's actually proving my point above, which is *further disproving* your point, genius. If Americans were all sorts of nationalist consumers like you conjectured, they'd be buying the American cars more, over the ""superior"" (your conjecture, but we'll use it here) Japanese and German cars, the same way the Koreans exclusively buy Korean products and dump American and Japanese products, or the way Japanese gamers exclusively buy Japanese consoles and games. But, since they don't, your conjecture that 'Muricans are somehow nationalistically motivated shoppers is clearly wrong.

&gt; Meanwhile the PS3 saw dominance in Europe... a country with ties to neither Microsoft or Sony so how do you explain that?

Uhhh, that was ***my*** point, dumb-dumb, and it clearly disproves your attempts. Clearly neither the US nor Europe are motivated by which country the console was manufactured in, whereas Japanese gamers are. "

privatedonut,AskReddit,1389147593.0,"It makes sense, diamonds are close to the toughest material we know, i think this is what most people forget when paying for diamonds.  Yeah they aren't as rare as they used to be, but what you are paying for it the craftsmanship of the cutter to do the job right, and give you a product that can last for many, many years.  Remember how everyone talks about their grandmother's engagement ring?  That diamond ring that made it through world war I?  There's a reason it wasn't sapphire, those rings don't last as long, at least not keeping the cut and shine that a diamond would keep up with.

As far as I know, not to say you couldn't with proper care perhaps, I'm nowhere close to a diamond expert, but it is true they are much harder to damage."

Watertor,oblivion,1389147603.0,"Because they're not hand crafted. Some places, yes. In Oblivion though, the majority isn't.

Mods do make up for that, but that isn't very fair. It's like saying ""I like Lime flavoring, however only when it's slightly added to coke/alcohol"" you're not really talking about the subject at hand, you're talking about what you've stacked onto it.

If that's ok with you, then sure that's fine, but when someone asks a question, it's... misleading, to say the least. To put it back with my lime example, OP asks ""Is lime juice corrosive or does the acidity add to the taste?"" to which you respond ""I drink tons of it - however only in other drinks that aren't as acidic""

That being said, my opinion on walking/fast traveling is Oblivion and Skyrim are set up so you can't just jump to a location. You have to find it first. That means you have to map out the entire setting before you're done with the game. So, fast traveling is definitely not going to hurt every now and then when I'm finally done with a quest in a cave in the middle of nowhere and the person I'm helping is across the map... and I don't have a horse nor any speed modification.

Like /u/UNREASONABLEMAN said, there are some great upgrades you can print (such as fan shrouds for active cooling) that help improve overhang performance and bridging and I also had the power connector in the acrylic enclosure get too warm and start to melt on an 8-hour print.  I don't even live in the US and Makergear still shipped me a replacement connector for free and now that I have the enclosure fan blowing on the connector, I've had no more issues.

I'm really wracking my brain to think of any other issues I've had with my M2 in the last couple years ... At one point I bought some really cheap black ABS that would clog my hot-end and was a real pain to work with (I think the dyes and fillers in the plastic weren't melting at ~230C).  Raising the temperature above ~245C caused heat to travel up the barrel and melt plastic near the PEEK throat.  That was pretty frustrating but again, I think the hot-end design is fine as long as you don't try to solve your problems with higher temperatures and use good filament.  Makergear also sells fully assembled hot-ends for $50 if you really screw things up.

I think you'll be happy with your purchase."

carlaacat,EatCheapAndHealthy,1389147843.0,"* Have oatmeal in the mornings instead of bagels (a large bagel=6 slices of bread). It's usually pretty cheap to buy in bulk. Other mornings, have an egg white omlette. Whole eggs are ok, but only if you eat them less frequently. Be wary when looking for whole wheat breads-- you want at least two or three grams of fiber, which does something magic related to fat disposal, apparently. 

* Beans and lentils are the best filler. They also take on flavors so easily! Amp up the spice-- chili, curry, paprika, black pepper-- to avoid using too much salt. Pair a bean chili with brown rice. I find that brown rice is more filling so you eat less of it at a time, therefore saving money. Frozen spinach is cheap and I like to add it to soups and stews. Cram in all the veggies you can, really. If you can get a good price (maybe Trader Joe's?) quinoa is worth experimenting with.

* Dessert: I unfortunately am in the terrible habit of always craving something sweet after dinner. Lowfat yogurt and applesauce is very satisfying, though.

* Want a snack? Get rid of the chips/pretzels and keep on carrots and celery in the house. Whole carrots are cheaper and last longer than baby carrots. I cut veggie sticks in bulk-- they last about three days dry. A tiny bit of salt on cucumber or tomato slices is also very satisfying.

InspectorVII,TalesFromRetail,1389147855.0,"Since legal action is involved it would be advisable not to discuss the incident unless you are put in a position to be directly questioned. 

I know this may not be a popular opinion, but your job is on the line.  The company doesn't want the press, they do not want the hassle.  They will settle.  It is best if you as an employee stay out of it as much as you can."

Or where were the ""free james reimer"" comments when Bernier was stealing literally every game for us? 

Do you think we'd be in a playoff spot right now without Carlyle? Do you think we would be just absolutely flourishing without him? 

I'm so sick of this conversation, and fans that think they could do any better or know exactly what is best for the team. "

Also, maybe you might live long enough to see a cool medical breakthrough or something like mind uploading or something? :P

Maybe earth will be a nuclear ruin in 100 years. Enjoy the time that you're given here on earth, in the universal time frame it's barely a blink. Thousands of years is barely a blink, just enjoy the ride."

I saw a pretty average looking (6/10) girl with a humorous profile and her inbox had hit the limit to where no one new could message her. She had ""casual sex"" checked though.

EDIT: 5-10 messages per day is still **significantly** greater than what men get."

Until we hear any different from anyone else this is the case.

I feel if Mark wanted to can him he would have already but I don't know because there aren't words from the team."

beanfiddler,AskReddit,1389147926.0,"You're welcome. I totally feel you regarding the ""some choices"" thing. I'm so, so, so hard on myself for the things I regard as ""fuck ups."" And the problem is, none of it is really all that awful. I know people who've done so much worse, yet get praised a lot more. I intellectually know it, but not emotionally. I can't forgive myself for bullshit that I shouldn't have carried around at all.

People who are bigots do terrible things to your head. Sexism is most terrible not when other people treat us like shit, but when we believe them. And it's so hard not to, especially when it's people like our parents.

Everyone deserves an education that they want, regardless of what anyone else thinks or tries to make you feel. I wish you all the best."
