It doesn't make any sense to anyone.

And just a correction, it's *not* legal there. If a federal officer is in colorado, he can still arrest you for possesion. However, since it's not against state laws, state or local law enforcement can't arrest you for it.

Quite frankly no one gives enough of a shit to send feds there to arrest people. Not to mention the fact that the feds may or may not have jurisdiction. (I.e. on your own property, totally legal. On State property, still totally legal. On federal property, like highways, even if you're in Colorado, it's still *illegal*. But you probably won't get arrested.)

However the banks fall under the jurisdiction of a federally regulated system. So they are automatically federal jurisdiction."

tubachris85x,StarWars,1389491884.0,"So, I'm gonna copy/past my response to another member since it's relevant here:

As for the MR helmets being highly sought after? I don't really see why. MR accidentally used the wrong helmet, as you can see, the Prepro 3, as the mistook it for the ESB hero. Well, on top of that, the Prepro 3 had the right-side mandible angled in a very noticeable way. I'm not sure who the hell cleared it for production like that, but it looks horrid and noticeable to every-non-fett researching person. So the MR is not entirely accurate because of the fucked up mandible along the visor.

EFX DID mold the screen used ESB Hero which will be coming out soon (I saw pics of them molding it!).

If anything, the top helmets to go with is either Fettpride/Grant McClune or even a Mystery helmet, too include an original Don Post if you want helmets with direct lineage to the movie made helmet molds

The Boba Fett helmets themselves are not as rare as people generally think. In fact, Ebay was flooded with Mystery helmet recasts. I remember I bought a shitty recast one on purpose to practice using bondo and generally how to take something ugly as shit and turn it into something great.

As for pricing? If you want a DECENT (BKBT OR ILM kit) finished/painted Jango helmet, it should run around $400-$550 already made and ready.
Do it yourself, should only cost you about $350

Boba Fett, Finished and painted, can run between $500-$650+ That's primarily due to how laborious a highly accurate paint scheme is."

It's [staged (NSFW)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UoDgARempk&amp;feature=youtu.be). There are other videos where he does that to other people. Elsewhere in the thread someone mentions it's [a running gag (NSFW)](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x182nhb_yola-berrocal-huge-boobs-with-surprise_people) on that show. The women are clearly participating.

Internet feminists are frothing at the mouth at being able to shriek about ""rape culture"" and ""omg reddit upvotes sexual harassment,"" but if the women consented to it then your opinions on it are pretty much irrelevant.

**Edit:** oh god my inbox

**Edit 2:** more info as per /u/Stingerc

&gt; I remember that show from when I lived in Spain, it's called Cr√≥nicas Marcianas(Martian Chronicles). It was a late night talk show and regularly featured tips, a big thing was a girl who did topless pole dancing when they went or came back for commercials.

**Edit 3:** Remember, kids, [don't argue with feminists](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1uzmoz/my_apologies_let_me_help_you_with_that/cendjuv). They're right even when they're wrong. Women are innocent children who aren't able to make decisions for themselves (this is sarcasm FYI) which is why we need feminists to tell them what to do.

&gt; Women have never consented to anything that is either a symptom of nor a cause of rape culture. Good point. It similar to how Blacks have never participated in anything that was racist. Have you considered publishing your findings? You could revolutionize the field of bullshit male reddit users think really shows dem idiotic feminazis.

**Edit 4:** Also, remember that you're not allowed to criticize feminism or feminists. Doing so makes you a fedora-wearing neckbeard-sporting MRA red pill misogynist. I'm not looking forward to having to tell my SO I'm these things, she will be very disappointed. :(

**Edit 5:** Thanks for the gold(s)! 

**Edit 6:** Featured on SRS?! That's pretty neat! Apparently I'm an anti-progressive neckbeard, which is funny, because I can assure you ladies that my neck is beardless, and I am not American, so it's safe to assume that you know little about my political views or options, for that matter. But I'm just a cishet male oppressor, so what do I know?

**Edit 7:** Critical thinking no reals, only feels. If I were a woman (or wombyn, if you prefer) I'd be allowed to make [these kind of critical arguments against feminism and/or feminist issues](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1uz0q9/tw_self_post_observations_from_a_double_agent/) because it'd be pretty silly to accuse her of being a neckbearded fedora-wearer, right? If my position is somehow cheapened because I'm not a woman, that's something to think about!

**Edit 8:** /u/KyriarchyEleison of SRS has [politely](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1uzmoz/my_apologies_let_me_help_you_with_that/cenjesf) asked me to edit once more on their(xir?) behalf.

Peacefulchaos6,todayilearned,1389492011.0,"What? First of all, it makes a huge difference how much the value of crack he was selling was worth. How is it justified to say someone selling $10, $100 or $100,000 of drugs should get the same charges. I am not saying that selling any amount of drugs is justified but for first offenders there is no way that someone should be sentenced to that amount of jail time. The level of the offense should be a huge factor in sentencing. 

Your example of comparing prostitution to selling a certain amount of drug is a very poor example. I don't think that it needs to be explained why. Saying that the value of drugs is irrelevant in sentencing is more comparable to someone speeding. All cars have the ability to go well above the speed limit so with your logic if someone is caught go 10 or 20 kilometers over the speed limit they should get the same charges as someone street racing since they are both endangering.   

Furthermore, do some research on the sentencing of people in possession of crack vs cocaine and you will see that punishment for crack possession is outright unfair. Those in possession of crack face punishments 100 times more severe then those in possession of cocaine (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act).

If God comes down and says 'hey guys, this religion is true and if a single one of you doesn't worship me I'll blow the lot of you straight to Hell' then a state religion would absolutely be necessary.


Neither of those are the case. If people aren't hurting each other with their beliefs and breaking secular laws, what possible reason could there be for banning religion that outweighs the threat of horrible damage inherent in such a plan? 

Certainly there are valid arguments for why religion is bad. There aren't valid arguments for why it should be banned.

The responsibility of sane feminists is to be one of the loudest and harshest voices that tackle bullshit SJW feminism. You DO see people with some serious contempt for what feminism is these days because of scumbag tumblerinas who have taken over the movement. 
And you know what? They should hate that nasty SJW feminism, because it's cruel and stupid and narcissistic. 

In able for people to see that calm headed, rational feminism does exist, those feminists need to come out and say, ""I am a feminist and this is not what I believe"" whenever someone tries to speak for the movement in this way. 

Everyone says things in anger, but I think that saying, ""Look, I'm a feminist just as they claim to be, and I disagree. The viewpoint this person expresses is not typical of good feminism for x,y and z OR unfortunately many feminists do feel this way but many of us feel that this viewpoint is harmful and are trying to get rid of it."" is really important.

Ker_Splish,MensRights,1389492463.0,"Seriously, why are you supposed to be born with a foreskin, man?  Is it because it's ""normal?"" 

...because one person's perception of ""normal"" is ""weird"" to another person.  

The reason I asked, is because things that form on a fetus during gestation could be considered by many as ""normal,"" and in no way would they be slated for removal.  

I'm going to pose another hypothetical question, but I want to assure you I'm not trying to make you look stupid or demean your beliefs in any way.  

If you had a child, and they were born with, say, an ear right smack in the middle of their forehead, (say it's an ""extra"" ear, and he/she has two more in the normal spot) would you have it removed?  What if the child was perfectly healthy, and removal of the ear had 0 medical necessity, but the surgery, as most procedures are, had a chance of being botched, leaving scars or a dead kid?  

In this instance, I would have the ear removed.  It might sound strange, but I'd just want my kid to look ""normal.""  (Remember, normal is subjective)  

The same could apply to parents who are just like ""alright, sure"" when the doctor asks about circumcising their child.  Perhaps they were circumcised, or they just figured they were going with the flow.  Any way you look at it, it's difficult to see the evil in this particular instance.  


In an earlier passage, you wondered why/assumed I did support female circumcision.  

Here's what I think:  

Now, female circumcisions are another thing entirely.  As you know, they're traditionally performed by a male family member with a pair of tin-snips or rusty scissors.  (Seriously, they just get whatever sharp thing they can find and cut away.  It's gruesome.)  

Why do they do this?  Sure, in some cultures, it's normal.  But, behind that normalcy (typically) lies a culture of female oppression; female circumcision is intended to deny the person physical sexual pleasure, so that she'll remain loyal to her husband.  (I'm going with the middle-eastern behavior model here, FYI.) 

I feel that in the case of female circumcision, which is something I WOULD consider mutilation, it's an obvious invasion of the sovereignty of the human body, to be exploited years later when the child has matured into society.  It's a means of control over behaviors and natural biological urges, typically perpetrated in a barbaric fashion by scores of girl-hating ragheads.  

I feel that here is the distinction between the two:  

Intent.  It's all about the intent.  You know how there's a saying that ""the devil's in the details?""  The female example showcases ill intention and control, the male (and I'm assuming, more ""westernized"") example shows no ill intention, and no domineering intent.  I guess that, in some cases, there's probably some redneck out there somewhere like ""by GAWD mah boy's gonna be cut, just like his pappy and his grand pappy"" and et al, but it's typically not that malicious.  

What do you think?

smartlypretty,relationship_advice,1389493033.0,"Congrats on making your decision and I definitely don't want to make you second guess it! However, one thing to consider depending on the level of custody you seek is sometimes courts favor the parent with current custody by a de facto arrangement.

If you are angling for joint or even primary custody, it may not be wise to flee the domicile without the child (or with) without first establishing this. As bad as sticking around broken up may be, I'd hate to see you in this position.

It happened somewhat to a (female) internet friend of mine some years back and she never regained anything other than weekend visits. It kept me in my own marriage far longer than I'd liked because I had no place to take my children to and thus could have allowed custody to default to their dad. (It's also slippery financially for both sides after a split.) 

We've never really fought over custody very much except for garden variety weekends stuff, and he'd like custody, but if it becomes a carrot/stick scenario, leaving without your kid puts you in a harder to change spot.

Dantilli,introvert,1389493065.0,"I'm don't believe that how genuine you are and how much you like to help out is dependant on an introverted or extroverted nature. Again, there may be a correlation, but i don't think it's cause and effect.

I lived with 16 people last year and I would consider all of them to be very genuine and helpful. In fact it was the two most extroverted people that I considered the most genuine and willing to help anyone. In fact if it wasn't for their influence I wouldn't be as open and confident as I am today. They are literally my inspiration in terms of socialising and networking.

Going literally on the definition of an introvert, the only thing I can say is that they are more likely to make effort to do the most with their social time. But doing more with your time is increasing efficiency.

Effectiveness is about improving success and, in this context, involves developing social skills. Sure Introverts are more likely to spend time studying this in solitude, but an extrovert gets much more hands on experience. I can't say which is a better strategy as it would probably vary wildly between each individual and their experiences."

Pros:

* Vastly improved visuals and it even manages to look better than MGS2 in some respects.

* It remains completely faithful to the original game's story so there are no retcons in the plot.

Cons:

* For one thing due to the introduction of gameplay mechanics from MGS2 boss battles are made much easier as the all with exception to two fights IMO play exactly the same as they did in the original game.

* The monotone voice acting in comparison to the original game is terrible.

* The highly unnecessary over-the-top cutscenes (with exception to only Gray Fox) look ridiculous and out of place in a series that is known for being over-the-top.

* The environments and guard patrols are literally copy and pasted from the original game. Unlike the Resident Evil remake that was released on the GC a few years earlier the developers did nothing to add to what was already a fantastic game or change the environments up enough to remain familiar while at the same time feel like something new. 

* Unlike Substance that was released the year before and the original game there are no VR missions, boss survival, or the cutscene theater.

But statistically, they aren't exactly common, are they?

&gt;But lets take a more average case. you've got a kid who never went to school. Doesn't know how to read or write. But he's been bestowed with the ability to see someone use a simple construction tool and then know how to use it, imperfectly of course. someone is going to see potential in him and teach him and work him at the same time. this kid has just gotten an opportunity to learn a new skill. in a while he could even work for himself or use any money he's saved up to learn a different more profitable trade. if he saves up eventually he can learn what he wants from anyone willing to take his money.

What....seriously? That sounds like a recipe for slavery to me.

Lost_Afropick,blackladies,1389493348.0,"I travel quite a lot and I don't agree with a lot of that list and I'd actually add other countries instead.  Take Italy and Spain off that list and even China.  Sure they're no paradises for the black traveller as they have issues toward African migrants but the people aren't actively hostile and dangerous.   Germany being on that list is silly imo.  Been there plenty times, always had nice experiences.

But Eastern Europe in general?  I'd avoid Ukraine and the other former Soviet republics.  They're actually dangerous.  Polish guys I work with have warned me off against going there.  Just like a Russian guy said it would be a bad idea for me to walk about Moscow by myself when I was there.  I'd also steer clear of the whole Balkans region too.  I'm not sure Israel is the cleverest thing to do either.

I saw some people commenting that USA is a bad idea which is just stupid.  I get the point they're making, that USA is not exactly black people friendly but a black traveller isn't in active danger in Washington or like he or she might be in Kiev, Moscow or Gdasnk.  I don't think if I walked through a white town in bumfucksville America the inhabitants would form a violent gang to chase me out.  If I wandered around some parts of some countries I mentioned that might actually happen.  So putting America there is stupid.

Go to Spain.  Go to Italy.  Go to Germany.  They're good to tourists and you'll enjoy it.

He served a few terms of internship and imprisonment in the 1970s and was viewed by the IRA as integral to their negotiation strategies at the time, which would be very unusual if he were an outsider with no connection to the IRA. It's also highly debatable whether a non-violent community activist (which he maintains he was) could have been elected leader of a political movement linked to a terrorist organisation at the time that organisation's campaign is in full swing. Numerous journalists, historians and former allies have named Adams as a former IRA Chief of Staff.

He was also from a strongly pro-IRA area and many members of his family, including his parents, were IRA veterans, which would make it all the more remarkable if he managed to become head of a pro-physical force movement without actually taking any part in the fighting.

Even we don't completely trust it because it's never been implemented honestly.

Ok, here's the thing you overlook about government...in theory, government works for the good of all (we can argue about whether it actually does, but the thing is, our government is for the people, at least in theory). Your system works for the benefit of those who have the property to serve.

To humor you though: religion is used to divide people and incite them to fight against each other, e.g. the Crusades, internal violence in Ireland, Israel versus Palestine, etc. If you outlawed religion, we'd still certainly have war, but it'd be harder to convince people to blow themselves up or fly planes into buildings if they weren't convinced they'd be rewarded in the afterlife, so you'd probably see less violence.

To reiterate, I do think the the value of freedom of religion outweighs the resulting violence, but that's based mostly on how I personally value freedom versus life itself; someone who values life more highly would probably disagree, and they wouldn't be wrong, because the premises would be different."

My mother was suportive, but my father was not, he thought that having BC would turn me into 'a slut'. he would flush my pills down teh toilet, or ring up and abuse my gynacologist. He took my photo to pharmacies and told them not to sell me my pill because he is my father and until I am married he owns my vagina.

Now I still experience problems, but this time its the government stopping me from having my BC. There is a law in Australia, where if you fit into 2 clot/stroke risk categories, you can't have oestrogen based BC. My mum had PE, and I'm overweight, so no pill for me. Thankfully Australia is amazing, and methods like Implanon, Mirena, Paraguard and Depo are cheap or free.

oldmonty,videos,1389493905.0,"The problem with the ""feminist"" cause you are defending, which promotes gender equality, is that it has been and is currently championed by people who don't at all believe in gender equality. I was having a debate with someone on reddit a while back who claimed to be a feminist and was very angry with me for suggesting that she should not be paid as much as a man because her job involved physical labor which she claimed she couldn't do because she was a woman. This whole attitude of ""I deserve the exact same even if it hurts everyone around me to do so and in fact isn't fair"" is total bullshit. If you can't do a job as well as a male candidate then you shouldn't be paid as much, plain and simple. I'm not saying that she couldn't have done the job, I'm saying she was using the fact that she was a woman to sit on her ass and not do the physical part of her job(lifting boxes), then arguing that she was a feminist and deserved equal everything. I think the same would hold true of any male candidate, if it was part of your job to do physical labor and you ""couldn't"" or didn't want to, then that's not the right job for you. However, can you imagine a male candidate trying to pull that kind of shit? It wouldn't work, people use feminism as a guise to further their own goals and that's why its bullshit, you can believe in gender equality without being a feminist that's just called believing in equality. Which I do.

Equal pay for equal work, no special considerations for anyone. I know for a fact that being a woman doesn't preclude you from being able to do physical labor in an office. Her point of view was that is was OK to have her colleague do all the physical labor while she just did all of the computer stuff, see equality- she does the 50% of the work that you can do while sitting on your ass and he does the 50% that involves getting tired and lifting heavy things. Even though those those tasks were assigned to the both of them. Even though if her employer had hired a male candidate for the job more work would have gotten done because they could switch between each of them doing the labor and the computer portion when one got tired. She still deserves equal pay? For dragging everyone around her down?

The problem is that, to her, when it's something she doesn't want to do its a biological fact that women are weaker than men (which I don't believe and in fact I was getting downvoted by the feminists of askwomen for saying that women aren't weaker than men) but when it's something that she wants it's an issue of opinion, open to debate. 

I think this is exactly the point bill burr is trying to make, it's about hypocrisy and the point where a personal beliefs system is used to justify an individual's wants while hurting others. "

But it's perfectly okay to let people starve to death to advance your own, right?

&gt;tell each of us why we don't deserve what we've earned and why someone else does.

Strange statement from someone who values human life so little.

&gt;if you can convince me that I'm evil i'll willingly, but not gladly, take that bullet.

I'm not interested in killing. I'm interested in people using wealth they got because of society, to benefit society. Taxes are the dues you pay for living in civilized society, the price for not living in a hobbesian state of nature. This is simple stuff. This men with guns crap is laughable, because somewhere, there will ALWAYS be a man with a gun. If it's not a government, it'll be a warring tribe, a business with a private police force, or it might not even be a gun but a tooth and a claw. Brush up on philosophy BESIDES John Locke. Seriously. If you don't like taxes, then you can leave and move to another country and renounce your citizenship...if they'll take you. 

&gt; 1. you have the right to live and fight for your right to live.

So...if someone oppresses me via property rights, is it okay if i fight a corrupt system that lets me starve?

&gt; 2. you have the right to make decisions for yourself as you see fit.

Given you don't harm others, mmkay.

&gt; 3. you have the right to property you have acquired or created from raw materials acquired in a manner that does not violate any these specific rights of another unwilling person.

I don't necessarily agree with those terms, but I do accept property as a concept.

Anyway. My sharing of views might be a bit more complex, but here's what I believe.

1) Life originated in a lawless state of nature. It was nasty. It was brutal. It was short. 

2) We form governments as a way to leave this nasty, darwinian state of nature. The purpose of government is to:

a) Protect human life

b) Enhance human life

3) I believe everyone has the ability to do what they like, as long as they don't harm others. Unlike libertarians, I don't just believe in active harm though, I believe passive/structural harm are also important to address.

4) When the private sector doesn't do a good job, government can step in and use funding from the people to do a better job to accomplish the goals in point 2.

5) On the subject of property, I think it's a useful concept, but not an absolute right. Making it an absolute right violates the directive to protect and enhance human well being. Also, keep in mind, without government providing a safe environment for you, you wouldn't be able to acquire property anyway. So it's only fair that they can sieze a portion of it if it is to society's benefit to do so.

To simplify it even more, I believe in a combination of social contract theory and utilitarianism. I think rights are a tricky concept, and are NOT self evident, but socially constructed and agreed upon. I view rights in a utilitarian viewpoint, that they are meant to benefit society, since **PURE** utilitarianism can cause problems. And by my criteria, I don't think protection of property is up there with the right to life or liberty. 

&gt; if it doesn't work for everyone, it shouldn't apply to everyone. Selfless or selfish.

I believe reality is a lot more nuanced and complex than this.

&gt;As a favor, please explain to me how externalities are immune to opinion.

Then she left him with over ¬£10,000 worth of debt (that she ran up in his name) and a lifetime of child support to pay.

An OS shouldn't be part of a budget. Really the only operating system people pay for is Windows, and unless they're not replacing an old computer they have a valid key. Otherwise, there's to much variation on the pricing for the OS to make it noteworthy (e.g. HUP, student discount, etc)

nicoleta_,Calgary,1389494844.0,"You know what, yeah it is an issue because using hateful language, even unintentionally, normalizes hate towards people and reinforces casual (or in some of the cases in this thread - blatant) racism. 

People would go crazy if someone said ""I was robbed by two blacks downtown today."" It's the same thing, but for some strange fucking reason many Canadians don't seem to give two shits about racism against First Nations people. It's not okay to refer to someone by just an adjective that describes them - gays, blacks, natives. Why would anyone be okay with reducing someone to just a label like that? It's not a nice way to talk about other people and yeah, it comes across as racist and hateful. OP could have easily avoided this, or edit their post to say ""two native people"" or go one step further and say ""two native men,"" which are both better descriptions that ""two natives."" 

The second issue is really what is the OP trying to achieve by posting in this subreddit? Is he looking for advice? If so, then why is a physical description needed? So I assume he's posting to spread awareness that there are dangerous people downtown, which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. If this is the case then OP should include as complete of a physical description as possible. Age? Sex? Height? Body type? Hair colour? Clothing? You wouldn't hear someone say ""I was attacked by two whites downtown,"" without any additional details, so why is this any different?

&gt; your [sic] taking offence to his friend referencing them by their race, which is probably one of the only things he remembers about them

Really? You don't think he remembers if they were men or women even? That's a pretty bad excuse. I understand that OP's friend could very well have been traumatized by this but I highly doubt that their race was the *only* thing he remembered (and seeing OP's update you'll note that he did in fact remember more about them!)

Do you see why this is an issue yet? Just because their friend was attacked doesn't mean it's okay for OP to use and promote hateful speech, even if they didn't intend to do so, and on top of that describing nothing but the race of the attackers is not a good physical description, in the case that he's trying to make other aware. That's what my above comments were attempting to establish. I don't want to personally attack OP, I just want to make him and others aware that the language used is offensive, and yeah, it's an issue."

It was a shitty unfair comparison and while not every sibling would do that for their siblings, not all parents would do that for their kids. Remember the guy who bailed on his wife and baby when the gunman shot up that movie theater in Colorado? The guy just ran and left them amidst  people getting shot and killed. A parent might feel like its the strongest love but they can't prove it. How many parents would chase a suicide bomber and sacrifice themselves for an entire school like that kid did a couple days ago? ""As a parent..."" Is a total fucking cop out.

abcd_z,TheRedPill,1389494953.0,"How to spot a gold digger (AKA a ""ho""):  

&gt;I must admit I always steer the fuck clear of ho's except to fuck a little with them when they try to hustle me for drinks...  

&gt; But I do have an amazingly hot pivot with clear-cut ho traits, so I frequently pimp her out when we're rolling together. The bulk of the following observations are based on my dealings with her as well as the ho's I've come across in the clubs:  

&gt; -Ho's dress for the symps. Meaning they'll look sexy but as opposed to the freak a ho will try to attract a ""provider"" rather than a ""lover"" so their outfits are less slutty and more classy.  

&gt; -Bling! Never seen a ho without expensive jewelry. Bracelets and pendants, ear-rings and chunky stones on the finger are the order of the day. (""Gifts"" from admirers, no doubt!)  

&gt; -""Buy me a drink!"" If you hear that line coming out of the mouth of a girl you met less than a minute ago, she's a ho.  

&gt; -""Let me buy you a drink!"" If you hear that line coming out of the mouth of a girl you met less than a minute ago she's a REALLY, REALLY GOOD ho. Watch out!  

&gt; -Ho's never leave the bar for long. You'll find your garden variety ho hanging out in close vicinity to the bar at all times as this is prime fishing waters for generous chumps hoping to score with the sexy ladies that just happens to be located conveniently near the 300$ champagne, lol.  

&gt; -Ho's are DIRECT. Their pussy is the tool of their trade and time is money. The instant a ho realize you can't be chumped, you're DUMPED. Ho's are also very vulnerable to game as they themselves are never gamed; they do all the gaming normally.  

&gt; -Ho's are NOT gonna allow you to game them when they're working, so find out when they're on their own time. This is when they're open to being gamed.  

&gt; DO's and DON'Ts around ho's:  

&gt; -DO make her understand you're a High Value Male whose value is so much higher than hers that she should be thankful you'll even spend time chatting with her.  

&gt; -DO cultivate an ""insider-mentality"" with ho's as in ""Yeah, I know what's up with you.. I'm not buying, but I'll help you land a symp to skin so we can split the loot.."" Then befriend her by making fun of the dudes buying you two free drinks. (Us vs. Them bubble).  

&gt; -DON'T buy a ho a drink!!! (Duh.) And don't do any favours, demand favours from her instead. If she's asking for a light, make her pass you a coaster for your drink or a cigarette from her pack, etc. Basic compliance.  

&gt; -The Ho litmus-test: Tell her you just lost your job and that you're living on a buddy's couch for a few months until you get back on your feet and watch the ho do an instant back-turn only to never acknowledge your existence again.  

---------------------------------------  

&gt; Also, you can screen out hoes when they say things like the following (they always will):  

&gt; For gold digger with no subtlety:  

&gt; ""I've been having money problems.""  

&gt; For bitches with some subtlety:  

&gt; ""I have a friend who's going into (whatever kind of business you're in). Does that pay well?""

I was worried we'd have no chemistry, that it'd be awkward and that it'd just be about the sex, but it wasn't. We met in a pub for our first meetup (our first date was the second time we met), and we talked the day away. We met early so he wasn't stuck until a late train if it went bad, as he lived 2 hours away, and we literally talked and spent time getting to know each other for over 6 hours. It just felt right. It was like we'd known each other for years by the time he had to leave.

Online dating isn't taboo any more, it's common and popular. I think it's a good way to meet people because then you can chose your date based on their information as well as their looks. 

My online dating experience was great, and this is one of the best relationships I know of. I'm not just saying that because it's mine, but we don't argue or fight, we seem to complement each other so well and it's a true, deep love that we have.

Riali,ABraThatFits,1389495114.0,"I totally understand your frustration here, with the seemingly contradictory statements of ""love your body, it's fabulous"" and ""here's an apparatus to make it look better.""  (Also, I think downvoting you for expressing frustration is counterproductive, but hey, whattreyagonnado?)

The thing is, there's two contradictory truths happening here.  The first, as escoomsol was illustrating (heh! pun!) with her figure drawing class anecdote, is that human bodies are not inherently ugly, no matter their shape.  They're fascinating and functional and imperfect and really pretty wonderfully put together.

The other truth is that there is a huge and important social pressure to look a certain way.  As much as we don't always like it, we really all subscribe to it, as much as we protest.  We all wear clothes and brush our hair and wear deodorant and a thousand other things to make ourselves ""presentable"".  We're always talking about minimizing our ""flaws"" and accentuating our ""good points"".  Presentation is a billion upon billion dollar industry, and absolutely obligatory in order to be a functioning member of society. 

So, what I try to cultivate is an attitude in which I know which parts of my body don't fit into the cultural box of ""beautiful"", and there are a lot of them.  And I do try to minimize them, and I do occasionally feel very frustrated by them.  But, at the end of the day, I don't see them as important.  They're just another thing to deal with, like struggling with arithmetic or being pretty close to tone-deaf.  I don't try to tell myself my body is perfect the way it is, but I also try really hard not to let those imperfections inform my self image in a big way.  It's a hard place to get to, and it's certainly taken me some time (I'm a good bit older than you), but it's worthwhile to work on getting there, I think.  

Your body is not ""perfect"", and it's never going to be.  But that's okay.  It's such a small facet of who you are and what you want to do in life and why you're a fabulous and loveable person."

Dr. Oz has a great segment about ""Rocco the Cowboy"" who he puts on a diet because he is basically about to die.

He talks about different ""phases"" of veganism.

Phase 1 is vegan food that resembles the meaty food you crave.  There is everything from ""steak"" to ""sausages"" to ""chicken"" to ""cheese"" to ""mayo.""  There is amazing stuff out there right now, new products everyday.

Later phases are eating more natural, less process foods.

http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/rocco-returns
(okay, I'm annoyed, I can only find the second part.  I don't know if they talk about ""phases"" here, but look for the first!! It's great!  But watch this one too...)
Most of what we crave in meat is seasoning, texture and fat.  These can all be easily duplicated with vegan options.  Have you tried seitan?  Field Roast sausages?  The new product Beyond Meat?

You should post here/in another thread the meals that you crave and I am sure people will give you great options.  Also check out vegan recipe blogs so you won't get stuck in a rut of plain food.

Tacos: you can have the same shells, they even sell pre-flavored taco ""meat"" which looks IDENTICAL to ground beef, or you can get your own taco mix.  You can have fake cheese, sour cream, etc.

Good luck!

grandteton,AskReddit,1389495312.0,Part of it was fear. Many people feared going against the power these people amassed and thus complied. Hitler started his political career by using his charisma to ensnare the hearts of the people. He built up a loyal following.  *Then* he started to make plans for eradicating the Jewish and those who would oppose him. Those loyal to him followed blindly and much of the population feared retaliation if they vocalized disapproval. It's like the terrorist cells. Many of thw terrorists that end up doing the suicide bombings etc. do so out of fear. Not just for themselves but also for thwir families.

1) people with very detail-oriented careers that involve reading for work (research, law, finance, etc.), who also like to read, enjoy either non-fiction or very simple books. 
2) you may have started on a mid-series to late-series book. Even though some serials are stand-alone: they can develop traits in their characters over time that become so blown up new readers aren't able to accept them. If you've ""known"" the characters since the books began it's not as hard to accept.

In my major we're used to speak Spanish between us, but I developed a rule: I force the conversation to switch language according to the topic. Doctor Who, English is the best. In my munchies business I speak with my clients in French (the third most spoken language in my school). And when I want to talk about a book I move it to Italian. And although Portuguese is one of the less spoken, when I find someone who speaks it I immediately switch to it. If you want to do exchange, the solution is simple: *lead the conversation*. All you need is confidence; the weird feeling will go away with practice.

Also: consider that the couple was in an airport; they probably have a close relationship. Get a bilingual or trilingual friend and do the same! it will be awkward at first, but you both will get used  to it. Get a language friend and actually be a friend, not just someone with a language in common, there are probably millions of those. Build a relationship, that's the key."

pfmac,footballmanagergames,1389495607.0,"I've got maxed out youth facilities and youth recruitment, and so far I generated 5 4.5-star players (A left midfielder, a central midfielder, a goalie, a striker and a defensive midfielder). 

From my experience, even when you do get these players, half of them won't live up to their potential anyway (out my 5 wonderkids, the ML stalled at 2 stars, the GK and MC at 3 stars, the ST did grow up to be a quality player, and the DMC is still too young). So yeah, it's pretty hard.

Try broadening your scouting knowledge (get some feeder clubs), I think this works if your recruitment is extensive enough. You can also try saving before the new intake, and reload until you get one of them. I know, it's lame and you may feel like this is ""cheating"", but you can do it to at least check how often you are generating this kind of player."

197mmCannon,Louisville,1389495694.0,"Yes everything can be done with a file but one of the selling points of gel nails is that they last longer. By design they are harder to take off when you change your mind and decide you don't want them.

I have a nail license but I am not currently working as a nail tech so the only time I ever encountered gel nails was in school and it took us, as students, an hour or more to file down a full set of gel nails with just a file.

**edit** I'll add here that I am not endorsing whether or not a tech should or shouldn't do this with a file. I am just stating that the reason a lot of nail shops use a dremel is because it's faster and when your only charging 15 dollars for a full set you need to crank out as many full sets per hour as possible.

So when it comes to something like gel, which is a bit of a specialty product like fiber nails, any work you get done will most likely be more expensive (if they even do it) and they are less likely to want to spend a bunch of time taking your nails off."

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389495736.0,"One thing I wanna add to my explanation of my system....you seem to believe in these universal principles that are ""self evident"" and should be applied in all situations. I think that's a very clumsy way to view law and government. Life is complex. There are problems with all ideas taken to the extreme. I'm not really about principles. I'm about pragmatism.

You need to understand, it's quite clear you got your ideas from the likes of John Locke, but let me tell you, Locke is not the only philosopher, and in my opinion, he's not even the best. I recommend expanding your horizons beyond your singular, rigid way of thinking, and do research on other things. Read the likes of Rousseau, who had a more collectivist approach to the social contract (which I don't necessarily agree with either, but it's a different slant), or John Stuart Mill, who wrote his piece ""On Liberty"", which explains...well...liberty from another context. Heck, this is where I got the you're free to do what you want as long as you dont harm others thing. Heck, even read Marx. I know that he gets extreme about his willingness to dismantle capitalism and replace it with an unsustainable utopia, but he also has some good criticisms of capitalism and property at times. Read others beyond this. Read Aristotle and Plato. Read Immanuel Kant. Read Thomas Hobbes. Read Machiavelli. Seriously. Read philosophers other than John Locke, and you'll see that there exists a lot of equally valid philosophies beyond the one that you hold. Just because the founding fathers of the US relied heavily on him, doesn't mean he's the only philosopher with a view worth a darn, or that he's right. Also, if you notice, the founding fathers replaced his right of ""property"" with ""pursuit of happiness"", since it's quite clear the pursuit of property only favors societal elites. I think pursuing happiness is a lot better way of putting it anyway. It places emphasis on creating a society in which everyone is free to pursue one's own interests....but when you realize that the libertarian perspective actually inhibits such things, you'll realize that hey, maybe an extremist stance on property rights isn't the greatest thing after all.

I think the fact that other perspectives exist, is the very damning thing about libertarianism. It's a narrow minded way of looking at the world. It's simply one perspective, out of hundreds, many of which are no better or not worse. And some are better and some are worse if you ask me.

Why should I accept your views, above the hundreds of other perspective that exist? Why should I believe in a right of property like you do when it's quite clear that viewing property an an absolutist sense leads to great harm to people? Also, you realize the US once tried the whole government with no taxation thing, right? It was called the Articles of Confederation, they sucked. We abandoned them for a reason (they were too weak and the government was completely ineffective)."

BuildMyPaperHeart,AskMen,1389495864.0,"At least we've identified -the- reason. The barrier here seems to be A, and I can understand how it can be difficult for you to overcome. Who (even *what*) we are, in terms of culture, language, and religion are very ingrained in our lives, and can be impossible to reconcile. 

&gt; Which is worse: a barren love life or losing an enormous portion of life to heartbreak and regret?

I'm with you there. I've asked myself that question many times. I find myself regretting the only relationship I've had, despite all I learned from it, just so I wouldn't be feeling like I was a waste of her time. And considering where I am, I don't know if it would be worse to feel lonely as before, than feel abandoned as I do now.

However, we stand on opposite ends of the spectrum. You have strong ties to your cultural beliefs, and you might be willing to pass potential relationships for that reason. But I've been the person who's been let go because of someone elses' restrictions on culture that I cannot control. So perhaps I speak from a different perspective, but if possible I'd ask you to consider opening up to other cultures and schools of thought. 

&gt; My language, religion, and culture are an enormous part of my identity and my inability to compromise on most of it is such a harsh selection criteria that I have almost never run into a potential match.

I'm not asking you to change your beliefs, or compromise them for another person, but there are many open-minded people from all different backgrounds who are willing to make it work. They're on YouTube, reddit, everywhere; multicultural/religious couples who love each other deeply despite their different beliefs. It's not out of the question you could find something like that. If you could open up the potential that someone not of your culture could accept you, then it opens up your world significantly.

Another tip (from the women's magazine Glamour, of all places): Don't compare your own life to your family's. You are not your father, your cousin, your uncle, or anyone else. You are you, and the choices you make, and what happens to you, are yours alone. It's okay to be afraid when others fail, but their failures aren't guaranteed to be yours. If it does fall through, yeah sure we'll all feel pretty stupid that we could think otherwise, but at least we could say that with absolute certainty rather than pessimistic foresight."

I would also like to point out that just the mechanics of weightlifting as a sport favors those with a shorter stature because all of the moves are based off of relative body height.  That is to say that a 7 foot man has to move 200 lbs above his head so lets say around 9 feet into the air.  A 5 foot man moving 200 lbs above his head would need to move it say 6.5 feet into the air.  The amount of force and thus energy needed to be exerted for each of these (not concerning levers or muscles mass or any other functions that change the two's different abilities) is different and favors the shorter person as they need less energy to move the same weight above their head."

FrescoColori,AskReddit,1389496042.0,"My parents were divorced when I was 7; my Dad's family is Catholic and my mother is protestant. Like many things, they couldn't agree on how I should be raised when it came to religion, so I was left to my own ideas. I didn't really think about religion until high school when I felt left out of my friends' youth groups. That's when I started ""sampling"", mostly within Christianity, but I basically said yes to anyone who invited me to church with them.  
 
Finally, in college, I was invited to Mass at the university Newman Center. The first time I went, it felt like home. (Background: I ended up being raised by my Dad's Italian catholic family with almost no exposure to my mother or her family by that point.) I went through RCIA (basically convert to Catholicism classes) led by Dominicans who taught us to challenge scripture to better understand its context and to come to terms with its meaning. I'm sad when I tell this story to other Catholics and they have not had this experience. Beyond the feeling of ""at home-ness"", I loved Catholicism because it was the most inclusive and academic church I had experienced. 
 
I'm still not sure why I no longer believe (or maybe I never did; I was homesick all along?). As a scientist, I grapple with the statistics of thing, and tend to be a very analytical, evidence based person. I don't think that religion and science is fundamentally incompatible, I just think the personality type attracted to one has a hard time thriving in the other. Also, I'm embarrassed to admit, the antics of extreme fundamentalists make me shy away from all religion more and more, even moderate churches who aren't to blame. 
 
tl;dr I grew up without religion, but surrounded by Catholicism. In college I found an open minded Catholic church that made me feel at home, so I converted. Now I call myself a cultural Catholic because I love how it feels to be a part of a church but struggle with the believing part."

AFormidableContender,confession,1389496062.0,"&gt;Women are not opposed to that system, we just don't use it as often. Although trust me, women do not have the same preferences in men.

Women have far more stringent preferences in men than men have in women. It's a biological fact; genetic testing proves far more women reproduce throughout all of human history than men. Men want attractive women. How women achieve ""attractive"" can very wildly because men really only care about physical appearance, where as women are want whatever man is the best in any group of men judged by social success (being a leader, highly respected), physical success (body/healthy/fit), and economic success (successful, validating job). You can see this anywhere...many men will desire many women, but all the women will chase only 1 or 2 men. At my work place, the same 2 guys have had sex with 10-15 of the women.

Go to any female centric NSFW subreddit like /r/LadyBoners, /r/GoneWildStories, and all the men are cookie cutter. 

Go to /r/GoneWild, and the diffeerences in women that get heavily upvoted are pretty significant, from punk rocker/tattooed and peircing women to girl-next-door types.

&gt;Not really. A friend of mine was once really attracted to a guy. She probably thought he was a 10. I thought he was a 3. That's just one example.

Meh. I can't dispute that. I havne't seen the guy. But I will say that that is rare. 

&gt;So basically, guys want sex with different women every day. Why should I feel bad for someone because he can't sleep with 1000 women?

I would never expect someone like you to have any sympathy for anyone, in any situation or scenario. You arent' capable of it. What I am trying to put across, however, is the notion that men want sex, just like any living breathing person, and they want sex, idealy, as much as possible. 

Male sexuality is binary; either you attract ALL/MOST the women, or you attract, pretty much NO women. You're trying to swing back and forth from ""he gets laid, and thinks he deserves MORE? Fuck him! Women don't owe him anything"" to ""He can't get laid at all!? That's his fault because he has a bad attitude. Fuck him!"". 

The only way a man can win in this logic trap you've set up, is if he just happens to be REALLY REALLY REALLY good looking and gets sex with 0 effort just like you, and everyone else deserves to die a virgin and too bad for them. 

No man is going to accept that at face value, and even less because you say so.  

&gt;expect you to do whatever you want, as long as it isn't at someone else's expense.

Everything in life is at someone else's expense. You got your job because you fucked all the other applicants over. You were just better, or better looking, and your superior hired you instead.

&gt;I don't equate quality of life with the number of sexual partners you have.

Because you're an attractive woman. Not everyone has your privilege, and not everyone thinks like you.

&gt;Everyone gets it for free, unless you go to prostitutes.

Nope. You pay with money,...time...., investment..., education, ....validation. Sex is never free. Human economics is the transaction of human value and validation. All relationships are just value transactions; you are friends with your friends because you value something of/in them and they value something of/in you. If that value was removed, you'd cease to be friends.

&gt;Good luck with that. Most women can see right through that.

Most women can see through it when it's done badly. The entire point of TRP and seduction is to emulate the men that do it naturally. The fact that anyone has sex at all contradicts the statement ""most women can see through that""

&gt;Just so we're on the same page, you think it's OK to force and pressure people into having sex. You know that's called rape, right? And that most countries' governments agree with my stance on the issue?

Several things:

1) My point was that your subjective morality does not apply to me or anyone else

2) No one said anything about pressure or force

3) Most people don't do anything unless somewhat pressured. Pressure isn't necessarily molevenlent.

&gt;So because I'm an ethical person, and opposed to rape, you think I take advantage of people? I really don't understand that logic.

No. 

I said it's clear you take advantage of people because you stated that you believe that your moral standards are superior or should take precedent to the quality of life of other people. What you said is the same as me saying ""People shouldn't get heart transplants to save their life because people exchanging organs is gross. People who have a problem with their heart diserve to die because they disrespected their heart and they will disrespect this new heart"". 

You literally suggested in your world, you'd want people to remain virgins unless they can find a way to have sex that satisfies your personal moral ideals and makes sure to benefit women by virtue of benevolent sexism, therefore, obviously you believe yourself to be more important than others, and hold yourself as the standard by which all other human beings need to be judged by.

&gt;That's a mathematical impossibility.

No it isn't.

Demonstrate how it's mathematically impossible...

It's a simply concept; a 5/10 woman can have sex with a 6/10 man because the 5/10 women can leveridge the difficult in the 6/10 man finding sex. A 6/10 is sex starved, and will gratefull have sex with a 5/10 woman, therefore, a 5/10 man cannot easily find an equivolent partner because 5/10 women can use this method to attract men of higher quality.
 
&gt;How is Affirmative Action racist or sexist? If you understand the history of the US, you will understand why that program was implemented.

Affirmative action on behalf of women is blatant sexism. I'm not sure what about that you don't grasp. Giving women special privilege because they're women is sexism.
 
&gt;The Alpha/Beta thing is dumb. Women don't care about that. 

They absolutly and most certainly do. 

I present, exhibit A: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1uy7wr/have_you_ever_had_angry_sex/cenbrep

&gt;Most women want 3 things: Attractive, Good Personality, Interesting. I don't care if he is an ""alpha"" or not.

Lol...if he's both hot looking, with a top quality personality, with interesting things going on in his life, he's alpha. 

You just said said you don't care if he's an alpha male, and then gave the definition for alpha males. 

&gt;Um, no. But I can promise you that if a guy is unattractive, but doesn't act resentful about it, or entitled, he will seem more attractive to some women.

Total bullshit. You're talking out your ass at this point.

&gt;I value women, children, family members, and animals. I don't flirt with any of them. Choosing to flirt with someone doesn't mean I value them more than someone else. I think you are using a very different definition of the word ""value"".

It means you value one or some men above others. You don't want sex from your cat.

We all freeze and a huge buck races past us, following it were 3 large coyotes. It was terrifying, these things literally ran through our group, hands reach away. 

Another time my brother (13) and I (10) went fishing down about a mile away from my grandparents house. There was this really old, rickety bridge with swampy water beneath it (we didn't eat the fish, just catch and release). Our grandparents let us walk down there often to fish, with the promise to always stay on the bridge, but kids being kids we decided to  walk under the bridge to the edge of the shore one day. The land around the water was really murky and muddy, so we were both barefoot. As we were baiting our lines I felt something sliding over the top of my left foot and it turns out to be a moccasin snake.. which are very poisonous. I just stayed as still as a could until it passed over me and then I ran back to the bridge and had a panic attack. Definitely taught us a lesson.  "

On a scholastic note, the *Cities of Tamriel: Orsinium* article took all damn week to write, but most of the work was done this morning. And no, this is not a series. I don't know any other cities. That said, anyone who's confident in a city should definitely use the supertitle so we can get a nice little series going.

This week's topic is pretty terrific for my chosen field of the Orsimer, so I'll see if I can whip something out for that, but since classes are opening this week (delayed a full week because of the winter storm, fuck yeah!) and I've still got the sequel to *Mortal* to write and code environments to get working, I may not have anything.

I *have* gotten a professional massage once, though, because the muscles in my neck/shoulders/upper back were all tight and knotted up from work/stress to the point where it was painful. The massage therapist loosened it all up for me and even did some hot stone therapy and showed me exercises to stretch out the muscles that I was being affected by.

It was still a bit awkward, though, even though I have absolutely no regrets about it. I'm not sure if I'd enjoy a massage from someone who didn't know what they were doing."

In addition, the abusive guy I dated treated his mother like gold, so there's that.

In another addition, my husband's mom passed when he was a child and has no siblings.  Seems like a very unfair metric to use for him.

Now, if the mom and/or sister are truly kind people and he's treating them poorly, then that's probably a good warning sign, but without context I think it's a crock of shit and very unfair to people with shitty parents. "

However, a girl on there posted some of her blog posts that seem pretty helpful. I'll be posting my routine for leg shaving on there (but, it's pretty basic to be honest).    

As for soaps, I really like the Taylor of Old Bond Street Grapefruit and the avocado. It smells nice and it lathers really easily. You can also check out How To Grow A Mustache Synergy soap, Barrister and Mann soap, Kiss My Face Shave Moisture (This is what I use in the shower). I just bought some soap from The Shaving Yeti, their scents sound good.  

As for razors, you can use anything you want, but I really like having a longer handle to reach all over. I have a Lady Gillette and love it. Partly for the color/design and partly because it's vintage.  

Just a note, I HATED shaving before I switched to DE. Now, I love it. The whole routine is very relaxing and my legs are way softer now. On good days, my boyfriend can't take his hands off my legs!

Skwonky,loseit,1389496567.0,"I derived mine mathematically starting with this calculator (you'll need a measuring tape): http://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/body-fat-percentage-calculator

These give you 4 different formulaic outcomes for body fat % using several body measurements, from there I dropped the lowest one (the YMCA formula was 3-5% lower from the other ones) and averaged the three other estimates. 

So the three highest calculated BF% estimates based on my measurements averaged to 22.85% at 228lbs. Now you know your fat mass by multiplying the weight by the BF% in decimal form:

228 x 0.2285 = 52.1lbs fat mass

228 - 52.1 = 175.9lbs lean body mass

Now that you have lean body mass you can find a goal weight based on BF%. Assuming my LBM changes negligibly (if you're weightlifting while losing weight it should stay relatively constant or increase slightly) you divide your LBM by the desired BF% subtracted from one in decimal form. It sounds complicated; it's not: Let's say I wanted to get to 12% BF

(LBM)/(1-desired BF%)

or

(175.9)/(1 - 0.12) = 199.88lbs ... or 200lbs rounded off.

or

(175.9)/(0.88) = 199.88 if that's less complicated thinking of it as LBM%

It seems a little long-winded but it's really simple and probably far more accurate than your handheld BF meter, those are NOTORIOUSLY innacurate with +/- error ranges of up to 7%."

1) Set an alarm on my phone for my wake up time (equipped with a 5min repeating snooze).

2) Dring 8 oz of water right before crawling into bed at night.

My bathroom is on the opposite side of the apartment from my bedroom, so when my body makes me get out of bed in the morning I hit all of the lights along the way.

&gt;Secondly, stop talking about 21 as if you're middle aged and haven't accomplished anything in life. You're still a baby as far as the universe is concerned and have a lot of life left to live. Enjoy the life you have now and stop regretting the life you had in the past. The surest way to miss out on life is spend it thinking about what could've been.

&gt;Third, you might want to think about actually living life a little before thinking about writing an autobiography. No one's going to have an interesting autobiography at 21.

Fortune cookies were originally Japanese, but when Pearl Harbor happened and Americans still wanted fortune cookies without being unpatriotic Chinese restaurants began offering them. Nowadays we associate them with Chinese food.

Point being: just because there's a bonafide Asian behind the counter doesn't mean they're 100% happy with the terminology or marketing. Not to mention it's very common for, say, a Japanese restaurant to be run wholly by Koreans. That's just business.

(I reread your comment after writing this, so I overlooked the patronizing part when I began writing, but I think there are still meritable bits of information so I'm leaving it as-is while acknowledging the market-base).

&gt; Why does the broker make money if they are not the business selling the product, or the consumer who is investing?

If they are working with their own money then they simply buy a stock at a certain price then they wait until the stock price rises and then sell the stock. The difference between those 2 points where they bought and then sold the stock ,minus any applicable taxes is their profit. Also some companys try to make themselves more attractive to stock aka share holders by paying dividends. Qoute from wikipedia:

&gt;A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it can either re-invest it in the business (called retained earnings), or it can distribute it to shareholders. A corporation may retain a portion of its earnings and pay the remainder as a dividend. Distribution to shareholders can be in cash (usually a deposit into a bank account) or, if the corporation has a dividend reinvestment plan, the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares or share repurchase. 

&gt;A dividend is allocated as a fixed amount per share, with shareholders receiving a dividend in proportion to their shareholding. For the joint stock company, paying dividends is not an expense; rather, it is the division of after tax profits among shareholders. Retained earnings (profits that have not been distributed as dividends) are shown in the shareholder equity section in the company's balance sheet - the same as its issued share capital. Public companies usually pay dividends on a fixed schedule, but may declare a dividend at any time, sometimes called a special dividend to distinguish it from the fixed schedule dividends. Cooperatives, on the other hand, allocate dividends according to members' activity, so their dividends are often considered to be a pre-tax expense.

If they are their own boss but managing another persons money then they can get a percentage value of the profit made on the share.
I can also imagine a case where you say you want to invest a certain amount of money and the stock broker then invests it at your direction (or not) and then gets paid a set amount of money wether you loose or make money on those stocks. 

&gt; what causes a stock to rise?
&gt; how are investors making money off this?

Stocks rise and fall depending solely on what people think its worth. 

Example: You buy  1 company x share in january at 100 dollars this share might now has a chance to pay you 1 dollars in dividends per year. IN june the company x announces a new product. Some other stock broker could now decide that the company share price might go over 200 dollars once the product is fully released. So if he thinks that he might now offer you 120 dollars.   So you have to then decide wether its worth it going for the 20 dollars in guaranteed profit or whether you want to wait it out and risk your current profit for potentially greater profit in the future.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1389497010.0,"I was skeptical about the 1 in 10 million myself (700 people is tiny, and in all fairness, doctors aren't *that* far up there in the top 1%), so I decided to work out the numbers myself.

The average endocrinologist living in a major metropolis in the USA actually makes slightly less than **250k** annually. This is including bonus. (You can check more localized numbers through payscale, salary.com, or any number of other resources).

As a single filer, that puts him at around the 1% percentile in the US.

There's roughly 22-23 times more people in the world than there are people in the US. We round that up for the most liberal estimate possible.

If we assumed everyone in the rest of the world outside the US was too poor to contest (not true, but close enough), that would put him at the top 0.044%... roughly within the top **0.05%** in the world.

Not bad, but honestly, these things should be localized for comparisons, due to cost of living and other relativistic considerations.

250k isn't going to look as impressive in Manhattan or the Silicon Valley where you actually can bump into young entrepreneurs who happen to be multi-millionaires, on the street, daily.

Note that that higher salary comes with many more years of schooling (less time to save, more debt, less opportunity for investing, less 401k/IRA accrual, etc), so becoming a doctor isn't usually the best financial decision. The people I know who became doctors did so also for the status/prestige and *even* the genuine desire to care for people's health. 

It also depends on what kind of doctor. A family doctor gets paid around 200k or even less. An anaesthesiologist can easily go over **400k+**.

All that being said, I agree with the sentiment that top commentor women are just being hostile towards the OP. There obviously will be status-seekers and gold-diggers who go after doctors. It doesn't have to be ""old money""; it's not like 250k is a drop in the bucket.

Lower down the comment chain though, some of them make a fair enough point. E.g.

&gt; A lot of men with a lot of money date women simply because the women are beautiful. When you don't bother to look for people with good character, you're likely to spend time with people of bad character.

Even people here would agree with that."

Misanthropy-Divine,introvert,1389497114.0,"I withheld from commenting on your previous post, but having read this with the other post fresh in my mind, I'm going to tell you what happened to me when I went back-and-forth with a girl for a long time: I became her yo-yo and her emotional tampon until she eventually slammed the door in my face and crushed any hopes of getting ""back"" with her, I suppose (we were a thing for about two months, but she sabotaged that one as well). I stopped all communication with her shortly thereafter, and we haven't spoken in almost two years. I plan on keeping it that way.

This girl is doing something very similar -- she's leading you on, and she knows she is.

Don't you find it convenient that she didn't start talking to you again until after she'd broken up with her boyfriend (the one she snubbed you for, if I'm understanding your story correctly)? Don't you think it's odd that her first words to you in at least a month are ""Sorry for not talking with you more"", like you're a plant that she forgot about watering for a couple weeks? Don't you find it at all interesting that all of your friends *and* all of her friends thought you two looked like you had a budding relationship, even though she was insistent that you two were just going ""as friends""?

Don't make the same mistake I did. As warm and fuzzy as she might make you feel, that emotion is *not* reciprocated. If it was, your homecoming night would have been totally different, and you would be the boyfriend in this picture, not the guy she just dumped. She does not want a relationship with you, so why torture yourself and settle for being this girl's yo-yo?

NOTE: This is not to say that I don't think guys and girls can be friends -- my best friend is a fantastic young woman, and a couple other very good friends of mine are also female. I just don't see that dynamic at work here; instead, I see the dynamic that was at work between me and who I can only refer to as my ""ex"": playing along that line between friendship and something more, only to push you away when she has a different target, only to bring you back when that fails, back and forth until she either tires of you or you break contact altogether."

BuildMyPaperHeart,AskWomen,1389497213.0,"I see concepts being thrown around like ""sexism"" and ""double standards,"" and that's scary to me since I'm certain neither is the case (for good men, anyway). The following is my opinion:

It's actually about ego.

Girls want to be *ours* for a reason. We want to be the best, the greatest, most awesome man you've ever known. We want to be your world, consume your heart, and occupy your mind. Those words may be off-putting, but it's how we feel and we mean that in the best way possible. *Of course* we don't actually want to ""own"" you, and you're not our property. What we're trying to say is that sense of exclusivity, and mutual bond only 2 people out of 7,000,000,000 share, validates us as a good husband, lover, father, etc.

So when a woman's had a lot of relationships in the past, or many previous sexual partners, that sense of ""ownership"" (a better word should be ""exclusivity"") is seemingly gone. Suddenly, he's not ""the one,"" he's ""the next one."" Maybe he'll be the last, win her heart, find love, have a family, happily ever after and such. But to some of us, that is intimidating. Rather than being a first lover and working things out as they go along, it's now a competition to be better as sex, love, intimacy, trust, and everything else compared to previous partners. It has nothing to do with the woman, actually; it's just a man's ego in trying to one-up the other men who have had the chance of being with you.

Again, many of the potentially off-putting words are used to explain the strong feelings some guys have on love, and not to suggest actual ownership of or intolerance towards women. It's literally just mental sabotage we do to ourselves, based on the stigma of being a man and trying to be better than others. Not all of us are action heroes, lifesavers, or expert romancers. **If there's one thing we want to be good at, *it's loving you.* If you haven't had a lot of experience, it's easy to make it up as we go along, as love should be. But if you've had a lot of partners, then suddenly how much we love you is more thing we have to prove.**"

That sums up why I got married, and why I am stoked to be married. We had been living together for 3 years, together a total of 5 when were were married. I'm Baha'i, he's Wiccan. I fix things around the house, he cooks. We both hate cleaning, but we do it anyway. Kids are in our future, but not right now. We still can't afford to live where we live without roommates (we work in the arts). All in all our marriage is unconventional but: I fucking love it. 

I love calling him husband, I love the stability, I love that my parents consider him a son, I love it when people call me Mrs [his last name] even though I kept mine.

I don't think that marriage is for everyone, but I also don't think that marriage is a one size fits all. You have to customize it for yourself.

I think the crux of marriage lies in the fact that you don't ""break up,"" you have to ""divorce."" For me that means that if we get into a fight I know that we will both work on ourselves. 

And having enough money is bullshit. I don't think that should be a prerequisite. That presupposes that money is the goal in your life, and it shouldn't be. Happiness should be, and if getting married makes you happy, then go for it. However you want. 

Also: tax breaks, hospital room visits, [there are tons of legal benefits from marriage](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/marriage-rights-benefits-30190.html).

I really wish they would have brought in people who really understand Halo at the deepest level. Guys like ChaosTheory, are on another level in that regard.

Either way it's an improvement, though. I just hope that these guys will take it upon themselves to look for exploits and broken mechanics and abuse them to the point that they **have** to be fixed. If they get things like that out of the way in play testing, then we'll get a good game **at launch**, which this series desperately needs and hasn't had since Halo 1."

When you say they talk a lot more and return your texts faster, it could be that it's just easier to talk to you now. Like, it's easier to ask how being a doctor is like, the stress, etc. Easier to start a convo.

1. We can't be compared to animals in a pack because *all* animals that must hunt for survival *will*. They may take turns killing each day, but not a single one of them would refuse to kill because it made them feel queasy.

2. Sure, you don't have the time - a lot of people don't, but OP's original statement wasn't about how time-consuming and tiring it is to hunt your own food, it was in regards to humans being unable to do so for whatever reason (nausea, lack of skill, etc.).

&gt;Your problem isn't that I don't want to kill animals myself. Your problem is simply that you think killing animals so I can eat flesh is unethical

I feel a person can believe both at the same time; that is to say one could think that eating meat is unethical and also that those who cannot kill for themselves are hypocritical if they eat meat. Believing that eating meat is unethical doesn't make the other belief/theory any less valid."

Wait for the price to drop, buy it all up, wait for the price to rise, dump it all for profit. The prices will rise and fall, hovering around a basic number. Say, cloth; on my server it hovers around 2g per each. So I watch; if someone posts a bunch at 1.5g each, I grab it up. At some point the bottom is going to rise to about 2.5g, and then I post all of my stock.

It's not sexy, but it's sound. Much more reliable than buying a t-mog item for 4000g and trying to flip it for 7000.

Seconding! 

After having my son, I started experiencing difficulties using tampons. It was like I healed *too well*; every tampon I put in hurt, and with certain brands, I'd actually start pushing it out over time unconsciously. Imagine being in the checkout line of the grocery store with a tampon about half an inch out of your vagina and the rest in. *Yeah*; not fun.

A trip to Costco left me choosing between Tampax Pearls and Kotex U Sleeks. I grabbed the Sleeks, since the Pearls were giving me trouble. **OMAGAWD.** There's no better word to describe the difference. I never thought I'd be writing a review for a tampon, but seriously. *Holy crap.* I know they're mean for tweens, but these are the best tampons I've ever used. No, they don't hold as much, but the tradeoff is fine by me. They don't hurt going in, the applicator is nice and long so I can really *get it up in there*, and I don't push them out. They offer them in higher absorbency, so I don't need to swap out for monster tampons on heavier days."

There won't be a lot of difference between the two. I doubt it'd be noticable. For that matter, I doubt there's much a difference between these OC editions to a sub-$200 270x.

The Sapphire Toxic is $250 from what I saw while the Powercooler Devil is $230. If you're set on one of these, the Powercooler is the obvious choice. However, for between $230-$250, you could grab a GTX 760 instead which would have better performance.

Sure, you put a lot of work into the character and it's early in the game, but it seems more of a disservice to a character to ignore its leanings and needs in favor of the needs of the player. And even in terms of the work of characterization, you may find another context in another game where it would make more sense to play your character's personality than in your current game, so it's not like you have to shun this character forever just because you want to move on. 

And honestly I'd rather a character leave because of an actual roleplaying reason than just because of the typical ""please kill my character it bores me to tears"" type of thing that happens more frequently. Now that you have a feel for your party and the style of campaign, you get the opportunity to roll something new that fits your purposes better for this situation, which doesn't make any negative comment on your current/previous character's depth or value.

&gt;Bone represents an important site of buffering acid load. An acid load, is associated with the uptake of excess H+ ions by bone which occurs in exchange for surface Na+ and K+ and by the dissolution of bone mineral, resulting in the release of buffer compounds, such as NaHCO3, CaHCO3, and CaHPO4.

&gt;t has been estimated that at least 40% of the buffering of an acute acid load takes place in bone. Chronic acidosis can have very adverse effects on bone mineralization due to this process and can result in bone diseases such as rickets, osteomalacia and osteopenia.

http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Acid_Buffering.html

&gt;We conclude that excessive dietary protein from foods with high potential renal acid load adversely affects bone, unless buffered by the consumption of alkali-rich foods or supplements.

You can excrete more urinary calcium than you consume when you drink a glass of milk.

To answer your question about dairy intake, countries with very low dairy intake also have low rates of osteoporosis.

Random quote from random article about study.  Feel free to take a look and see if you feel if it has merit:

&gt;Growing evidence is showing that calcium in milk does not protect against osteoporosis. For example in a 12-year Harvard study of 78,000 women, those who drank milk three times a day actually broke more bones than women who rarely drank milk. Similarly, a 1994 study in Sydney, Australia, showed that higher dairy product consumption was associated with increased fracture risk: those with the highest dairy consumption had double the risk of hip fracture compared to those with the lowest consumption.

&gt;Author Russell Eaton says: 'Dairy milk does increase bone density, but this comes at a terrible price. The latest research is showing that far from protecting bones, milk actually increases the risk of osteoporosis by eroding bone-making cells. Also, people with osteoporosis have a much higher incidence of heart disease and cancer, and the evidence is pointing at milk as the common factor. '
I have done more fully researched posts on this in the past, I wish I had a better way of organizing my info.  Let me know if there were parts of your questions that were still left.

Note to everyone else reading this:

1. These studies/text quotes were chosen quickly to demonstrate that: a. the type of research that is done.  b. Provide links to other studies. c. As a jumping off point if you would like to continue further research on your own. 

2. I am in no way affiliated with this research.  If you have a problem with the methodology, sampling, statistics or if you would just like to point out that ""correlation does not equal causation"" please contact the authors directly.

3. I understand the pros and cons of epidemiological studies.

4. Yes, there will be other research out there that I am sure says the exact opposite.  I just found one of these papers.  It was sponsored by the ""Protein Summit.""  A good thing to do is to look at MANY studies and find general consensus, bias, etc.  

5. This is in no way a complete, fully researched discussion on the topic.  It is a reply to a question on the Internet.  I could cobble together a 100 page lit review with full citations, but I rather get another beer and click on ""random"" subreddit instead."

Haha, made me chuckle! 

Yeah with wolf hybrids it is really hit or miss because you really never know if you will get more of the wild wolf genes or the domesticated dog genes. When Orion was a puppy our then neighbor had a huge wolf hybrid who was the sweetest thing ever, he'd let Orion crawl all over him and play with him all submissively. The (idiot) owner actually hated that because he thought he was getting a tough, vicious semi-wild animal when he was getting the hybrid. 

Now the two at the dog park were brothers, both intact (which doesn't generally bother me) but they saw Orion as someone who was on ""their"" territory so they wouldn't leave him alone even though he was doing his best to ignore them. "

TheEviltane,NoStupidQuestions,1389498518.0,"Well  basically anything alive in that lake would die immediately or within a few minutes. (i don't think any organism can survive being immersed in mercury. 
Next all the plant life would also perrish (from what i have read high enough dosage of mercury will kill anything.)

Next all the water reservoirs in the surrounding area would also be contaminated by the mercury and it would again proceed to kill anything as long as its concentration is high enough. 
Some of the  mercury would then also be forced into the connecting lakes and rivers down stream. Its obvious the same amount of killing would go on down stream as the mercury that makes it there gets thinned out.
Over time the mercury that can run off will but that which cant since its heavier then water will pool at the bottom creating PERMA DEATH!

One thing thats interesting I thing is that This would be a fairly large amount of extra weight and what that could do

1 cubic meter of water weighs 1 000 kg
1 cubic meter of mercury weighs 13,534.00 kg

Lake superior has 12 000 000 cubic meter water volume according to wikipedia  so it weighs  12 000 000 000 kgs  if you multiply that volume by  by the weight of mercury the lake now weighs 1 578 408 000 000 kg (by god someone pls verify my math i fear i screwed up my 0s).  Such a sudden and massive shift of weight might have some very interesting consequences beyond even the pure change in the erths gravitational field. Hell this might really cause the wobble that people were afraid of when the 3 gorges dam opened in china which is a fraction of the proposed weight. "

sw1n3flu,woahdude,1389498709.0,"DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert, just an enthusiast who likes to learn about this kind of stuff. Take the following with a grain of salt.

We cannot comprehend the 4th dimension because we are 3 dimensional creatures. Also, there are possibly infinite dimensions, and for each of them we apply the same principle: The first dimension lies on a single line. If you take a length of that line, it is the basic 1 dimensional object. If you take that line and multiply it by itself, you get a square. That is the basis of the 2nd dimension. And if you take a square and multiply it by that line (a length of it's sides) you get a cube, the basic object of the 3rd dimension. And if you take a cube and multiply it by the line, or one side of the cube, you get the basic object of the 4th dimension, a tesseract. Our universe ""exists"" in the 3rd dimension, but if a 4 dimensional object were to enter it we would be able to see a 3 dimensional representation of it. Think about it this way: if you take a flat plane and slowly move a cone through it, the only part visible to a 2 dimensional thing on the plane is a circle, and as the cone moves through it the circle gets smaller and smaller because the tip of the cone is skinnier than the base. So a being in the 2nd dimension cannot comprehend a 3 dimensional object, but it can picture it moving through the 2nd dimension. (now there isn't anything *in* the 2nd dimension because everything has depth, but this is theoretical.)If a 4 dimensional object moves through the 3rd dimension, we would see a 3 dimensional ""shadow"" of the object. A 4 dimensional being would also be able to see in 3 dimensions. We can only see in 2 dimensions, our eyes send a flat image to our brains, although because we have 2 eyes we can sort of see in 3d (but not really). A 4 dimensional object could comprehend a 3d object in a way that we cannot picture, it would see it from every angle, inside it, and know everything about it, however it would not be able to see in the 4th dimension. Only a 5 dimensional being (or higher) can see in the 4th dimension, but lets not get into that. Now I have no idea if anything actually ""exists"" in the 4th dimension, at least not in this universe, but it is there.

TLDR: the 4th, 5th, 6th, etc dimensions have all been proven mathematically, but we cannot comprehend them because we live in the 3rd dimension. Also its possible that nothing exists in the other dimensions."

It usually will eventually be able to stretch the whole way back with a bit of practice, and lube.  Once every two days seemed to do the trick for me, 2 months later it could go all the way back, and a year on, it's a lot looser and very comfortable.

If you can fix it naturally, it's worth it.  I remain a very sensitive guy, and although I can't speak from a 'cut' person's point of view, I'm very happy with my decision."

So there is this group called the Silver Hand that they are at war with.  Silver Hand hunts werewolves - it's all they do.  Is there anything wrong with a group that dedicates themselves to hunting werewolves?  If not, then why are the Companions at war with them?

You got the leader of the Companions, and he believes he can't go to Nord heaven unless he is cured.  Is he wrong?  Right or wrong, the other companions perform the ritual for him.  Are they wrong to do that?

There are clear-cut moral issues with the Companions.  AND they know it. 

&lt;/spoilers&gt;


Since before the game even came out people have been alll over the internet saying ""How do I become a werewolf in Skyrim!?"" and everybody has been telling them ""Join the Companions, and if you play your cards right they will make you one.""

I've lied to my SO about my jobs, where I work, and that I'm actually just after him for his $$.  

Oh and I never had an ectopic pregnancy. 

Obviously this is 100% false. You can pop my name into the Collage of Nurse's website and I come up as a licensed and registered nurse. My education is pubic record, and I've spent the last 2 years supporting my SO as he finished university. 

As for my Ectopic pregnancy, apparently she has access to my OBGYN files?? God I was so freaking sick afterwards, and I went to visit his parents, that I passed out on the couch (apparently this is a deadly sin, anywhoo) and basically didn't move the whole weekend, but clearly I didn't have an ectopic pregnancy *eye roll*. 

I just find it mind baffling that his sister can actually argue with my SO that she knows everything about me when she's met me a total of four times, and that his mother is naive enough to believe every lie his sister spews.

anonlymouse,rpg,1389499153.0,"&gt; How is GURPS ""poor at telling any particular type of story""? That's a big claim you're making without any support.

Because it has nothing in its design that's suited to telling stories. Everything is built around simulating actions. You can make up stories within the GURPS framework, sure, but you can do that playing Dope Wars or Gran Turismo too.

&gt;In my opinion, FATE isn't a ""pretty bad reality simulator"" - it's not a reality simulator at all. It's a narrative simulator, and the creators put that on front street pretty hard in the rulebook. You yourself say it meets your stringent requirements for being at least competent at telling a story, so I think it's safe to assume right there that FATE has accomplished its own mission and doesn't need to worry about physics simulation, which it specifically designates as being not its concern.

No, it doesn't accomplish it well. It's so restrictive in how you tell the story that while it lets you tell *a* story, it doesn't let you tell the story you want to tell.

&gt;I'm not sure your understanding of FATE is the same as mine. I was under the impression that the system specifically tells you that all aspects are always true, e.g. if there is an oil slick all over a zone, the GM can decide that oil slick makes movement difficult for all characters in that zone, and therefore require an Overcome action into or out of that zone.

Nope, you have to spend a FATE point for a tag after the first free one (or two if you're lucky) to have any story element mechanically affect the game in any way.

&gt;What are the restrictive aspects of FATE you're referring to?

You have to spend resources to do what you can do by default in other RPGs.

&gt;but what, exactly, does any of this have to do with my initial assertion that FATE ""does everything, and really easily""?

FATE doesn't do everything, and the things it does do, it doesn't do really easily. It's just a completely factually inaccurate statement."

If you still live with your parents, keep your board in your room if your worried they are going to confiscate it (they shouldn't do this to your property as your 22, but some parents are like that), and even just to prevent people from falling / tripping on it on accident.  

I suggest you watch Braille Skateboarding's tutorials, that's the name of the YouTube channel, the guy who gives the tutorials (Aaron Kyro) is really good and gives them in a well presented manner that is easy to understand and well planned.

The nickel boards are pretty good for cruising around and stuff, but if you want to really do some tricks, after you get balance down on that you should go for a regular deck with concave and a nose and tail, there are a lot more trick options on those.  

You can still pull off some old school tricks with the nickel boards though, it just takes a lot of patience and practice.  

The key to skateboarding is persistence, just keep at it and you will get better.  And the more you do it and get into skating the more your parents will recognize it as more of a lifestyle and (hopefully) will become more understanding of it as an art and passion.  "

It's crazy and frustrating. And when you try to refuse to bring them that ice cream/pudding/graham crackers/pepsi because their blood sugar is in the 400's, they get angry and defensive.

All this argument from others is just to make you aware that using terminology as ""doesn't exist or will ever exist"" or comparing a rational argument to invisible pink unicorns is ridiculous and dangerously close to making you seem ""a hallmark of foolishness"" and ""blind to the world"". If nothing else, it raises the question of how rational one is to make the comparison in the first place.

A little hyperbole is acceptable in much of society, but outright bigotry is not. I found your original comment closer to the acceptable side, but these replies make it seem more the latter. I don't expect you to change your view on circumcision - it's mostly sound imo - and I don't think you're irrational, but simply be aware of how you come across in this conversation."
ShmifandWeshun,knifeclub,1389499454.0,"If you want a folding knife, I'd suggest you not get a folding knife.

If you *have* to get one, get a **Strider SNG** or an **SMF**, a **Benchmade 275**, or a **Spyderco Tuff**.

For a fixed blade, I'd get something in 3V or D2 steel if you want something really tough, and since you are on the ocean, you want something that's coated since high carbon steel rusts fairly easy.  A coated 3V blade is sometimes hard to come by.  I'd go with a **Benchmade 375**, an **ESEE 5**, a **Strider DB-L**, a **Zero Tolerance 0100**, or a **Survive! GSO 5.1** with a coated blade.

Taking ALL personal beliefs and food preferences out of the equation, I think everyone who prides themselves on being a rational person can agree that eating meat is not necessary for us to live. Yes, some may like the taste. Yes, every person is different and maybe some would be healthier with the consumption of certain meats. Regardless, nobody would *die*. No one.

If someone requires open heart surgery, I'm fairly certain they wouldn't live without receiving it. They may live for a while longer but when that diagnosis is given, it's serious. I don't think you can refuse open heart surgery if you need it and still have a high quality of life.

My friend is obese and she was making chili dogs for her (obese) younger cousins. My friend's sister and I were the only average-weight people, and we each got **one** chili dog. However, my friend served each kid **two** chili dogs, with cheese on top, and two handfuls of chips, each. I quietly said ""hey do you really think they need two?"" And of course she got really mad and was like ""*they're growing boys! what are you trying to say??""

If your assignment offers you the liberty, you might consider filling in the harmony with an additional voice or composing a descant for one of the trumpets. 

Unfortunately I'm not at all a brass person so I can't really think of anything off-hand that would be a particularly good example.

If she wakes me up accidentally, so what? I've done it to her as well.

Create and sign a roommate agreement together. My university requires this and it can help smooth over some tensions. Make sure you discuss lights on/off, what the room's primary purpose is to you (for some it's sleeping, others make studying in their room a priority). This includes guests! No one should get locked out of their own room. If you don't agree on everything, try and find a way to compromise.

It's going to take a little while for you two to get used to living together. My roommate and I were very polite and respectful of each other's space during our first year together (and still are!). I think I've lucked out, her and I get along really well and she's one of my greatest friends.

I agree, you don't need to partake in the production of a product to enjoy using it. I feel OP's statement may be stemming from frustration with those who go on and on about how we are smarter, tougher, and more evolved than the animals we eat and therefore we have a right to eat them, yet have never hunted a day in their lives, and don't actually have any clue of what it truly entails.

Aul√´ is the smith, with qualities of creation and order.  He even gets into his own trouble with the creation of the dwarves.  Both Sauron and Saruman love the machinery we see in the movies as it enables them to progress towards their own creations: Urak-hai and the rings of power.

We have to remember that Sauron is not inherently evil; when Melkor was overthrown Sauron was legitimately sorry for what he did his lieutenant but just didn't show up for punishment day due to sheer fear (a cowardly quality but something I think we can all relate to.)  

I wouldn't say Saruman was foolish in wanting the ring for power to be bad but for power to create.  Much like Sauron wanting the ring for the power to have order (by destroying all other opposing forces.) It just seems those qualities as opposed to living with what is are troublesome in the middle-earth universe. As seen by Sauron, Saruman and Aule. "

Life-in-Death,vegan,1389500342.0,"The main question here is why do you want to go vegan?  If I want to be a pilot, I am not going to let our evolutionary past of slow, terrestrial movement from stopping me.  Nor will I let the radical change it will take to go to flight school, etc. to achieve my dream, even if this did mean not going out every night, giving up on other career paths, etc.

All of your questions can be easily answered, but consider: are these the questions that are really meaningful to you?  

But, to answer your questions:
&gt;is there a convincing argument against the idea that we should continue eating the way we have in our evolutionary past?

Well, there better be, because we in no way eat how we used to in our past.  We eat food that is from all over the world, not just what would grow in our native area.  We have selectively bred food to the point where they have nothing in common with their predecessors.
http://nicolecooks.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/f2104.jpg  We raise cattle and subsist off of large quantities of meat.  We bake, we fortify, we process and package.  You mention you love cheese.  Cheese is in no way a prehistoric food.  Drinking milk is super-recent, most humans don't even have the ability to break down lactose.  

No one denies that humans evolved eating any food they could find, including meat, however ""teeth"" is one of the worst ways to indicate this trait.  My favorite image on this: http://www.renovegans.com/media/images/ex/animal_rights/why_vegan/canine-v.-human.png

The most convincing argument along this biological line is how does the health of meat eating humans fare as composed to non-meat eating.  The vegans are far healthier in every aspect and live longer.  So even if morality wasn't an issue, eating vegan is obviously something that works for us as humans.

&gt;do you guys ever find it difficult to maintain your vegan diets?  

No, not at all actually.  And I loved meat and cheese!  I do live in NYC which does have tons of vegan options, both restaurants and grocery, so I know that makes it easier.  If ever I don't find a good option, which is very rare, my response is irritation at the venue for being so limited, not at veganism.

Almost every craving/sensation you get from meat and cheese can be pretty closely replicated.  There is a new cheese coming out.  It is to die for!  http://www.treelinecheese.com/  (This is an eating, not melting cheese, by the way.)  There is also a new product called Beyond Eggs coming out that replicates scrambled eggs to a T.  For now tofu scramble and quiches are divine.  All my omni friends love them!  Shoes and stuff are easy.  You would be surprised how many shoes are accidentally vegan.  Just look for ""all man-made materials""  But don't freak yourself out with everything at first.  Especially when you move beyond the food part, it is definitely a learning curve.

If you have any other questions, comments, etc. I would love to hear.  Good luck!

Lolno. Just like saying ""In my experience with the men of /r/short, they are bitter"" or the ""men of /r/short are bitter"" is not sexist.

The women I get into conflicts with may respond in similar ways, but that does not say anything about all women (or most of them). There are women I have never had a conflict with, and they have different responses, usually because, in my experience, they are level-headed enough to be willing to discuss things in a civil way before it gets to the conflict stage."

The whole essence of their existence revolves around shopping to try to take their minds off their own emptiness, making fun of other people to try to improve their own shitty self-esteem, and ultimately ending the day with that bottle of Merlot, a handful of Prozac, and a husband that doesn't give a crap about them either.

keakealani,musictheory,1389500518.0,"To approach things from another angle, I think an important mechanism for understanding classical music is to understand the history from whence it came. Everything we consider part of the ""common practice era"" (17th-19th centuries roughly) is part of a larger history that spans all the way back at least to medieval chant if not even earlier such as the early music theorists in classical Greece. 

So I would start with some reading about the history of Western music, such as [A History of Western Music](http://www.wwnorton.com/college/music/grout7/home.htm) (which I used in my music history classes and think is a great overview to topics from the medieval era to the 20th century). It can be really helpful to understand music through the processes that evolved over time, whether it's the development of polyphony or the solidification of functional harmony or the evolution of chromaticism. 

Beyond that, I think the gist of understanding and appreciating music are the same for classical as for jazz, except maybe a slight difference in approach. Listen to some pieces, identify what you like (or don't like), and take the time to analyze and make connections about the things that are going on within the piece. As you undoubtedly know from your jazz background, it takes a lot of experience to be able to do so in real time. This is the reason transcription is advocated so heavily in jazz and pop styles, but as others have pointed out, transcription is unnecessary for most classical music where scores are readily available. Instead, the experience is gained through a conscientious analysis of the written work which can then help you identify and analyze other incidences of the same types of patterns when you encounter them in the future.

You found the post offensive and rather than contacting the mods (as I did) you went off on a rant about how bad this sub is etc.  I tried to point this out as being somewhat counter-productive and basically pointless.

&gt;Though I find this post really offensive, I commented on it because I found it really stupid.

2. How far in advance do you want to be notified of a potential overnight guest? How will you be notified?
3. What parts of your room are shared (fridge, microwave, sink, etc?)
4. What parts of your room are not shared? (bed, desk, etc).
5. Rank the importance of these activities that may occur in your room  (sleeping, socializing, studying). 
6. What substances are you comfortable having in the room (drugs/alcohol)?

These are just a few things, and most are not set in stone (like lights on/off). It's really up to you two to decide what's most important. Think about some of the issues you had with your old roommate, and make sure to address things you would be uncomfortable with.

197mmCannon,software,1389500850.0,"First off thank you very much for your extremely in-depth response. You have surpassed all expectations of what I expected from this. I tried replying back the same day but I accidentally closed the window out after typing a very long response and didn't have the energy at the time to retype. First week of classes and kids has been rough on me this week.


Last semester was ""systems analysis and design"" class where we made use cases and such. We learned how to make a data dictionary and use case diagrams, site diagrams, gannt charts, etc.


This semester we are supposed to make and implement the system and the client will pick her favorite and actually use it for her business.


So even though a lot of the suggestions you gave were technically already done last semester you did post some new ideas and since my group was supposed to have a meet-up where we hammer out the ""getting started"" part I had planned on going over a lot of this with them.


Then one person ended up having to stay at work late so asked if he could just join by hangout so when I said yes, everyone decided to just join by hangout. So we had a hangout conversation in which we went over design challenges and how to solve them.


We have tentatively decided to use Windows Azure to go forward, mostly because the only programming language the entire group has experience with is C#, but after the session ended I looked up Azure web hosting and now I am worried that it may be too expensive for her.


Which brings to me a question you had, which was on the clients existing technical support. They have none. The client is a non-profit organization that currently is only one person with volunteer college students serving as case managers. She is hoping that this system will improve the potential case load of the organization (the only one of its kind in our area) which will hopefully lead to more donations / grants so she can pay case managers.


The organization currently does everything by email, paper, filing cabinet, and excel. They want a system to replace almost all of that. They interact with the local government so a certain amount of physical paperwork is unavoidable. The college student volunteers are usually pretty tech savvy but she has other volunteers like counselors who have trouble figuring out email and drop box.


The system needs to work without the need of tech support. Features like access control needs to be easily handled by the system admin. She won't have any tech support unless it's provided by the hosting company or by volunteers.


And speaking of hosting. She currently has a free wordpress site and is only paying the yearly domain name ownership fee. I am worried that she will have a bit of sticker shock that her ""free"" case management system is going to cost her at least a few dollars per month, if not more.


I am hoping to get in contact with her soon to let her know exactly what this entails and see how far she is willing to go.


What are your thoughts on Azure versus other options? You mentioned MSF but I don't know if your familiar with this particular solution. "

BarelyLethal,vegetarian,1389500997.0,"Idk what to tell you except to just do it. I did and never looked back. It wasn't a deal for me, but your experience could be different. It was not a ""life change"" for me. It's just one ingredient that is the change. (not literally) It's just that now I make vegetable pot pie instead of chicken pot pie and when I get fast food it's taco bell sub beans for meat and veggie burgers at Burger King. Think about it. Is it going to kill you to eat your spaghetti without meatballs or your pizza without pepperoni? Take a minute to think about what you eat and what you like. With minimal preparation and a little discipline you can do this.

What to expect really depends on your situation. Do you live with others? If so you won't, or shouldn't, rely on them to cook you something special. It sounds like you like food so explore different cultures of vegetarian food. 

Sometimes my extended family give me shit about being a veg and I find the best way to handle is to just not react and to answer their questions calmly with short replies:

""Why don't you eat meat?""

""I like animals more than I like the way they taste."" Who wouldn't want to hug fluffy bunnies?


Also, don't make a big deal about it to your family. If I were you I would not make any announcement AT ALL. It's a personal matter and really none of their business. I would only mention it casually in a related situation. 


I am in a relationship with a meat eater and there is the tiniest bit of friction about it. I never say anything but I'm disappointed he doesn't share my values. He is very nice, though, and when we cook he never expects meat. I like to think I extend my vegetarianism out to him by cooking with/for him. I wouldn't want to control him, though."

Learning math in smaller chunks lets you spend some time to look at the material, do some practice problems, and then ask questions the next class.  If you have one class, you're trying to absorb nearly three hours of material all at once.  This sucks.

Wyboth,AskReddit,1389501187.0,"No, it really isn't. There's no punchline, other than domestic violence, and that in and of itself is the opposite of funny. You can try to defend it as ""it's just a joke"" (and I'm sure you will), but the problem with that is it makes actual wife-beaters feel justified. They believe that all men beat their wives and just do a better job of hiding it. If a real wife-beater reads that joke, his view about all other men beating their wives will be reinforced. Also, there's no way to know if /u/way_fairer is being sarcastic and is against wife-beating, or if he is a wife-beater himself. We wouldn't want to support his ""joke"" if he was, would we? Finally, dismissing the sexist overtones of something because ""it's just a joke"" effectively disables a person's firewall against sexism and makes them slightly more sexist without them even knowing it. If you don't say ""that's a terrible, sexist thing to do"" when you hear something like that and just laugh at it, you're opening yourself up to harmful sexism.

Of course, this is all giving you the benefit of the doubt that you're against sexism."

Cut it or Don't.

If you don't want to cut it, then just get yourself some product, and put it in your hair. Only a little bit, because you just want something that will give the hair some weight. 

My hair is just like yours when I shower, and I always put product in my hair after I'm done so it doesn't poof like that. 

Note: I don't even really style my hair when I do this, I just get it in there to give it weight. 

Now if you do want to cut it, then you have more options. I always suggest an undercut for your type of hair, but if you talk with a hairstylist, they'll be able to consult you with more options.

the second reason is that at the first alarm, i can let myself know that ""you still have one more hour to sleep"" which makes me feel good.  sometimes that last hour isnt as fitful, because having woken up there is a part of me that is afraid i missed my alarm and keeps jolting up, but that does not always happen.  it's like i get to trick my brain into thinking im letting myself sleep in, so that im more amenable to waking up later.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389501256.0,"It's not, as you can probably imagine with my references to Mill and his works ""on liberty"", I'm not against liberty. But the essence of the social contract is to sacrifice some of your liberty so you can enjoy the rest of it. Libertarianism leads to immature liberty. It's a childish liberty, rebellious against government in the same way children rebel against their parents. Especially in regard to property. It seems to forget that we live in an interconnected society and how we structure things and our actions DO affect others. You can't have an economy with one person alone. Actions affect others, actions benefit some, harm others. libertarianism is a system of letting the cards fall where they may, even though this often favors the rich and powerful who have the most property. Property is power. property is liberty. I can't understand how one can be truly free if the system is structured for people more or less selling themselves for their basic sustenance. This is not true freedom. THis is a form of modern serfdom with slightly better philosophical justification of it.

Even then, I;'m not totally against one selling his labor, it's necessary for society to function quite frankly, but it's a topic of discussion that needs to be subject to strict rules regarding how much people are paid, under what conditions they can work, and perhaps people should also be entitled to some property for themselves. Becuase otherwise, liberty is meaningless, it's just the freedom to starve or choose your masters. You see, to achieve true freedom for all, we need to REGULATE how our economy works, and perhaps redistribute wealth as well. This is the only way people are truly free to pursue their own happiness."

Riali,ABraThatFits,1389501374.0,"&gt; in my head it's a pretty big imperfection

This was kinda my point.  It's in your head.  If you can get to the place in your head where it's not such a big deal, you'll really feel a lot better.  It's not a matter of not giving a shit, or being at an age where it doesn't figure in your lifestyle anymore, just a matter of prioritizing which issues are worth your worry. I know, I know, easier said than done, but really, worth the effort, I promise.  And that effort begins with not obsessing.  With accepting that it's not the shape you would most like, but that there's nothing you can do about it, (Well, barring a huge, expensive, invasive surgery.)  so you might as well just make the best of it.  If even approaching this mindset seems impossible to you, and your self worth is so tied up in the issue that you can't deal at all, then it is time to look at some counselling/therapy about the issue, because there are professionals who can help.

MGMA data is compiled from employers - mostly large employers; the data set is highly selected; compensation is not defined as 'wages' but in fact is inflated with all kinds of things; and many physicians in the US are still in small groups.  MGMA does this with an agenda in mind and it does not reflect the reality of medicine as it is practiced in the US; most physician associations suggest it not be used.
tastytoast,LifeProTips,1389501405.0,"Its not so much that lucid dreaming is the problem; that's a conscious choice to pursue imo. I'm talking about the prerequisite habit you have to get into of recognizing dreams states in order to lucid dream in the first place. 

I've always been a terrible sleeper. Had trouble quieting my mind. But, even if it took me a while to fall asleep I would still get a decent amount of solid hours. My mistake was learning to manipulate that thinking mind to recognize and brute force into dreams. I'm just going to assume most people dream throughout the night once they enter REM. But now it's not one glossy shadow of mismatched random memories once my conscious mind starts to wake up. Instead, I get my mind persistently trying recognize that dream state. Not with the purpose of manipulating it, just to recognize as it being unreal. So, as a crappy byproduct, I am constantly woken up by a barrage of extremely vivid dreams as they are brought to the forefront of my conscious mind. It's particularly frustrating. 

Sometimes it will dull, if I'm just pleasantly content. Happily neutral and not contemplating a damn thing. That doesn't happen often, but I am getting better at it. And, even if it this does have unfortunate byproducts as well, at least I'll still be pleasantly content ;)"

mmmmmbb,sex,1389501415.0,"It sounds like you need to spend more time on foreplay. The vagina expands with arousal, which makes penetration easier. Also, since she's used to things hurting at first, she may be tensing up unintentionally. Working on relaxation might be a good idea. 

Lube is great, but take some time to get her ready first. Also, what kind of lube are you using? Are you using condoms? Depending on what you're using, you can end up with different issues. 

Personally, I usually don't have more than one orgasm per session. It's usually really uncomfortable for me to continue after I orgasm - I start feeling extremely tight and weirdly enough, dry (although obviously I'm not). 

I have occasionally had multiples, and it was fun, but not earth-shakingly amazing. I've definitely had more memorable sessions! For me, sex is about the experience, not how many orgasms I can cram in. I'm sure there are lots of women who love having multiples, but I wouldn't say that it's something every woman is dying to do. Quality can definitely be better than quantity. Make sure *she* wants to pursue having multiple orgasms. Communication is definitely key. :)"

noiretor,changemyview,1389501439.0,"Hmm. I don't think it's necessarily about the ""end product"" in this situation. 

OP didn't say it, but as I mentioned in a different comment, I have a feeling OP is alluding to those who harp on and on about how we are the most evolved species, the toughest, the bravest, etc. and therefore of course deserve to eat animals ""beneath"" us, yet have never before hunted and aren't actually aware of what it truly involves. In *that* sense, I am with OP and believe those people are hypocrites.

However, there are those who don't make any such bold claims and just enjoy their meat without yapping about how stupid animals are and how amazing humans are. In fact, I've met many people who eat meat regularly and are in awe of those who can hunt and admire them greatly. I don't think they are hypocrites because they actually think about what they are saying and realise the process it takes for that meat to reach their plate (assuming we live in a world where the food actually *does* come from hunting, and not slaughterhouses - I'll join you on your hypothetical train, here).

Thjoth,Survival,1389501483.0,"I've posted about this before, and I'm not sure how ""offbeat"" this is, but I make what I call M(A)REs (for Meals Almost Ready to Eat).  The idea is to get simple, dry ingredients that you can boil until they're done within an hour or so, and place them in an airtight vacuum sealed bag.  I measure them out to contain 700 calories of the dry ingredients in the bag, because presumably you can add a fish or gathered items to it and bring it to a round thousand.  Because the ingredients are both dry and in vacuum sealed bags, they keep for a very long time, won't get wet or spoil in a pack in the elements, and are extremely compact while weighing practically nothing.

My normal M(A)RE setup is mostly rice, with some dehydrated vegetables and peppers, and half a bullion cube (usually chicken) for flavor (and to give you about half of your daily value of sodium per pack).  The dehydrated vegetables are mostly broccoli due to its nutritional content, but I usually include some peas, maybe a small number of soybeans, and a couple small pieces of dried peppers for flavor (and a little vitamin C).  Pair that up with a little pemmican and you've got complete nutrition, and you can carry enough in even a smallish 72 hour pack to last 4-5 days, and the only skill you really need is starting a fire, opening the package, and dumping it in a pot.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389501682.0,"Except we live in a society of differing ideas, so someone is gonna be forced to obey someone else's rules. It's just the way the world works. If you want unlimited liberty, the theory is you go back to the state of nature (even if this is impossible). You know...where you have to hunt for animals, live in caves, and probably die at a young age. Otherwise, the concept is you give up some of your liberty so you can enjoy the rest.

The thing is since i see the role of government is to enhance and protect well being, sometimes it is necessarily to regulate human interaction, and sometimes it's necessary or prudent to require people to pay a portion of their income so that all can benefit for the greater good. It's just how life is.

It's not a matter of me being anti liberty, but as I said in this or another post to you, it's a matter of libertarianism being an immature liberty. An unrealistic liberty. A liberty that is very harmful to people. I too think people should do whatever they want...but the caveat in that is that they should not harm others in doing so. The thing is, I don't limit that harm to active methods like guns, but passive methods like sstarvation too. The thing is, libertarianism justifies some pretty screwed up social structures that leads to the benefit of some, but the detriment of others. "

&gt;Not sure how that qualifies as ""racism"". I mean, it's mentioning a race, but it attributes no qualities to it.

I‚Ä¶ I've actually been on the other side of this.

I dated a black girl for a while. She didn't say it while we were fucking, but she did tell me she had ""always had a thing for white guys"" one time we were hanging out. And that she never thought she'd be dating one.

I'm usually pretty quick on my feet, but it was honestly such a weird thing to hear. I said, ""I do what I can,"" and changed the subject.

I wouldn't call it ""racist,"" either. But it is a bizarre thing to hear."

duckface08,AskWomen,1389501697.0,"I shared a dorm room with someone who was already my friend, and actually, we lived very well together and ended up sharing a student house with some others for the rest of our undergrad years and never had issues with each other. I can't say the same for the rest of my housemates, though.

* Discuss expectations and rules ASAP. Have it written down/typed out with both your signatures on it. It won't hold any legal ground, but at least it's something you can both agree on and refer back to should there be any problems down the line. Also, it's a good idea to get to know how the other person lives and what they expect and vice versa. Everyone lives differently. For example, some people are ok with some clutter, while others are not.
* Determine what can be shared and not shared. My friend and I agreed to share a carton of milk, for example, as it was more cost effective. I was also allowed to use her mini-fridge (no sense taking up even more space with a 2nd fridge).
* Keep the place clean! No one likes a dirty/stinky room, unless you're both slobs. What helped is that my roommate and I figured out a time in our weekly schedules that we were both free, and we would spend half an hour each week to clean together. Unless someone is allergic, a *very* light air freshener can work wonders. We used a couple spritzes of Febreeze over the carpet.
* This should go without saying but some people need to be reminded: maintain your own hygiene. No one likes a room that smells of BO. Thankfully, I never ran into this issue, but my roommate's boyfriend had this problem (one of his roommates did not shower regularly and their room smelled funky).
* Lights/noise. Ideally, you and your roommate will have similar sleeping times. Unfortunately, my roommate and I did not (I'm frequently up late and she frequently goes to bed early), but I did my best to keep the light and noise to a minimum if I was awake much later than her. She did the same for me if she was up a lot earlier than me in the morning. Also, neither of us were party people so that helped.
* A guest ""policy"" needs to be implemented. My roommate and I were pretty easy-going about this, but generally, we didn't have a lot of people over anyway, and if we did, it was never early/late in the day.

Don't be afraid to be upfront with your roommate if you have an issue with something she's doing or not doing. They may be unaware that they're bothering you. I would still choose your battles, though. If it's something minor and you can put up with it, then why potentially start a fight? But if it's something big or something you just can't deal with, then it's probably worth having a talk with her about it.

It might also help to make other friends in the building, too. I ended up befriending one of the girls in the room across the hall, and unfortunately, she had many problems with her roommate. Sometimes, my friend would hang out in my room while her roommate was making out with her boyfriend or something like that to avoid that awkwardness."

This was back in mid-BC so neither of us had mounts at the time of the story, since I was in the 20s and he was 30s.

We spent all of our time running all over Azeroth on foot, together, having a blast doing whatever we could think of.

One day we somehow found ourselves in a raid group to kill the world boss in duskwood, which caused us to die too many times to count but was insanely fun because we were actually ""contributing"" (or so we thought).

This wasn't the best though. The absolute best was when we would run all the way to crossroads on foot, and ""raid"" the town. Meaning stealth around as lowbies killing the low guards and people, and vanishing when the high level guards showed up.

As would be assumed, this led to 70s coming out to take care of us, which in turn led us to make friends that were 70 and would tag along to rampage through crossroads with two low level rogues for shits and giggles.

It seems so long ago, but I remember sitting there for hours on end having a blast with my best friends doing random shit just like it was yesterday. We've since grown up quite a bit and moved further apart, him no longer playing the game. It was an amazing time that I'll NEVER forget."

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1389502053.0,"Since you brought up my expectations, as a woman, when I go to my sangha, I *expect* the Theravadin monks to not try to sleep with me, claiming they are ""above the expectation of celibacy"" (how convenient!). I guess not wanting to be sexually coerced while I'm learning about my faith shows how unenlightened I am. 

While he was not a monk at the time (I think. If he was this makes it even worse), for reasons I already stated, his actions weren't acceptable (I suppose you just glossed right over the adultery point). Even in East Asian schools where monks and nuns are allowed to marry, it isn't ethical to sleep with students they have intentionally taken up, and it's definitely unethical for them to cheat on their spouses. All of this is to keep everyone accountable and feeling safe.

Usually, *charlatans* claim that they are above the ""expectations"" (moral code) of their particular religion or practice. It's usually used as a cop-out to convince a lot of people to sleep with them. In his case, a lot of his students came to him vulnerable to begin with, and some were runaways so I don't doubt there was some illegal dealings going on. If you are a teacher they are directly looking to for guidance, you don't sexually coerce them, and definitely you're not suppose to take advantage of their highly suggestible state (which a lot of *drugs* and *alcohol* tend to put people in -- it's just all coming together).

This is wrong and an abuse of power. Justifying this just makes it harder for people in modern-day ""Buddhist"" (or whatever) ""sanghas"" who are currently studying under sexually abusive teachers. This is the excuse they use all the time.

red_one2012,MakeupAddiction,1389502092.0,"Here are a few of my essentials:

**Brushes**

* MAC 217/224: The 217 works great for applying shadow in my crease and subtly blending it out and the 224 is excellent for blending the very edge so there aren't any harsh lines.
* Real Techniques Base Shadow brush: Love this one for sweeping shadow all over the lid and also works to add/blend crease color for my hooded lids.
* I LOVE the [Sephora Face/Eye Travel Kit](http://www.sephora.com/face-eye-travel-tool-kit-P105102)

**Primer**

* UDPP used to get rave reviews (and still does) but they changed their formula before I bought it and I don't think it's that great for oily lids anymore. It used to come with a doe-foot applicator and a rigid tube and that was the formula people loved. I think **NARS Smudge Proof base** is amazing as an alternative, I've had a few samples and it performed much better than UDPP.

* Maybelline Color Tattoos are also excellent products for oily lids ! Just wish there were a few more matte shades.

* **Edit:** Forgot about NYX Milk Jumbo Pencil !! I have to layer this over another primer because of how oily my skin is but it totally makes eyeshadow look more pigmented.

**Remover/Brush Cleanser:** 

* I really like the MAC brush cleanser. Lasts a long time and gets all the gunk out. Lots of people just use baby shampoo though.

* For makeup remover, my #1 is [Take the Day off Cleansing Balm.](http://www.sephora.com/take-the-day-off-cleansing-balm-P126301?skuId=886267) Seriously can't rave about this product enough.

**Mascara**

* [Covergirl Clump Crusher](http://www.covergirl.com/beauty-products/eye-makeup/mascara/clump-crusher-mascara) in Very Black. This is the regular version, not the water resistant.

* [Clinique High Impact](http://www.sephora.com/high-impact-mascara-P122912) is my holy grail mascara. My lashes look so much longer and fuller after using this stuff.

He fights for extra yards every play (a big reason why he fumbles more than he should, although that's not a good excuse), is a great pass blocker, and provides a combination of speed and power (something Blount doesn't have).  The key to Blount's success is his ability to take advantage of the defense being tired (normally in the late 3rd quarter and 4th quarter).  He's so big that once he gets a head full of steam, arm tackles won't bring him down.  You saw first hand that while he scored 3 times in the first half, most of Blount's damage came in the 2nd half when the Colts defense was worn out.

He doesn't have to have all 3. 

&gt;I just looked at both. Based on the current front pages, neither are very diverse (almost no ethnic diversity), but Lady Boners was definitely more diverse.

A 30 second look at the front page for one day is not going to represent diversity.

&gt;It doesn't happen often, but it happens. Women have widely ranging opinions on male attractiveness.

No, not really. 

&gt;I am definitely capable of sympathy. I'm not a sociopath.

You've proven this false about a dozen times. You'd have no argument if you did. Or at least, a very different one.

Your entire outlook on life is based primarily in sociopathic tendencies and believing you interpretation of the world should take precedence over the quality of life and agency of other people. 

&gt;If a guy is capable of meeting some women, getting to know them, and forming a meaningful relationship, and he instead chooses to make it his life's mission to have 1000 one night stands, then no, I don't feel bad for him.

Again, a total lack of empathy. You insist your interpretation of a meaningful connection outweighs his own, when it's HIS life and HIS problem. 

&gt;Trust me, no one does it very well. 

If peopel have sex, they do it well. How many sexual partners have you had? They did it well. You fucked  them.

&gt;And any woman who has done any research on the Red Pill knows exactly what to look for.

All attractive men...? Lol...

&gt;If that were true, the human race would not have survived. If 20% of men were sleeping with 80% of women, after a few generations, incest would start occurring

Ugh...............no...............that would requires that only 1 generation of people is having sex with themselves...theyre not. 45 year olds have sex with 19yr olds, 25yr olds, 45yr olds etc. 

And two, out of a population of a million, you'd have 200 000 men spreading their seed. That's a strong mix of genetics. 

&gt;No, they don't. I don't even think of Alpha or Beta when I see a guy.

Lol, no one does...You know when you see a guy that he's successful, popular, handsome, has a strong personality, etc. and you know when he doesn't...= alpha/beta. 

&gt;I mean a genuinely good personality, not a douchebag who tries to woo women.

Umm..are you under the impression an alpha male is a guy who does nothing sexually aggrevate women..? Cause...you're insanely wrong...

devilized,AskMen,1389502324.0,"I feel like I may be the odd one out here... Anyway, 25m here

&gt; How long are you willing to see a girl without having sex with her?

I don't have a set time limit, it's just whatever feels right depending on the girl. I'm really in no rush. I've been dating my gf for a little over two months now, and we haven't had sex yet. We've been taking it slow, but steadily moving forward and I'm perfectly fine with this. If the progress stops short of sex for no apparent reason, then I'll start to worry/evaluate what's going on. For now, I'm completely content with cuddling on the couch making out. 

&gt; How do I go about saying ""I don't want to have sex but I really like you and would like to keep seeing you?""

I'm not really sure it needs to be said... my gf and I haven't explicitly talked about it. It's just naturally run its course as our passion for each other has increased. 

&gt; Do guys (not trying to generalise, but do some of you?) expect to sleep with loads of girls and in the end find some innocent fairy that you can marry?

Perhaps some do, but I'm certainly not one of them. If the first girl I slept with was the one I wanted to marry, I'd be totally fine with that. I don't sleep with a girl outside of a relationship, and I don't keep a relationship running unless I see a future with her.

keakealani,SRSWomen,1389502360.0,"Besides talking it out with other people, I've found that writing is a nice outlet to think about these issues and then put them to rest. I often turn to my personal blog and just vent or talk about whatever recently shitty thing I've witnessed/experienced, and get it out there in writing. Normally, just the act of writing it down is kind of cathartic - I guess I feel like now it's out there and it's evidence of the shitty world, so I can leave it alone. It also helps me to go back and reflect about the things that happen and brainstorm about how to personally address them, how I can talk about these issues with others, and what forms of activism I can involve myself with. And sometimes -gasp- I even reflect on the ways I reflect shitty attitudes and work on fixing them, which is also important. 

To build upon /u/ArchangelleSamaelle's thought about activism, consider finding specifically an organization or cause that focuses on girls and young women, and supporting them in some way. If you have the opportunity, consider volunteering. I think one of the most important ways we can fight against sexism is taking an active part in building up a generation of younger girls and women with strong, feminist role models so that they can begin moving the world away from patriarchy stomping on them and speak out against the injustices that come from a patriarchal society."

Even in PC exclusive or focused titles where this may be applicable (meaning, not necessarily an RTS, something like The Witcher series), it's a bit ludicrous to make that assumption.

No, it's not, but that's the thing with my ideas. They're not applicable to all societies. I'm not trying to base my ideas on universal principles that apply in every situation, because honestly, there aren't many such principles. I base my ideas on the fact that in the united states, we have the luxury to decide that hey, no one actually HAS to starve. It's not really as much of a moral dilemma as you think. 

Morals change based on circumstance. Morals arise to address the circumstances in which we live.

&gt;You've made your assessment of me and believe i don't value human life, making me a dick

Well, I'm sorry but when you come out and say ""it's not about who lives and who dies"", you kinda put those words in your own mouth.

&gt;i have to do good to receive good whether i want or not.

Yep, the reciprocity principle...

&gt;Everything most people do is to secure a quality way of life. But quality life is relative to the individual.

Yeah, and how we address quality of life is dependent on the circumstances we find ourselves in. And as it stands, it appears a lot of peoples' quality of life is going down, while a select few of people is going up. And this is largely because we give people too much freedom economically, and people are taking advantage of other people.

&gt;f you leave it up to the individual to do whats best for themselves you'll see happy people everywhere.

Not really. At least not economically. American economy is a REALLY good example of this. Still waiting for that wealth to ""trickle down.""

&gt;And no reality isn't that complex

Yes, it is.

&gt;Would you trust that a tree is brown more if i told you showed you the tree or if i showed you the movement of photons and light waves interacting with a bit of matter at an atomic level i only claim it is a tree on a large scale?

Ah, but the tree can be broken down into smaller parts. It actually is complex. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSxuL_54sMk

This guy in MIB really explains how complex things are at times. Human society is built on TRILLIONS of interconnected variables that interact with one another and can cause things to play out differently. And this is why libertarianism fails, and limiting ourselves to three universal principles isn't necessarily a good thing.

redwhiskeredbubul,TheBluePill,1389502586.0,"Well, I don't understand the details of the argument about genetics since I'm not a geneticist. However, that's not really where the problem I see lies. The difficulty is rather than the 'populations' that the author studies are not properly defined as populations. For example, there are inferences made about the school performance of Africans, as a single population, that are attributed to genetic factors. The problem is that Africans are not a genetically homogenous population any more than Americans are. For that matter, they aren't a population any more than one would find by randomly scrawling a rectangle on a world map and defining everyone within the rectangle as a population. There is tremendous internal genetic diversity in Africa. Cases where straight lines can be drawn between ethnic affiliation and genotype constitute the minority: for example, there is (controversial) work on mitochondrial DNA in Orthodox Ashkenazi Jews--but this is possible because of 1.) religious stipulations about not marrying non-Jews and 2.) the fact that one's status as a Jew is, like mitochondrial DNA, transferred through the female line and 3.) that mitochodrial, unlike other DNA is conserved in sexual reproduction rather than being recombined. This is fortuitous. It is not the rule. 

Now, on what basis can we believe that 'Africans' or, for that matter, 'Asians' constitute meaningful populations in this sense? No mystery here: by _assuming_ that they are races and fishing for statistical differences. But it's long been established that phenotypic differences between what are assumed to be 'races' in the historical sense (let's not hedge words here: Negroes, Mongoloids, Malays, Caucasians, etc)  are not statistically meaningful compared to difference in phenotype between individuals within the same population_even in the case of physical appearance_. Unlike sexual dimorphism in humans, race is not a salient biological phenomenon--it is simply a rule of thumb that can be established _once_ we know the genotypic basis. But there is no basis in genotype  for the concept 'African' and thus no basis for generalization. In short, the author begs the question. Anyway,  this research was done by Franz Boas, the first important figure in American anthropology, at the turn of the century and had a pivotal effect on the entire discipline. I encourage you to read more about him if you're interested, and if you don't follow anything about my discussion I'd be happy to clarify. "

Necron_Overlord,movies,1389502717.0,"&gt;Ugh, I am sorry, but I think you have a pretty narrow-minded view of things if you think that place with all men or all women = homosexual island.

First of all, I don't have any problems with homosexuals at all.  Second, the alternative is an island of virgins with no sexual desire, or an island of intensely sexually frustrated immortals.  I actually think the ""isle of lesbians"" theory makes the most sense.  An island of all women would be awesome if you were a lesbian, but it would totally suck if you weren't.  And I just think implying that the Amazons are sexless is way worse than implying that they're lesbians.  That gets into that whole very sexist ""women don't like/want sex"" nonsense.

&gt;Do you even know what a feminist is? And not the cartoonish concept that people seem to have of them?

We are talking about the same people who freaked out because the main character of a Disney film based on a Danish fairy tale set in northern Europe didn't have a person of color in the lead.  The same people that hate Macklemore because he wrote a song in favor of gay marriage and got a lot of credit for it despite being straight.  The same people who said Stephan Moffat should die because the new Doctor Who isn't a transgender woman of color.

Okay, not *all* feminists would scream bloody murder.  But don't pretend that Tumblr wouldn't light up with people freaking out because adding men to Paradise Island implies women couldn't run a functioning society without men.

&gt;WITH ALL OF THAT SAID, you wouldn't even NEED to add men to Paradise Island as, in later Wonder Woman series, it was pretty well established that they had connections to other societies. They ran this series for 70+ years, don't you think they addressed the concept of reproduction?

When a writer (I'm a professional writer btw, this is my wheelhouse) wants to write a story like this, the origin/franchise launch, they want it to be completely accessible.  You're totally right that all of these issues are resolvable, it's just that they're *hard* to resolve in a quick way that won't leave large chunks of the audience bewildered or laughing at unfortunate implications.

&gt;I think the main problem people have is finding the same kind of funding that other superhero movies get, or gauging whether or not there is any real interest.

People have been trying to get a WW movie made for 15 years, and every insider gossip I've heard is that the problem is that nobody has been able to get a script written that makes sense.  It's got to be the origin problem.  That and the fact that she's been portrayed so many different ways; a lot of people want to see the comics version, or the cartoon version from Justice League (my vote), but a **lot** of people want to see something campy based on the Linda Carter series.

That makes a huge difference too.  Like I've read that Joss Whedon's script was rejected because it was too dark and edgy (this was years before Nolan's Batman).

&gt;But as I said, there is a Wonder Woman movie that has been cast, so there's that.

Yeah, I'll believe it when I see a trailer.  WW projects have gotten to this stage before.  Hell, they shot an entire pilot for the Wonder Woman TV show and it got canned.  And that was supposed to be a sure thing."

The hamster is a funny creature. A woman will usually spin endlessly on her wheel to conceal her duplicitous and opportunistic behaviour, but sometimes she'll cheerfully admit what she is. It all comes down to her feels in that moment. **Allow me to present an anecdote of my own:**

I remember a conversation I had with a plate I was spinning a couple of years ago. I was at her apartment. We were both glowing after a quick late-morning romp, when suddenly her cell phone rang.

She reached over, looked at it, and then answered it with a ""hey babe"" as she swung back over wrapping her arm around me. She proceeded to have a brief conversation with a boyfriend I didn't know she had - confirming plans they had made for some time this same afternoon.

When she was done, she snuggled up closer to me. After a brief and contemplative silence, she said ""sometimes I wish my boyfriend made me feel as girly as you do.""

""Girly?"" I asked.

She said something to the effect of: ""Yeah. I mean, he's great and all. He's a really nice guy, and my parents like him, and he buys me great presents for the holidays. His family is pretty loaded. But he's just not the kind of guy who makes me feel like a *girl*.""

I asked her about the kinds of presents he buys her. She mentioned a gold locket, a dashboard mp3 player for her car, some designer shoes, and a few other choice items.

""So, if he didn't have a lot of money you wouldn't be meeting him for lunch in two hours, yeah?"" I asked.

You know what she said?

**""Pretty much.""**

*In that moment, her hamster was comfortable, well-fed, and in no mood to go for a spin, so the rare and precious truth passed from her lips.*"

Montuckian,startups,1389502835.0,"Fellow startup-ite here.  I actually own a small digital marketing virtual agency in Longmont.  Essentially an agency filled with freelancers, but that's besides the point.

First off, stay away from services like Attracta.  We're beyond the days where you can stuff keywords and get a good result and many of these SEO folks who still claim to be beneficial use black hat methods that can penalize you instead of help.  I see you're using yoast SEO for wordpress and if you can do a bit of research on how to do SEO these days ([hint](http://moz.com/learn/seo)) you can cut Attracta out of the picture and know more about what's going on.

Plus, I can tell by looking at your source that they aren't doing much at all for you.

I also see that you're [not spending much in PPC.](http://www.spyfu.com/Domain/-6153193418395908996)  Before you rush out and start paying Yelp for their services which may or may not work for your business, go spend some time in Adwords and see if you can't generate a following there.  Your daily budget (from spyfu, so I'll take it with a grain of salt) says that you're not pushing traffic effectively through this medium.  Businesses in your line of work tend to spend too much rather than too little, so this is a red flag for me.

If you do use PPC, use call extensions to enable click to call.  People don't research business like yours, they call when they need it.  Either the dog just crapped on the rug or they're too busy wrangling kids to clean their own house.  They're searching from mobile and looking for a quick solution is what I'm saying.

There are also a few problems with your site.  

The first and most major is that it's really tough to find out how to get a hold of you.  If you want to use your website as a lead generation tool, you need to set it up so that the path of least resistance is to a human being or at least a phone number.  I've got to go through two clicks (one on the serp and one on your site) to even get to a contact page and then I have to scroll down that page only to find a contact form.  I'm out of luck if I'm looking to just call you.

Listen, lead captures work fine if I'm looking for you to originate a loan for me.  They don't work well if I'm trying to schedule you out for Tuesday; I'll just call one of your other 87 competitors who will fix my problem immediately.

Second, your font isn't good on a normal display or on mobile.  It may look cool, but it's not very readable to me and I've got a 30 year old's eyes.  This is minor, but think about your clients who are in their 50s or 60s.

You also have way too much content stacked up.  Content is king, especially with the google algorithm changes, but not in the way you're doing it.  Reorganize and worry less about pumping the SERP page for ranking and more about capturing the folks who are coming to your site.

Last, (finally, right?) is that it's not a good idea to pump ratings sites with fake reviews.  Yelp is smart enough to know that you're doing it and penalize you appropriately (think about how many of your friends and relatives are regular raters, or rather how many of these people have never rated anything.  Yelp knows..).  Work up to good rankings by mentioning it to good clients as you get them and treat everyone like they could be a secret shopper.

My business is relatively new too and am happy to talk to you more specifically without any expectation, plus my mom ran a cleaning service for 23 years.  And hey, I've got three dogs, carpets, and a business to run.  We might find some mutual benefit.

She's trying! You're directly eating unhealthy shit right in front of her and trying to goad her into eating it too. That's pretty ridiculous. She is obviously desperate to tell you how she really feels, but all you can do is try to preempt her and shut her down by saying
&gt;""we've never had an issue with our sex life""

Obviously you *have* if she's trying to wedge her sadness into everyday conversation to get you to hear her! Listen to her more. Tell her what you need from her (less nagging, that you don't want to feel resentment) but then LISTEN TO HER TOO. Imagine being in her shoes and feeling really bad that you're not attracted to your SO and how badly you want to change it but they're sitting there eating nachos saying ""yeah please help me do better!"" 

I'm not saying she's in any way blameless here but you both need some serious communication and to rebuild your respect for one another.

If you do go through the gun store offer to buy ammo, holsters, accessories, etc. from them (if you were planning to get any).  LGSs usually have a larger profit margin on those items than on actual guns, and IME they may be more willing to knock a few bucks off of them.

Evidence for never receiving training for Goodridge.

&gt;Gary Goodridge: Well, there was a Kuk Sool Won club in my area, and I told them I wanted to go into the UFC. They had a little 158 pound guy that wanted to go as well. They had a little donation thing to help this guy out too. Now, people are coming in to support the gym or whatever, giving change here and there trying to help this guy go to the UFC. I was thinking ""This guy's 158 pounds!"" And at the time, the UFC didnt have weight classes. He just wanted to go and try to beat up somebody. So, I'm 260, 275 lbs at the time, and I'm thinking, ""You know, I could wrap this guy up into a pretzel and have him down on the grass sucking himself off in no time at all!"" So I said ""You know what, I'll beat up your boy, then I want all that money, and I'm going to the UFC!"" So we had a little sparring session, and of course, I was on top of him all the time. I didn't know what do to, I was just on top of him. So we just wrestled around until we got tired.

Kastoli,2007scape,1389502908.0,"I would like to think that eventually we'll see the introduction of all the existing (RS3) achievement diarys and their rewards. With that being said, we lack an item slot to equip the Wilderness diary reward to! So **[possibly a talisman](http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120512032549/runescape/images/a/a1/Hunters%27_talisman_detail.png)**, in your inventory?

A great majority of the other reward items have teleports, so naturally the wilderness talisman **should probably have a teleport**.

[**Here**](http://i.imgur.com/ZIoRjgZ.jpg) I have highlighted with yellow boxes areas I think the/a teleport should end up at. The teleport could possibly end at all three locations, and randomly pick one. (Similar to how the wilderness gates work in RS3)

With the proposed removal of the ability to teleport out of the KBD lair within the 'new' wilderness, possibly a lever, or something similar which requires you *use* the talisman on it to be teleported a random distance towards the wilderness ditch.

[**Here**](http://i.imgur.com/0onWNY3.jpg) I have highlighted my idea for possible teleport locations after using the KBD lever. The distance between the player and the wilderness ditch could be decided by the difficulty of tasks which they have completed.

What do all Talismans in Runescape have in common? A locate feature! Be it a runecrafting altar, or the draugen... they all point the player to something. Perhaps we could cause this locate feature to direct the player to a (living) boss within the wilderness, one of the wandering bosses more specifically.

The removal of the fail chance on cutting spider webs (within the wilderness) while the player is carrying the wilderness talisman is also another option.

Other possible passive rewards that work regardless of the talismans presence could be:

* Zombies in the wilderness ruins drop more Fishing bait when killed.
* Chaos druids have a low chance to drop noted unit herbs.
* Prospecting a depleted runite ore vein within the wilderness could present the player with a rough estimate of it's expected respawn time. (Freshly mined 15+ minutes, Some pick marks are still visible 10+ minutes, Starting to grow moss 5+ minutes.)
* Run energy drains slower in the wilderness.
* Vengeance, Teleport Block and Entangle have a chance not to consume runes.
* Prayer drains slower in level 1-10 wilderness (Smite is unaffected)

Edit: Updated the post, fleshing out a few ideas a little more."

No matter what you do you should start light and work up, and that's doable with wood bows as long as you either buy a three-piece takedown (you'd have to discuss that with the bowyer and hope like hell they do that) or just buying a second, heavier bow (I advise a thirty and a fifty pound bow, start with form training, get comfortable, then start strength training with the fifty for several months before practicing/hunting).

Longbows, flatbows, and composite recurves are the most popular, but I favor the mollegabet, and penobscots are just too awesome.

A thirty pound longbow or flatbow shouldn't run you too much, just a couple hundred dollars most places, and the fifty pound bow of the same designs shouldn't cost more than three hundred if you don't order anything fancy. 

The fancier models are, of course, going to cost more- but if you get a thirty pound mollegabet you should get the same cast as a bow ten pounds heavier, though you wouldn't be able to hunt with it legally.

When they had it tested they found it was absolutely toxic and they were made to leave most everything they owned in the house and stay in a hotel. Now they are suing the contractor.

What is ""feminism"" truly about? How are moderate feminists more in a position to dictate what ""feminism is truly about"" than radicals? Remember, it's the radicals that publish papers and teach in universities. They're the ones who pioneer theories like ""rape culture"" and ""patriarchy"" and ""all sex is rape."" I've done my reading. I've read the Greers, the Solanases, the Dworkins, et cetera. For every published moderate feminist there are three or four radicals.

They same the same thing about moderates, you know, that you guys are the ones who ""aren't the real feminists"".

But all in all it doesn't matter what feminism is or isn't about, the point is that if you're going to insist on identifying with an ideology, you're going to have to deal with being associated with the radicals that adhere to that ideology. 

You lose nothing by saying ""I believe in gender equality"" instead of ""I'm a feminist,"" and there is a notable difference between the two. Feminism is a political ideology, a proposed means to an end, not the end itself.

AnyelevNokova,Mommit,1389503129.0,"Big clarification here:

**If you're going to come over to help, actually help.** 

I had tons of visitors that did the, ""oh, I'll come over and help you with the baby!"" song and dance, which in reality turned into me frantically cleaning up the house while they sat on the couch holding my son only when he was calm. The second he so much as whined, he was being held out for me to take him back. So if you offer help, make sure it's *help* and not ""help."" If you're sitting on the couch and mom is doing anything but resting or relaxing, you're not *helping*, you're visiting. If you do wind up visiting, know when to leave. Having guests over just adds to my stress level.

I can't tell you how grateful I am when my MIL comes over once in a while after I've worked a graveyard to watch my son for a few hours. She'll come over at 8, take him, and tell me to go to bed. I won't hear a peep from either of them until noon, and my god, I sleep like a *rock*. I'll wake up and she's done my dishes and moved some laundry around, and my son is happy as a clam. I don't ask her to do any of the cleaning or anything; she just does it automatically because she knows we get swamped and she's been there. I did the same thing for her when she did chemo. It makes a huge difference, even if it's just a couple little chores. Living in a messy house stresses people out, and you can easily be overwhelmed by everyday tasks.

So yes. I'd say above all else, genuine help is the best. People can usually acquire things like robes and PJs over time, but *stuff* won't fold laundry, wash dishes, or mop the floors. Babies are exhausting, and if baby turns out to be very attention-hungry, she might not have the time or energy to get things done ((mine, no joke, has a screaming meltdown if he even *sees* a vacuum or mop.)) No, it's not the kind of gift you can just buy, put in a box, and say, ""here you go!"", but the impact, in my opinion, is much deeper."

Dantilli,Stoicism,1389503156.0,"I can't help but notice you are obsessed with how people view you in this situation. I'd invite you to ask yourself WHY are you so invested in other people's opinions. Of course people's reactions matter in terms of how you've affected them. But their opinion of you shouldn't define who you are, that can only be defined by you.

If you define yourself by your ""reputation"" you end up spending every waking moment trying to maintain it. Every tiny change in this nebulous idea of a ""reputation"" causes you to percieve yourself in a completely different way. So instead of saying what YOU want to say, you say what you think people would expect you to say. You don't want to upset anyone because that would make you a ""bad"" person. You want everyone to like you so that you can consider yourself ""likeable"", so if someone does something you don't agree with you just stay polite, so they'll still ""like"" you.

This is what I think has happened in this situation. You let him walk all over you because you didn't want him and his friends to stop ""liking"" you (whch tbh, if they were treating you with such little respect, they probably didn't). You were terrified of offending anyone because it would go down in your ""reputation"". Because then you would be a person that is capable of intentionally embarrassing someone.

FUCK THAT SHIT!!

I personally define myself by core values and principles, concepts that I choose and that I have control over. They aren't completely static, depending on what stage of life I'm in they will change gradually in importance, maybe a few new ones will appear. But they don't change moment to moment, they change over the course of weeks and they are ALWAYS an expression of what *I* want from life at that time. Not that I act selfishly, helping people where possible is of high importance to me, hence I'm typing this reply. I can expand on this quite a lot if you wish, I'm too tired atm to think of how to explain it.

But defining exactly where I stand in terms of how I want to live means I have something tangible to grasp for when I'm lost in a situation. It means that instead of worrying and guessing about how other people might feel, I look to my values and *know* without any doubt how *I* wish to act in that situation. For example in your situation I would have tried to work out a way to tell him without embarrasing him in front of his friends. I would probably have taken him aside and had a quiet word. I don't like embarrasing people but I also wouldn't stand for such behaviour against me, so I'd look for a situation in which I can uphold both. If that wasn't an option then calling him out would take precedence over not embarrassing him and I would have layed into him.

**I have boundaries of behaviour that fit how I wish to live, not how I wish to be percieved.**

This probably isn't written very well, but I hope you can take something from it.

Btw, these are my opinions, not fact, and should be considered as opinions. If you don't agree with what i've said, feel free to ignore it.

MarkWW,musictheory,1389503192.0,"Yes, there are tons of books written prior to the 20th century (and a few in the 20th century) about this.

The bottom line is this - simple is harmonious. Complex is disharmonious. It remains true today.

For example the first interval we get from the overtone series is the fifth. It has a 2:3 ratio to the tonic - or you can find it at 2/3 the full length of string (the 7th fret is around 2/3 form the bridge to the nut on a guitar).

The major third is 4:5 (just take it on faith, but you can take your tape measure to this too).

This makes the major 7th (the 3rd of the 5th) 2:3 x 4:5 = 8:15 (I hope my math holds up).

This means the 5th repeats itself once every 6 cycles - 6 being the lowest common denominator of 2 and 3.

The major 7th however only repeats once every 120 cycles - the lowest common denominator of 8 and 15.

The tritone is a combination of the major third and major 7th - or at least one of the possible tritones is - so it's 4:5 x 8:15 - I don't feel like doing the math, but you can see how this would get rather complex.

The equal temperament scale we have today is an approximation of this. Notes are not quite 2:3 or 4:5 to each other, but ""close enough."" Why was the equal temperament compromise attempted, much less came to dominate all of western music starting in the latter half of the 20th century? Because a piano - and for late 20th century music, more importantly, guitar - tuned to play perfectly in one key, can play passably in some keys and not at all in others. Orchestras, consisting entirely of instruments that do not have fixed pitches could play perfectly in any key they wished.

By the latter half of the 20th century, most musicians don't know this, and even the ones who do frequently dismiss this in favor of other more modern (read: equal temperament based, serialist etc.) theories - at least the more vocal ones around here seem to."

I know lots of businesses will keep cash transactions ""off the record"" but I don't see how they could pull that off with gun sales since they have to keep 4473's and other records of the sale.

I mainly ask because I've tried the pay in cash tactic a couple of times on large-ish gun purchases and the stores showed zero interest in giving a cash discount."

On offense, we just need a center, probably a guard, and a training camp for our running back, and we'll be set.

The best advice I can give is to sit down and really listen to his objections, let him know that you care about his opinion, but then make sure you have solid answers to eat of them.

Be prepared: he is most likely going to ask you about protein, iron and calcium.  He will also probably bring up ""problems with soy.""  

If you have a GREAT vegan restaurant in the area, maybe you guys can go to eat there.  Or get a great meat-substitute product or cook a great dish at home.

Also, parents have a tendency to listen to people they aren't related to.  Would he be impressed about Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Mike Tyson being vegan?

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,declutter,1389503322.0,"I use these old cloth ikea cloth drawer bins ([kind of like these](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00192631/)). I pretty much only wear short socks, so I have two bins, one with athletic short socks and one for ""[dress short socks](http://indulgy.net/pE/N9/Q3/7021666.jpg)"" for flats. I mostly separate them because I kept losing the thinner socks and I found that keeping them in their own small bin helped. I have some warmer tall socks in a ""winter storage"" bin, but I live in CA so I don't really need them. When I'm doing laundry I tuck one sock into another so whenever I grab one sock it's actually a pair. 

*I only put matched pairs in the bins*. Socks with no mate go in their own small bin in the back of the drawer. No more hunting through various socks looking for a pair! I just throw the matchless leftovers in the bin, and then every couple of months go through and almost always match them all up. If there is one that never finds its match, I toss it. 

Some people only buy one type of sock, so that no matter what if you pull out two socks they will match. If you are starting from scratch I would go that way, but I personally already have too many different socks. But I am trying to aim towards all one brand. 

Underwear I have split as well. I have normal cotton bikini briefs in one bin, and thongs in another. I don't fold anything. I've found as long as I split between those two I can basically locate any pair I need really fast by searching through the bin. And I know that even if I did fold them I would just mess them up trying to find a certain pair. I embrace the chaos and just use the bins to corral it. 

Two other bins are for bras, one for light colored bras and one for dark. That's usually the deciding factor for which bra I will need, and as long as that basic separation is made I don't fold or arrange anything and I always find whatever I need. Specialty bras (strapless) are in a box on a shelf (along with panty hose and slips). I don't need them in reach on a daily basis. 

I've been doing this for the past 3 years and it's really worked out! I always know exactly what socks/underwear I have when I need them. No more hunting through random thongs and holiday socks in order to get dressed in the morning :)"

I'm not going to deny that there is black-on-non-black racism. I know a guy who got shanked because he was a mouthy fuck who pretended to be black (he was a dark Sri Lankan) and someone took offense to his adoption of the term ""nigga"" and stabbed him.

But that wasn't *normal*. I hung out with loads and loads of asians, hispanics, black kids, and white kids (okay, mostly white kids and asian, even the hard parts of town are segregated). Everyone knew to stay away from the gangs, but everyone else was cool.

Yeah, I doubt it's true. No, I don't think it's impossible for it to be true. Nobody is totally fucking excluded from their community. Maybe the reason people didn't like OP was because he was an asshole or socially weird, not because he was white. After all, I've been in classes with literally two other white kids, and I've got on fine with everyone else. Invited them to my birthday party, been invited to theirs, all the works.

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389503487.0,"&gt; Since ""working people also get the basic income... businesses can reduce their wages by (up to) the level of the basic income"" which means significant reduction in tax revenue

1) If this happened people would quit, as long as we keep our current minimum wage structure in place. No point in lowering ones wages if that mean they can just take up an easier job.

2) The money saved gets taxed in the form of capital gains and corporate taxes.

&gt; Furthermore, it is only logical that once everyone is ensured a basic ""livable"" income there will be a significant reduction in the workforce, further decreasing the revenue significantly.

A US study indicated a 17% reduction I think? it was posted here last week I think. Not a big deal. Also, this means that employers would have to pay MORE to attract people.

&gt;Basic Income presents reduction in additional welfare and social programs as one of its benefits. But there is nothing to guarantee that payments will be used responsibly. What happens if people use all of their income payments irresponsibly (drugs, alcohol, gambling, video games, etc). Do we let them starve? 

Yes, although there's no reason to assume this would happen. It's not backed by any study on the subject I've seen.

&gt;Since vast majority of people's well-being is directly tied to the health of the government and the GDP, what happens if there is a major catastrophe (i.e. war, disease outbreak etc.)?

Well, you'd either have a reduction in payments or deficit spending. If things get really abd, you may have to discontinue it altogether.

Honestly, I cant imagine every society in every situation having a basic income. I think it's something that is doable in the first world because of high living standards and the fact that we can afford for everyone having their basic needs met while still maintaining a largely capitalist economic system.

&gt;What happens to immigration? Wouldn't the shortage of workers in workforce due to citizens getting basic income encourage companies to hire illegal immigrants?

No more than now. Legal immigrants wouldn't get it, there's also no reason to assume large amounts of people wouldn't work, especially since the amount given for UBI isn't enough to meet a GOOD lifestyle.

&gt;How do you stop government abuse when basic income would give the government unprecedented control since majority would be entirely dependent on government payments?

UBI gives people MORE options, since they can continue to work as it is. If anything, the current system of work is more exploitative, because rich people can pay poor people to work for peanuts because they're desperate. We're not taking away anyone's ability to work with UBI. If anything it just gives people more options.

&gt;50% reduction in monthly income for those that are gay or no payments for those that don't go to church law from being passed if the majority votes for it. 

Basic income is meant to have no preconditions. It's more likely you'd see asinine requirements for this under our current welfare state than a UBI state.

&gt; Remember most of citizens now get government income and there is no minimum wage so wages would be significantly lower. 

This is why I break with a lot of others on this subreddit who argue for getting rid of the minimum wage. I think UBI should SUPPLEMENT the minimum wage, not replace it.

My boyfriend and I LOVE to take day and weekend trips to parks and natural areas, if you have any questions let me know.  I am located in South Florida but a bit north of Ft Lauderdale.  If you would like opinions of places you have in mind there is a good chance I have been there.

Save yourself a few hours in the car and stop at [John Pennekamp State Park](http://pennekamppark.com/) in Key Largo instead.  The Keys are gorgeous and there are many great places to stop along the way if you do decide to drive all of the way to Key West.  If you are more into nature than bar crawls then I wouldn't bother with Key West honestly, it is a bit too crowded for my own liking.  My favorite thing about Key West is probably the [Hemingway House](http://www.hemingwayhome.com/) with all of the kitties and quirky stories.  If you are really interested in snorkeling/diving you can take a short ride via boat or plane from Key West to [Dry Tortugas National Park](http://www.nps.gov/drto/index.htm) which is phenomenal but pricey.

Take some time to get out to the Everglades, pretty much anywhere, but bring bug spray, depending on the time of year mosquitoes get terrible.  We made the mistake of going deep into the Fakahatchee Strand in July once and were swarmed by dense clouds of mosquitoes, no fun.  Maybe find one of the many air boat tour companies or somewhere you can get a canoe, it is very peaceful.  One of my favorite attractions down south is [Flamingo Gardens](http://www.flamingogardens.org/).  A bit north of where you will be but still worth mentioning is the Downtown Delray area of Atlantic Avenue, you can make a day of it that includes some beach time.  I love to browse the art galleries and there is an excellent antique consignment store.  There are several excellent restaurants, including Pizza Rustica which is a must.

AnyelevNokova,Mommit,1389503671.0,"""Thank you for your opinion.""

Most people realize the intent of this statement and will shut their chilly holes.

I remember one exchange we had with some of our friends. The subject of pregnancy scares came up, and our friends were going on about how, well, if their girlfriend came to them thinking they were pregnant, they'd freak out and omg, like, *babies so scary* (these are 23~25 year olds. I'm 21.) The one guy said that he could never have a kid at this age because babies suck. Then he looked over at me and realized what he said. He started saying, ""no offense, I mean, (son) is great and awesome, and you guys are great parents, but-"" I responded with, ""That's fine. Thank you for your opinion: I think we get the message."" Instant silence, and the subject was never raised again.

I've found that if people push the issue beyond that point, I simply disengage from the conversation. They're going to have their opinions, but I can exercise my right to not give a crap. I learned during my pregnancy that people feel no shame in expressing their opinions on the matter and asking prying questions; the only thing I can control is how I react. If someone goes in thinking that young parents suck, a rant or insult-laced defensive response is only going to reinforce their argument. Taking the high road and offering a non-response response usually ends the conversation there because it gives them nothing to work with. And if they stare, so what? It's none of their fucking business, and who cares? Let them stare. They're going to think what they want to think because it's human nature to judge. Uninvited criticism is rude, so polite them to death."

bosh-head,Guildwars2,1389503829.0,"&gt;  I have tried changing my gear, my traits, and other things based on suggestions from others, but the more gold I spend the worse I suck.

How about your key bindings? I bet it's game mechanics that are tripping you up more than traits/gear. Do you have difficulty pushing the right button at the right time? Make sure everything you need to hit frequently is within easy reach. The standard 7-0 keys for your utility/elite are terrible.

Are you using your mouse for movement rather than keyboard? I rebind A, D for left-right strafe, which you can do while moving with the mouse, but in general you want to change direction by holding down your right mouse button and moving your mouse.

I read a post below that said you click your skills.. yeah, that's going to hold you back a lot. In PvE, clicking utility skills (NOT weapon skills) *miight* be okay, but you should really try to rebind them to something that works for you.

I have my utilities on E, R, T, and elite on C, for example.

You need to be able to hit the right buttons at the right time, if you're having any difficulty doing that, if you're saying to yourself ""oh I could've survived if I just my dodge a bit quicker, or hit my stability a bit faster, etc.."" then you need to keep working on your mechanics until that's not an issue for you any longer."

To me, a strong female character has a well-rounded personality with complex goals and motivations that don't just revolve around getting a man. I don't care how ""girly"" those motivations are--Kristen Wiig's character in Bridesmaids was very much a strong female character, and her ultimate goal was to throw an awesome bridal shower and bake cupcakes. 

ETA: 

&gt;If a woman does anything that a guy would do, she's just a strong female character.

So many female characters end up being ridiculous amalgamations of stereotypes about women that they end up doing nothing but shopping, drinking cosmos during ladies nights, going on dates, etc. Strong female characters with more complex motivations also have more complex actions, because nobody can realistically do nothing but drink wine and buy shoes. I don't think it's necessarily that a female character is doing something a guy would do, but simply something a human would do, that makes her a strong character."

audreyshake,sex,1389504008.0,"Thank you for your thorough response. I‚Äôll accept you know more about endocrinology than I do‚Äîor care to.

I didn‚Äôt wake up one day and say, *Hey, I think I‚Äôll drastically change my hormones today.* I‚Äôm well aware of the potential health consequences both of altering my hormones (essentially, I assume a female-typal risk profile) and of the specific drugs. The drugs I take‚Äî6 mg estradiol taken sublingually and 200 mg spironolactone (I‚Äôm ‚Äúpre-op‚Äù)‚Äîhave decades of reported use in similarly-situated individuals and are both well-tolerated. Additionally, my physician does yearly screens for serum liver enzymes and potassium levels (both of which can be affected by the spironolactone) as well as for testosterone and estrogen, to make sure they‚Äôre staying where we want them. With that in mind, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything hypocritical in pointing out the seriousness of changing one‚Äôs hormones while having done so myself, especially since, in my case, there was no other way to get what I wanted.

My concern with your advice to the OP is that your recommended protocol makes no mention of the risks, most notably osteoporosis, and doesn‚Äôt (at least as far as my Googling indicates) have a long history of use. Perhaps my concerns are unfounded. Also, I had no idea that male and female brains responded differently, libido-wise, to testosterone and estrogen. I know short-term it would, of course, as the person adjusts psychologically, but didn‚Äôt know it actually got wired that way.

There is *some* published research on transsexuals, both on treatment outcomes (endrocrinologically and otherwise) as well as neurological differences (both pre- and post- hormonal transition). I don‚Äôt remember any specific papers, but there‚Äôs a bit on PubMed if you‚Äôre ever curious.

I‚Äôm actually quite happy with my sex drive. I have no trouble enjoying sexual contact or reliably reaching orgasm. It‚Äôs actually better now because I don‚Äôt *need* it at all, so I only have it (usually with myself) when I feel like it. I can have multiple orgasms now, although I rarely feel like it, and I don‚Äôt ejaculate, so no sticky messes to worry about. Also, it‚Äôs great being able to think sexy thoughts when I‚Äôm bored in public. If I wanted more testosterone, I‚Äôm sure I could just halve my spironolactone, but why bother? (If you‚Äôre curious, my testosterone was ~10 ng/dL and my serum estrogen was ~350 pg/mL at my last testing.) 

When I first started experiencing sexual attraction at age eleven, it was primarily towards girls and women, but I was pretty solidly bisexual throughout my teenage years, and had crushes (and masturbated to) both men and women. As an adult, I find women much more attractive, but sometimes drool over men too (although I‚Äôd never date one unless he looked like Andrej Pejiƒá). I know there have been studies that suggested, as you do, a prenatal etiology for transsexualism, and I know that theory has been widely embraced by transgender activists (similarly to the ‚Äúborn gay‚Äù theory). But, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a typical transsexual: I wasn‚Äôt unhappy being a man until my mid-teens, and I‚Äôm not terribly bothered seeing my penis in the mirror. (Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I look forward to having my stuff rearranged, ‚Äôcause finding lesbians and bisexual women who don‚Äôt have a problem with my, uh, configuration is a little tricky, and also because it‚Äôll be easier to hump things (which I enjoy).)

Either way, I am very happy with how things worked out and I am much more comfortable now. Outside from conversations like these, it‚Äôs not something I even think about anymore. And I do pass quite well: A few months ago, one of my office mates told me about a transgender man she knew, and I told her about me because I assumed she could tell and felt awkward bringing it up. She was shocked, and actually a bit indignant when I asked if she‚Äôd suspected (‚ÄúHow was I supposed to know!? You *look* like a girl! You *sound* like a girl!‚Äù). Normally, young, feminine women are the most perceptive of that sort of thing, so I think that‚Äôs a ringing endorsement.

Sorry for writing you a book! Feel free to ask anything‚ÄîI‚Äôm not shy!"

Stereotypes exist for a reason, namely, because they're representative of the kinds of experiences people have with a group of people.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1389504070.0,"A lot of what you're talking about is high visibility national level politics. Voting makes a huge difference at more localized levels. I'm sure you intuitively know that without any need for us to discuss it.

As for the social inequality on the national level, it might sound strange to Europeans, but Americans actually vote for that. I know people making 3 times less than me annually who are considerably more fiscally conservative than me. There are countless studies you can find comparing American and European attitudes. Americans generally have a more positive view of the rich/wealthy.

(Tangent: I was going to lump Canada with Europe, but I actually have close ties to Canada and see a lot of attitudes changing. It's rather unnerving how different teen and young adult Canadians have changed since I was last living there. Probably has something to do with the tar sands and associated propaganda.)

Americans voted and got what they want. Remember that Reddit is populist. It'll give you a populist cross-section of the American population who care more about social inequalities. As long as people aren't literally starving in the streets, you'll never have lower to lower-middle class banding together over shared economic interests (e.g. rednecks side with ghetto dwellers)."

Flatbar,AskMen,1389504378.0,"I never said that there was something wrong with the male sex drive. I said that there is something wrong with the mass exploitation of the male sex drive. It doesn't make me feel very good that there are individuals making millions of dollars ""on the balls"" of millions of lonely males. It's just plain wrong, unethical, and unnatural.

It is much different from fantasy in that it is virtual, graphically visual, *endless*, and 100% FREE. Think about it. There is a free, unending ocean of porn videos out there. It's almost worse than other drugs in that there's no limit. A coke head that needs more and better coke will find himself searching and searching. With porn, there is no end. It's always there, and there's always more, and more.

I think about my younger cousin who is 11 years old. I grew up with the internet. I had to put in some effort when I wanted to see porn. NOW, you can type in pornhub.com or whatever the fuck, and find a vast collection of any porn you would ever want to see. Are you telling me that this isn't some kind of sociological problem facing young men? It's poisonous, and I don't want this next generation of boys whacking off by themselves in a dark room just because they are the ones who happened to grow up in a world where this SHIT is readily available to them.

edit: I've written all of this without even mentioning the exploitation of females. It's not just their anatomy that is being taken advantage of, it's their lives. I know, many of them chose to participate in the industry, but why? Most of them have lived in broken homes, had broken lives, and have just made bad decisions. OK, there are some women that are doing fine in porn, but seriously, 90% of porn is straight-up abuse at the hands of emotionally sterile men and I refuse to be a part of that any more."
Nombringer,changemyview,1389504379.0,"Hmmm, as someone who hunts meat, and recently held an opinion similar to yours, here is my attempt to change you view.

The time when the hypocrisy occurs is when someone holds a point of view like this:

* ""I believe it is morally justifiable for people to kill animals for their meat""
* ""I believe it is morally justifiable to eat meat""
* ""I believe it is morally justifiable for me to object to personally killing an animal because I associate negative emotions with it""

Even worse is when: (As someone who hunts this one annoys me)

* ""I believe it is morally justifiable for people to kill animals for their meat""
* ""I believe it is morally justifiable to eat meat""
* ""I believe is morally justifiable to object to the person who kills the meat because killing an animal has a negative emotional association""

Now, these points of views feel they are morally justified BECAUSE of emotions they hold. THAT is hypocrisy. e.g It is morally justifiable for me to hate all females/males because of the actions that some inflicted upon me

This point of view however, is different:

* ""I believe it is okay for people to kill animals for their meat""
* ""I believe it is okay to eat meat""
* ""I cannot bring myself to kill an animal because of emotions I have no control over. I accept this is a contradiction my views on eating meat, however I have no control over this""

This point of view is okay to hold, but people must ACCEPT the contradiction in logic of this viewpoint. I do not believe it is possible to morally justify this, without falling into hypocrisy. In fact, most of the analogies here, and arguments and analogies against your point of view fall under this logical fallacy http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-common-practice.html

However, was that last point of view a hypocrisy? I do not believe so.

The online Oxford dictionary tells us that a hypocrisy is:

* ""the practice of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs than is the case""

In this case, they do not pretend to uphold high moral standards or noble beliefs.

Therefore it is only a hypocrisy of a person has a MORAL objection to killing an animal, yet eats meat.

If they have an EMOTIONAL objection to killing an animal, it is not hypocrisy, but a contradiction of logic that they have no control over. However emotions often do run in contradiction of logic, and this is the real reason why this unfortunate contradiction occurs.

I hope I have been able to separate what I believe are two different viewpoints here. One being a hypocrisy, and the other (being more common) a logical contradiction due to emotions.

Star is basically asking, the *Have you stopped beating your wife* question . No matter how he answers or does not answer their reporters will make something of it . Even a ""no comment"" for what ever reason will paint him as supporting Ford or afraid to criticize him.    Peter Kent is right as well that the Star is trying to manufacture the news for their own political ends rather then report the news . The other thing of the ""roll call"" of public figures and people who depend on fair treatment / coverage for their living smacks of political intimidation of the worse kind , like your boss asking for a donation to his political party or candidate and those who refuse or opt out will be noted .

This some what validates the opinions of the Stars yellow journalism and that they have a vendetta against Ford and are doing every underhanded thing they can to get him.

In the book,  Ginny was the seeker against Ravenclaw and beat Cho Chang to the snitch.  She proved to herself that she was worthy of Harry, by beating the girl he had already chosen once. The kiss in the common room was EPIC.

But they wrote Quidditch out almost completely, and instead they turned the entire relationship into little ""stolen moments""...

Although...helping her zip up her dress before the wedding was a great scene, it just wasn't the same.  And the kiss in the Room of Requirement was so badly done you almost didn't know if it actually happened or was just Harry's imagination.



All of that,  and I hate that you practically cannot see a damned thing from movie 5, 6 and 7 because the story got ""darker"" so some idiot director decided to make the movies BLACK with hints of blue and brown.  I have an awesome television with great contrast, and I STILL cannot see what the hell is going on in half the scenes."

I just tested it again on one of those huge sacred oak trees in survival mode with a manyullyn lumber axe. I struck a block at the very base of the tree, and it did a 3x3x3 chunk thing. I was surprised at this because i remembered it working before. I tried again, but this time striking the block just above the bottom one, and the whole thing was felled. The tree was approximately 45 blocks tall.

I don't think the material would make a difference for the axe's behavior. The only way it would be different would be if it broke before it could fell the entire tree. in that case, after repairing it then yes it would only chop out little chunks instead of the whole thing."

Life-in-Death,AskMen,1389505115.0,"I mean, everyone is right to have whatever criteria they want, but the 3 date thing always seems a bit crazy to me.  A coffee-meet date, a drink date, then in the sack.  I just think that you know nothing about the person at this point (besides whether or not you are attracted to them.)

It is hard for me to imagine getting as personal with someone as possible without us having any real trust or knowledge of the other.  

I don't think sex is sacred, but it is pretty much the ultimate reveal to someone.  I would hate the idea of having sex with someone and not knowing if he would want me the hell out of his apartment or would never call again, etc.  

I can understand if you are just wanting a one-night-stand or something (which doesn't appeal to me for the same reasons) but if I am going to have sex with someone I want to know that we genuinely care about each other.  (Even if it is a friends thing)"

If people are going to leave or take breaks, I wish they would just step away for awhile, without doing anything like deleting their account or mentioning their intentions before deciding what they really want to do. I don't have a problem with letting the community know you'll be gone, and in turn the community keeping up with its active contributors, but you don't have to decide every time you click /r/short or come to reddit whether you're ""in"" or ""out"". But then, most of these acts are most likely acts of frustration, and I can totally understand getting frustrated at this sub.

Also, it makes the community feel really fragile. I remember not long ago, I think when laurise left the first time, another 2 or 3 people also posted about leaving and/or deleted their accounts at the same time (IIRC, majkatt and someone else).

Maybe even your neighbors are going to worry about the property values. Even though your Dad's a lawyer and Mom's a CPA. Ain't none of that shit happening when my family moved in next door to a Gonzalez and a Martinez, even if we loudly fought every night and the car backfired in the driveway more than once.

I was giving an example of an actual real-life instance of pretty nasty racial violence I saw in my life, growing up in shady neighborhoods, because someone *black* didn't like the color of someone else's skin (that person being someone who hangs around asians and white kids, who were considered higher on the racial totem pole). I also heard about plenty of black-on-hispanic violence, since those were the two active rival gangs on campus. But I didn't personally know any of them.

By ""racial totem pole,"" I mean we got away with more shit than other kids in high school. In a school rife with gangs, I could easily skip class, show up late, and all sorts of shenanigans someone with darker skin and family members who are known gang members could not get away with. Why? Because I was white, and so where the administrators and most of the teachers.

A lot of stories I read on reddit about racism read like a CNN headline special. Like someone literally has only been exposed to minorities and poor neighborhoods through the media and television.

RsonW,webcomics,1389505406.0,"&gt;That's not how supply and demand works at all...

Of course it is. If people don't buy a product, its price drops because supply remains stable.

But there's more going on here than simple supply and demand.

One doesn't go to the local art store, slap twenty bucks on the counter and say, ""One art, please."" Art has always been ruled by patronage. Someone commissions a piece, and they pay the artist. Or an artist produces a work and sells it to an interested patron. What you have here is an artist saying to other artists, ""if you work for free, you fuck us all over because now everyone will expect us to work for free.""

Try applying this to, say, programmers. It starts out well enough, a contest for who makes the best program some company needs with a payout. Other companies see this work, so they copy the idea. Over time, the companies realize they don't actually have to pay these people at all; people are voluntarily giving them these programs for free. Just tell them you'll put in a good word for them in the industry. If there are bugs, no problem, they just hold a contest for the best bug fixes. It still takes (expensive) training to learn how to code well, but now the reward has totally fallen out of the workers' side of the industry. Quality overall drops, but the companies doing this are profiting regardless, so it keeps on going.

Not that that's exactly what's happened to art verbatim, but that is what happens when people work for free. That's the message you completely missed in the comic because you think everything is explained simply by the three words ""supply and demand."""

Usually, your payment to debt is higher priority than investing, as the average investor is far from beating the rates he pays on debt (with the exce. So they have to wait even longer, after paying off those debts, before starting to invest. By then, others who had already started working in their early 20's are getting significant returns already (capital gains, lower tax rate).

Long work hours. Less time for side-projects (e.g. real estate). Specialized connections. This is aside from the fact that you've invested about 12 of the better years of your youth into that. 

As a purely financial decision, there are better options (unless we're talking certain specialists like orthopedic surgeons and anaesthesiologists -- they actually bring in some serious cash). Becoming a doctor is more than just the money. It's about the status/reputation and genuine desire to help people.

The wealthier youth I know tended to have gone to school for engineering, came out of school, joined startups (or started their own business -- yeah, it's a risk), and became multimillionaires after a few years, well before age 30. Worked for a younger sibling even. Barely 23, and he can basically retire now. 

I wasn't as talented or diligent, and haven't reached that point yet, but even I don't envy doctors for their salary (when you tie it to the sacrifices they make). I respect their title/reputation."

ernestborgnine2013,AskMen,1389505538.0,"I have to agree with a lot of people on here. I recently met two guys. Both of which seemed interested in me right away. I gave them both a couple weeks' consideration and even met up with one. Through that time, even though I initially like them both the same, one of them started to shine for me a bit more. I initiate communication with him and have stopped communication with the other guy, but if he were to talk to me I would maybe play long because the guy I like is not in the bag yet. 

I definitely don't want to reject guy number two outright because I don't know him that well, but guy number one has my time and attention at this point.

If you continue trying to get her attention, it's only going to make it more certain that she doesn't get interested in you. It's called the switch - the more someone chases after us, the more we don't want them because they seem desperate. This goes for both genders. It even goes for job interviews!"

The leather is just glazed pig split backed with vinyl lining. All the stitching is saddle stitch. For the body of the wallet I used I diamond chisel. For the inside lining I used a pricking wheel, and a hand awl with a small tip. I had to go to a quilting shop to get thread that was thin enough to sew the inner lining. I don't own a sewing machine, so sewing the inner wallet was a time consuming pain in the ass. Not to mention the thread kept breaking. The inside was 10 separate pieces all stacked and sewn together. Contact cement was used to hold down just the edges before it was sewn. 

My advice is if you have access to a sewing machine to do the inside use it. You don't want the nightmare job of trying to do that by hand. "

MN_Wild_Rice,trees,1389505570.0,"Sorry man, couldn't find a decent webcam, so I'll just do it in text. My ultimate roaches are pretty simple, I just love 'em because they're very fat and dense for a roach, just basically a paper cigarette filter really.

I use regular 8.5x11 inch notebook paper, cut the side with the fringe into the first margin, and proceed to cut widthwise strips off the remaining sheet. I usually make my strips two lines deep but if you have trouble with the roach staying in the end of the joint, try three lines deep.
The strip before you roll it then should be about 6.5in x .5in. I take the very end, and fold over as small a peice as possible. Using that fold to start my roll, I then roll the strip as tight as possible into a roll, unravel it, and then reroll it a little bit gentler. While its still tightish on this second roll, just tuck it into the back of your joint or roll it into the joint, whichever is easier. When you let it go, should expand by itself a bit. And voila, should be a perfect 'filter' roach. 

I love this method, and its fairly easy to perfect. The benefit is that once you get the size of your strip down for your joint size, you can preroll a bunch of these and close 'em up with a pinch of tape, or just make a little booklet of unrolled strips to throw into a rolling kit.

anonlymouse,rpg,1389505642.0,"&gt;That's... a wild stretch, but let's just say it's fair for argument's sake. What games do you feel are suited to telling stories?

Technoir, Cosmic Patrol, Our Last Best Hope, Smallville, Dust Devils... how many do you want?

&gt;At the risk of coming off dense, I still just feel like you're saying nothing at all here, because you have no examples from your own experience with the system, or even particular rules that make this so. It's ALMOST like you're being contrary just to be contrary.

You use a manouver to disable a security system, one person walks through it free, next person that walks through has to pay a FATE point. They do, 2 more walk through, spend their points as well. Last person doesn't have any left to spend because they spent them all earlier. They can't take advantage of the disabled security system and set the alarm off. Sure, it's an interesting story where by some plot twist the alarm system came back on, but it's not the story you wanted to tell whereby the hacker disables the security system so everyone can get through it.

&gt;Here I'll quote the FATE Core book, p. 76:

Not the relevant part of it, because not all aspects are on your character sheet.

&gt;Other RPGs let you reroll or get bonuses to your rolls without spending resources? Which ones?

See, that's a pretty shitty use of FATE points, and it's rather comical that people even bring this up as a strong point. Shadowrun and Harn, among other systems, had that decades ago. No, other RPGs let you state facts about the game world to make it more interesting without spending any resources. In Cosmic Patrol you can just state as a fact what in FATE costs you a limited resource to do. Once you've stated it, nobody has to spend anything to take advantage of it.

**Shipwrecks:**
&gt; ""I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gorged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see. As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

&gt; In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

&gt; Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

&gt; Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks."""

jaynay1,nba,1389505867.0,"That can't be right.

Let's say you have a series of n balls numbered 1 through n.

The question being asked, then, is how many combinations are present?

Well, on the first draw, there are n possibilities.  On the second, assuming we don't put the ball back, there are n-1, the third n-2, and the 4th n-4.

There is no integer n where n\*(n-1)\*(n-2)\*(n-3) = 1000.

Not only that, but even if you do replace the balls, n^4 would have to equal 1000, which again, no integer n exists.

Either it must be 3 balls, or 10000 combinations with Milwaukee receiving 2500.

Edit:  Or, they cheated and used 1001 as referred to in the wikipedia page.  Also they cheated again in not considering order."

GeeJo,AskHistorians,1389505983.0,"Probably the most famous depiction of a Victorian woman that goes against the grain of societal expectations is Manet's *Olympia*. While  at first glance it might appear to be fairly standard fare, its exhibition caused a storm of controversy and there were fears of a riot taking place to tear the painting down.

Okay, to place this in context, since the establishment of major art academies during the latter part of the 18th century, critics, painters and philosophers alike had come to the consensus that *good* art inspired something in the viewer - that they come away from it better than they were before. There was a marked upswing in moralising art from the likes of William Hogarth and Augustus Egg; serial narratives spanning several paintings such as *A Harlot's Progress* ([1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hogarth-Harlot-1.png), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hogarth-Harlot-2.png), [3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hogarth-Harlot-3.png), [4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hogarth-Harlot-4.png), [5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hogarth-Harlot-5.png), [6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hogarth-Harlot-6.png)) or *Past and Present* ([1](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/egg-past-and-present-no-1-n03278), [2](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/egg-past-and-present-no-2-n03279), [3](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/egg-past-and-present-no-3-n03280)) would present cautionary tales to the viewer, while stuff like *[Gin Lane/Beer Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beer-street-and-Gin-lane.jpg)* tried to guide viewers onto the ""correct"" path. At the same time, there was still veneration of the ideal beauty that could be found in the works of the ""Old Masters"" of the Renaissance - Raphael, Michelangelo, Giorgione, Titian, etc.

*[Olympia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Edouard_Manet_-_Olympia_-_Google_Art_Project_2.jpg)* was a slap in the face to the moralisers of the time, and it used the tools of the Old Masters to accomplish it. It took a well-known and beloved work by Titian, the *[Venus of Urbino](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Tizian_102.jpg)*, and turned it on its head. To modern eyes, these two paintings look pretty damned similar on the surface - you have a naked woman reclining on a bed, accompanied by pets and servants with flowers in evidence. All the components are the same - but the message is entirely different. In Titian's work, you have a coy and demure beauty, looking sidelong at the viewer and clutching roses in her hand. At her feet is a sleeping dog, iconographically linked to the concept of ""fidelity"". She's unconcerned about her nudity because she's with her lover (the viewer). Lip service might be paid to her being a classical goddess, but realistically this is meant to be sensual, her nudity erotic. 

*Olympia* on the other hand isn't a lover but a prostitute. Her gaze is frank and her posture challenging. For her, nakedness is just part of a job, the bed a workplace. Where Venus is brushing (toying with?) her pubis, Olympia is firmly covering and protecting hers. The flowers are a gift from a patron (perhaps the viewer themselves) and it's pretty clear she doesn't much care for them one way or the other. You can't buy her affection with pretty baubles like the Venus, you buy her body and nothing more. At her feet, a black cat with its hackles raised, also staring at the viewer - there are many iconographic interpretations for this element, but at the very least it's there to make it damned clear just who the interloper is in this situation. And while the cat might be disconcerting to avid symbolists, it pales in comparison to the overall impression taken away by the average Victorian viewer of the piece as a whole. Here is an independent woman who, in contrast to the ""virginal ideal"" placed upon women at the time, is firmly in control of her sexuality, using it to her own advantage and to put her in a dominant position over men (she's not being pimped here, she's a courtesan who chooses her engagements). And *worse*, she's successful at it. This is no ""fallen woman"" to be pitied. You only need to look at the rich draperies, the expensive orchid in her hair and the jewellery she's wearing - *the fact she has a servant* - to see that she's no ten-penny whore. This at a time when there was much public discussion and controversy going on over the place of prostitution in society as a whole, and Parisian society in particular. Something that made prostitution seem *appealing and empowering* was only ever going to add more fuel to the fire. Manet knew the painting was going to be controversial - he kept it hidden for over two years while deciding what to do with it.

When it was finally put on display, *Olympia* drew fire from critics and outrage from the public pretty much instantly. Not on aesthetic grounds, but for the way it portrayed its subject. It was described as ""art that has sunk so low it is not worthy of our censure"", showing ""scandal and idol, power and public presence of Society‚Äôs wretched secret, [...] the primitive barbarity and ritual animality in the customs and practices of urban prostitution"". They said of its exhibition that ""if the canvas of the Olympia was not destroyed, it is only because of the precautions taken by the administration."" Manet was airing the country's dirty laundry to anyone who wanted to gawk at it. *Olympia* refuses to be anyone's dirty little secret, she makes no effort to conceal who and what she is. She stares outward at the viewer and says ""so what?""

This frank approach to the depiction of women was taking off in other circles too, during the transition from Romanticism to Realism. And pretty much anywhere it was going on, there were people complaining about it. People were starting to depict women in ways that broke the mold of traditional feminine beauty. Take a look at Millais' *[Christ in the House of his Parents](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/John_Everett_Millais_-_Christ_in_the_House_of_His_Parents_%28%60The_Carpenter%27s_Shop%27%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)*. What do you think was the most-discussed aspect of the piece at the time? The symbolism? The style? The subject matter? Nope - what drew most comment was the artist's choice to portray the Holy Family as actual human beings, and not sculpted Romantic beauties. Charles Dickens himself called Millais out for portraying Mary as being ""so hideous in her ugliness that [...] she would stand out from the rest of the company as a Monster in the vilest cabaret in France, or the lowest gin-shop in England."" People went *on* to discuss the other issues raised by the piece and the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelite movement as a whole, but the opening salvo was entirely at this ""warts and all"" aesthetic.

Other artists took up the reins of this idea, this levelling of the playing field. You started to get more ""warts and all"" portraits of the likes of Klumpke's portraits of [Rosa Bonheur](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_22.222.jpg).

For more stuff on depictions of women in the 19th century, one of the better books out there is Bullen's *The Pre-Raphaelite Body*, which goes into exactly this sort of schism."

Now, presumably this happened in America. We do have laws that state when someone is really fucked up, having sex with them is rape. I'm going to presume that when your BAC is so high you can't tell who someone is, even when you're close enough to fuck them, you're *really* over that ""can consent to sex"" limit.

What exactly do you want to customize and how would it be done?

&gt; And what's the difference between it being baked into the OS vs a downloaded app? The functionality is extended, and if you don't use it it shouldn't matter that much. There aren't performance hits or anything for those who aren't using it.

The system I'm referring to is called Just Intonation, not to be confused with Well Tempered or one of the Mean Tone temperaments.

Also if you're talking about dissonance with regards to a specific tuning or key, throwing out C vs C# and D vs D# is meaningless - what key are we talking about?

What I believe you mean to ask is if there's a difference between - for example, the minor 2nd and tonic, or the leading tone and tonic, or the major third and subdominant, or a flat sixth and the dominant.

You may have noticed that I mentioned that there's more than one possible tritone, depending on the context.

There has been some analysis on the various minor seconds - not to scrutinize their relative dissonance, but simply to tune instruments and orchestras and so forth. Not all minor seconds are the same, nor is the context in which they exist the same. There are different various intervals for the minor second that can be derived from the methodology I outlined above - ranging form 15:16 to 18:19 - but I don't think anyone considers them to be different enough to be taken as isolated dissonances outside of the context of their musical purpose.

Both are national sports of Ireland and hurling is the fastest field game in the world. Not only is it an amateur sport, but the All-Ireland stages are the most watched sporting events in Ireland. The passion in these matches are arguably higher than most other sports. 

The players don't play for the highest bidding teams, they represent where they're from and are in peak physical fitness. 

Imagine your sporting hero (LeBron, Brady, Ronaldo, etc.) playing their heart out on a Sunday and exhausting themselves and then the very next day they're in a classroom teaching your children, or at the office filing reports. 

That's what the GAA is all about: passion

If you don't believe me, go onto YouTube and look for highlights from the 2013 All Ireland football and hurling finals; I get goosebumps watching that shit!

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1389506524.0,"Maybe there are different kinds of love.  There is definitely lust, but I haven't quite experienced that.  Perhaps it's just not in my character.  But I do fall in love with personalities - this means that I believe, like you, OP, that love develops over time.  When I first met my boyfriend, I thought he was bitter and abrasive.  Then I got to know him.  He wasn't like that all the time, but I saw the aftereffects of a bad breakup he went through.  He'd bring up conversations at work about old adventure games he used to play, and that really caught my attention....I love that stuff, and have trouble finding people in my age group who've played it too.  He's older than me, by the way.  So that drew me closer.  We talked more, and I realized we held a lot of similar beliefs, we could let the conversation flow between us effortlessly, and slowly I fell in love for him.  Now, mind you, this took me years to do!

For him, while he admits he did have lust-at-first-sight, it's also my personality that made him realize he wanted to be my boyfriend, long term.  I highly doubt that your female friend's definition of ""love"" is the same as mine, because how can you actually love someone when you don't know if your personalities resonate?  But as I said, I've never had that with anyone.  So I really can't relate! Some may call it lust, some may call it chemistry, but it takes a lot more than that - according to me - to say you love someone."

The second guy seemed really great, nice looking guy who seemed normal and open. We met up, clicked and ended up dating for a few weeks. One day at work I thought I'd look him up on Facebook and friend him, saw his profile photo was his wedding photo. He had an open profile and when I checked his other photos I saw he had a newborn baby, as in born a week before we met. I called him and said I couldn't see him anymore, obviously.

Obviously, some shit happened. I was called a cracker, and I've said as much in other comments. I remember a couple of people being mean about it. But persistently mean, all the time, to the point where i had no friends? Like a purple-prose story of woe?

Nope.

I've had felons on the run from the cops jump over the fence on the backyard and rattle the backdoors, only to sprint across the lawn and jump another fence. Police helicopters overhead at least once a week. Gunfire from the apartments behind our development pretty regularly. Drug deals going on in the industrial parking lot behind our house. Not a nice neighborhood. Phoenix, if you're wondering.

Obviously, segregation was a problem. Everyone kind of kept to themselves. When we were kids, really young -- like middle school and younger -- mixing races was a lot more common. By high school, everyone stuck to their own kind. Still, the people that were *mean* about it weren't really normal, unless you went out of your way to provoke them. By wearing gang colors or something really stupid like that.

And the cops were still white, the administrators white, teachers, principals, and most authority figures. I got a lot of slack because I was a white kid.

Plus, no complete social alienation. So any purple prose stories of ""everyone with power hates me and everyone in the community was mean"" come off as fake as shit."

smootie,relationship_advice,1389506655.0,"You and your wife have been together (and I assume monogamous) during the period of your lives where most people are dating around, experimenting with relationships, and trying to find out *how* to be in a relationship and what qualities you want from a partner.  Also, this period is when most people experience a lot of change.  People's goals, values, and personalities can change a lot throughout their late teens to mid-twenties.

It's natural that at this point - when you are broadening your horizons and are exposed to new, exciting, interesting people in college.  And some of the women you meet will be in your major, and have similar careers goals as you.

In short, it's completely understandable for you to wonder what else is out there because you didn't have the chance to explore when you were younger.  

But you made a commitment to your wife and you owe it to her to have a frank discussion about where your marriage is going.  You can't unilaterally decide that you can't maker her happy in the future unless you know how she feels.  Even if you've made up your mind that you no longer want to be married, she deserves and explanation.  But keep in mind that the grass is greenest where you water it.  

I went back to college a few years ago when I was about 30 and I went through a period where I wanted to withdraw from my ""old"" life.  I was absorbed in my studies, and spent a lot of time in my own head just thinking.  I wanted to spend all my time immersed in this new environment, and my husband and his needs (though minor) were a distraction.

After a lot of anguish which I won't get into here, I talked to my husband about needing more time alone, and how I felt guilty for wanting to put less time and effort into our relationship.  He completely understood, and assured me that he and the dog would be perfectly fine and I could have all the time and space I needed.  I'm really grateful to be able to withdraw yet still have the emotional support of my husband when I need it. 

But I'm starting graduate school soon and I'm sure that's going to come with its own set of challenges.

askgeeves,AskWomen,1389506786.0,"The anniversary special is pretty standalone. People always talk about how it has been building up to it for so long but in reality there's a 1 minute scene at the end of the previous episode and a (very good) web mini-episode and that's all the preamble that's (not even really) required. You'll miss 1 or 2 references of course but you'd miss much more from not watching the classic series which most people haven't done anyway.

So if you want to watch the 50th special for one last Tennant episode definitely don't let not seeing the last 2 seasons stop you. I haven't really liked Smith's run either (partially due to yo-yo writing quality, mostly due to his hyperactive acting style) but the 50th is a nice nostalgia trip and focuses more on David Tennant and John Hurt anyway."

squeadunk,AskWomen,1389506817.0,"I'm currently pregnant but I LOVE my Lunette cup.  It is so easy and comfortable.

Even though I've had a period for 23 years I never got the hang on tampons.  They were never comfortable, removing them hurt, and if I coughed I'd push the suckers out of me.  On my heavier days they would make me feel sick to my stomach (after using my cup I've learned that my cervix hangs really low those days so it makes sense that the tampons were too long and were actually hitting my cervix...)

So, for 20 years of my period I wore pads.  They leak.  I've stained I don't know how many sheets, mattress pads, pants, etc.  At 30 years old I'd still have months where my pad leaked at work or I was out and about and I'd have blood on the crotch of my pants!!!  And don't even get me started on the blood stained panties.  

And oh my god, the smell of pads!  There's nothing like pulling down your pants and being greeted with the smell of death and decay!  Ewww.

Adajeanne,books,1389506835.0,"Your last sentence tidily sums up a common debate in literature departments on whether breadth or in-depth analysis is more important in the discipline. Since the 1960s in particular, there are a number of ""theory"" schools (psychoanalysis, feminist criticism, deconstructionism, etc.) that have developed, and you will often see scholarly publications based around applying one or more of theses approaches to a work of literature. 

One of the central questions (if not *the* central question) in literary studies is how to best interpret a text. Interpretation of a single work implies, certainly, multiple readings and clear and close analysis. 

That being said, a single work stems out of a great and vast tradition. Can you really appreciate *Cold Mountain* without having read Homer? The average literature prof/scholar holds a PhD that indicates they went through a series of steps and exams, including reading and digesting dozens of books designated by their department, not to mention whatever books they had to read for seminars. This process doesn't (usually) allow for very sophisticated readings at the time, but certainly prepares students for the careers they will have one day where a broad knowledge of the literary tradition is assumed, and is a step that generally proceeds any of their own contributions to the field. 

Finally, the benefit of an undergraduate degree in literature is, imo, that you read a variety of texts from a set literary tradition (or many traditions, if you are in comp lit), with the help and guidance of experts. You learn tools of analysis and apply and adapt them to these different works, with the hope of refining your approach as you go along. 

TLDR: You will probably have to get through one of those ""giant reading lists"" if you want to know what it's like to read as an academic. Just as I wouldn't be able to learn graph theory overnight, so too you will need time to learn literature as a discipline. "

ShamelesslyPlugged,40krpg,1389506882.0,"Keep in mind that canonically, Deathwatch should mostly be high risk, high reward missions against aliens. The following is how I would structure the scenarios as you have laid them out, but they're more a springboard for your own ideas.  

Scenario 1 Phase 1: I might have the world using some sort of Eldar/Dark Eldar tech. Make the beginning the easy part as they blow through the PDF with ease. They get to the machine and have to fight a psyker or two - this should be one of those fights that could go wildly easy or wildly hard based on rolls, as kind of a boss with PDF fight..  

Scenario 1 Phase 2 Harlequins or a Farseer or the like shows up and warns them not to do something stupid, but in a haughty fashion meant to piss off the players. If they go with the Eldar, they are double crossed and things go violent hellworld with the Eldar trying to escape with their tech - while mocking them. If they beat the Eldar and blow up the machine, things go violent hellworld.  

Scenario 1 Phase 3 Fight back to the LZ or loyalist lines. Crazed hordes of humans coming at them, maybe a few Eldar harrying them, and you can throw some demons if you get bored. Emphasis should be on keeping them moving. Might be fun to throw a vehicle like a rhino in here, or maybe a landraider.  

Scenario 2 I like. Bait and switch. You need to make the world variable based on the chapter make up of your players. Choose the best roleplayer for whom it makes sense for, and have it be a recruiting world for his Chapter. But I'd make it interesting. Scavvies and Redemptionist equivalents are having a turf war, and it turns out the Scavvies ARE a genestealer cult. And if you want to go REALLY crazy, have the Loyalist Chapter present there being in a rush to induct guys because of high casualties, and the apothecary missed that some of their recruits are infected. Because then it turns into a real shitshow with lots of sides playing off one another and no good guys.  

Scenario 3. This is the one I think that you need the most idea help with. Here's what I'd go with - struggling low tech world that is barely making it. As such, they've been missing their tithes. You don't screw with the administratum, so they sent in some IG and took the tithes by force. Now the world has a huge  worker shortage, and is not only going to be unable to make future tithes but is looking at a huge famine. However, part of the reason that they've been so under the gun is that they're in a warzone near the Tau, and Imperial lines are stretched thin enough that they're desperate for help. Tau swoop in, offering help. Deathwatch is sent in to demolish the Tau ambassador and escort to send a message that the Imperium doesn't take kindly to meddling aliens. However, in doing so they're likely dooming millions of humans to enslavement and famine. If you really want to have fun, reverse the typical Imperial Governor trope. This one is actually competent and CARES, but he was just dealt a hand that he couldn't win with.  

Scenario 4. I think you have a fun one here. I'd do Orks on the Space Hulk, because they're fun and you can do hilarious stuff to make sure that the heroes keep moving. Make the artefact awesome and let them use it. I would suggest a totally OP power weapon or absurd heavy flamer. You could also have it just be the corpe of a hero of the Imperium, who happens to have some old school armor, an awesome weapon, and is deserving of a honorable burial. You can play run and gun against orks, and then they get a signal offering help - it looks Imperial but the code they're using is far too old. Then they have the choice: Join us, Give Us the Artifacts and we'll leave you on the hulk but we wont' kill you, or Deny Us and Die. They should take option 2 or 3. If they take option 2, they have to fight through the orks to a hangar bay, hold it, and then they can get out of their with the Imperial Hero to bury but they will have consequences (probably be declared traitors or forced to do a suicide mission). If they choose option 3, they have to fight through the Orks with Chaos Marines hot on the tail. Then they get to do Heroic Last Stand in a hangar bay. A few waves of orks to make sure they're hurting and low on ammo, then you throw the Traitors en masse. Time things so that they can get the artifacts away, but most if not all of them will die in the process. Encourage them to make those gallant sacrifices, and add them to the roll of honor.  

Hope those help."

Alcohol is not the same as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, peyote, and other hardcore drugs. It's not even close, actually. So please, for the love of God, stop comparing them. 

All drugs should be legal? Heroin, too? Have you seen a person addicted to heroin? I have because I grew up with a few. Do you know what a person will do to get their next hit of heroin? **Anything**. They will sell their children into slavery in order to score another blow.

Most kids either had or were in the process of having their first kiss. Some kids started the year before, but where I was, 4th grade seemed to be where everybody got on the kissing train. Kids would become 'boyfriend and girlfriend' just so they could sit together at lunch time, smooching.

None of the girls wanted to be my girlfriend, and none of them wanted me to be their boyfriend.

A lot of kids were very casual about kissing as well. It wasn't just a bf/gf thing, kids would play kiss-chasy, spin the bottle, etc. It felt like not only had the other boys my aged kissed a girl, they were kissing quite a few girls. And everyone seeemed to be enjoying themselves.

But no one wanted to kiss me or have me kiss them. Because **""ew""**, **""gross""**, and **""no way""**.

I wasn't allowed to join any of the kissing games because all the girls agreed that I was disgusting. I suppose kids that age aren't concerned about other people's feelings. It was made very clear to me that I was not to participate.

Ever since then, it's been the same deal when people started having their first sexual experiences in their late teens, or when getting into their first serious romantic relationships in the years post high-school. No one wants me, and no one wants to be wanted by me."

I was with my boyfriend for a long time and I trusted him, and I had a very positive experience.  Do I think I was 'too young?'  Meh... what's right for one person is not right for the next.  I certainly wouldn't encourage kids to go out and lose their virginity at 14 like I did, but it was fine for me and I certainly don't regret it or wish I had done it differently.  I don't at all feel dirty about it - it was loving and safe and planned and discussed at length.  But, I'm not happy about it necessarily.  It is what it is.

I didn't tell anyone about it for a long time, just because I knew my friends couldn't relate.  I don't think I was afraid of judgment, but I was afraid of being seen as unrelatable or aloof or 'better than' them.  The only thing I have to say is that I was really in a rush to grow up, and I wish I would have allowed myself to be a kid and play and not care about boys longer.

Keep a note book and write down the words.  (don't bother with the definition)  If you are using an e-reader, you can just highlight the words and go back so you are not interrupting your reading.  Occasionally go through the list and see what words you remember.  If you don't look them up again and write down the definitions.

Vocabulary is the biggest block to reading comprehension, so putting in work in the beginning will give you a lot of payback.

In my Kindle (and in any dictionary), the definition will give you the origin of the word, this can help you learn the meaning behind it.  Get familiar with roots, suffixes, etc.

Get lists of words for SAT/GRE, you can get free apps/games on your phone.  It is amazing...once you learn like 50 words you will start seeing them everywhere.  

Other:

First, I might start with short stories from the same authors you want to read.  It will just provide smaller chunks for you to digest.  

Secondly, read analysis (just wikipedia the book) when you are done.  It will give you insight on larger/deeper themes you may have missed.

theworldiswierd,offmychest,1389507499.0,"One you statistics are wrong. Or at least ignore the facts that you grouped Hispanic and non-Hispanic white Americans. Hispanic americans typically don't have this issue so that lowers that [white number to 63%](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html). And less than 50% of Americans under 30 are white Americans. So still a majority in total, but this would include the majority demographic of the white Americans that use reddit.

The bigger issue isn't that history classes down delve into different ethnic groups history. It's the fact that some white Americans feels like they are taking up a torch for African Americans calling the term politically correct or disrespectful. When in reality calling someone black is politically correct. It's a term use to try and not irritate others, but at the same time allows white Americans to ignore different ethnic groups in Americans. It's like grouping Hispanic people together. Well the fact is African Americans and Mexicans have more in common than some of the people in this group we through everyone south of where we are.

It's the fact that they were explicitly told the right term, but ignore this because they don't like. Or they butcher it because they never bother to understand. Well we didn't ask you to read a history book, it is only ask that you call African Americans what they explicitly told you to call them. Is that to much to ask? Well I guess it seems to be."

One of the biggest differences between ""good"" and ""bad"" readers is the idea of how active the reader is supposed to be.

""Good"" readers often work hard when they read.  They may draw a confusing family tree out, or a timeline, or a list of characters.  They will sit with a dictionary and look up words.  They may make notes in the text.  They form mental pictures of the actions in the book, like a movie.  If they don't understand a sentence, they will reread it.  They will try to figure out why the authors is mentioning something odd.  I know I have read a paragraph 5 times in a row sometimes.

No, but to a lot of white guys they are.  I think nobody should ever date within their race.  But I support the idea of Planet Starbucks, a world where everyone can be described by referencing some kind of coffee drink.

&gt;And is there any reason for it?

Racism?  Not intentional racism, but more the unexamined white supremacy that we all stew in.  We live in a culture that celebrates white beauty, and defines beauty as whiteness in a lot of ways.  A lot of men's idea of beauty is heavily influenced by the popular culture.  I think it's changing, their are a lot of people challenging it, but it's slow work to shift deeply ingrained attitudes.

First sentence announces dying uncle.

Followed by 6-8 minutes of crazy poor pity me all about how my dad won't let her use his frequent flyer miles to buy a plane ticket because of fear he'll have a heart attack and die when uncle sees her. This because according to her he randomly went nuts a couple of years earlier and told her if she didn't get off his property, he would shoot her. Pretty sure she knew at the time exactly what pissed him off but has done a mental re-write. Now the god's truth for her is he was already suffering from his cancer and that somehow caused him to be unstable. Note once again everyone but her is crazy in some way. 

Then we got to the heart of why she had called me. Did she ask me to help her out? Of course not! Told me she guessed we'd have to drive up together. Ah fucking ha. This is why she called me regarding this death and not regarding half a dozen others in the family since the last time she called me.

GeeJo,AskHistorians,1389507815.0,"Primitivism got its kick-start with the exploitation of the new African colonies established during the Scramble for Africa at the tail-end of the 19th century. While there had always been trinkets and baubles passing along the trade routes towards Europe, the establishment of permanent colonies opened the floodgates. 

(EDIT: Part of my undergraduate dissertation touched upon the displacement of huge numbers of cultural artefacts from Benin and Nigeria by the British as a concerted campaign to uproot native culture and, in so doing, quell much of the potential for ""nationalist"" uprising by the native population. These artefacts had to go somewhere, and what didn't end up at museums was sold directly to interested parties in Europe. There have also been huge scandals in the past few decades around museums refusing to sell the artefacts back to museums in their home countries even at above market value, who subsequently pass them around to other Western museums or sell to Western collectors at cut-rate prices instead.)

The new availability of such works sparked interest in all quarters, manifesting first in a new trend of ""ethnographic museums"". These were not particularly...respectful of the cultures they were trying to inform the Western public on - they were more interested in titillating through ""savage displays"" and in the most exaggerated art-pieces they could find. This is all ""Dark Continent"" stuff that I'm sure you're familiar with. 

But all of this new material started to combine with the on-going Romantic movement that idolised the concept of the ""Noble Savage"". Artists, like the general public, were very aware of the wave of modernity that seemed to be radically altering every aspect of life. Those who were excited by the prospect were attracted to movements such as the Futurists and the Vorticists, the fetishisation of the mechanical. Others sought for a return to a purer uncivilised state. It was the latter group that turned to the idea of Primitivism.

What differentiated African and other tribal works from Western European art of the time was a focus on form rather than line - an almost alien abstractness compared to the naturalism that had been in vogue since at least the establishment of the art academies of the late 17th century (though if you exclude the fantastical allegories of the 16th and 17th centuries and focus on naturalism of *appearance* rather than subject matter, you can drag that date back to at least the start of the Renaissance). It's true that abstractness and naturalism have waxed and waned throughout art history, but if you put up an African dancing mask against a formal oil painting, the contrast is extremely jarring. Of the artists to incorporate African motifs and designs into their own work, Picasso is undoubtedly the most famous. He often took pieces straight from the local marketplace to his studio and began *directly copying* them onto canvas. As he got more familiar with the eccentricities of West African art, he toyed around with his own elaborations from the basic forms. It's universally accepted that his experimentation with African artwork is hugely responsible for his transition into Cubist and other abstract styles.

Gaugin, of course, famously upped sticks and moved to Polynesia in the hopes of finding an unspoiled ""primitive paradise"" on which he could draw for inspiration. He was unaware, apparently, that the Spanish had been sending missionaries for quite some time and that he was unlikely to be hailed as the first ambassador of modernity. He seemed to get along well enough with his disappointment though, especially with ladies of looser morals. He never returned, though we have a number of his paintings from that period, many of which feature said ladies of loose morals.

While Primitivism *started* with an interest in foreign tribal cultures, it did not take long for Europeans to become interested in their own primitive past. Germany in particular was home to a large number of ""art colonies"" that segregated themselves off from the wider world in the hopes of re-capturing a more primitive, more pure sense of nature.  For these people, Primitivism wasn't an art style but a lifestyle. These were essentially turn-of-the-century hippy communes, minus the drugs. Very bohemian in outlook. Der Blaue Reiter, while one of the more moderate in its approach, is probably the most famous and certainly the most influential of these groups. Interest in the past branched out to other areas, too. Artists began taking up abandoned forms of medieval or early German art such as woodcuts, seeing an opportunity for blending abstraction with the burgeoning German nationalism of the pre-war period. World War I largely put an end to such endeavours, though many former German Primitivists switched over to full-on Expressionism, which remained in vogue until the NSDP began rounding such artists up and arresting them as deviants.

The final expression of primitivism that I'll bring up is the sudden and massive interest of the European intellectual community in the ""naive artist"". Works by completely untrained or self-trained artists began to be snapped up for gallery auction after being ""discovered"" by more famous patrons. There's a definite primitivist element in this - paintings of nature and human figures that approximated what art critics had come to expect from ""primitive""/Primitivist artists were particularly favoured - and it combined with an increasing fascination amongst intellectuals with Freud's new theories about the unconscious mind. Were these naive artists perhaps closer to expressing something true from their subconscious, unfettered by formal training? Were they, at heart, noble savages in modern clothing? It was a question that spurred much discussion for several years. Eventually, after the war, Breton and the Surrealists took a different approach - professional artists trying to *become* naive artists through techniques such as automatic drawing and illustrations of Exquisite Corpse word-poems - but naive art remained an on-again off-again fad for decades.

So, a tl;dr: 

* Rousseau's ""Noble Savage"" and associated romanticism/nostalgia for a utopian tribal lifestyle
* Increasing availability of tribal works
* Novelty/public interest
* Nationalism
* Psychology"

Might be that that one professor was a weirdo though XD (He wasn't a very good form and analysis teacher, but that's another problem entirely XD)

Anyway, my composer brain is definitely percolating - while it's certainly extended, I feel like if it hasn't happened already, someone *should* write music that takes advantage of the harmonic possibilities of those little differences in ratio.

ep0k,Military,1389508282.0,"This is more or less my perspective. A film like The Hurt Locker gets marketed as the product of embedded journalism and diligent research (in short, is sold as an accurate depiction of modern military life) while being rife with basic technical and procedural errors, showcasing a main character who is almost unilaterally unfit for any leadership position. Simultaneously, the film maligns ground troops with almost comical depictions of cowardice under fire. People watch the movie and, having heard that an embedded journalist wrote the script, walk away with the impression that this is what modern warfare looks like, thus ensuring shitty stereotypes are perpetuated.

Yeah, I have a much bigger problem with that than an obviously tongue-in-cheek comedy series showcasing a bunch of fuckups. Of course everything is wrong... they're *fucked up*. I don't even care that it's not very good, as long as it doesn't try to convince people that it's somehow accurate."

&gt; Black women get caught up in ""Black culature"" and they view things like, wearing pumps and high heels and dolling up as ""white"". I asked my sister why she doesn't put a perm in her hair and I don't know, comb it like a regular girl does and she says **""I don't want to look like a white girl""...well okay but don't come crying when all the black boys in your school don't want to date you which is the case now.**

To boil down his reply as simply a list of things he finds attractive and unattractive is false and really is a disservice to a well thought out post on something that is very complex. I might not agree with it, but it's not as simple as you're making it out to be. That bolded part is institutional racism at its worst and his sister and others like her are victims because some want them to reject who they are.

mikelek,relationships,1389508419.0,"I think pushing her would be a bad idea. Personally, I have ended it with every boyfriend who has ever ""pushed"" me. It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and used. 

My boyfriend now was fantastic with the way he went about it. We've been together over a year now and he is the longest and most serious relationship I've had. I was shy like her for a very long time when we first began dating. We took things extra slow - most of the times it was just him touching me while we made out. Most of our sessions ended without him getting touched down there at all. I felt pressured to touch him, because I knew I should, but I didn't feel comfortable with it yet. He never did or said anything to get me to do something to him. 

One day I finally took the plunge and started touching him down there, outside of his pants. I was nervous, but I found I liked touching him. Sessions later I was eventually in his pants, and things moved on from there. Everything was in baby steps, and I was slowly becoming comfortable. I told him I wanted him to take my virginity and at 5 months that's what happened. Now I'm super open sexually; I text him dirty things/pictures, I initiate a lot, buy sexy underwear and lingerie, and we try new positions and things all the time. He says he's had the best sexual experiences with me. 

All I'm saying is, it could be worth the wait. I think I surprised my boyfriend with how I turned out - I sure surprised myself. Let her work her way up to it, make her feel as comfortable as possible. Talk to her after your sessions and ask her what she liked and if she was okay with what you were doing. Tell her there's nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about. I think having her become comfortable talking about it first can lead to her willing to reciprocate in the future. "

Gertiel,raisedbynarcissists,1389508429.0,"For me, it has helped to remember the GC child, even as an adult, has a role to play they are pushed into by the nParent(s). Because their role is the role of the 'good son', they probably are much less likely to be truly aware of it. Understandable because playing that role means things go their way and who wants to argue when things go their way? All the same, they are not free to be themselves, nor are they allowed to learn about the world from their own trial and error. 

I suppose it helps that I am much older than my GC sibs, and I have a couple of good friends who were the GC in their own little narcissistic families. My experience has been when the parents are no longer there to support and direct the GC, they often find their lives falling apart. I think this is a big reason why you get the older people who seem to have a very bad late midlife crisis. Most people's parents are gone somewhere around midlife.

The best thing you can do right now is concentrate on yourself and on getting that college degree. If a job is necessary, then it is necessary. Maybe not even so much for the money as for the acceptable reason to avoid as much of the bad stuff your parents dish out as possible. Getting yourself to a good, financially stable point is an excellent goal that will pay big dividends to you in the near years. It will ensure you the freedom to hold your dealings with your family on your terms, so don't let the degree studies slip! 

If there is one thing I uniformly admire in the posters here it is their ability to survive adversity. I know you can do what is necessary. You've already proved it by surviving this far. Good luck!"

GeeJo,AskHistorians,1389508557.0,"* My first degree was actually a BSc in Chemistry. I went on to spend several years working in a geotechnical laboratory and, frankly, did not enjoy myself very much. I think what started me down the path I ended up on was actually pretty prosaic - the National Trust offer ridiculously cheap rates to under-30s, and it made for a lot of very affordable days out (and a decent filter for dates, too - if they found going round an old manor house as interesting as I did, chances were pretty good that we'd get on with one another.) From there I started going to museums and wanting to learn more about the art pieces I was seeing there. When the lab I was working at went under in the Recession, I returned for another go at University with an Art History course. I graduated last year.

* I took up making [dorodango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorodango) as a hobby that nicely intersected my job working on soil samples and my interest in art. We got quite a few contracts from famous locations around the UK, and I made sure to take a jar of dirt from the cast-offs to play around with at home. Sadly, they haven't fared too well with all the moving about I've been doing recently, so I've left them at my parents' house. **EDIT: wow, that wiki pic is a terrible example of a dorodango.

spoonfedsam,SuicideWatch,1389508661.0,"Fall of last year was probably the most miserable I have ever been. I was depressed and thought about suicide every day. I even tried to strangle myself with a lanyard. But I sought out help. I stayed at a psych hospital for several days and I was able to get medication. I am now seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and they are doing wonders for me.

However, it still took me awhile for me to consider myself fully ""better"". I was still experiencing suicidal thoughts and depression up until last week. I had to go to the emergency room at a psych hospital, where they prescribed me another antidepressant. 

I can say now that for the first time in a LONG time, I have gone several days without having suicidal thoughts, and I feel the best I ever have.

Although I could have easily ended it back in the fall, I am really glad I didn't. I stuck it out and fought for as long as I could and things ended up improving.

So I say this: stick it out. Keep fighting. Seek help. Go to a hospital. Things aren't gonna start improving unless you take action. Once things start improving, you will start to see the stuff you would have missed out on. I know what it feels like....not having the will to live anymore...just wanting the pain to go away. It's hard. But I am glad I stuck it out, because things have definitely gotten better for me. I would have missed out on finally owning a cat. I would have missed out on another semester of school. I would have missed out on finding the love of my life and finally having sex (both of which have yet to happen)

So yeah, just stick it out, man. There's just too much for us to miss out on.

But when I was 18, I found out that I was infertile, and I mourned my fertility. Suddenly, there was nothing I wanted more in the world than a baby, and I'd just been told I couldn't have one. As the shock wore off I came to terms with it and realized how much I don't like kids, and how it was a momentary pang of desire for a child.

I think, for me at least, it's like when you're told ""nothing to eat or drink after 7PM."" You're not hungry/thirsty at all at 6:59, but suddenly once 7:00 hits and you CAN'T have anything, you want nothing more than a burger and coke. :)"

If you're disabling one element of it, the only way to do it is to add an aspect of disabled x. If you overcome, you're taking out the entire aspect. The system just isn't flexible enough. In CP you just say your character disables it, and if nobody spends a resource to oppose it, that's what happens.

The Mexican sombrero Halloween costume or the Indian headdress is an issue because it's endorsing a stereotype: it's like dressing up in blackface.

Building the most common type of app - a list view / detail view sort of setup?  Phonegap type apps will do you just fine.  Building a graphically intensive app, a music app, or a game?  Probably not your best option.

If you're going the webapp route, i'd suggest you look into a mobile framework like Sencha Touch. It'll handle common tasks like screen transitions etc that you shouldn't waste time reinventing.  There's a learning curve, and there's some tools that not everyone discovers before they give up on that learning curve (e.g. Sencha Cmd for deployment, which strips out all of the classes / code you're not using from Sencha Touch to only deploy the lightest possible bit of the framework in your app), but people who get past that learning curve generally find it very much worthwhile.

Disclosure: I do work for Sencha, but Sencha Touch is free and I honestly and unbiasedly feel it's your best option. The company I worked for before ending up there used Sencha Touch to build a mobile app.

blue_eyes13,MakeupAddiction,1389509603.0,"I'm a little late to the party here but I figured I'd chime in. I haven't had acne as severe as you are dealing with but have had it all over my body pretty bad and constantly since I was about 18. A lot of it had to do with the birth control I was on at the time I think, and using the wrong shampoo/conditioners/soaps/lotions. I found once I started using stuff that was all natural my skin cleared up A LOT. Shampoos and conditioners like pantene, loreal, tresseme, and most hair products sold at salons REALLY broke me out big time. After researching I'm pretty sure it's because sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate is such a harsh degreasing agent (same stuff they use to clean oil off garage floors, and is in the majority of soaps and shampoos as well) that they then will put waxes and silicone based ingredients back in it to make your skin and hair not feel so dry. The SLS is irritating and the wax and silicones clog up your pores- bad combo. 
My favorites are the burts bees fabulously fresh body wash, witch hazel for toner, yes to blueberries shampoo and conditioner, Alba mango shampoo and conditioner....all of these you can get at target.

Nope. In fact, she seemed very satisfied with the answer.

In that moment, she wasn't on the defensive. She didn't feel the need to justify herself or her behaviours to me. Neither her comfort nor her beta-provisioning were under threat at that moment. She'd just had an earth-shattering orgasm and was filled with bonding chemicals. Everything was right with the world, so why bother with deception?

Euryleia,starcitizen,1389509983.0,"I think most people are hyped for what's basically a modern Wing Commander coupled with a Freelancer-like persistent universe afterwards.  I don't see any reason to think we won't get that.

I'm not sure what exactly you think most people think they're getting that they won't actually get.  You mention a few more niche features, but I don't see any reason to think that most people think those things will be the major focus of the gameplay.  Quite the opposite; for example, I've seen plenty of threads where people question why there are even multi-crew ships, with people asking why you would settle for being crew on someone else's ship when you can fly your own?

It seems like perhaps you were overhyped on those ideas at first, then reality set in, and are assuming most people aren't as smart as you so reality won't ever set in for them?  I both doubt that those particular features are what the average player is hyped about, and doubt that those who might have been haven't figured the same things you have regarding these.

I don't see much in the way of unrealistic expectations.  I see lot of people saying other people have unrealistic expectations, but ""not me, of course.""  No one actually claiming that CR is the messiah, but a lot of people claiming other people are claiming CR is the messiah.  Etc.  It makes for a great story, I guess, and makes you feel so *tres cool* to be the counter-fan who's excited but isn't falling for the hype like ""everyone else"" is.  Wonderful ego-boosting narrative, but not really true.  In reality, most people are just like you: cautiously optimistic."

I don't know.  I like my 4x4, and I have a megaminx in the mail.  I know the 4x4, at least for basic reduction, will require at least three algorithms (edge pairing, OLL/PLL).  I don't know what goes into the megaminx, but it presents its own challenges simply by having more faces/edges/corners.

I like my ShengShou 4x4, and I ordered a Dayan megaminx because I like how they design their pieces/puzzles.  The ShengShou 4x4 is decently quick OOTB, doesn't squeak (I haven't lubed/tensioned it), and is a darn fine cube to have.

Somehow, I haven't broken the inner pieces, either.  They catch, but the mechanism lets them move a bit, so you don't rip them out faster than you can catch the issue.

The Dayan megaminx I ordered is the V1, which I bought because it's what I found, but more specifically, it's a decent enough puzzle.  The pieces should let it move quickly, and smoothly, with decent corner cutting.  Based on what I've seen, it should handle like a Zhanchi, quick and crispy.

As /u/cube1916 mentioned, you'll learn stuff on 4x4 that you can apply to other higher order cubes, so it'll benefit you more if you go that route."

&gt; **This blog is one-sided! Women do terrible things, too!**

&gt;Here‚Äôs the thing; 
Yes, women can do terrible things to men and other women. Women can be racist, misogynistic, cissexist, homophobic, you name it. But none of that changes the fact that we live within a society that is oppressive to women. Being marginalized doesn‚Äôt excuse sexual abuse, violence or the marginalization of others, and women who do these things most definitely should be held accountable for their actions - but saying ‚Äúwomen do bad things, too!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt magically erase systemic oppression, which is the whole point of this blog.

And yeah, I knew what you meant. :) I was just curious more than anything. Since they were serious about the $800, I figured there would be *some* truth to it. Hearing the price/easy labor aspect..it seriously blows my mind that they get away with charging people those prices. One of the reasons I even went was because several people had commented on Google reviews that they were ""honest and very reasonably priced."" Main reason was because I use my car for work and my normal mechanic was fully booked for almost a week. My normal mechanic is almost crazy cheap but does a great job. I had 4 break pads/rotors/calibers (is that right?) replaced, and oil changed and tipped off fluids in one go for under $200.

Anyway, again, I appreciate the advice. I've never done anything like replacing parts by myself, and my father isn't with me anymore so I would be worried I would fuck up replacing it..haha. I'll probably go with the $165 place so I know it's right and have a warranty and all that."

Aside from the terrible graphics, what would you recommend I improve?

My problems so far have been the placement of the circles:

I tried to implement a x^blue - x^red must be &gt; than n

      (the point being that they do not spawn on top of one another)

But that didn't work well so I basically divided the values to have one spawn on one half of the screen and the other on the other half.

[something like: (red x (-180,0); red y (-240,0); // blue x (0;180); blue y (0;240)]

If you have an idea as to how I could go about re-randomizing spawning point if they spawn too close, I'd like to work on that!

I know things were incredibly shaky at the end of last season, but he's flourished in the system and is in tight with Eakins. I think we could definitely re-sign him. That said, Gagner...God only knows if moving his contract would net enough. Perhaps a Gagner for Grigorenko &amp; something else trade would go down well. I wouldn't mind at all. 

However, as always this leads back to development and youth. He has to go back to junior, and he has to accept it. He can't stay up at the NHL level. If the Sabres, of all clubs, wanted to stick him back in the drawer, the Oilers keeping him up would only hamper his development. One year in the AHL after that and then up to the big club for a 3rd line job with potential to move up would be my progression.

it's possible that convection currents could still cook the food evenly enough but that depends on a many factors.

also, all the heat being restricted near the bottom, and radiated back down, could overheat the element.

and if nobody cares about this science shit, the short answer is it isnt covered in your warranty if you damage your oven with foil. see here: http://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/1v0bpb/sick_of_cleaning_your_oven_wrap_the_bottom_rack/cenie0y"

&gt;Evolutionary psychology (EP) is an approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological traits such as memory, perception, and language from a modern evolutionary perspective.

Now I want you to imagine an average person. Now with that person I want you to imagine another person almost exactly the same, the only difference being is that this person is now on cocaine. Are these people going to behave differently? Hell yes. Because one has a chemical in their brain that the other doesn't have. What we can conclude is chemicals effect the brain and body, and thus how we think and act. 

Now lets tie this back to humans. Men (on average) have significantly higher levels of testosterone than women, and experience huge bursts of this chemical at certain points in their life. This has an overall effect on their brains and their bodies, and thus much like cocaine or some other chemical will change our thought patterns. Thus it would be reasonable to conclude that there are differences between the men and women in how they think from evolutionary and biological process in the form of testosterone production. 

Now if reasoning doesn't do it for you, there are numerous studies to show how testosterone effects the brain. I unfortunately can't pull them up for you in a way that you can read them (university access and all that), but here's one that I'm pretty sure you'll atleast be able to read the abstract.

TCsnowdream,funny,1389511448.0,"Hi /u/Yoppyomocoro I'm a gaikokujin in Tokyo right now. My biggest gripes with Japanese websites are...

**1. The Japanese websites have a terrible, outdated layout that often become terrible English websites.**

While the Japanese website layout is OK for Japanese people, since that is what they expect and are used to, keep it the same. For English speakers, create a more intuitive and visual webpage. You should look at SOFTBANK for a good example of an intuitive website.

**2. English Websites often have no information on them or vital information (Phone numbers, addresses, extensions) are difficult to find.** 

You could remedy this by having a simple 'contact us' or 'information' section that seems to be missing from *so many* Japanese websites. If you can **not** provide numbers, say so - It should not be a mystery.

For example, look at the [Nitori Website](http://www.nitori.co.jp/en/) for English. It's terrible. It has no information and no functionality for an English speaker. It's just for investors. The end result? I don't go shop at Nitori. I take my money to Ikea!

**3. English on the English page. It needs to be fluent and perfect. I and many of my gaikokujiin friends will pick apart many small errors on a webpage. Campaign ad's are especially notorious for mistake - ""Let's Dancing!"" ""Let's Vitamin!""** 

Hire native speakers. Hire native *ENGLISH* speakers who are gaikokujin. A Japanese person with a TOEIC score of 990 is great! But they still can not compare to a native English speaker who was born and raised abroad. If your website is going to use slang or attempt to use 'Engrish' to be ironic, you *must* hire a foreigner to handle it properly. 

If you have a lot of high-level English speakers on your staff, then you can set the threshold for English speakers to a lower level for hiring - N3 or even N4 instead of N2 or N1. They should also be allowed to have a very, very heavy influence on the end result. If you can hire more than one, who can cover each others mistakes - even better!!

If you're really nervous and want the best feedback - hire a foreigner! :D

*edit* - Edited formatting and grammarz."

Accidents WILL happen, absolutely.  People drive too tired, angry, distracted, whatever.  But low tolerance levels for driving under the influence do decrease some percentage of people who are borderline and unwilling to take a risk at losing their license.

There is the most dangerous risks that you will never get off the roads because even losing their license will not deter them from driving and they will generally be drunker than most people.  The best we can hope is those people will end up imprisoned before they kill someone.

Drinking lowers your response time.

Arc implies a planned out story with beginning, middle, and end. Knowing where you're going to go and how you're going to get there. I like arcs.  

Mystery is starting a story with a premise and characters, but not knowing the endgame. The ""crash landing on an island."" The ""prisoners coming back from Arcatraz."" The ""electricity is gone."" The ""robots destroy humanity and there's one warship left guarding the paltry remnants."" Mystery is bad, because it ends up creating bad deus ex machinas and disappointing endings.

Even though he seemed completely fine and his performance was top notch, i informed HR and the matter was then between he and our benefits administrator to work out. I could not inquire about details beyond saying that I hoped he was well soon and that we'd take care of things in his absence. I never snooped or dug around for the reason behind his sudden need for temporary disability and was very annoyed when a loose-lipped mutual friend informed me that he (the employee) suffered from severe alcoholism and was in residential treatment for it. Yes, I was angry at our mutual friend for not respecting such private information and for sharing it with me, his boss, when it was not my place to have insight into such private matters. He returned to work several months later and trust me when I tell you that had I ever discussed the alleged details of his temporary disability, I would have been in hot water for it.

ScipiiRye,WTF,1389512188.0,"&gt; radical gender egalitarians

Heh. What exactly is a ""radical"" egalitarian going to say? ""Grr, men and women should be equal! Or else! Death to the sexist...archy! Say no to double standards that affect both genders!"" There's no such thing.

Egalitarianism is about equality in and of itself, not just of gender. The same cannot be said about feminism, since there are feminists (though they are radical) that *do not believe in gender equality.* TERFs, for example, don't believe that transwomen are ""real women,"" and instead believe that they're some sort of group of undercover rape commando vying to invade women's spaces. There are also sects of feminism that believe that gay men are the worst kind of misogynists; that think that they hate women *so much* that they'd rather have sex with other men in order to avoid women. You also have your run of the mill ""kill all men"" feminists like Dworkin and Solanas. 

Or Germaine ""Drink your own menstrual blood"" Greer. Or the one who said in so many words that ""men falsely accused of rape have something to be gained from the experience,"" which I could find a name and a quote for but I don't think it'll make a difference in terms of convincing you.

The answer that people like to respond that is always ""Not All Feminists Are Like That"" which is true! But it's also irrelevant, because though moderate feminists like to say that they're in the minority, you can't prove that. There is very little in the way of ""moderate feminist"" academic literature. ""The crazies always yell the loudest!"" is another, which is again, true! But the ""crazies"" also publish a lot more than the moderates do, so either they're getting a disproportionate amount of attention and work done, or they're not so small a minority as you'd like to believe.

Feminism is about women's rights, and *only* women's rights, for better or for worse. That's not equality, that's *women's rights.* Women's rights =! equality. They're an important *component* of equality, but they are most certainly not the be all and end all of equality.

Egalitarianism is not the same as feminism, claiming that it is displays a fundamental lack in understanding towards both ideologies. 
I know a great deal about feminism and feminists, academic and ""mainstream"" both. I've done my research. I am in a position to make my own opinions based on that, and if I'm to labelled ""anti-feminist"" then so be it.

&gt; If you choose to guilt people by association

I ""guilt"" the ideology, not the people. And people should always be prepared to face criticism from those who do not agree with their ideology. What does that say of their ideology if all they can do is accuse its critics of ""wearing fedoras"" and ""being neckbearded""?

&gt; then by the same logic you are running with an even worse crowd

How? Because if you're not a feminist you're clearly a misogynist? What are you implying by this? It's not black and white. There is no ""feminists v misogynists"". The ""you're either with or us or against"" mentality is not the right one to have here.

redwhiskeredbubul,badlinguistics,1389512225.0,"I read historical sources in Japanese. I've mostly seen katakana used as furigana in very early modern Japanese stuff (1870's-1880's.) Katakana are sometimes used as furigana when foreign loanwords or proper names are written with Kanji, e.g. ÂÄ´Êï¶ for 'London.' This convention has persisted a lot longer and is still in modern usage. 

There are a lot of other historical and stylistic variations in usage beyond this, like writing womens' names with katakana (this is a really old practice) or writing official documents in katakana instead of hiragana (this continued until the end of WWII and is maddening--there's a name for this style but I forget it).

But L.Ron mostly would have been dealing with Hiragana. He's confused about the terminology. "

kempff,Catholicism,1389512270.0,"In the letter to the Philadelphians Ignatius repeats themes for other letters, such as an overall emphasis on unity, keeping one's body holy, avoiding association with people who hold unorthodox opinions and heresies, the centrality of the bishop.

""Keep yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, because they are not the planting of the Father."" Jesus preferred the analogy of sheep in a sheepfold, but Ignatius may have in mind the Garden of Eden, with Jesus as the new Adam.

""May I have pleasure in your purity, as that of Elijah, or as of Joshua the son of Nun, as of Melchizedek, or as of Elisha, as of Jeremiah, or as of John the Baptist, as of the beloved disciple, as of Timothy, as of Titus, as of Evodius, as of Clement, who departed this life in [perfect] chastity, Not, however, that I blame the other blessed [saints] because they entered into the married state, of which I have just spoken."" Again, Timothy and Titus were real people. But Ignatius' point is that these people forwent marriage. I guess they could handle it. But still, remaining unmarried has a firmly established precedent in Christianity.

""Let governors be obedient to Caesar; soldiers to those that command them; deacons to the presbyters, as to high-priests; the presbyters, and deacons, and the rest of the clergy, together with all the people, and the soldiers, and the governors, and Caesar [himself], to the bishop; the bishop to Christ, even as Christ to the Father. And thus unity is preserved throughout."" Ignatius believes Caesar should be obedient to the bishop. That's a rather daring point of view to hold, and much was made of this idea over the history of Christianity, from the Pope crowning Charlemagne, to another Pope excommunicating the English monarch and thereby absolving the subjects of obedience, turning all Catholics into traitors to the crown. But I digress. The Roman emperor at this point would have been Trajan, and I don't think Trajan would have agreed with Ignatius.

""But your prayer to God shall make me perfect, that I may attain to that portion which through mercy has been allotted me, while I flee to the Gospel as to the flesh of Jesus, and to the apostles as to the presbytery of the Church."" Ignatius equates the flesh of Jesus with the Gospel, and the presbytery with the apostles. Ignatius doesn't think of the Gospel as primarily a message, but as a person. If cornered, I wonder if Ignatius would admit believing in something like Apostolic Succession.

But both of these attitudes - as well as many others Ignatius holds - are quite unlike what I find in modern Protestantism. Maybe it's just a difference in emphasis, but I do know that many Protestants explicitly deny Apostolic Succession. At the risk of sounding cynical, they pretty much have to, don't they? Because otherwise they would have a lot of explaining to do.

""For as the false prophets and the false apostles drew [to themselves] one and the same wicked, deceitful, and seducing spirit; so also did the prophets and the apostles receive from God, through Jesus Christ, one and the same Holy Spirit, who is good, and sovereign, and true, and the Author of [saving] knowledge."" Hebrews calls Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, but Ignatius calls the Holy Spirit the author of knowledge. Interesting. John, on the other hand, identifies Jesus with the Logos, the rational principle behind the universe. I wonder if Ignatius would admit that the Holy Spirit in the trinity is Love.

""For there is one God of the Old and New Testament, one Mediator between God and men, for the creation of both intelligent and sensitive beings, and in order to exercise a beneficial and suitable providence [over them]."" Again we have a direct quote, this time from 1 Timothy 2:5, making it seem unlikely that the pastoral epistles were pseudonymous products of a Pauline school. Sometimes I wonder how some scholars take themselves seriously. I guess no idea is so outlandish that some academic hasn't published it.

Ignatius sees the God of the Old and New Testaments as one and the same; apparently it never occurred to him that the God of the Old is a God of hate, and that of the new is a God of love. But then again I doubt he had 12 years of Catholic school.

Ignatius refers to a ""New Testament"", proving that the anthology was already a thing by his time. I'm not so sure all 27 items were enumerated together as we have them now, and Ignatius so far hasn't referred to Peter (his predecessor in Antioch) or his encyclicals. But I hear that the four canonical gospels were already considered a unit, as another bishop Irenaeus in Lyons says, ""There are four gospels and only four, neither more nor less: four like the points of the compass, four like the chief directions of the wind."" Irenaeus lived right after Ignatius, and probably never saw any History Channel documentaries.

If you want to know what everyone is talking about and can spare 90 minutes check out ""Banned From The Bible"" at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuVKZCb9N4o I enjoy documentaries of this type because every couple of minutes someone says something that can provoke an all-night argument in a seminary dorm and make people spend an entire afternoon looking things up on the internet.

""There is also one Comforter, who displayed His power in Moses, and the prophets, and apostles. All the saints, therefore, were saved by Christ, hoping in Him, and waiting for Him; and they obtained through Him salvation, being holy ones, worthy of love and admiration, having testimony borne to them by Jesus Christ, in the Gospel of our common hope."" Ignatius answers the question of how people were saved before Jesus, one of the most important questions the early Christians needed to answer in order to justify distinguishing themselves from Judaism.

Speaking of which, Ignatius warns against the doctrines of Judaism in the next section, but deals with them together with other heresies concerning the nature of Jesus. En route Ignatius mentions Simon Magus the sorcerer whom we know from Acts 8, the Nicolaitans whom we know from Revelation 2, Ebionites whom we know from history; he repeats descriptions of their various teachings that we are already familiar with from his other letters.

""And such a man is poor in understanding, even as by name he is an Ebionite."" The Hebrew word ebiyon means poor, as in poverty. Apparently the Ebionities believed Jesus was the Messiah but didn't believe he was divine.

""When I heard some saying, If I do not find it in the ancient Scriptures, I will not believe the Gospel; on my saying to them, It is written, they answered me, That remains to be proved."" That sounds familiar.

""But the Gospel possesses something transcendent [above the former dispensation], viz., the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, His passion and resurrection."" I have heard that the kernel of the Gospel message is Jesus' passion and resurrection, not so much his birth. Indeed Paul barely mentions it, only saying he was born of a virgin.

""For those things which the prophets announced, saying, 'Until He come for whom it is reserved, and He shall be the expectation of the Gentiles,' have been fulfilled in the Gospel, [our Lord saying, ] 'Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.'"" A direct quotation from the end of Matthew. And some scholars have said Matthew must have been written after 70, since it refers to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple. Yet here Ignatius is quoting it 40 years later. That doesn't make sense. I think Matthew was written earlier. By Matthew.

I know a shit-ton of white guys who say that they find some black women attractive, but end to shy away from knowing them because of the stereotypes (which are rooted in fact), or the baggage (kids, poverty, racist parents, etc).

HungoverDiver,scuba,1389512635.0,"To answer your question succinctly, no.

&gt; Since intake of oxygen is the main reason we need to breathe, I suspect that we might get away with breathing less total volume of gas because of this.

Actually this is a common misconception. The physiological trigger that regulates breathing is actually CO2. When CO2 increases in blood, as a result of cellular respiration, the breathing reflex is triggered. CO2 in an aqueous solution, such as blood, is actually carbonic acid, H2CO3, a strong acid and will lose a proton and become HCO3^- . This drop in blood pH, if allowed to continue, will lead to coma and death since acidic blood is bad for brain activity. Therefore the brain has evolved reflexes to respond to a drop in blood pH with increased ventilation which will off gas the CO2.


This is why hyperventilating, which will off gas more CO2 than a normal breathing rate, before free diving will suppress the breathing reflex.

So your breathing rate will be the same if you are on air, EAN30, EAN50 or 100% O2.

&gt;Does the extra oxygen reduce the volume of Nitrox consumed per unit of time, as compared to air or does the extra oxygen just ‚Äúgo away‚Äú?

Not sure what you mean by thus? Your ventilation rate will be the same, so the extra O2 is used at the same rate as the rest of the gas.

ManWithoutModem,halo,1389512712.0,"&gt; By posting and whining on 343 forums about how its ""bullshit"" that dominion gets to be there but ""pro"" gametypes don't.

Okay, assuming that this is true for the sake of the argument - why can't/why didn't 343i just include both gametypes?

And there already was a competitive playlist. So you are saying that the competitive players complained for the removal of Dominion because they wanted Action Sack? wat

&gt;You yourself have said dominion was broken, because it was too ""casual"" or whatever, same as Invasion and Big Team games in general. No I don't have a link because it was in IRC or Xbox live chat

lol, I played the gametypes a ton. Even if something is casual, that doesn't mean that it can't be fun. I did have a lot of fun on huge maps doing [lots of stuff.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ84Gzs2lHk)

Navi1101,Frugal,1389512761.0,"Do you have a crock pot? Because if not you totally should. Pork shoulder (also called pork butt; don't ask me why) is one of the most delicious bulk meals you can eat on the cheap, and if it's just you it'll feed you for a good week at least on &amp;lt;$20.

I get 8 lb butts at Safeway for $10-12, with the bone and fat in because it adds a lot of flavor (or you can save the fat for cooking with later!).

Things you can throw in the crock pot along with the pork butt: 

* Potatoes
* Beets
* Carrots
* any old root vegetable that's on sale
* Onions
* Fresh garlic
* Apples
* Kale - dem vitamins!
* Mustard greens
* Chiles
* Bottom-shelf white wine
* Onion soup mix
* Sriracha chile sauce
* basically just empty your spice rack into the thing

How I made the big-ass bowl of pulled pork in my fridge:

&gt;1x 2qt crock pot
1x 8 lb pork shoulder \(with bone and fat\)
1 medium-sized russet potato
1 beet
1 big ol' carrot
1/2 yellow onion
3-5 cloves minced garlic \(I wasn't counting\)
2/3 bottle bottom-shelf pinot grigio
~1.5 Tbsp salt
a few squirts of Sriracha chile sauce

&gt;Throw all at stuff into the crock pot; cook on high for 3-4 hours while you finish off the crappy wine. Turn crock pot down to low, then continue cooking overnight. In the morning, extract veggies, juice, and shoulder bone, then attack meat and fat with forks until you have delicious pulled pork, with a side of delicious veggies! Reduce the juice down to about half and slowly whisk in some flour for a delicious spicy gravy.

Hope that helps!"

Saiyaman,GrandTheftAutoV,1389513247.0,"&gt; Mission Rewards were adjusted at one point to give lowered payouts because there would have otherwise been less incentive to buy the Shark Card micro transactions.

Why does everyone here think that Rockstar is forcing players to get shark cards? They've made enough money with the sales of the game alone and if that was the situation, then the DLC would have not been free. IIRC, the only missions that were nerfed were the ones that everybody was repeating, deathmatches and regular missions still paid out well. Also what everyone here seems to forget is the stimulus. But most here probably blew it in a day, and want to blame Rockstar for that.

&gt; The idea behind Ranking Up and your unlockable rewards in GTA Online is horribly imbalanced towards players not willing to 'game' the system: ranking up faster gives you access to better weapons, which allows you to kill other players better. This focus encourages the idea of 'grinding' one mission over and over again. No player finds grinding the same mission over and over again 'fun'. No one.

Again, there's no need to grind the same mission over and over again. And with the content creator introduced, it's possible to make anywhere from 3k-20k, depending on the amount of people in the game, how long it is, and if you win or lose. That adds a ton of variety, but the problem there is that most seemed to ignore that feature.

&gt; Your statement that grinding is the intended design is exactly the problem. Again, no one wants to grind the same mission over and over again, so why design an online mode that demands hundreds of hours gameplay to reach a satisfactory result, when you could have designed it to require far less time and be much more fun? 

Again, you don't have to grind the same ones over and over. At first there usually were not many choices if you weren't at a high enough level, then the content creator was introduced, for that purpose.

&gt; Do you see how saying ""They meant to do that!"" isn't an actual argument to the merit of this choice?

But it's true. That is how the game was supposed to be. You work your way toward things. And with the mission creator rumored to come into the game soon, there will be another option to make money that most here will ignore.

Zinn was out to write what amounted to an introductory text to a progressive or small-d democratic or whatever term you want overview of U.S. history. It's designed to challenge your status quo opinion. It is not, and he arguably did not intend it as, a final explanation of the real history.

terp02andrew,buildapc,1389513749.0,"Not one question about what resolution, expectations on graphics quality (low/med/high/ultra), or type and amount of AA preferred, etc :P

The only thing you need to upgrade is your GPU anyway. I would also argue, in agreement with 420dope, that you look at a slightly higher card than the 270X. [Your 6950 performs fairly close to a 7850](http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Sapphire/HD_7870_Flex/28.html). Moving to the 270X (basically a rebrand of the 7870) is [not a significant bump in performance](http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/AMD/R9_270X/26.html) - looks like maybe +24-25% (from a 75% or 76%), if we set the 270X as the reference point at 100%.

**I would go for no less than a 50% performance increase if you want to make your upgrade really worthwhile**. This means we are looking at closer to a 680/770 or the R9 280X (price is way-inflated over MSRP right now). You are free to go with a lesser card of course, but your upgrade would be more *incremental*. Incremental is not necessarily a bad thing of course, but if you want this GPU upgrade to last, you will need to spend a bit more. 

To give you a personal example, I was considering a 'slight' upgrade from a 580 to a 680, but ultimately decided that I would need to go to a 780 to have a longer-lasting upgrade."

robotfriend,SexPositive,1389514049.0,"So you eventually got there on your own, it doesn't have to be a fixed number for each man; it could be a range of partners, different to each individual. The zero-sum game you're equating the quantity of sexual partners to is just off-putting, to me. You're not wrong that slut shaming is a problem, but I feel like you've completely neglected the reality that not everyone participates in it, and for those that do, participation can come in pretty varying degrees (often dependent on culture).

You've also reduced all women to passive bystanders in their own sexuality, as if we simply are not capable of ignoring the collective and owning our own sexuality as one of many mechanisms to overcome slut shaming.  I understand that many, many women do not feel empowered to do this.  If that's the case, the slut shaming is merely another symptom of a bigger disease. If it isn't the case, *I really mean this, see my italics? Who the fuck cares what other people think about your sexuality?* Don't fuck those people.

Also unaccounted for: fluctuating sexual drives, lower libidos or asexuality.. All with their own stigmas attached. In your survey of the structure of slut shaming, all men want to fuck all the time, but will only fuck women with x &lt; (whatever magical number we're assigning 'non sluts') previous sexual partners.

So here's what I take issue with. Trying to distill such a multifaceted issue down to this one linear, absolutely undeviating narrative to ...compare sexuality to gold? It's as though you had this place you wanted to wind up with slut shaming, and just haphazardly tried to make the rest of your reasoning follow suit to reach that end goal.

Yeah, my birthday comes along, I work a 10 hour day, and get home super pumped and excited to be going to a nice dinner. 

My mother is sadly disabled, blind and very ill and she was too ill to do anything and my father got called into work. Ultimately I ended up having to take my mom to the ER - The fact my birthday was shot I think was worse on her, she felt guilty for being sick. Which ultimately made me sad. 

Yeah, so a few days later my dad takes me to a bar down the street from us so he can drink, so we both can have a drink. The gal behind the bar was covering for a friend (The actual bartender), but had NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL. 

All she knew how to do was pour shots and (barely could) pour beer and make a mudslide. That was it. 

SO my dad and I ended up getting wasted on Whiskey and mudslides. A few days later, tried a different bar only to have a trainee on who didn't know the difference between gin and vodka, and was too afraid to really make anything.

When you play SC2, you can have unlimited amount of units in a hotkey group. You can hot key multiple buildings. You can rally units. You can SHFT + COMMAND. Workers can be automated to mine in the beginning of the game. SC2 pretty much simplifies BW.

In BW, you could only have 12 units per hotkey group. Basically it just took more skill to be dominant in BW than it did in SC2. Protoss in SC2 is just gimmicky. Oracles that kills workers in 1 second, warp in units, and a gimmick mothership core. I personally feel like BW was a bit more balanced than SC2 was.

People tend to just put their nostalgia glasses and just favor BW. Also BW at its peak was way more popular than HOTS is now. And the BW single player story campaign was a lot better than WoTs or HoTS.

ScipiiRye,WTF,1389514785.0,"&gt; And feminism is absolutely about egalitarianism

They are not the same ideologies at all. [Egalitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism) is an aspect of liberalism. [Feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism) is a whole other collection of ideologies that often can have *nothing to do with liberalism.*

Equality = egalitarianism = feminism are not interchangeable synonyms.

Thus far I have been quite specific in making sure that I am not treating ""feminism"" as a monolithic entity, hence my frequent use of ""radical,"" ""some,"" ""many,"" and complete absence of ""all,"" ""majority,"" and whatever universalist language you've accused me of using.

All the aspects of feminism you don't like that I've described are separate from each other, but they're still ideas put forth by feminists under the banner of feminism, and as radical as they are they are still part of feminist ideology. I'm sorry that bothers you. But instead of attacking me personally for pointing this out, it should serve as a moment of self-reflection, you should be asking yourself, ""okay, people are criticising my ideology, is there any truth to their arguments?""

Equality is a noble goal, but people need to realize that feminism is but a proposed means to that end. It's a tool. Like any tool, it can be misused, and it is.

It is wrong and completely *not* egalitarian for feminism to have a monopoly on ""gender equality,"" which it currently does in western society. Look at how legitimate MRAs are treated; are you familiar with Big Red and the U of T? 

&gt; It happens to focus on women's inequality.

Yes, it does, and by itself that's a good thing. But I've often seen the argument that feminism should speak for men too, in order to totally solve all inequalities on their own. How can it do that if it focuses entirely on *women's inequality*? Unless you're willing to argue that men face no inequalities, then it's not really equality, is it?

And I mean, look at the responses I'm getting for daring to be critical of feminism. Come on. People should be able to defend their positions without going ""lol neckbeard.""

I'm just going to point out the flaw in this logic and then go to bed... You can't state something is wrong and then proceed to blame it on Harvin for the route he ran. There was an apparently intentional leading with your helmet and aiming for Harvin's head. You can have big hits without coming in contact with the receivers helmet. See Kam Chancellor's hit on Vernon Davis last year that everyone going... It looked bad, sure, it was very physical and flags were thrown. But slowed down you see that no part of Kam's body touched Davis' helmet ... In that case a concussion was the unfortunate yet unintentional result. In THIS case the concussion was seemingly the INTENDED result. I'd like to think I would be intellectually honest about this had the situation been reversed. I just think there is NO place for big hits in the NFL if the intention to hurt is encouraged or allowed."

* she *reluctantly* agrees that our children must not be indoctrinated

Sounds like your core beliefs aren't in line.  Sure you care about each other, but why make a lifelong commitment to someone who doesn't share the same understanding as you?

*  she has these intrusive thoughts such as god punishing her harshly for a stupid reason and send us to hell or break us apart, some come in the form of prayer so that I leave her or cheat on her, or die in some terrible accident. She becomes extremely upset after those attacks and sometimes breaks down crying, other days feels extremely nervous and stressed all day and can't sleep at night.

Thanks religion!

* I'm starting to think maybe she'd be better off if she didn't believe in god

No shit!  Look what her religious beliefs are doing to her!

* maybe it will backfire and she'll be worse off if I try to persuade her because that god will punish her harshly for turning away from him.

This would be something she would have to work through herself.  It would have to come from within herself, not simply hearing words you or anyone else says.  

* I really hope some of you have some advice to give me

Again, I say get out.  You are moving into a deep commitment with someone who doesn't share the same core values and beliefs as you, as well as having other emotional stuff that she is working through.  

This isn't needed.  You are young, you will both move on.  You can find someone who (even if they have their own emotional baggage) shares the same core beliefs as you.

ashwinmudigonda,writing,1389515264.0,"Recently got done with mine. Here is how I intend to tackle it.

1) Forget it for a couple of months. The heat of writing the first draft stays with you. Your subconscious will work on it. Specific sentences and conversations will automatically bloom, rise to the top, and fade away. Just be aware of all this.

2) When you are ready, print out the draft. Make sure you have page numbers. Print it on a single side so that you can make notes on the left side.

3) Get a pencil (with an eraser), and start reading. Have another notebook by your side. Here, you put down major revisions - ""change voice of character X"", ""This name doesn't work. Go with Y"", etc. All this time you are also looking for typos, and minor plot edits. Be ruthless. Also, preserve this first draft with all your edits. When you become a NYT best seller, 100 years from then, this will sell on eBay for a million bitcoins. Your grandchildren will be rich!

4) Now, your first draft notes are done. Give it a week or so. Let it simmer, and go back to your writing tool and start incorporating all your changes.

5) Find a friend who will help you out by being an objective reader. Give him/her the first three chapters, and ask for feedback on tension, character development, flow, etc. If they are clamoring for the next 3, you are doing fine. If they give any critical feedback, time to revise again.

6) Once this exercise is done, you have a good second draft that has been on a treadmill, keto diet, and has been regular to the crossfit classes. It's lean and mean, but it's still not cooked through yet.

7) Now, you go through it with a fine comb and check for all typos, formatting issues, grammatical flaws, tense mismatches, etc. This round is purely cosmetic.

8) Let the third draft breathe. Give it a couple of weeks. By now your mind has been nonstop living and breathing your characters, and you should actually begin to see through their eyes. If you think all loose ends tie up, and the story is done, start shopping for agents. If you think you want to tweak changes, you may do it one last time. You should know when to stop making changes, and either abandon it for years before looking at it again, or move forward to selling it. This is that time."

p3ndulum,poker,1389515647.0,"The point of the game is to extract as much value as you can from all of your hands played, not to show a positive return from each position, respectively.

Poker, like in business, you have to spend money to make money (or, ""give action to get action""). So you shouldn't get hung up on trying to find a way to show a profit from every seat on the table, but instead you should be working on developing a style of play and image that works to reduce the amount of chips you lose with your weakest hands as well as maximize the amount of chips you win with your strongest hands - and most of that is heavily dependent on controlling the size of the pot, hedging your bets according to your perceived equity and finding ways to win pots without actually having a hand. And all of these things are much easier to do when you have position, which is rarely the case when you are in the big blind.

With that said, some things that I would suggest are, first, try to avoid playing heads-up pots out of the blinds for the most part. If you are goin to put yourself in high risk situations, you should be trying to set yourself up to win the biggest pots possible when you actually flop a strong hand. The more opponents that see the flop, the more likely it'll be that you'll get paid off big when you hit. Being up against a single opponent reduces the odds of there being two hands that are willing to invest significant portions of their stacks.

Also, try to avoid raising out of the blinds with your premium hands. Instead, 3-bet with more speculative hands (but only on rare occasions) in an effort to deceive your opponents, as well as win small-to-medium sized pots with little-to-no equity when you miss the board, and monster pots when you actually connect. Those times where you miss and get played back at, at least you'll have a pretty good idea of where you stand in the hand, and therefore shouldn't be at risk to lose a lot of chips when you have to fold, or feel tempted to call large raises.

The idea is that raising from the blinds is usually an indication that the player who is doing that has a strong hand, so the raise gets a lot of respect, especially when it's followed up with pre-flop action (continuation bets).

The issue with raising out of the blinds with premium hands is that your actions are in line with your opponent's expectations of the relative strength of your hand, which means it becomes easier for them to make the right adjustments and play correctly against you. Usually what ends up happening is you put in the raise, your opponent calls assuming you have a big hand, and then they fold when they miss - winning you a small pot - and then get it all in with you when they flop strong, and then you lose a big pot when you find it difficult to justify folding your over pair after the flop.

Instead, realize that top pairs and over pairs are still going to win their fair share of pots, and look to play them more passively while out of position, exercising good pot control while trying to get to a cheap showdown. If you lose, you'll often be losing much less than you would if you bloated the pot pre flop and then got it all in on the flop, and when you win, you'll often win more than you would if you (again) raised before the flop and then got a fold when you made a c-bet.

At the very least, you'll be minimizing your losses when you have to fold, and money saved in poker is the same as money earned, right?

Additionally, by not raising out of the blinds before the flop, you'll gain deception equity by not giving away the relative strength if your hand by raising, so when you just flat with your pocket kings, for example, your opponent will never be able to guess you for a monster set when a 3rd King hits the flop, setting you up to win, on occasion, a much bigger pot than you would have if you raised. And! Your Kings are going to hold up often enough even when you don't improve where you should still show a decent profit with them that way - you just have to be more disciplined about not overplaying your hands.

The overall theme, I guess, is that if you're going to play out of position, you should be setting yourself up to win monster pots with very strong hands, or small pots with very weak hands. So if you're drawing, make sure there are a lot of potential customers, otherwise look to blow your single opponent off their hand with aggressive play with hands that have a lot of deceptive value, as well as connectivity (i.e. small suited connectors) while being supported by a lot of fold equity because of a strong story/line.

Hope this helps."

terabyte06,NoStupidQuestions,1389515766.0,"I wouldn't think so.  Math takes practice, and without practice you'll forget it.  And some people are just better than others at working with numbers.  

There are also a lot of ""mental math tricks"" that your buddies may be using that you might not know about.

Like finding a 15% tip on a $31.18 bar tab:

First just round to something more reasonable, $30.00.  15% is just 10% + 5%.  So, 10% of $30.00 is $3.00 (just move the decimal over).  5% is just half of that, $1.50.  Add the two together and  you have $4.50.  (15% of 31.18 is $4.68, so it's close enough).

Another one I can think of (that I use pretty often) is multiplying something like 4 x 14.  I don't know what that is, but I can swap the numbers around a bit.  

4 x 14 is the same as 8 x 7 - just cut the 14 in half, and double the 4, if that makes sense.  You know what 8 x 7 is from grade school, I'm sure.  

When I was in high school, there was an academic competition based on just this kind of mental math called ""number sense."""

I purchased a new mazda 2, two years ago. I love it. I got mine for 13k. In retrospect, I should have either bought used or an entirely different car (I've since become more interested in performance). 

With that said, I love my Mazda 2. It's the cheaper option than a Honda Fit or a Ford Fiesta (which is basically the Mazda 2 with more options and a stronger engine). If you buy a used Mazda 2, even maybe 2 years ago, you can find one for about 10-11k, at least in the US. And, more importantly to me, it's just fun to drive. While you're not going to get something like performance feel, it sure does have that zippy feel and turning ability you would want from an econo-box. While it's only a 100 hp, if you get stick, it feels good and rarely would you feel underpowered. I've driven 12+ hour trips multiple times with the car and I've enjoyed it through. Honestly, for a new car under 20k, I'm not sure what more I could have asked for.

am5437435,videos,1389516010.0,"&gt; If you didn't have a door on your house and someone walked in you couldn't really charge them with breaking and entering just trespassing.

Well, they can't be charged with breaking and entering because they didn't ""break"" the door in order to enter the place.

But just because you haven't locked your door doesn't mean you are inviting people to enter your residence.  Similarly, if I don't lock my car when I park it on the street, I'm not inviting people to steal my car or the stuff I have in my car.  As much as I might carry a moral responsibility for being an idiot and not locking my car, I carry no legal responsibility.  The guy who steals my car/things in my car is the only person responsible.

In the case of someone entering into an unsecured place without consent, most jurisdictions have a criminal offence similar to ""being in a place without consent"" which, depending on the circumstances, can carry a sentence as serious as a ""break and enter"" case.  In some places, ""break and enter"" covers any unauthorized entry, whether a ""break"" is involved or not."

&gt;If I remember this right, there is a surge of testosterone post birth in baby boys and we have no idea what it does or why it happens.

No idea? Please, we may not have a complete understanding of exactly what testosterone does to the brain, but it's a far cry from ""no idea"".

&gt;I just made that up and don't actually think that, but the point is that biological difference doesn't always clearly result in behavioral or psychological difference.

That's what I tried to explain to you with the analogy. A chemical difference in the body that passes through the BBB will have an effect on the brain. And studies show this. They have observed that when giving women doses of testosterone their behaviour changes, it effects the brain, and how it perceives and then acts. So now if we have two people with a different level of this chemical they are going to perceive the world differently and then react different. 

Here's another one that I managed to get an abstract that you can read. There are numerous studies that demonstrate that testosterone as a chemical changes behaviour.

http://pss.sagepub.com/content/23/5/459

I would like to conclude by pointing out that I am not saying that evo-psych as applied to sexual identities is most certainly correct. My point is that there is undeniable evidence that the physiological differences between the sexes leads to behaviour differences because of the chemicals and structures of their bodies. Like I illustrated above, a person on cocaine, behaves much differently than a person not on cocaine. So to write evo-psych off entirely is absolutely ridiculous because we can see obvious behavioural differences in controlled studies where we introduce a chemical to women that they don't typically have. 


Edit: I would also like to add that the between the male and female bodies there is a variety of chemical variations. To suggest that because of all of the differences between the two sexes that they both somehow come to equal out to the same equation is a far more unlikely position to hold than there being some sort of difference. As such, if you invoke [Occum's Razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) your position has far more assumptions. I would also like to remind you, that different does not necessarily mean better, just different.

It's easy to lay the blame on the players directly involved in the losing mistake, but I'm sure every one of them walked into that locker room knowing that, though they may not have been directly involved in that last sorry display of poor decision making, they all played their part in that loss.

I think the only player I have no complaints about tonight is Crawford. We got our shit ruined. Outright stomped. At least Crow's outstanding performance made it less apparent, but seriously, that score might as well have been 6-1. If not more.

Saiyaman,GrandTheftAutoV,1389517250.0,"&gt; And again, saying ""It is what it is"" doesn't make a good argument for ""It's not fun that way"". Also, just because you're not forced to do something, doesn't mean you're not being heavily bottlenecked either.

What you're saying would basically be like playing Call of Duty and asking ""Why do I have to complete these challenges to get XP?"" or playing a fighting game and saying ""Why do I have to keep doing all of these fights to unlock stuff?"" It is the whole point of the game. I've been playing legitimately since day one, and have had a blast with this game, without grinding missions multiple times, and have a 6 car garage.

&gt; Oh, smashing, and how much money and RP do you make while creating your own? Just kidding, I know the answer, it's none, and is also the answer to why this is a terrible point you're trying to make.

You don't gain money and RP for making them, you do for having people play them! And part of that problem lies with a majority of the fanbase, who would rather mess around in freemode.

&gt; This is merely a cop out to the fact that you have nothing better to support your argument than ""It's what was intended!"". No one's arguing that, we're arguing that it was not a good intention.

The only thing I wish is that more things were available to do, but most people here act like the game is barren from money making opportunities when that isn't the case. Making money's pretty easy, you just have to cooperate with people.

I enjoyed the act itself, it was the relationship with the guy who took my virginity that was toxic, and mixing sex in with a complicated relationship i was too young to handle was a learning experience.  The best part of it- and the reason i have no regrets- is that i learned a lot about people and relationships sooner than my peers.  My SIL did not lose her virginity until rather late, and even in her marriage she was making these high school girl mistakes with her husband in terms of drama and how she treats him. These were all mistakes i made in my teens, not my twenties.

You don't judge a cis (not trans) woman for wanting to be very feminine, do you? You think her womanhood is just as valid as the tomboy in shorts, right? In the same way, there's a lot of variation in trans women. There are an infinite number of ways of expressing being a woman, so it's not surprising that there are women who prefer to be a certain way. 

Having said that, there are probably some trans women who are extremely feminine as a way of compensating for internalized Transphobia. But that doesn't make their womanhood a mere imitation. Perhaps when they get more comfortable with being trans, they will figure out how feminine they want to be. "

I'm not a fan of physical punishments but I did experience it as a kid. It wasn't something I would classify as a beating, it was usually my mother who did the 'discipling'.

I've been slapped on the back of the head on occasion but never been hit with a closed fist ever. I've been disciplined with a wooden spoon, a sandal and other household items.

I think on occasion I did deserve a few hits. My parents always apologised after but they NEVER got carried away.

I did have an interesting conversation with my cousin about imams hitting children, I sided with it being unnecessary, he sided with it being OK. I asked him if it worked with him, he eventually realised it was unnecessary. 

Spouse abuse is common in desi culture, but that's because it is patriarchal culture, which does eventually lead to abuse. The worrying thing is that divorce is seen as worse culturally, than wife beating. Disgusting really.
Also worrying is the acceptance of it amongst desi women. Apparently some women deserve a slap for running their mouths or not having hot food prepared after a tough day at work.

Until woman are seen as having equal responsibilities/rights in a committed relationship, this kind of thing will always occur.

I'm an egalitarian, not a feminist, so I don't see feminism in its current incarnation as the correct way to achieve equality. Disproportionate focus on women's rights isn't egalitarian. Never mind the radical feminist spewing hatred and self-interest. It bothers me when people argue with such blanket statements such as that feminism *is* equality, as if it's some sort of interchangeable synonym.

Obviously this is in terms of western feminism, there are other places in the world where feminism is necessary, just not here, where men and women are essentially equal barring respective inequalities we've yet to iron out. (Divorce, custody, domestic abuse, the US seems to have issues with abortion and birth control though that's not the case where I live...)"
TheProverbialI,Frugal,1389518986.0,"Farmers markets can be a boon depending on where you are. The goods won't look as picture perfect as from a grocery store, but they are usually dirt cheap and very healthy.

Also, for bulk food a slow cooker is a life saver. Get one from a second hand store, they last for ages and soup/stew is as easy as chop everything up, put it in with some water and come back a few hours later. It will vary depending on the cooker but I put mine on before going to work and then come home to a weeks worth of meals."

Well that's great if you believe that, but I never said he improved because he was put on the bench. I said I think him having to start alongside Harden and play alongside Brooks have impacted his numbers lately, i.e. the Beverley injury. Whether or not you think the Rockets coaching staff is conspiring to ruin Lin's career is irrelevant.

I am a white appearing half Native woman (mixed on both sides of my family, and I did not grow up on a reservation) and I grew up being taught that I had to be strong, independent and in charge of myself and able to care for myself because men, especially our own men (and good luck find any of them at that), were generally unreliable and I shouldn't expect that they will stick around. But, my mother also bought into the white beauty standard and indirectly taught me that a woman's power in this society is a combination of her cleverness and her ability to meet that standard of white beauty/femininity. I hate it so much, but its true. I have dressed in androgenous clothing, and in men's clothing and I was treated really poorly compared to when I wore skirts and heels and makeup. And, I lived near the Tulalip reservation for a while.... at the very least the women from that reservation dressed up (as in nice skirts/dresses, heels, well done hair and make up) very nicely for work. D: There were some beautiful ladies in that area... oh man. &lt;3

but I do have to say that the beauty standard.... really gives most of us the short end of the stick. Its really, really hard to feel beautiful as a Native woman when we have pretty much zero positive representation and a lot of our features are considered flat out unattractive by society at large. No white man has ever told me I was even remotely attractive, quite the opposite.  Mmmm  black and latino men are a different story. You have to understand that its.... its just *so* hard to keep trying with your appearance when you get zero validation, when there is no one to notice your effort and when you're regarded as unattractive despite your efforts. Honestly speaking, I put forth such efforts primarily because I know that it will affect my paycheck and the treatment I receive from the people I have to interact with.

kicker7955,lostgeneration,1389519937.0,"&gt; Of course. This is how the housing market regularly works. 

No, it's just not, that is why poeple use the houses as investments, prices don't go down unless there is a systemic paradigme shift, hwat happens is that some sellers will try to undercut the market, but rarelly does the whole market uniformly goes down, unless as I mention there is a big disruption.

&gt;By definition, fixed costs do not increase with quantity supplied. But I think I understand what you mean.

I meant to say ""and logistics and labor"" to scale any business you increase these costs, and most of the time there are passed down to consumers.

&gt;You're not being ""pragmatic.""

where have I not been pragmatic every single arguemn was within a real world context.

&gt;Your argument is analogous to someone arguing that an object does not necessarily fall to the ground, because of air friction. It's true that a simple model of gravity does not take into account air friction. That means that the descent of the object may be slowed down by air friction. It does not mean that the descent of the object might not exist

Not touching the labor market, in my opinion it will remove the ""work to live"" paradigm which will be healthy in the long run. But your socialist assumption of labor vs capital is so fixed in that context that common ground is impossible.

very true, I'm arguing that in our hypothetical, air would be so dense that its effects where similar to water, and the descent will reach a level where gravity will be useless and the process would make it much more difficult to reach the bottom even if a direct external force would be involved.

&gt;It is not true that they could get no increase in buying power.

I said it will be balanced out by the market, and that the actual benefits will be non-existent in the long run, and with a reduction in social policies, this will actually cause more harm to the people it actually was designed to help. And somewhere in this thread I said that it's basically a governmental subsidy for the businesses that service the lower classes.

Ralkir,changemyview,1389519994.0,"&gt;right, but I wasn't claiming that I thought that men and women had no differences. I don't quite get where you are coming from. I can easily accept that men have higher testosterone and that it has some effect on them to have that chemical in their bodies, though I don't know precisely what psychological effects it has, nor do I know if we have testosterone because it causes beneficial psychological effects. 

My point is related to the definition of evolutionary psychology from wikipedia that I previously provided.

&gt; Evolutionary psychology (EP) is an approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological traits such as memory, perception, and language from a modern evolutionary perspective.

And as I have demonstrated testosterone greatly effects the perception of individuals with higher levels (ie. men). That is what the studies show. 

As for how this comes back to evolution, well everything is evolution. That average amount was selected for, for whatever reason, so people examine the effects of testosterone and then attempt to determine what evolutionary advantage this might have given. How might the higher levels of testosterone in males might have led to their increase in fitness, their increase in ability to pass on their genes. How might this have affected their behaviour to very simply, create more babies that survive. 

Edit: Conversely how might these levels have normalized to be at what they are as opposed to continue to increase. What evolutionary advantaged was gained by this average, and not a higher value for testosterone, with specifics to psychiatric phenomenon.  That is what evo-pysch is at it's core. Looking at behaviours that human beings exhibit that offer an increased level of fitness and ability to pass on their genes.

Tall_LA_Bull,AskMen,1389520158.0,"I'm white and I've dated a number of black women. Some of them only once, and a couple for months or more. A few observations I've made:

1) Some black women talk like they're in a bad SNL skit about black people. So do some black guys. So do some white guys and white girls, for that matter. They use profanity and say the N-word three times a sentence, they threaten to kick everyone's ass, and they don't understand the difference between public and private spaces. (e.g. talking in the movies.) These are stupid stereotypes, but some people really do act that way. I can't be attracted to any woman who does, and I can't be close friends with any guy who does. It's embarrassing, and it makes me have no respect for them.

2) Some black people have a fairly distinctive odor. It's impossible to describe, but it's the same among all the people who smell like that. I'm not sure if it's diet-related or what, but I find it off-putting.

3) A few of the black women I've dated acted like I personally owed them something in our relationship/on our date, just because white people have been shitty to black people over the years. I agree that black people have been treated atrociously in this country. Inner city schools should be funded like crazy and black people should go to college for free and stop-and-frisk is an abomination. But I'm not going to live white guilt in my personal life.

4) There are some black women who are simply not feminine, as others have indicated in this thread. There are some white/other girls who are this way also, but the percentage of black women who are this way is higher, by my observation. Some are just built more like men in body and facial structure. This is the saddest case, because there's really just nothing they can do about it. My heart goes out to them.

5) Despite the foregoing, I've met many black women who I thought were very attractive, and dated and had enthusiastic sex with them. They're generally educated, kind, smart, beautiful, and take great care of themselves. Just like the white or Latina or Asian girls I date.

6) I now online date in Los Angeles. I don't know if this explains the online dating stats or not, but I have noticed that the white women who tend to be on that site are generally younger, and generally more attractive, just based on their pictures, even to someone like me who thinks lots of black women are really beautiful. Also, some of the black women on the site use truly, truly horrifying grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Lots of black women write very well in their online profiles, but I'd say more don't generally than with other ethnicities. That takes them off my radar immediately.

7) All of the above is undergirded by a very real and pervasive racism towards black people in American culture. Overall, just having to deal with that racism even in passing makes hanging out with black people a pain in the ass, sometimes. It's much easier to just keep one's head down and not think too much about all the racist shitheads in this country. To date a black person is to share in their troubles in this area.

8) The foregoing are based only on my anecdotal observations. I don't think there's one factor that explains why black women have a tough time in dating. I hope you found this helpful in some way."

TheHolyFool,writing,1389520738.0,"Your brother sounds preoccupied with totally unique ideas. He is in for a lifetime of literary disappointment.

The point of storytelling isn't to come up with a completely new concept. The point is to paint a perspective in such a way that lets readers take home an experience they didn't have before. The best ones will damn near make readers live through it, and by the time they close the book, the characters feel like old friends and the plot resonates as if it were something they experienced personally. A recent study suggested that reading a novel can alter someone in a profound psychological way, in much the same manner as a real-life profound experience would. (If anyone wants that link, I can probably dig it up.)

Storytelling is perspective-sharing; by no means does it require blowing everyone's mind with innovation every single time. People who set that as a literary standard tend not to catch the subtleties that would make them appreciate a less-than-earth-shattering story. Don't write to please those people; they are putzes."

griffer00,psychology,1389521419.0,"In any case, the summarized study isn't even published yet... it's being presented at a conference. Even if you don't have amazing data, you've still gotta get out and network with other researchers. 

Apart from that... I disagree with your evaluation of the worthiness of correlational methods... for many reasons.

Correlation studies are an extremely useful tool when trying to map out novel or prospective relationships... especially when exploring a ""young"" field of research. If used correctly, moderators and mediators can also be identified, giving researchers a place to start for exploring directional and/or causal relationships. You bet your ass that chemists and physicists would have used correlation analysis if it had existed before the 1900s. In these fields, thanks to centuries of trial-and-error, intuition, and descriptive methods, enough of a knowledge base was established to permit straight-forward causal experiments from the 1800s-onward. New fields like psychology don't have that luxury -- psychology as a science is roughly 100 years old, so the terrain is still being mapped. Correlation allows research in the field to ""hit the ground running,"" so to speak.

You also need correlation studies to get funding for larger/directional/causal studies. You need to show some evidence of a relationship to those with the money so they know they aren't throwing it away. Also, given the current state of technology, studies that even barely broach directionality/causality are very expensive and difficult to conduct. For one, you need to compensate participants for their time, and you will need to follow them for years, as they move between different demographic groups with correlations of their own. Throw-in the obvious variability and biasing introduced into your data due to indirectly-related factors (e.g. fads, natural disasters, attrition, episodes of mental or physical illness), which further increase the difficulty of controlling the experimental environment. The environment is the world, not a small white labspace. In short, you can't just do groundbreaking studies day-in and day-out... you build up to these studies by conducting smaller studies and collecting less conclusive evidence.

It's not about psychologists being ""worth their salt""... it's about investigating complex relationships that are made even more complex by human elements. Often times, reaching the point of having a perfect experiment has little to do with ""saltiness;"" it has more to do with being in the right place at the right time. Crick and Watson are big shots because they were doing research at the exact moment in history where enough of the ""puzzle pieces"" had fallen into place; their intelligence has less to do with savant-like precognition of DNA's structure, and more to do with capitalizing on their given state of affairs. They had access to decades worth of others' discoveries, which they used to form a hypothesis that could only be tested with newly-invented equipment, in a laboratory that was restricted to a single location on the planet, which itself could be accessed by only a select few scientists. They were lucky, but they also saw their chance and they took it -- but good luck getting any scientist to admit how much luck plays into their accomplishments."
mundabit,childfree,1389521420.0,"I think the main issue I had is that everyone at this service knew me, I just had no idea who they were.

We did it the opposite way around, family members only at the service, anyone and their dog at the wake. Plenty of people at the wake were almost complete strangers to each other and it was much more comfortable to be myself.

I totally agree that if you knew a person, even only slightly, you should feel free to go to a funeral (if you are invited) because its about celebrating life, and you were a part of their life, no matter how small a part, it still counts. what's important is recognising your connection compared to the others present, don't go walking up to the deceased's mother to talk about how empty your life has been since their passing.

The top three mod listed in the sidebar are obviously very popular. Kerbal Attachment System (KAS) adds winches, hooks, and the ability to move small parts and create various in-situ linkages between objects. Kerbal Engineer Redux gives various flight and build information which can be very useful (orbital/surface information, dV, TWR, etc). RemoteTech2 forces you to create a communications network to pilot your unmanned vehicles. 
 
Additionally, MechJeb (an autopilot of sorts, not always the most efficient) is popular in some circles. B9 and KW Rocketry are popular mods that greatly expand the pool of available parts. There are also addons like FAR and IonCross which improve the aerodynamic modelling and add a life-support requirement respectively, making the game more difficult. There are mods which scale the planets up to more 'real world' values, making things far more difficult. You can get mods that add additional planets (these have been receiving a lot of attention lately) and mods that make the game more aesthetically pleasing. There are also some texture reduction mods that make the game a bit more memory friendly, both because the code is not as optimized as it could be and because (except linux, IIRC) the game's engine is single threaded and 32-bit which means your processor speed is more important than the number of cores you have and that the game can only make use of ~3.2GB of RAM, regardless of how much your system has."

Next, take a few minutes to answer a couple hundred questions. You don't need to answer thousands, but at least a few hundred should be answered to ensure more accurate matches.

**Self-summary:** It's hard to get a concrete idea of who you are here. It's a bit all over the place.

**I‚Äôm really good at:** Again, this section doesn't give me a great idea about who you are. Either expand into something more concrete, or remove entirely.

**Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food:** Good length, without being too long.

**I spend a lot of time thinking about:** Again, expand and make more concrete, or else remove entirely.

**On a typical Friday night I am:** If you're pretty outdoorsy, write about your idea night outdoors, then explain that realistically, you're probably stuck doing homework. Currently, it comes off a bit half-assed.

**The most private thing I‚Äôm willing to admit:** Again, this is kind of half-assed, on what sounds like it could be a very humorous story if spun correctly.

**You should message me if:** Probably worth adding this section, as it may be one of the last one's that a potential match reads before messaging you.

Before you do anything else, though, answer some more questions!"

&gt;So now I'm trying to figure out how to do this with the least impact on my kids and others involved.

I have never been in a similar situation. My advice is always honesty. Telling your husband your feelings will of course be difficult and a roller coaster, but certainly necessary.

Lying is not good for the ""least impact on my kids"" part so I suggest opening up to your husband as soon as possible.

You can still love your kids to death even if you break up with their father. If all goes well you two can part on good terms, that way everyone can find happiness.

He deserves to be with someone who loves him just as much as you do.

No hiding things, and no going behind is back. The more honest you are the better chance you have to have everything go well.

There is no simple way to do it, but you'll have to sit him down and say what's on your mind. Speak your emotions and if he cares about you he'll understand (maybe after some confusion or anger)

Tall_LA_Bull,kettlebell,1389522252.0,"A lot of that is flat wrong. Stretching after a workout is good for muscles, but it won't make them bigger. Calisthenics are not good for mass-building unless you're doing specific, very high resistance exercises.

Here's how you get bigger muscles: 

1) Increase the resistance against your workout movements. This involves using heavier weights or more difficult movements. More reps will help your endurance, but will not help increase mass.

2) Take rest days in between your workout days. Doing a little (LIGHT) yoga on an off-day probably won't hurt you, but it should basically be just to warm up your muscles and work out any kinks. Rest days means REST. Time for your body to recover is literally as important as hard, weight-intensive workouts.

3) Eat more calories per day than you expend on a daily basis. Use an online TDEE calculator to determine what your calorie number is, and eat about 500 calories more than that. Make sure you eat healthy, lots of protein and lots of veggies, but don't sweat eating some fats. The number that matters is the calories.

That's literally all it takes. If you do those three things, your muscles will get bigger. If you don't do even one of those things, you probably won't."

There is one way that Rabies can be stopped (excluding the mild vaccine), and it's a procedure called the ""Milwaukee Protocol"".

camel_slayer,nba,1389522371.0,"I hate having to keep addressing this... (I don't mind you asking though, it;s good for discussion and I don't expect other teams to understand our team's dynamic as much as their own). 

Kendrick Perkins' main job is to shut down dominant bigs down low, ex: Dwight Howard. Look how Kendrick has played Dwight as compared to other centers in the league and you'll get a decent picture. 

Thunder fans don't think ""highly"" of him, we (if I can briefly generalize for all the fans) just understand his role on the team. Is his contract a semi-disaster? YES! Does Brooks over use him by giving him vital, game-deciding minutes? YES! Does Adams deserve more of a minute share at C? Absolutely. You'd be hard pressed to find a Thunder fan that isn't on board with these comments. 

I guess we come to his defense, because over the last 2-3ish years he has become /r/nba 's laughing stock, and no fan likes to see that happen to a player. A lot of the things brought up against him are obvious to the point of a circlejerk and it can get under any fan's skin. I'm not defending his decision making either, that fast break was bone-headed.

Another thing I forgot to mention is his role in the locker room. Perkins keeps the team level headed and plays an invaluable role as a leader behind the scenes. That doesn't mean he isn't overpaid on the team, it's just a fact.

Just to be clear, again, I respect the question for discussion's sake. If I came off strong, it's only because I love this team. Cheers.

BunRabbit,japan,1389522555.0,"On the job before my current one, one of my managers went to the point of saying I was the second fastest coder on a team of 12 programmers. I would still get ugly looks when I left ""early"". I tried staying late a couple of times, but those guys did shit all as soon as the bosses left at 7:00. Out came the snacks, the smart phones games and they did nothing but gossip about the day's events.

At twice daily meetings, there was an audible sucking of teeth, when I reported that I had finished 8, 10, 12 tasks that day to their 4~5 tasks. I tried joking that it was because I used key strokes and not a mouse. I really wanted to say, because you guys waste time chatting, going for smoke break after smoke break.

Soon the clique mentality kicked in. My morning greetings were unanswered, even the simplest comment I made in meetings were met with snide remarks from one guy (the laziest guy there) about he couldn't understand my Japanese. I started getting contrary instructions. ""Why did you do it that way?"" Uh - You told me - here's the example function you gave me two days ago. 

Then they started giving me increasing difficult work in an area that's outside my expertise. They were hoping for a fuck up and they got it. I reported it immediately. Work stopped for a hour while a key table of the database was manually edited. Off they all went for a meeting about what to do. I was then assigned to a most menial task of hand finding coding naming conventions differences on a couple hundred files. Completely pointless, but there was still 3 weeks to the end of my contract period. For security reasons I couldn't install any Diff plugins on the text editor we were using. So, took those 3 weeks and learned how to write a bash script to do it for me.

During that time another programmer fucked up big time - 2 days of production lost. He was part of the clique, so that was just laughed off. "

way i see it i could either send it off to railcar fine goods for their tapering service, which would be an extra $75, or i could sell and get a new pair locally. so i guess my questions are:

has anyone got their jeans tapered by railcar? is it worth the hassle of having to ship them to america and back?

Not only did he jack your nail up but there is no cuticle there. I don't know if he did that or if your one of those obsessive cuticle clipper types. That's really bad though. The cuticle serves an important role, it's the biological gasket between the nail and the inside of your body.


There are some decent quality ""cheap"" shops but when someone fucks up... sorry.

When I was in school it was about 70% Asian and half of those were high school or just out of high school Asian boys. Their parents owned salons and they had to work off their debt to the family business before they could go to a ""real"" college.

I also spent one summer doing metal work and one of the thai guys I worked with also owned a nail salon. It's bad to stereotype but in this instance it applies. There are a whole lot of asian men in the nail business and they thrive off of very fast very cheap work. If they fuck up, sorry.

ScipiiRye,WTF,1389523146.0,"&gt; **Where are you guys finding all these crazy feminist comments?**

/r/tumblrinaction is an excellent source of crazy feminism, fat-activists, racism, racial purity shit, ""otherkin,"" ""headmates,"" and other stuff. The discussion there is usually of a higher quality, as we have people from all over the political spectrum there. Women, men, trans people, gay people, it's a pretty diverse sub. The sub also makes fun of crazy people on the opposite end of the gender spectrum, such as TRP and radical MRAs.

/r/ineedfeminismbecause is another satirical subreddit which mocks feminists on social media who hold radical and sometimes downright nonsensical views.

Be warned, though, some of the views people hold can be really depressing.

Generally speaking, ""crazy feminist"" comments are much more popular on tumblr than reddit. You can find some in the feminist subreddits like /r/shitredditsays and their ""fempire,"" if you look, but they aren't nearly as easy to find as on tumblr. For instance, /r/makeupaddiction heavily moderates the feminist commenters who occasionally come in and accuse them of ""supporting the patriarchy"" and whatnot, so you'll rarely see them.

&gt; **Does anyone actually come across crazy feminists IRL on a regular basis? (I imagine this would depend highly on where one lives.)**

I have only met what I would call a radical feminist IRL less than ten times, usually under circumstances in which they were relatively easy to ignore/avoid. As you say, though, this sort of anecdotal experience is highly subjective. 

&gt; **What is your personal understanding of feminism?**

That... is a difficult question. Feminism isn't something that you can simplify as some seem to be keen on doing by saying ""if you believe in women's rights, you're a feminist."" That's an oversimplification.

""Feminism"" is a blanket term that covers a huge range of differing ideologies that have one key tenet at heart: the advancement of women's rights. Sounds simple, right? It's not, though.

There are tons of different types of feminists, as there are ideologies. ""TERFs,"" trans-exclusionary-radical-feminists, for instance, [refuse to believe that transwomen are ""real women""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia#Transphobia_in_feminism), and therefore are unworthy of benefiting from women's rights, which is at odds with egalitarian ideology.

There are adherents to feminism that believe that homosexuality is wrong, and even that [gay men are so misogynistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_sexuality#Homophobia_and_lesbophobia_in_feminism) that they'll have sex with other men in order to avoid women. Again, not very liberal.

There are tons of other negative or speculative aspects of feminist ideology that have little to do or only tangential relations with gender equality; [sex-negative feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_Sex_Wars#Anti-pornography_feminists), [political lesbianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_lesbianism), ""patriarchy theory,"" the idea of ""rape culture,""  et cetera.

Feminism is a huge, broad concept, much larger than what many who call themselves ""feminists"" realize, and it's far too complicated to write off as ""gender equality.""

My experience with feminism is, apart from seeing the internet crazies in abundance, exclusively academic. I've read works and excerpts from quite a few radical feminists, either on my own or as part of a course. I've discussed it on my own, usually on reddit, I'll admit, but enough so as to be exposed to points of view other than my own.

A lot of feminist theory is downright insane (all men are born rapists, all sex is rape) or is justified through the use of ideological bogeymen (""rape culture,"" ""the Patriarchy"") that can't be proven.

**Yes, thus far I've been focusing on the negative aspects of modern feminism.**

I do freely admit that in the past, what I call ""moderate"" feminism has been a force for equality and the right tool for that job. First and second-wave feminism largely accomplished the goals they set out for themselves. Men and women are practically equal in the first world, barring respective inequalities, and much of that is due to feminism; suffrage, land ownership, inheritance, right to divorce, right to refuse sex, these things largely came about because of feminism, but these were specifically *women's issues*. What happens when we, as a society, start to run out of issues that only affect women?

As an egalitarian, I believe that the time to focus on bringing women ""up to men's level"" in terms of rights has passed, and now we need to start addressing respective inequalities; divorce courts, custody, domestic abuse, legal definition of rape that includes men as potential victims... these are issues that cannot be neutrally addressed by an ideology as self-interested as feminism. Focusing solely on women's issues, which is what feminism as a whole does, is not the way to do that.

I believe that people associate the antiquated ideology of ""feminism"" with ""gender equality"" because for much of the 20th century, they were essentially synonymous because women were truly second-class citizens. That's not the case today, at least in the first world, but the terminology is still being used in the same way, which leads to people being hostile to those critical of feminism as if they were being critical of what they perceive to be gender equality.

**TL;DR:** feminism has many negative aspects that are directly at odds with egalitarian ideals, as well as having aspects that are in line with them. That said, it can't be inherently ""good"" in and of itself.

I'm very pleased by such a neutral comment such as yours, so I'll be happy to expand on anything that hasn't come across clearly and answer any more of your questions. :)

enlightened-giraffe,changemyview,1389523217.0,"&gt; 1) Physicians need to be well rounded outside of knowing the sciences. The college experience goes a long ways towards that. In addition, by having to take general ed classes, you learn things that would otherwise be neglected if you just started medical school immediately.

While i agree that it is better for any individual to be well rounded, physicians don't need this any more than other professions that don't need to go through two different tiers of education. Arguably, since this is a very specialized profession it's arguable that it has no advantage at all other than the personal development of the individual which would be better handled independently according to personal interests.

&gt; 2) You need mental maturity before starting medical school. A high school student is not mature enough to decide s/he wants to become a physician, let alone go through med school.

I understand your point of view but i don't see what you base it on, practicing medicine has a vocational side, deciding to go into medicine generally happens pretty early, most of my old friends/acquittances that went into medicine decided this in middle school

&gt; 3) College is college!!! Why on earth should someone have to give up that experience in order to start practicing medicine two years early?

I don't know what you do in the states but medical school in Europe is pretty much just like any other university, there are dorms, parties, the yearly schedule is the same, etc. The work volume is a little higher, but comparable to any other college you take seriously. 

Financial arguments have been made by others so i'm not going to repeat them, but i would like to state that i see them as being very important. Furthermore, if you want to be a doctor and before medical school you decide to go through a three year university there's nothing stopping you, you would have no disadvantage, yet that is a very rare occurrence."

Tall_LA_Bull,EatCheapAndHealthy,1389523586.0,"A few points:

1) Your diet is fine as far as the contents. You can always eat more veggies, but it's really not bad. Changing the things you eat is just rearranging furniture. You just need to eat less of it. Unfortunately, at your height, you're going to have to control your portions pretty strictly if you want to be lean and mean. I'm not telling you to starve yourself. Not at all. That actually wouldn't really even help, since you'd yo-yo and binge. But you are going to have to eat less than you want to.

2) Most of the food you listed can be made in small portions, so I don't understand why you have all these leftovers you're trying to eat up. For the stuff (like stir-fry) where it can genuinely be hard to make just a little, you need to get small tupperware containers, just the right size for a single serving. When you make something like a stir-fry, separate the entire thing into the various tupperware, before you eat any of it. Then you eat one tupperware's worth, and put the rest in the fridge. Eat them one at a time, as a full meal. They're not a snack. This will sometimes mean you have to eat the same thing several meals in a row. Get used to this. It's what eating healthy requires. I eat basically the same thing every day except my cheat days.

3) A ""semi-active lifestyle"" is not going to cut it if you want to lose weight, especially if you like to eat. You need a rigorous program of exercise, so that your body will expend more energy, so that it will burn body mass. Also, while walking is fine as a supplement, for a young person, it's not optimal at all. You need to work your way up to high-intensity cardio, and you need to do resistance training to encourage your body to change its composition. The fact that all really fit people do those things is not an accident. The good news is that, if you work hard and smart, you'll actually spend less time at the gym.

I wish you the best of luck! What I've just described may seem daunting, but if you can gut it out for a few months, it'll just become a habit. Then you'll start to see results, and suddenly it won't seem that hard anymore. And then, finally, when you start to make real progress and have real success, it'll become a pleasure."

Until I got yelled at, I also used to leave the keys for the operator to put back in place. Something they could never figure out despite adjacent consoles with their keys intact (literally a metre apart)."

enlightened-giraffe,AndroidQuestions,1389524766.0,"Welcome to ROMs, this is your new base of operations : [Nexus 5 xda forums](http://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5) where all roms and mods for your phone converge. The ROMs are in the ""Nexus 5 Android Development"" subforum, that are built on top of the Nexus 5 build of Android, and in the ""Nexus 5 Original Android Development"" which are built on top of AOSP - Android Open Source Project, the base of Android as an OS, this is where most development goes on.

There are a number of established ROMs that you can look into and they all have a dedicated topic in the original development subforum. Among these i am inclined to mention 

- Cyanogenmod (the most widely used ROM across all phones)
- Paranoid Android (with many unique and interesting features)
- Omni (which is sort of the old philosophy of Cyanogen before they went corporate)

For all of these you can find a lot of reviews, FAQs and videos detailing their features and implementations and their respective communities are large and the progress well documented. 

With Android ROMs there are a few stages for each main version that indicate stability and feature content, these are widely used but each team might use a different release system :

- Nightly, a new one almost everyday, has all the latest features or fixes, stuff might not work or be very buggy. After about a month of nightiles when base features and stability get sorted out, if you are prepared to encounter a broken feature once in a while, these are an option as a daily driver.
- Weekly/Monthly, self-explanatory, a build that includes stuff that is considered pretty solid, less new stuff but works better, they come out when the ROM is pretty well rounded and nearing completion, these are almost always ok for daily use
- Milestone/Beta, almost final, for most users will be indistinguishable from final version.
- Final, everything should work, but by the time this is out the developers are usually well into Nightlies for the next version

Even before you try a ROM i recommend installing the Xposed Framework and trying a few modules, especially Gravity Box. These are mods that bring a lot of what ROMs do (and a few unique other things) but only require root and install like apps.

**But, the most important thing to know about ROMs : Always have backups - nandroid backups, made from a custom recovery, and app/settings backup with Titanium Backup (app)**"

Some people don't want NSFW content (and, yes, there are ways around it [RES etc.]) and are perfectly justified in pointing out what they perceive as rule violations.  It turns out that this isn't technically one of them (as per my conversation with the mods) but that changes nothing.  

The mods of any sub as large as this one will be busy people and may occasionally miss something, giving them a heads up is a public service; not to mention that the whole point of a comment section is to allow the users/viewers to speak their minds about the content.  All I did was gently point out that there are better ways to object (read as message the mods) and there are better ways to express oneself and ones dis-like of particular pieces of content.  Objection to content shouldn't be downvoted because one disagrees (check the reddiquette [which is, sadly, not adhered to by many users {myself amongst them, I must admit}]).

&gt; 1) Define your goal.  Make sure that the goal is [SMART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria): specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound.  

&gt; 2) Figure out one ridiculously small step that would move you towards your goal.  That's your goal for the day.  

&gt; 3) No, smaller than that.  We're talking stuff like ""march in front of the TV one minute each night"" for the goal of losing weight, or ""eat in the cafeteria instead of my office"" for the goal of meeting new people.  [note: in your case SadDrop, you might want to choose ""saying 'hello' to a female stranger"", or even ""asking a stranger for the time"" as your initial goal.]  

&gt; 4)  Record the days when you accomplish your daily goal and the days you don't.  For the days you don't, figure out what happened that day to cause you to fail and figure out a way to prevent, avoid, or mitigate the problem in the future.  

&gt; 5) [optional] Reward yourself with a small reward each time you accomplish a daily goal, or create a token economy where you earn points for larger rewards.  Don't use large rewards for every daily goal accomplished because that actually reduces motivation over the long term.  [Note that use of the reward system may or may not decrease your intrinsic interest in accomplishing your goals (the ""overjustification effect).  There's conflicting literature on the subject.  If you need rewards, use them.  Otherwise, don't.]

In the States for example, where it is more expensive to consume health foods and eat healthily than it is to eat McDonalds, we associate being slim with beautiful. In Africa, where food is a scarce in the rural regions, being fat is considered beautiful, because to consume a lot of food is expensive over there.

And you also ignore military training. Especially in a post Iraq conflict where the importance of urban tactics changed the way war was waged. Your 'one bullet' point strikes me as rather specious. Superior fire power is nothing to sneeze at. This isn't bow and arrow vs musket. Beyond tactics you would also have to consider things like weapons that don't require personnel on scene (unmanned drones for instance) or weaponry immune to civilian accessible attacks (tanks etc). Not to say these are insurmountable. Enough people shooting CAN take down a drone and building home made bombs is likely easier here than in the middle east. But these aren't just so easily swept under the rug. The losses those could inflict in an internal war would be great. Possibly great enough to turn the tide in the military's favor."

The first player was a player on the team Seattle, his name is Hutchinson. He was what's called a Restricted Free Agent. Restricted Free Agents mean that if a player signs with another team (in the first case being the Minnesota Vikings) then his original team could choose to match the entirety of his contract with the Vikings and stay on Seattle. However, in this case, Minnesota put in the 'poison pill' which meant that if Seattle matched Hutchinson's contract then the poison pill would kick in (because it only applies to one team and not the other) and his contract would become fully guaranteed, which is something you typically don't want in the NFL.

The same thing happened with Nate Burleson later in reverse, with a less creative but still equally applicable poison pill of playing more than 5 games in Minnesota, which you would only do if you were on the Vikings. "

The Fluffy Bunnies Motorcycle Club (FBMC) was created in response to the QLD Governments attempt to portray ALL motorcycle riders as criminals. Anyone can join the FBMC, as long as you have a motorcycle licence, or you have someone in your immediate family that does. It also doesn't matter to us if you are a member of another MC. As the saying goes, it doesn't matter how big and tough you are, when a 4yo kid hands you a toy phone, YOU ANSWER IT, and that's what makes you a Fluffy Bunny!

Our rules are simple:
1: no illegal activity during club events (what you do in your own home is your own business).

2: Ummmmm, that's pretty much it.

It doesn't matter what you ride. American, British, German, Italian, Japanese, chinese, we don't care. You're on two wheels (some exceptions have 3) and that's fine with us.

Our aim is simple. We're here to ride, to have fun, to make new mates, and to protest the perception that people who ride bikes are criminals. The dream is to organise a rally of 10,000 bikes to ride through Brisbane CBD and up to the steps of the QLD parliament house!

If you can do that, it's probably cheaper and less risky to do so.

&gt; With that kind of money you can import a virgin teenage HB10 from any place on the planet you want.

1. Probably not any place on the planet you want. Unless you literally just want a sex doll/slave, I assume you'd at least have to pick from a place where English fluency is common (unless you can speak the language). The poorer the country, the less likely that will be. 

2. On the flip side, the wealthier the country, the less likely a ""virgin teenage HB10"" will be willing to emigrate just to marry some guy in the US making ""a mere 225k"" who is only ""above average"" but not extraordinary in his neighbourhood. If she can work a web-cam, is digitally aware, and is actually an HB10, she shouldn't have many problems attracting wealthy enough guys in her own country without wanting to move to a completely different place away from her friends/family.

3. You'd want to meet this person first before such a major commitment. That means paying for flights and other costs.

4. You'd have to marry her to keep her in the US, since she's more likely to be undereducated and unlikely to be working. Once she gets her citizenship, there's a risk of divorce. This is California we're talking about (Orange County, remember), so in the event of divorce, you'll be paying her over 75K out of that 225k after it has been taxed *annually* for every 2 years of marriage. ([See spousal support calculator](http://www.cadivorce.com/tools-resources/child-spousal-support-calculator/))... I estimate you'd be taxed about 80k-90k federal and state first, so you'd be left with 60k-70k. If you stayed married for 10 years, this could last for life. Prenups might not even save you from this, depending on the situation (and mail-order brides who don't have English fluency could be that situation). Again, this is California we're talking about.

For so many more reasons that I won't bother listing: If you just want to use that money for sex, and that's it, it's cheaper and ironically *safer* to get a prostitute.

It works for some of my coworkers/colleagues, who are Indian, but that is mainly because they have family connections in India helping them set up arranged dates/marriages. It's not like they can just pick any ""virgin HB10"" from anywhere in the world, even when some of them DO make 200k+.

I'm not criticizing or trying to discourage you, but I do want to point out that careful decision-making is why some people got to that income level in the first place, and why they stay there. There are many reasons mail-order brides aren't a lot more common than they are."

*New  PC gamers don't necessarily know that.* This scratches the ease of use itch that console gamers tend to like. 

&gt;Who are these devs? Very few big studios bother making a Linux version of their AAA title.

I recall reading this last night that somebody in this thread made a list of devs/pubs who were starting to include Linux in development, it was impressive. The biggest absence was probably EA, unfortunately, but that will change with time. 

&gt;If you can get a windows PC that matches performance and price of a steam box while not only having access to 10 times as many games then why get a steam machine at all? What appeal does the steam box have for a console gamer over a windows based PC?

Ease of use, a bigger degree of uniformity, a more trustworthy brand (yes, that is how they'll see it) - ultimately, a console replacement. They don't want a straight up gaming PC right off the bat. &lt;- My perceptions."

I personally dislike them, as I said earlier, because game devs gimp their games so that consoles can play them. Like you said, Skyrim is a perfect example. If you didn't know any better, it looks amazing on the console. Because it was designed for it. But you hit a PC up. Mod it. It is a whole new game. The way the game should really have been designed. 

Now there is a completely different problem. Consoles aren't ""just working"" anymore. Many people are reporting crashes to desktop on the xbox one. Stuff like that isn't supposed to happen. If I had to have a console my one stipulation would be that it works. 100% of the time. Plug and play.

This is no longer the case. Both systems require you to install the game before you can play it. Then you have to patch it day one. It's obnoxious. 

Personally I think this will be the last generation of the consoles as we know it. The console environment won't go away, it never will, but this style of super closed off hardware etc will. "

The advantage of this for the public is the BBC answers to us rather than advertisers. The BBC is required to provide a public service as well as make entertaining shows. That means it must work to provide relevant and accessible programming for all walks of life, and decent coverage of important events, even if doing so is not beneficial to its ratings. This is why we don't tend to get situations like NBC's abysmal Olympic coverage, and why even the blind or deaf* can use the BBC's services. It also puts pressure on other TV channels like its major competitor C4 to keep up with the services the BBC provides.

- Surprise: Why is everyone so surprised at the Tobias perspective? Was no one else expecting this? I see comment and post after comment and post about how surprising it was and how it *must* have been signaling the death of Tris. But why? It's a trilogy, it's the last book. Why wouldn't the author split perspectives now that the romance has reached full bloom. It shouldn't be that unexpected. After all we had hints of this when we got the first novella featuring Four's perspective at the knife throwing scene. Other series do this. Bloodlines split perspective to include Adrian in addition to the main lead Sydney. It made all the fangirls go squee. Meyer wanted to do it with Twilight before that. Milk the franchise by rewriting the first book from Edward's perspective. It got leaked and like Eminem\* I think she just said ""sod it"" and dropped the project

- The Romance: As a dude I obviously love romance. I certainly don't mind it in my YA fiction. But good lord does no one else see how idiotic Tris and Four are in a relationship. They stare longingly into each other. Then they speak and break up. Then the next day they stare longingly into each other again. Most importantly they don't really learn anything from each other. They break up three times for what felt like literally the same reason. It's like watching a TV show and they break up because he thinks she's cheating on him with her male best friend. They get back together and then break up again because he thinks she's cheating on him with her male best friend.

Well there is no real answer where this comes from. There are some myths that try to explain it. 

One for instance is that a music group on a festival in the late 90s had a technical fallout during a solo and the guy screamed angrily for his roady/technician/whoever with the name Helga. People found that funny and kept screaming it if someone would screw up. From there it spread to other festivals and so on.

If you want to be attractive to the majority of a group you need to find out what the majority of that group finds attractive and strive towards that. It's a simple as that.

To me that whole ""strong black woman"" act that was mentioned or that ""tired of this shit so I'm just gonna be how I want to be"" just reeks of insecurity and laziness and selfishness. You are free to be how you want to be of course but be prepared for the consequences too.

As with the tomboys, a lot of guys do love them... as friends or as friends with benefits. Thing is most tomboys I have known throughout my life have actually been really feminine too, they are just well in touch with their masculine side. They may not always wear dresses or skirts, rarely wear makeup, make dirty jokes and be rough housing with the guys. Still they do wear nice looking clothes, they take care of their appearance, and when the time calls for it they can be soft spoken and caring in their actions.

So i think it's perfectly reasonable to say that as a woman, if you want to be attractive to most men you should be feminine. If you want to be attractive to most people you should be well dressed, well spoken and respectful to other people without letting them walk all over you."

At least in Ft. Worth, there's actually something to do past 5pm.  Downtown Dallas shuts down after 5, except for the douche-tastic downtown club scene.  NYC is the most expensive city to live in because there is more to do than you can do in a lifetime.  LA and San Francisco are expensive, because EVERYONE wants to live on the ocean, and in San Fran's case, in perpetual perfect weather.  Same goes for Honolulu.  Chicago's expensive for all the reasons NYC is, but for people who want some midwest charm thrown in.  Dallas is expensive because it is.  

The Margaret Hunt Hill bridge is the great parable of the city.  That fucking bridge cost $187 million.  (Don't worry taxpayers, $12 million was covered by private donations!)  Dallas built a $187 MILLION dollar bridge to go over a creek, into a shitty part of town.  But don't worry, some restaurants are popping up along the street to mask the run down housing and rusted metal warehouses.  Maybe, if Oak Cliff is lucky enough, they'll be overrun with overpriced apartment buildings.  

That bridge is part of the makeup of Dallas.  Maybe it's even the lipstick on the expensive pig.  Just like all the flashy lights and outdoor video screens.  All of it says how expensive Dallas is, but none of it is actual content.

However, in regards to your situation in high school, I don't see how you were trivializing queer experience and I think the premise of this show easily lends itself to that.

My issue with the show isn't that the the concept couldn't be funny. My issue is that this is an example of a queer experiences being exploited to tell a straight narrative. Queer issues, like homophobia, will be explored but through the eyes of straight characters.

Of course, the show hasn't aired and it's very possible that one of the characters could be queer. And I get what you're saying - the concept is funny and the show could be funny. But I have trouble getting past the idea of queer stories being told...by straight people. It might still be funny, but I'm not sure I'll be able to fully enjoy it (which is a personal thing that might not be true for you).

The Hunger Games didn't glamourize children killing each other. It SHOULD have because that was the point of the book but in the films (or film b/c I haven't seen *Catching Fire* yet) but the movie glossed over the children fighting to death.

If you've ever seen *Battle Royale*\* **that** is a film that glorifies children killing children. It does so in service to the satirical message. The same is actually true of The Hunger Games  though it's more satirical and less violent.

The Hunger Games needs to be violent because it's supposed to contrast with the fact that an audience is watching it like an action film. In theory this should come across even better on the screen because the viewer is part of an audience relishing in the violence. By neutering all the violence they basically killed the entire satirical point. Not to mention all the problems with nuances that didn't work like Katniss being incredibly smart and figuring out how the system works and using her ""stardom"" to her advantage in the game.

sorator,watchpeopledie,1389528206.0,"My first experience was actually rather healthy; my great-grandmother died in her sleep when I was maybe 10.

I wound up here after learning that my grandad was in the hospital and just *knowing* that he would be dying in the near future, and sure enough, he just went home (because the hospital can't really do anything for him anymore) and will die within the next two weeks - he can't swallow due to spinal damage/Parkinson's, and he doesn't want a feeding tube to keep him alive for another few months when he can't move his legs anymore anyway, so he's basically starving himself out.

I've also struggled with depression and suicidal ideation for much of my life, as well as extraordinary pain throughout my body, and while I'm far past the suicidal tendencies now, I still regard death as an old friend of sorts.

I spent about two weeks around Christmas taking care of my family, making sure my dad was eating and sleeping and such, helping organize things, helping keep track of which doctors said what and when, and so on. I left because I knew I had reached my limit (I basically have mild PTSD from growing up and being unintentionally tortured by my parents before learning about my disability, that causes enormous pain when moving or applying pressure or distributing weight, and a lot of that comes back when I'm in the house for more than a few days), but I knew I'd need to go back sometime soon to prep for the funeral, though I didn't yet know when.

Both before I went down and now, while recovering and getting ready to go down again, I wound up here as a way of sort of coping and sort of helping with the situation even though I can't physically be there to help. It's odd, but it does relieve my stress, and even though I don't really understand why, the why isn't important. -shrug-

mundabit,MorbidReality,1389528458.0,"having had pneumonia twice, thank you, There is no need to pass blme on the parents. The first time I got it It came on suddenly with strange symptoms, I felt dizzy and tired, But I had no cough, no rattle, no mucus. Not untill 2 weeks later, when I started to develop more mucus, and thought it was just a normal flu. Flu's last 14 days for me, so it wasn't until another 16 days that I knew something was wrong, My GP said it was probably just a bad flu, it wasn't untill I passed out while going up the stairs that my parents demanded a chest X ray and found I had pneumonia, I was hospitalised for a week as they tried to clear it, then I had to visit the doctors every second day to monitor it.

If we happened to live in a country without free healthcare, My parents may not of been able to afford the after care, and complications could of occured aesily.

the second time I got it I knew within 5 days it wasn't a normal flu, but the first 3 doctors I saw told me it was a ""stress cough"". It was my gynaecologist who said it sounded like pneumonia, and scheduled an Xray, she couldn't do anything but write letters to my normal doctor and try and get me in to see someone. I ended up having to use OTC expectorants and alternative therapies to recover because I wasn't able to get into the system with my level of illness severity or insurance. In that case complications would be rare, as I was older and it wasn't as severe, But in a child, a minor case can change quickly."

Usually, if you treat them like a human being who has just as many feelings and emotions as you do, they will go much further to help you than if you shout at them as if your crappy life is their fault and the new LCD that was faulty would have fixed everything.

I remember we had a problem with a delivery from a supplier at work, we'd had a few really bad batches of components and it was starting to affect our products. My business partner (ex hot shot London law firm associate) called up the supplier and gave them the nastiest earful about ""sort it out"" and ""passing the buck are you?"" I had ever heard. As soon as he rang off, I excused myself and called them back, aologising for his dreadful behaviour and then we investigated the problem. In the end, the problem was found and fixed and they said they'd send us a large quantity of another component we use to compensate us.

lordfuzzywig,WTF,1389528778.0,"Former DOC officer. You would be impressed with the ingenuity these folks have in regards to hiding things. A large item like that is generally stored outside of a cell, such as in a metal fabrication shop, where inmates can make money. At the prison that I worked at, we had an item that was probably twice that size and totally sharp. You know how big a broadsword is? It was about 3/4 that, and thicker. Terrifying weapon. In fact, a lot of these items won't be stored in a cell. If they do store them in cells, they'll hide them inside a giant legal paperwork box which we are not allowed to thoroughly examine (seriously).

You'd be amazed the amount of contraband I found hidden inside a box that was supposed to just be case paperwork. But for the big weapons, they'll make them, hide them in the shop, and wait until they need or want to use them. They know we're not allowed to search their case notes.

Alternatively, a very popular method is to hide icepick-style shanks in the yard in different places, so if a large fight ever happens, you have a lot of weapons at the ready.

We had a lot more crude grills. They called them ""stingers"". They'd partially disassemble their fan (obviously making it contraband), tear a bag of chips open, clean it thoroughly, and then use the reflective side as their heater. It was very, very effective. I've seen some kickass grilled cheese sandwiches made that way. We then, obviously, took the shit.

As far as the guns working, I can verify that they all will work 100%. Improvised firearms were a very real concern because they're very easy to make. I've seen much more crude ones work (such as a pen being able to fire a .22 calibre round).

The most common weapon, however, contrary to popular belief, is actually a lock inside a sock. Razors are pretty easy to find, since they're not allowed to have them disassembled. But a lock and a sock individually? No problem. So all they have to do is keep them separate until they want to fight.

EDIT: The scariest weapon I ever saw though -- and saw it used, sadly -- was a lock with a bunch of razors shoved in every crevice tied to a sock like a makeshift flail. The damage that caused was devastating. Horrific."

I think I disagree with you because I value the consent of the majority and see it as a feasible and better way to effect change then maintaining an almost literal war of the sexes.

Second, I take certain letters from whatever service I'm signing up for and run it through a letter substitution cipher that only I know (I mean, it's not something that would take anyone more than five minutes to crack if they had enough sample text, but it serves its purpose.) This makes up the second half of my passwords.

The resulting password is between 10 and 16ish digits usually, is easily memorizable after typing a few times, and in the off chance that I somehow forget it I just recreate it in my head using the same rules and it always comes up right.

Now if I somehow forgot the first half, that would probably suck.

Escaides,OkCupid,1389529758.0,"""Her"" is absolutely amazing. In fact, I saw it with a fellow Cupidite, and we both thought it lived up to the crazy amount of hype it's been receiving. I'm not sure if it resonated with us because of our online dating experiences, probably more because it's just a fucking great movie.

I think the reason I related to the movie the most is because it reminded me what it's like to experience love on a crazy powerful emotional/psychological/quasi-spiritual level. For me there are multiple dimensions of attraction (mental, emotional, physical) and there have been times in my life where I've gotten very intense crushes on people just by talking to them, at times before I even knew what they looked like. I can easily become addicted to just talking with someone, spending time with them (even if it's not in the same physical space), exchanging ideas, sharing secrets and feelings with them. When I was young, before I'd hit puberty, I'd even say the majority of my ""relationships"" were like this, and it was only later after I'd started puberty that sexual attraction began to become a part of how I am attracted to someone. Now a relationship without sex or physical intimacy isn't really desirable to me, but I can easily see myself still being capable of falling in love (or intense infatuation) with someone without any idea what they looked like, if I let myself.

Maybe people who don't experience attraction the same way won't ""get"" it, but the film not only really resonated with me but I found it very believable."

NoseFetish,cringepics,1389530201.0,"I would advise you to continue your tactic of complaining on /r/cringepics about moderators of another subreddit because it will allow you to vent your frustrations, and hopefully move past your negative emotions. 

I don't understand why people who don't like other people, just don't socialize with them or spend any time thinking about them. You don't like me, so I don't waste time thinking about why you don't like me or what your deal is. I'm not here to make everyone like me. 

You were banned many months ago, I can't say for sure but probably close to a year ago. Holding on to emotions about people who you've never met and don't mean anything in your life isn't healthy. Learn to let go and you will be a much happier person.

If you were polite, like some people who address us in modmail are, we happily will reverse a ban. I'm not going to go back through months of modmail messages to find where our conversation lays. I think your memory may be a little distorted, because I generally don't tell people to fuck off for nothing, ban for nothing, and I rarely use such language in modmail in general. 

Tons of people say we abuse our power, when in reality they just don't like structure of the rules or subreddit, or us personally. That's fine, they don't have to. You're not going to like everything that happens in your life or all the people you meet, and not everyone is going to like you, and that's ok.

It's a very interesting read, but it's also very sad. They compiled a lot of data and came up with some admittedly disheartening conclusions, such as:

&gt; **Black women write back the most.** Whether it‚Äôs due to talkativeness, loneliness, or a sense of plain decency, black women are by far the most likely to respond to a first contact attempt. In many cases, their response rate is one and a half times the average, and, overall, black women reply about a quarter more often that other women.

&gt; **Men don‚Äôt write black women back.** Or rather, they write them back far less often than they should. Black women reply the most, yet get by far the fewest replies. Essentially every race‚Äîincluding other blacks‚Äîsingles them out for the cold shoulder.

Tuala08,AskWomen,1389531501.0,"You are free to play whatever game you like, as long as you also have other hobbies and will put the game down to see me.  I also play video games but I am very picky about what I like and I don't really like to invest 3+ hours to learn it because I do not see it as a life skill and therefore do not want to put that much effort into something I see as entertainment.  I get frustrated easily so for example when I was playing Zelda (the shadows one) I would have lots of fun trying to figure it out but I REALLY hated that if I died I would have to repeat stuff, so I would always make my bf do the repetition to get me back to where I was and then I would continue on my merry way.  
Anyways, my point is I think it depends on the game and what someone's interests are (I had FPS, prefer adventure style things like Fable), their ability and time available... I might be more willing if it's summer vacation, but not when I am busy with school. And finally it's important how you approach it, let her learn at her own pace and don't be mean about it. I had to stop playing starcraft because my bf at the time just criticized the way I did everything and it was no fun."

""""You shall not hate your brother in your heart?You shall not take revenge or feel resentment against the children of your people, you shall love your companion as yourself."" From this it is clear that ""your companion"" refers to the same category as ""your brother"" and ""the children of your people,"" all explicitly referring to one's fellow Jew.""

Jakedubbleya,KansasCityChiefs,1389531846.0,"Kelce is a solid TE that got hurt in the preseason, we will likely see what happens there. ALTHOUGH there is an outside chance that superstud TE Eric Ebron may make it to the 23rd pick, an opportunity I don't see the Chiefs turning down easily.

Players often listed as quality KC first picks that may make it as late as 23 (our spot) in the draft:

1. Marquise Lee. 3rd ranked WR with a high upside (best receiver in the nation his Sophomore year) but some recent injuries and current middle-of-the-pack performances. Obviously we need WRs, and this guy could be a gem.

2. Eric Ebron. #1 TE by a long shot, touted as the next Vernon Davis.

3. Stephon Tuitt. 3rd ranked DE, Powe needs help, the Chiefs know it.

4. Calvin Pryor/Hasean Clinton-Dix. A draft class starved at the safety position makes these two valuable. With a Chiefs secondary in dire need of help, don't be surprised if Andy grabs one of them first round to make sure he gets some quality, cheap young talent in at the position.

5. Justin Gilbert. The #2 CB prospect. Once again, our secondary needs help.

We traded our second round pick for Alex, and that is going to hurt as there are many interesting players that could make it to us in the second round otherwise. Alex was worth it though. 

Look for Andy to pick the most talented player rather than one at specific position. Luckily, we could use help everywhere."

PatHeist,JusticePorn,1389532193.0,"On the contrary, studies show most pedophiles are functioning non-raping individuals in society. And the general view of pedophilia probably causes more problems than it solves. I'd think most pedophiles, by far, living in societies that recognize the lack of possible consent from a sufficiently young individual do so as well. And thus, realize that carrying out actions based on their feelings would be immoral. This, along with the comparably low child abuse to pedophile ratio would suggest, as could logically be assumed, that most pedophiles don't want to hurt anyone. Like most people don't want to hurt anyone.

Would it not be reasonable to assume that the average pedophile has the same feelings about sexually assaulting someone from the group of people they're attracted to as the average non-pedophile individual? With the only difference being that the pedophile knows that who they are attracted to could never consent? If so, I'd think rehabilitation and aid would be the best course of action to help an individual who has sexually assaulted a child in the past not do so again. 

And would it really be a big stretch of the imagination that this would be successful, knowing that rehabilitation has already been shown to reduce the re-offending rates of other crimes in sexual assault? (Possibly pedophilia as well.) In comparison to 'punishment' systems."

People will pay hand over fist worldwide for this technology and when the other companies see how awesome it is, they will fight to the death for the scraps.

That doesn't mean that open source will be banned from the car, but it does mean that the decision making, to the extent that it is done by the car, will have to be closed off from the user.  It is simply worth way too much money.  Microsoft guards the code for its proprietary apps carefully and even accepts compromises in performance to guarantee that only paying customers get to use it.  With google this motive would be magnified at least tenfold.

One way open source might be possible would be if you had a proprietary Google computer in the car (an Oracle) which issued commands and made decisions about where the car would be driven, and communicated with Google as necessary in order to make those decisions.  In addition, you would have a hackable, open source computer that was more like the operating system for the car: it accepted commands, managed the data connection, abstracted the interface to the car's mechanical system, and allowed the user to control everything.  That part could eventually be open source.  But it would be a big job to develop, and wouldn't immediately benefit anyone."

hermithome,TwoXChromosomes,1389532704.0,"Sorry, no, this is completely wrong.

You're confusing a relationship type with character traits. When people say that the thing they want in a romantic partner is a best friend they aren't saying 'kind and funny' or 'intelligent and confident', they're saying 'this is the type of *connection* I want.' Different people are going to want different things in a best friend. When I say that I'd like a partner who's a best friend, I mean that I want someone who's nice and funny and intelligent and interesting and much more. But I leave out those details because friendship is much more about connection than everything else: I've had close friends who were nice and funny and friends who were caustic and sarcastic. I've had close friends with differing intelligence levels. There are few personality traits that I consider 'must-haves', but a deep trusting connection is a definite requirement.

This is the problem with the 'friendzone' concept. Guys who think the friendzone is real are rarely true friends. They think that by simply showing up and lasting long enough they'll win the woman of their dreams. They aren't actually interested in being friends, they think it's a game that they have to play. And yeah, I'm sympathetic to nervous young people who haven't dated. But that's not what 'friendzoning' talks about. The friendzone doesn't describe every male/female friendship or even every male/female friendship where one party wants something more. The whole concept of friendzoning says that friendship is an obstacle to overcome. You should it avoid it like the devil, or if you can't, participate in the ritual so that you can bullshit your way through to the goal (pussy).

There's a different between being in the friends stage of a relationship and the friendzone. There's a difference between a nice guy and a Nice Guy TM. I get that it can be awkward to be friends with someone when you want more (and vice-versa). And I get thinking that you're a good person and wondering why the hell your life is sucking. Everyone has self-pitying moments where they compare what they think they deserve to what they have. The difference comes in what you think the world (or in this case a woman) owes you. You've hung around with her, been there to do fun group activities, listened to her talk about her life, and make her smile with corny jokes, so clearly, she owes you sex, right? That's the mentally of Nice Guy TM and the concept of the friendzone. 

Guys, when a woman tells you that she's not interested but that she'd like to be friends, it doesn't mean that if you're there for her enough she'll suddenly change her mind and sex you. If means that you have some qualities that she likes and she'd like to be your friend. There's this thing called friendship, and it's awesome. Girls do it, boys do it, sometimes even girls do it with boys. If that's not what you want then don't pretend to be a friend, just leave. Women don't owe the people in their lives sex. That's just not the way it works."

Noneerror,AskReddit,1389532776.0,"Dude... you are going to lose your house.

Loans aren't enforceable against objects (a house), they are enforceable against people or legal entities like the estate of the deceased. A house isn't a legal entity. If it's a mortgage then the mortgage names the person it's tied to. It's not ON the house. It uses the house as collateral against the named person. The bank doesn't have title to the house, your grandmother estate does. The bank is taking steps to secure title (paying taxes and upkeep) since nobody is claiming the title to the house.

You need to take title of the house. When the bank tries to enforce the loan against the estate the executor of the estate (aka executor of the will) says sure, show proof of that loan. IF what you say is correct and they've lost all the proof a loan ever existed, then loan becomes unenforceable and the title of the house goes to your grandmother's heirs.

The way you are doing it now *the bank is going to take ownership of the house then evict you.* I don't know what's really happening from what you said but I'd bet hard money you are screwing yourself over by trying to be clever."

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1389533164.0,"&gt;Hello I'm wondering if there exists a USB powered VV/VW device that can do sub ohm from 0.9 and up 

Are you talking about being able to fire a sub ohm coil, or just measure it?  Just about any VV/VW mod with the ability to read ohms should be able to measure sub ohm.  It just won't fire them.

&gt;because my ohm meter is broke, and don't know how many ohm I'm using now with my new awg 32 thread, 

What device are you using?  And it is wire, not thread.

&gt;so if it was a kind of vamo or anything else that was usb powered that showed me ohm

PatHeist,AdviceAnimals,1389533174.0,"Yeah... If someone's a veteran, they've kind of opened themselves up to criticism. Regardless of your feelings about the particulars behind it, you're aiding a war effort that is leading to a lot of death. And you can argue that you're saving lives, too. But then that should be something you are prepared to argue for. Being prepared to take lives and expecting it to never be questioned is kind of fucked up.

**EDIT:** So, I've been gone for a few hours. But apparently, I am of an unpopular opinion? I have to say, I'm a little intrigued. Is it really too much of me to expect a person who has, on purpose, put themselves in a situation where they are actively expected to take lives to defend the decision of doing so. Or even to just be able to give a reason that they feel justified their killings? When not even approaching asking for this in a manner that would suggest I am challenging them on their justifications? Am I expected to not question murderers (not talking about soldiers here) in their supposed justifications either?

Quit worrying about the past (I know it takes more than just one sentence) and learn to appreciate yourself.  When you quit worrying, confidence will be a little easier for you to develop.

Put yourself out there and talk to people.  You don't need to ask every girl out that you see, although it may help if you want to get used to rejection.

/r/seduction can help, but be careful about the advice there.  Some people take that advice and become manipulative assholes who give no fucks about life (it's in the stories).

As for the 1%, yeah, the Fluffy Bunnies definitely are a pisstake.  Names like the Hells Angels and the Bandidos aren't exactly the best PR, so what better image to give the public than a cute widdle fluffy bunny?  We're the 99%, and the idea is to include the Ulysses Club, HOG, Vietnam Vets, and many others (of which I have friends in all) in order to band together as one to stop this bullshit.

When HOG does a toy run with 700 bikes, with the police commissioner in tow, everything is fine.  When the Tribe of Judah, very religious people, does a toy run with 700 bikes, they get stopped and the toy run is a failure.  If they had done it together, everything would have been fine.

The Fluffy Bunnies isn't a replacement.  You don't have to quit your club to join the Fluffy Bunnies.  When I can get someone to do a logo, you'll be able to buy a patch and sew it on with the rest of em.  FWIW, I have NO intention of making any money out of this.

She was good Amish girl tempted by modern world, pulling her towards it [Kai asking ""Where did you go..""]. 

To test it and she did. It won her over causing her to step on hers origins [e.g. fucking with Hood in S01, car driving over bonnet in S02].

Her walking around in hers underwear with no shame about it showing hers acceptance of new her, acceptance of where she belongs now. To modern world.

Her spying on uncle fucking gave flashback from S01 where Kai got angry with her and threw her on bed while getting top of her. That look in hes eyes, hesitation and pulling away with frustration and hints of shame. Now Rebecca spying, watching, on Kai as he fucks with another woman?

Is it just me or is pull between these two that isn't just *family bond*? 

She obviously is attracted to Kai's strength and how he has survived in this, to her, new world. Kai's attraction to Rebecca seemed a lot more passionate, sexual, when going by that scene from S01. It could have just been that she was still Amish girl, basically, and Kai has fetish about them after all.

I'm not worried about my account because I don't really have any promotion to promote but I'm just trying to understand.

----

Under Spam they have the following bullet points

&gt; - Remember that in general, reddit is not a platform for self promotion

&gt; - We are a community: TL;DR, posting your own content tends to go over better (receive less downvotes/reports) if you actively participate in the community first.

----

Self Promotion takes us to the SP Wiki page which says

&gt; Here are some \***guidelines**\* for best practices:

| (*emphasis mine*)

&gt;You should submit from a variety of sources (general rule of thumb is 10% or less of your links being your own site), talk to people in the comments (and not just on your own links), and generally be a good member of the community.

----

[We are a community](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/120abl/we_are_a_community_and_youre_welcome_to_join_us/) takes us to a post by a mod in mod colors where he talks about the 10% rule in the context of basic 'quette

This problem isn't just in our subreddit, our community.  It's recognized across Reddit, which is why it's part of [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), which says in part:

----

&gt; Please do
&gt;
&gt; * **Feel free to post links to your own content** (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, and it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror ‚Äî you just might be a spammer. A widely-used rule-of-thumb is the 10:1 ratio, i.e. only 10% of your submissions should be your own content.

----

My point isn't that KoreanDev did anything wrong or right or that the mods shouldn't have banned his post. I'm simply trying to suggest it was a violation of 'quette and not a literal rule. and so far I don't see anything to suggest that 10% is a literal rule and it shouldn't be. "

Because it had climbed out of a gravity well done distance, the photon could not be reabsorbed, since it's frequency had changed as it lost energy. They then tried again, but moved the receiver and used the Doppler effect to make the receiver ""see"" the photon at a different frequency, and this time the photon was absorbed."

ctesibius,AcademicBiblical,1389534920.0,"&gt; We know from the archaeology that the Israelites were never enslaved in Egypt, never escaped en masse or wandered in the Sinai and never conquered Canaan.

Only if you choose to take one particular part (the numbers of Hebrews involved) literally - which seems to be cherry picking. You would not do this with other documents, particularly when there was no means given by which this number was arrived at, and when the document itself says that no census had been taken.

Yes, if we are talking about hundreds of thousands, there is *evidence against*. However if you were to estimate the numbers from the population that the two named midwives (in the story of Moses) could support, we're talking about a couple of thousand - a size which would simply not show up. This changes the situation to there being *no evidence for*.

What is there beyond that? Well, Joseph is said to become a high official under the pharaoh. Again, there are choices other than taking it literally. Is this the pharaoh of all Egypt, or some smaller area such as Goshen? Could his role be exaggerated rather than invented?

Similarly the Hebrews are said to be present throughout the land. But which land? Egypt, or a smaller area?

I don't think that the statement that there is evidence against their presence can be justified, only the statement that there is no evidence *for* their presence."

We celebrate together, we just celebrate different things. The few of my family who are Christian go to church, the rest doesn't. The celebration at home is just a big family come together, with good food and presents.

&gt; 2) graves your family probably do something about them

I have the big luck, that none of my close relatives died, except of one, but he is in the Christian part of the family and they take care of everything.

The atheists in my family (at least the ones I talked with about that) don't want to get buried.

&gt; 3) you probably have some friends who believe in one god or another

Not a lot. Some believe something, but I don't have a single friend who really are religious.

&gt; 4) is there a limit to what level (call it power level) you wouldn't make a friends with someone who is religious? for example priests level too high/grannys who go to church every sunday too much etc? or is it just practical he prays rather than doing something useful.

The limit is, when his style of life is in conflict with my style of life.

&gt; 5)What is the bigger reason for atheists like R. Dawkins to be so vocal

Guess that's different from country to country. I've read the ""God Delusion"" and thought it was pretty boring, because most of his arguments are against young earth creationists and alike. I live in Germany and you rarely find people who believe such a thing. But in America it's still big, so I guess one of his bigger reasons is education.

We have someone like Dawkins in Germany, his goals are different, it's much more about the separation of church and state.

&gt; 6) let's say atheism is not just to piss of religious people - so why there is atheism?

I don't understand the question. There is atheism, because there is theism. It gives a person a label."

That is, I'm not a teacher, however this is about a friend, who was in all my classes.

I live in the UK, so for the last two years of compulsory school, it's common to study A-levels, the equivalent of graduating from high school in the USA (assuming that you graduate at 18). Normally, people do 3 A-levels, and it's common to start 4 (you get a qualification from the first year, and the full thing from the second). 

At my school, there were a group of us who started 5 A-levels, myself and him included, however most of us only did 4 for the second year, and some only 3. He continued with all 5. That might not sound like much, but 3 keeps you busy enough for it to be considered full time education. And then there's the subjects themselves- he was studying maths, further maths, physics, chemistry and biology. I'm pretty sure that he had no time to socialise whatsoever, but that's not all.

A couple of years before us, two students achieved 4 A* grades (the highest possible) at A-level, in the same subjects except biology, and this was the first time that anyone had managed it. He got 5 A*s, with almost full marks in all his exams. So academically, I guess he's the most successful student I've seen.

Oh, and he's now studying medicine at Oxford."

wolfkin,boardgames,1389535574.0,"Have you been watching [Tabletop](http://geekandsundry.com/shows/tabletop/) because that's a great place to start. 

Also dont forget to scan [our Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig) for games. If you're really new to the hobby. I'd suggest playing some games so you have an idea of what you might like before buying. Go to a [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com) or play some games [online](http://www.boardgamearena.com). Those are some great ways to see what's out there even if you hate playing [[Dominion](http://www.goko.com/games/Dominion)] that tells us something. We know not to suggest similar games like [DC Deckbuilding Game] or [[Ascencion](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/9974/ascension-deck-building-game)].

It's also useful if you tell us what sort of environment are you playing in. Do you play with the same group of guys and gals consistently? Are you looking for something you can play with your family? Are you trying to find something that fits large party-like gatherings? Are you nerdy? Are you bothered by High Geekdom? How do you feel about cyberpunk? Are you trying to play serious gamez or just looking for a laugh and a good time?

We could probably find games that do a lot of these or none of these depending on how you respond. But again start with Tabletop. It's entertaining and it shows the ""fun"" of each game. In reality [Dixit] might be too simplistic for a regular group but you can see [when they play it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6UlbxeDE0w) how it might be fun.

I'm surprised you didn't note that Pullo shouldn't have survived though. And that it's ridiculous that a couple of naked blue barbarians could have made it into the heart of the military camp to steal the legion's eagle. But! THANK you for mentioning the bit about the talent! That one actually had me yelling at my screen saying ""WHERE'S THE REST OF IT."" 

&gt; Furthermore, I do not believe that private urban baths were terribly common, although I am not terrible familiar with high status housing in Rome itself.

Especially at this point? Nah, you're absolutely right. Private baths, *especially* for a family that wasn't exactly one of the ""greats,"" wouldn't have been a thing. Speaking of, was Vorenus' mythical kitchen in the first episode?

&gt; The fighting strategy of the Romans, in which they rotate their front lines, is based on a single passage from Livy but is a surprisingly durable myth that pops up everywhere. On the plus side, the whistle is authentic.

*hugs*

Don't forget to mention that Livy had a proclivity to make things up to ""polish a scene,"" as it were!

&gt; why are all the Gauls in sack cloth?

BECAUSE BARBARIANS

&gt; I haven't noted it before, but the soldiers' kit is superb.

The shields are all wrong :( Everything else is *perfect*, but the shields! Take pity on the shields! ....but what I really loved is the idea that the centurions led from the front. That's something you don't see often - all you generally see is the ridiculous idea of the *general* leading from the front (Lookin' at YOU, Gladiator). 

&gt; Alesia was built on a hilltop you dweeb.

I love you so much right now. You have no idea. *gives cookies*

---

One quick question - what did you think of the *casting* (besides Cato, who they got all wrong)? It seems to me that Caesar, while being a decent fit was...too flabby. And his hair wasn't thinning at ALL. And looked a bit too young. Pompey is probably the best depiction, as I can SEE the man we know as Pompey growing into the man in Rome, but he still seems....extremely flabby, especially for a man who supposedly showed off the energy of his youth when he was training his men in Greece - someone who participated in the martial exercises and supposedly still excelled in horsemanship. Know what I mean? 

Cicero was pretty...decent, but for a man who was the **oldest** of the lot, probably pretty bald (going by his statues), and probably chubby....eh. His loquatiousness didn't overly impress me in the show, either &lt;.&lt;;

They got Mark Antony SPOT on though :D

....Yes, I'm nitpicky. Sue me ;) Also, I'm totally up for tag-teaming this, if you'd like!

I've had more than one BMW shop rep flat-out tell my insured right in front of me that I was trying to screw him/her--This while quoting a $2000 price for the part when I was looking right at the NAGS list and it said $4-500.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AskReddit,1389535928.0,"yes i believe so, (in my country at least UK). just like a company cannot cancel your statutory rights which are protected under the law.

Basically such statements are unlawful because they do not have the power to relieve you of your rights under the law.

By signing a waver for not holding them responsible for negligence effectively you are removing your rights wrt to health safety (in the example of bungee jumping).

basically if in the case of a bungee jump, they were found negligent and i had an accident any waiver would be meaningless and any costs or death/injury would be fully held against the party that was negligent.

if companies could enforce these waivers they could completely removed all your rights and consumer laws.

in many cases, (such as statutory rights) simply advertising something that implies they do not apply is an offence.

For example: if a shop had a ""Terms of service"" you had to sign that if you bought a product from them you accept that you are not entitled to a refund should the product be faulty, this would be illegal to display (no refunds sign) and the waiver is meaningless as under the law the shop has to provide a refund for faulty goods not fit for purpose, else it would be forbidden to trade as a shop.

vivalaemilia,ucf,1389536956.0,"Hi, I'm doing the reverse- transferring from UCF to UWF. I'm a Pensacola native. 

*There's a hell of lot more to do in Orlando, and it can get a bit overwhelming. Trying to do everything at once is not the best plan. Try making a list of things you want to do/see/eat in Orlando and cross off two every weekend. 

*Get a Universal or Disney pass, if you like the parks. Sometimes after a hard test or bad day, it's nice to go ride a roller coaster or immerse yourself in Hogwarts or the Magic Kingdom. 

*Eat at 4 Rivers, Toojays, and everywhere you can downtown.
*Spend some time downtown and in Winter Park just walking around without an agenda. Go in wherever seems interesting. 

*Depending on your major, it might be really hard to get into certain classes. When planning out what classes you need to take, keep this in mind. It might not take 1 year or 2 to finish your degree. But hey, that just gives you more time not in Pensacola, right? 

*Get a longboard, learn to use it before you get on campus. UCF is a big place, and having something quicker than walking to get from the HPA or Engineering building over to Visual Arts in 5 minutes is nice. Bikes get stolen, but you can take a longboard into class with you. Also, you'll fit in because like half of UCF is also on a longboard. 

*Find a parking garage you like that doesn't seem terribly crowded and stick with it. The first 2 weeks of classes is not the time to do this. B is not this parking garage. I usually parked in H, when I parked on campus. Otherwise I parked in the visitor area in an apartment complex off campus and rode the UCF shuttle in. 

*If you want the professor to know your name, go to office hours. S/he's got a LOT of other students. They won't remember you because you held your hand up in class. 

*Enjoy it! I'm really passed off about having to leave Orlando and UCF to go to back to Pensacola and UWF. So live it up for me while you're there, OK? "
enlightened-giraffe,photography,1389536956.0,"From a practical point of view using full frame impacts these area :

1. More options for wide angle lenses (for example you could use the 14-24/2.8 Nikon, you can't get 14/2.8 on a cropped sensor)
2. Lower noise, you can go a step or two further with ISO, but this will only make a noticeable difference in really low light situations
3. Better build quality, more sophisticated AF systems, etc, this all due to the fact that full frame cameras are more expensive, doesn't have anything to do with the sensor
4. Better dynamic range, but good exposure technique will make a much bigger difference

It's not as big of a difference as it used to be, a D7100 or a 7D should satisfy an enthusiast's needs quite well"

They even felt superior to Bunny, although he was their friend. Later, when the shit hit the fan, they behaved like enemies. Henry attempting to poison Charles(?!).

The team  in New Orleans is changing their mascot to the Pelicans (??), so Charlotte is rebranding their new team with the old name.

You get weird stuff with team moves... The Cardinals are traditionally St. Louis, but in the NFL, the Cardinals are in Arizona because they moved but kept the logo.  Similarly, the Jazz are in Utah instead of New Orleans.  I really think it's time for them to give that one up. :-/  The Baltimore Colts moved to Indianapolis and Baltimore is still butthurt about it.

GeorgeOlduvai,scifi,1389538287.0,"Reading order...I normally recommend Flatlander (or at least a few of the shorts contained within it) first.  This will give you a basic idea of the culture that is produced by the technology introduced (which is really what most of Niven's stories are about [see my earlier note about characters]).  There are other short stories but they're spread out over various collections and thus become a bit of a pain to fit into a reading order.

After Flatlander move on to either the first 2-3 Man-Kzin War books or go to World of Ptaavs and Protector (depending on how deep you want to get).  If you choose Ptaavs and Protector...then read the Man-Kzin Wars up to 6 or so (mostly to familiarise yourself with the Kzinti and the more advanced history [the various colony worlds and whatnot])) or just the first 1-2 then move directly unto Ringworld (and it's sequels [if Ringworld grabs your attention]: Engineers, Throne, and Children).

This is where it gets tricky (I know, I know...as though it wasn't before).  Having finished the Ringworld series I would then direct your attention to the various short stories collected in [Crashlander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crashlander) (this will move your perspective backwards in history but will also provide relevance for the next step).  From there...the [""Worlds""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_of_Worlds) series (which will also bounce you around a bit in history but offers greater insight into the Puppeteers and Louis Wu.

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1389538296.0,"&gt;In short, could I get some suggestions for batteries (18650), and some info on what I need to learn about amp limits/ohms? 
The Sony VTC4 batteries seem to be all the rage right now.  Personally I'm using the same efest 2000 mAh batteries I had for my regulated mod.  I really like my dripper (IGO-L) right around 0.8 ohms, so they're fine for my use.

The amp limits you're concerned with are for the batteries.  The Sonys I mentioned are 30 amp batteries and my efests are 10 amp batteries.  You can calculate the amp draw by dividing your volts by your resistance.  Always use the voltage of a freshly charged battery, so 4.2 volts.

So in my case: Amps = 4.2/0.8

That's 5.25 amps.  Of course I'm just using my old SVD to measure my resistance, not a high end calibrated meter...  But I've got plenty of matting for error.  But if you want to go lower than say 0.6 ohms then *definitely* get a battery rated for 30 amps.  Always measure your coils before using them.  And whatever batteries you get should be IMR.  That is a common battery chemistry and catastrophic failure due to overdrawing them results in venting some nasty gasses, but that's better than turning your mod into a pipe bomb.

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1389538327.0,"This sort of sentiment is misogynistic. If we are to stop talking about women as objects, we have to attribute agency to them, and thus, we have to acknowledge their choices. If they lose their ability to choose for themselves when they are in a relationship that they seem to feel that didn't want to be in in the first place, they do not have agency. If women do not have agency, and are prone to falling pray to the whims of whatever man happens to court them, then what is the purpose of women in the work place or women suffrage?

The ability to make mistakes and recognize decisions as your own is what makes us human, if you accept that you are just flowing through space, merely reacting to your surroundings in logical ways, you are indistinguishable from a rock, and should have as much rights as one.

No, rape is not when you have a choice and you feel you've made the wrong one. Rape is when your agency is forcibly removed from you. When you are coerced through actions you had no control over, to have sex. This includes drugs that were given to you without your consent, physical restraint, or threats of violence to you or another you care about."

We've a local Asian marketplace, it's a little out of the way so it's always a treat to go.

fromyourscreentomine,AskMen,1389538441.0,"I dated one black women and she was doll like as far as dresses and makeup.  The problem was she was literally a typical black woman.  She was a little ghetto in her swagger but talked normal.  She had a 1 year old kid with a thug father who was in prison.  She lived in her parents rental and lived off of welfare.  She shopped at wal-mart and made sure her 1 year old always had nike.  She smoked new ports and pot, plus she never went out.  She was out of shape, and never bothered to lift a finger.  She eventually kicked me out after an argument about politics.  She had a very narrow minded view of the world.  I would date a black women again if I was single and she was nothing like the last one I dated."
