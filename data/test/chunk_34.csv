rockspeak,weddingplanning,1389644057.0,"I'd recommend having your SIL be your MOH, and your FH already has his BM, then leave it at that.  It's fairly traditional to have sisters and SILs in the bridal party, and this would give you and her a chance to get closer.

You can also consider a mixed party (men and women on either/both sides), but it seems your main issue is not having enough close-friends to fill a larger bridal party, so I feel like having just a MOH would be a good fit, and your SIL would be an ideal choice.

Have you seen the movie ""I love you man?""  If not, I highly recommend it.  It's a very fun and sweet movie about a groom trying to meet and make a best friend, because he has no male friends.  It's one of my favorite movies, but I just love Jason Segel and Paul Rudd.

**Also, a story:**  My BFF got married recently, and her FH didn't have any close male friends, so while my BFF could have put together a bridal party of 4+ girls, her FH didn't have anyone close he wanted to stand with him.  

She asked him to get more social, to try to get closer to their mutual friends, and while he did those things, he still didn't find anyone he felt comfortable asking to be his BM.  Eventually he asked his ex-best friend, whom he had had a falling out with but was trying to mend the relationship, and that ended up being his best man.  My BFF couldn't forgive the BM for the issues in the past, but she put her feelings aside so her FH could have his BM.  The BM ended up doing a great job the day-of, and my BFF forgives him (pretty much) because he's really shown he's changed.  

I know these are examples of men trying to fill their best-mate position, but hopefully the info help you a bit!  Just remember that you're an awesome person (how could you not be, for your fiance to want to be with your forever?) and you deserve friendship.  Even if it's awkward or hard, you CAN and WILL have close friends, regardless of gender, and they'll be there for you at your wedding and beyond."

With proprietary software the inner workings are closed to most people, you have to rely on a small cadre of highly trained professionals to really understand it and be able to fix things if something goes wrong, if they can't resolve the issue or just feel like leading you to believe it's more difficult than it is, there's little that can be done.  Open source software however is open to analysis by anyone, from the highest educated specialist to the truck driver doing it as a hobby. The truck driver may misinterpret something, or not understand it all 100% but he will start to grasp it, even if slowly and develop his own ideas and notions. More eyes and brains working over something is always better, even if all those brains don't fully understand it. I agree that people are prone to rash, stupid decisions, but I firmly believe that knowledge is power and power shouldn't be concentrated in the hands of a few elite.

I'm curious about your sources on this. It seems to me that herbivores are often migratory, and aren't immune to exhausting local food supplies (overgrazing). Some of them are also quite fast (pronghorns, horses, kangaroos), although I guess the very fastest animals over short distances are carnivores (cheetahs, falcons). There are also some herbivores which are really smart (elephants, parrots), probably comparable with really smart carnivores (dolphins?)."

Nomopomo,Anarcho_Capitalism,1389644282.0,"**Education**  
  
Kling's education podcast episode, wherein he outlines why he has sever doubts about the ability of MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) to have the substantial impact on education that many people think they will have.  

Changed my view.  
  
Says the only real beneficiaries to online courses are:
  
* People who are already going to MIT/etc but can now watch the lectures online and then socially learn with peers down the dorm hall.  
* People in totally remote areas that had the ability to learn technical materials but not the resources. These two groups are small and so almost no impact.  

Says their failing is to take the classroom model and blow it up to mass audience, and that the actual way forward is to ask 'what would you do if there were a single student in the classroom?"" and use AI or something to automate a personalised service, riding the sweet spot in difficulty, feedback,emotional support, coaching etc.  

So proliferation of education that moocs think they'll get is probably a lot farther off than they think, and they also talked quite a bit about post secondary education in general. Really fascinating.  
Mentioned one of the lowest hanging fruit would be to separate teaching and testing into independent institutions. That students like better and choose more often profs that grade easily. Separate teacher from examiner so that students demand teachers that prepare them well.  
  
Here's the episode: http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/10/kling_on_educat.html  
  
**On the fence**  
  
I can't tell if I should be eating meat, from a moral standpoint. It's obviously really sad what we make many animals go through, and if I could avoid it I would. But I get so much benefit from it. More than most in fact. I am on a ketogenic diet and so get most of my calories from animal fats and meats, and think that meat is an essential part of the human diet.  
  
My guess is that farming can be made tolerably moral by treating animals as humanely as possible, assuming meat is as nutritionally valuable as I believe it is, and the fact that there's no replacement right now.  
  
Hopefully this won't be an issue in the medium future, when all our meats are produced synthetically in vats. Yum!  "
Andrew9623,AskReddit,1389644283.0,"My funniest experience of high school started innocently enough. We were at a friends place, just hanging out. One of my friends found some eggs in the fridge and jokingly suggested egging someone's house. For some reason we decided to do it. We went to the fridge and got out the eggs and found some leftover goulash (weird I know). We took the goulash and eggs, got in my friends SUV and went to our targets house. We picked the house of a girl that goes to our high school. She was the BIGGEST BITCH OF ALL TIME. She lied constantly, acted like she was superior to everyone and faked illness to gain sympathy. Anyway, we get to her house and sneak up to her back deck. Three people stayed in the SUV for a quick getaway. Just as we're deciding how to go about actually egging the house the my friend who had the goulash takes it, grabs a handful and throws it at the house. As soon as that happened it was a free for all. The back deck was covered with egg in a matter of seconds. When everyone ran out of eggs and goulash we booked it back to the SUV. On the way back down the road we ran by the local pothead hangout. They started shouting at us waving their arms around. Once we got back the the SUV we peeled out of there and went home. A few days later I overheard one of the potheads who were at the hangout that night. Apparently they saw us get out of the car and run up the road towards the house we were egging. They then said that they saw the SUV's car alarm go off (the guys in the car accidentally set off the alarm). They assumed that we were running around looking for cars to rob and tried to rob the SUV, setting off the alarm. When they saw us running back towards the SUV they shot at us with airsoft guns (we thought they were just shouting at us). They then saw us get in the car and drive away, they thought we stole it. I got a few chuckles out of that one. 

TL;DR: egged and goulashed a house, got shot at by potheads and had an overall good time."
Esotericgirl,relationships,1389644283.0,"If I had something big going with my friends, I think I'd be pretty pissed if my SO didn't go with me and instead decided to hang out with his friends - *depending on the situation*. We don't know the situation here, but if you had agreed to go with her to said event (which is *probably* the case, as big events which are hosted people typically assure attendance ahead of time) then you were a dick for canceling. Period.

If you were asked last minute, that's a bit different and her reaction may very well have been excessive. It's *also* different if you'd made plans with *your* friends ahead of time for the same time/date and she had known for awhile that you wouldn't be attending with her. If *that* was the case, it wouldn't make sense for her to be upset about it, either.

So, you have to clear the situation up first to get more pointed advice, here.

If you choosing your friends over her has been a trend in your relationship, then I could see this situation being the proverbial ""straw"" that broke the camel's back.

If you have had to fight for time with your friends because she always wants to spend time with you, she's probably absolutely right that you two just don't want the same things. She may very well require more attention/affection in the relationship than you do.

Again, I have no way of knowing if this is the case.

If you want to try and salvage things here, you have to talk with her.

Ask if she'd be willing to talk about things before she gives up. Tell her that you want to understand how she feels. Ask her what she feels makes you incompatible and tell her that you'd like to work on those things if she's willing. Ask her what has changed between you, what she wants from the relationship *now*, what her goals are for the future (for herself and for the relationship). **LISTEN TO AND ACCEPT THE ANSWERS SHE GIVES YOU.**

Then share your feelings about these things with her, and compare.

Maybe you *aren't* a good match. Or, maybe there is another reason. Maybe she just doesn't want to be with you anymore, which will be something you'll have to accept if that's the case. Let her know if that is the case, she should just tell you that outright.

There's so little information here to go on regarding your relationship, it's hard to give you more than this. 

Key point is though, talk to her.  "

mrcleanup,rpg,1389644305.0,"If you have computer programmers in your group, MapTool has a more robust scripting system.

You would then click the token of your opponent, click the attack macro, and it would roll the dice, compare against AC applying all bonuses and stats for both people, tell you if you hit, whether it was a critical, and tell you what the damage was. You can create macros for nearly all spell effects too, basing damage on level, telling you what the save DC is and if they made it and everything.

Roll20 is a newer product and doesn't have as robust a scripting system, especially at the free level. They do have an API at the paid level, but then you don't need someone who dabbles in scripting, you need someone who knows full on Java.

We have been using Roll20 lately, it has some advantages being online based and not local server based, and it is getting better more quickly and has more active development at this point then MapTool, which is a little older and development has slowed down on."

Truth be told, divorce happens. People grow apart. When you feel forced into being in a relationship for the sake of other things, like children, it can be exhausting. And in your case, where you say you have been unhappy for over seven years, I can understand where you are coming from. 

Sometimes we just need to walk away from a relationship or a marriage in order to find out who we are. Having time to yourself and being who you want to be can help you become a happier person.

Well that's pretty clear, because you're talking about a game mode/s where several sets of gear are very competitive, and then comparing it to PvE where 1 set of gear reigns supreme.

The entire point of the discussion is to get PvE to come closer to where PvP/WvW is with having many more competitive builds. Right now PvE is basically everyone wearing white gear. Except that white gear is currently called Berserker.

That isn't a bunch of people, such as yourself, on Reddit sitting behind their PC's making comments who have no real inclination on what is actually going on in the fan bases mind.  These are born and raised Clevelanders who could give a rats ass about anything outside of Cleveland sports saying that WE knew that he was leaving.  It wasn't unlikely at all and the fact that you say it was unlikely really makes me wonder how long you have actually been following the NBA.  We all knew that it was a very real possibility and it happened.

What has the front office done that has given you any real inclination that they know what the flying fuck they are doing?  Who wants to go to a situation with how far away the Cavs are from a championship and return to an owner who publicly ridiculed you in a letter saying that the Cavs would win a ring before the Heat would.  We have one of the most toxic situations in the NBA right now and play for a coach who based on reports you had previously gotten fired because you did not get along with.  

Yes, LeBron coming back is a possibility but it is a VERY small one.  You do not base your decisions around that or you get burned.  Look at what happened to the Mavericks this year.  They based their entire off-season strategy on the chance that they can land Dwight Howard.  Where did that get them?  Exactly where they were a year ago and another year wasted on the aging Dirk.

Poly requires a lot of work with regards to working past deeply ingrained beliefs about relationships and what one is supposed to get from love. Many teenagers seek identity and validation through romance, so they strongly want to be someone's ""one and only"" and to base their self worth on their partner's view of them. This makes poly ""harder"" for those teens who are drowning in this culture of insecurity and desperation.

That being said, there's no reason high school kids can't make poly relationships work. It just takes the same kinds of self awareness and communication, which can be harder for teenagers than for adults."

Additionally, the obligations to his personal sanity and happiness have to be put on the back burner because he promised to take care of another person. You can't just decide to stop taking care of people that are dependent on you when it becomes less fun to do so. He didn't even say that she'd done anything bad...*he's just bored*.

I agree, he does need an exit strategy, but the burden of guilt falls on his shoulders. He asked her to move in with him, he agreed to pay for her school, he said she didn't have to work, and he implied that he would marry her. It's not going to be easy to find a simple way out.

And I'm not sure why you think that she's not 'pulling her own weight'.

&gt; ...she cooks and cleans for me and tries her best to give me great sex...

...and she's also going to school full time. Sounds to me like she's doing exactly what was agreed upon, plus some housework, for someone who told her she didn't have to work, and that they would foot the bill. If he thinks that's her not pulling her weight, then he should never have agreed to that arrangement in the first place. 

You can't just stop taking care of people you've agreed to take care of when it becomes harder for you to do so. "

Which is not the case, and stating it is *unsympathetic*. It is a demonstrable proof, even if we just base it on the activity between these two subs, that /r/tall has a greater preponderance of women fawning and flirting over taller men and enjoying being tall themselves, compared to /r/short where men do not have women pining for their affection or complimenting them for being cute or whatever. 

It is this lack of feminine contact, that leads the men of /r/short to become jaded and upset. Which is *completely understandable*. While I don't think they are prejudiced, I do think they're dating prospects are much lower then a larger man **all things being equal**. 

We both know, even if we just base off the posts by women on this sub, that it seems that the majority of women are looking for taller men.. to the extent that shorter men are discredited *solely for being short*.

PirateCodingMonkey,askgaybros,1389645114.0,"the hardest part is just doing it, but really think about this: what's the worst thing that could happen? will he try to attack you? doubtful unless he's a real ass. will he scream and run away? same answer. what's the absolute worst thing that could happen? he might be polite and brush you off. yeah, it's rejection, which sucks, but it's not going to hurt you or embarrass you.

so, you go up to him and just say something like, ""hey, i see that we have the same class. what do you think about what the teacher was saying about (whatever was said in class)?"" or ""i didn't really understand when the teacher was talking about (whatever), did you get it? can you explain it to me?""

if you don't have a class together, ask about something you have in common, or ask him about himself. ""have you declared a major yet? i'm having a hard time deciding what to go into"" or ""what do you think are the chances the basketball team will make it to the finals this year?"" even something as simple as ""how are classes going? what's your favorite class this semester?""

the point is, get him talking about something he likes, you have in common, or that he knows something about, then just ask follow up questions. most people like to talk about themselves, and as long as you don't ask awkward personal questions, if he has any interest in you, he will keep talking. if he doesn't have an interest, you will know it pretty quickly. that said, most people - unless they are real bastards - will be polite when talking to someone they don't know well.

so, think about what's the worst that can happen, what do you have to lose, and what do you have to gain, then go for it."

I mean, he's a STEM major and he goes to the gym regularly, but he loves and respects me as a human being and likes to maintain a sense of equality in our relationship.

Not black women directly in that thread, I suppose, but I can't help but see it as a response to the ""Are black women inherently less desirable"" one. Cuz Asian women are the absolute picture of femininity, exact opposite of black women, right??? The valorization of femininity itself also bothers me.

You also say nothing of the father, so that's kind of a wild card as well.

If the marriage is as loving as you think it is, it will survive this.  I've seen this happen and people live with it.  

She put you in this situation, you could even offer her a straight-up ultimatum.  ""Tell him in 6 weeks or I will"".

Some of the internal problems were structural (it's hard to equally divide *power* in any kind of organizing structure, but it's much easier to divide voice and control), some were behavioral (many people were first time protesters that expected rapid and drastic change to be accomplished), and some were logistical (without the communication structures in place beforehand and the volunteer basis of everything, coordination was sometimes exceedingly difficult).

But... the point I was making was that those problems were surmountable. They were something that could be solved and fixed, *until* law enforcement started actively and quite forcefully sabotaging key people, efforts and systems. That created negative feedback loops in the problems that were already present, and made it easier for them to execute the next ""op"".

I mean, we got wise to it eventually. At one point we divided information about a planned march in a way where literally no one knew the entire plan, and we only communicated face-to-face in ""moving meetings"" (invite only basis) through public areas that had at least 100 ft of open space on all sides. It was the most successful event we held since the initial march, and the main reason was that we took information security very seriously for it, we abandoned certain philosophical beliefs when they were logistically inconvenient (such as discussing and deciding ALL details in front of the entire group), and for the first time the group gave me the approval to directly and tightly control the PR for the event.

OWS had lots of internal problems, but they would have been solvable without the interference of law enforcement (in ways that were illegal in Oregon by the way... see *Squirrel v. Moose, Oregon Supreme Court*).

Without the presence of those issues to begin with though, i don't think that the actions of law enforcement to sabotage OWS would have been as successful. Or at least, they would have had to be a lot more forceful about their sabotage."

If that's the case, then why do people call someone who's sex is male but gender is female a ""man""?

&gt;Why do you think the cliche of ""I'm a woman trapped in a man's body"" comes from? If someone told you that, would you then say ""actually, due to your male sex, you're really a man""? I like to think you wouldn't, because it's insensitive.

Again, you're forgetting that ""man"" refers to *sex*, not gender.  Calling that person a ""man"" is in no way denying that their gender is female!"

That being said, you shouldn't be too worried. Attraction is just chemicals. Relationships are a choice. There isn't some magical mechanism that completely turns off all mating instincts just because you're hanging around with someone you call a ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend."" Attractive people don't cease to exist when you enter a monogamous relationship.

It's normal. It's otherwise known as ""having a pulse and functional hormones."" He probably isn't fighting a constant battle not to jump every attractive women he sees.

&gt;Well if this second deity has a completely separate version of creation maybe these things wouldn't be sin at all in that universe.

For the purposes of this hypothetical situation, I had mentioned that the second deity was equal to this universe's deity in principle, i.e., he has the same ideals.

&gt;it would of course be man's fault because of free will (that's the loophole for almost every christian argument)

I'm not sure if you're trying to put words in the mouth of a christian or if this is truly your answer, but I'd like to engage in a logical discussion as to why the free will of a human from another dimension enters into the equation of accountability here.

With a master's degree in psych you should know better than to conjecture about internal motivations of a (frankly strawman) archetype. It will get you nowhere when it comes to testable theories and practical solutions. In fact, that idea of ""compensating for insecurity"" is one of the oldest psych 101/armchair psychologist truisms in the book.

If you want relevant information about issues affecting men and their relationship with cultural masculinity, I suggest starting with the APA's [Division 51 Website](http://www.division51.org/). While I agree the psychology of men's issues is painfully understudied, there *is* a great deal of well-constructed academic research in print about them.

Combined together, you might find you no longer date in your age range.  I'm not interested in marriage so many women in my age group peace out quickly.  I tend to bring this up almost immediately.

Sometimes you will find the woman who thinks she will change your mind, but they get over that fast.  Most women might fuck you once and then move on.

It also behooves you, if you're not interested in marriage, not to waste her time.  She's on a schedule, her eggs have a best before date, so just get out of the way.  Let some guy who wants to get married take a shot.

GroundDweller,AskUK,1389646010.0,"I understand, but a lot of young people (me included tbh) just don't identify with the mainstream parties who seem to focus on older people probably because they are the voters. They see these old men and they think that they can't relate to them and don't care about them. Even the ones that have some good ideas ruin it with some ridiculous policies (*cough* Green Party *cough*). Honestly, I think we had our chance to bring some change with the AV referendum but we fucked it up thanks to the media bias and the awful 'Yes' campaign. It'll be a long time until we get that chance again.

Personally, if there was a social democratic party that looked to appeal to ALL potential voters (and didn't focus so much on the environment) and wanted to introduce PR, I'd be happy to vote for them. It's a shame left-wing politics in this country are in such a poor state. I think that if there was a party that had a leader that has the same effect that Farage seems to for UKIP (can't deny he's effective and appeals to his target voters), young people may be motivated to get out there and vote. The Lib Dems could have been this party but they signed a deal with the devil and will pay for it. Until then, with youth unemployment as it is and the tuition fee increases and whatnot, people like me will continue to be disillusioned with politics in the UK."

I have no idea what it would be like to interact with my *own* children, as I don't have any (yet?). But when I see babies or children in public with their parents I just melt. It's like seeing someone cuddling an affectionate puppy times a hundred. When I see a mother nursing her baby, or a father holding his little girl in a museum and telling her about dinosaurs, or whatever, it's like this enormous universe of possibilities unfurls in my head within seconds and I see myself doing these things with my own kids some day... Explaining the solar system, defining words, playing I-spy on car rides, reading them books before bed time, getting peed on and muttering about how I'll tell this story at Christmas when he brings home his first SO, stepping on toys in the night and groaning before peeking in while they sleep to make sure they're still breathing... The good and the bad and the insanely stressful all feels like it would be magic to me. And ugh. The most concrete thought at the forefront of my mind is, ""I WANT ONE!!!""

I can tell I'm an adult because now that ""Son of Man"" song/scene in Tarzan makes me super emotional because I imagine watching the movie with my future tiny toddler son and getting emotional *then* because--sniff--my little guy is going to be a *man* someday!

Kineticillation,TheBluePill,1389646077.0,"Honestly, I breezed through Scott's blog post and used Alone's blog to address Red Pill as a whole.

Are you asking if I think Scott is saying society punishes promiscuous men, but doesn't punish the men just wanting to be promiscuous? I don't think there's much difference between the two, at least in the U.S. We live in a very ""sins of the heart = sins of the flesh"" society. The pedophile is as bad as the child molester. A man who wants to be promiscuous--as in, they would be if the opportunity came up or the risk went down--is frowned upon as much as the actually promiscuous man. My problem with Scott's argument comes in here:

&gt; But in general, society is organized as a virtual prison for men’s natural desires. I don’t have a solution in mind. It’s a zero sum game. If men get everything they want, women lose, and vice versa.

He's asserting here, and further up in his post, that men are crazed sexual animals. That they would take/capture/rape without society around, and that is their default instinctual response to women around them. I think that's sick and sexist, and a huge stigma that men have to fight today.

It's the reason society punishes (I'm not sure about that word, I would really rather use ""stigmatizes"", as there are no real repercussions other than a damaged reputation and society as a whole can't even agree on the crime taking place, so why is it a punishment?) the promiscuous man, I think."

Capntallon,teenagers,1389646105.0,"I made a Dan Brown style clue chase based off of that. In my eighth-grade English book, there was a note saying ""page 238"". I was curious, so I checked out the page. There was nothing fancy about it.

So, I circled letters on the page so they spelled out a Vingenere cipher that said ""Below 243"". I had a hint to the key word on the page. Underneath locker #243, I taped a note that had another Vigenere cipher and keyword hint on it. This one led to the top of the double-doors that closed off the hallway. From there, the clue led to a note taped to the back of one of those roll-up world maps in the history teacher's room. Then the trail led to a morse code message carved into the side of a podium. This clue led to a note under a table in the lunchroom that was never moved anywhere. This clue said ""Above 1986"". What you did for this clue was open the wall-mounted senior photo book. Open the yearbook to 1986 and feel above it. There you would find the final clue, one that led to a waterproof container in the main drainpipe outside of the school.

What was in the drainpipe was a congratulatory note and ten dollars.

Two years later, an eighth grade kid by the name of Brooke came up to me. She had completed her quest. She said it was difficult, but she had completed it none the same. She showed me the notes and I looked down on her and smiled, congratulating her on her epic win.

Sure, a large amount of the new hires had connections helping them, but what percentage of the overall applicants were fraternity men? I would recon a large amount. How about white vs black vs hispanic vs any other ethnicity ? Im sure its a majorly white dominated field of interest. What percentage were female? Again, probably male dominated. Even picking 350 at random from 18,000 a trend will begin to form. The data they are presenting in this video in particular actually proves nothing without knowing the whole story, it is all speculative. 

With only 350 new analysts, in a market that is run by white males, with children they have been grooming to join their profession, its no wonder that there isn't a large new class of black males or females or what have you. Any change to a companies demographic will always be slow and steady. As more ""minorities"" hold those positions, a larger amount of these minorities will actually vie for these jobs as a future career, thereby increasing the number of applicants and theoretically, the number of new hires.

You'd be surprised.

Anyway, this is the reason we need to wait to see UBI's effects before making such a big decision based on conjecture of free market economics, when most peoples' understandings of free market economics don't adequately represent how the free market works.

&gt;It's possible that it would drive up wages for some jobs, but not others. Dead end current minimum wage jobs would probably be paid more, while more enjoyable jobs, or jobs with the potential for career advancement or making it big later on might pay less.

Hard to say. More reason to wait so we can evaluate this further instead of making kneejerk decisions!

&gt;That's a good point though. With so many unknowns this stuff needs to be approached with caution.

Exactly. Your points are conjecture, as are mine. We don't KNOW what the market will look like with UBI fully implemented, and I think that being said we shouldn't make such a rash, irresponsible decision without knowing the consequences. I will say the potential costs are likely greater than the benefits go. At worst, we'll get status quo, maybe slightly worse than status quo if the taxes on the rich go up. If we eliminate it, we could either get some benefits, or drastically adverse conclusions. Seeing how it's likely the bad may outweigh the good, it's best to wait and take a muddle through approach.

VHS did, so VHS won. the internet, of course, is a product of DARPA, but was quickly used by users for sex (e.g. newsgroups devoted to sex in the form of texts, stories, arranging meet-ups, etc.)

with the war machine (hopefully) winding down, sex will be the driving force behind a lot of future developments. more realistic sexual avatars and androids will probably lead to breakthroughs in prosthetic limbs and replacement organs. the desire to have more realistic streaming porn will lead to advancements in telecommunications and videography. the desire to have sex in free-fall or in low gravity will spur the growth of space tourism and planetary exploration.

I'm certain they did see it coming, I'm also certain they had mounting automatic takedown notices that they had to deal with.

&gt; Do you seriously think Youtube will last forever?

Not sure how this is relevant. No, I'm certain nothing lasts forever.

&gt; There is no contract between content creators and Youtube.

I don't understand how this is relevant either.

&gt; They are pretty much being nice enough to pay people.

That's not why people are angry. If I promised you a share of money in exchange for producing some content for my website - you'd be understandably pissed off if I stopped paying you for something that wasn't your fault. People feel cheated, that's why they're angry.

&gt; It's not Youtube's fault that networks took too many people and didn't regulate enough.

This is really badly phrased, but I think I understand what you're saying. It takes too many people to regulate such a large system; after all hours of content are uploaded per second, how is any number of people ever meant to police it? But that still isn't the point, you're saying people should be grateful they got anything at all - and they are ridiculous for even mentioning that they aren't being paid for something they were previously promised.

There are changes that youtube can make - and which I imagine they will make. In the meantime people are perfectly entitled to be angry."

A little backstory: there was this girl in my high school that would always take the same bus as me to school. I would always look out for her because she was very attractive. So, I would naturally notice every time she was around. 

Moving forward several weeks, winter break rolls around. Normally, my family always goes on vacation around this time of year, so this year, we went to California. I don't remember what city, but think about this: I'm from Miami so first of all, that's a trip across the country. Within this particular week, we chose a day to tour the city and wound up visiting some science museum. This is where I blew myself away. Within this WEEK, within this CITY, at this particular MUSEUM, and at this particular HOUR, I freaking saw the girl across the lobby when we were purchasing our tickets. I literally froze in shock and didn't want to believe it was her. The way I was 100% sure was because she had an attractive older sister that would also ride the bus from time to time. They were standing next to each other and were looking right at me, possibly stunned just like I was. I had no clue what to do at that point. I just stood there, eventually regained my awareness, and simply walked on. Turns out she was with a group of friends and at some point, we happened to come across the same exhibit and I could hear her explain that yes, I was a kid that went to her school.

This happened a few years ago, yet I still remember it vividly "

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1389646623.0,"So question. I'm reading R. Kaplan's (z'l) Tefillin. I'm about 15 pages in, so not all the way through, but I have a question so far, as a lefty:

In it, he says that to help us remember the ""with all of your heart, with all of your soul, with all of your might"", that we place the arm tefillin on the left hand, closest to the heart. 

Then, he says later in passing that it is worn on the weaker hand. (Haven't read any explanation for this yet... might appear later in the book?)

So does the reasoning for the weaker hand override the reminder of ""with all of your heart"" in the case of a lefty?"

Every day, checking in with teachers and providers, making sure she didn't ""misbehave"" and then having to somehow discipline her for every little infraction...she threw a temper tantrum in which she flailed a kicked a teacher in the shin, she wasn't paying attention, she was talking when she wasn't supposed to, she got upset about this or that....omg, it's never ending. 

It's exhausting and we get to the point where I feel like I'm putting too much stress on her. She's a great kid, just ""strong-willed"". I wonder sometimes if I should cut her some slack. I feel like I'm being forced into a position to follow up on everyone else's negative reinforcement and I hate it. I'm not being given enough positive to outweigh it.

Attention is always nice, but this man has laid out his priorities.

I suspect that you can't make that jump in your mind, that you won't ever believe that it could just be a game because he is manipulating your emotions.

Do you want to get married someday? It won't be to this guy. If you do then end this and keep your eye out for someone more appropriate or the prefect guy may come and go and you will be too wrapped up in this fantasy to even notice.

I visited Ireland about ten years ago and it struck me as a community driven environment, everyone knows most people and most people are helpful and nice to each other... in LA there are hundreds of different communities so the hardest thing will be having faith that you will find your new group and it will probably take a few different tries. I've lived in two major international cities, a minor metropolis, and a country town and the happiest and most productive times in my life have been when I was part of a company of like-minded people I was excited to see everyday.  As soon as you two find your community, you will be very happy here and LA is so diverse that it will happen, you just have to search for it."

Whereas there is a brand of SJWs that have a repellent, race-essentializing substantive message wrapped up in social-justice discourse that anyone left-of-center is going to agree with in principal.  

e.g. - Soleil Ho's ""some food writing is dumb and racist"", which many would agree with, somehow transitions to a mandate that people have to only eat food that comports with what people of their same skin color and geography ate at some time in the arbitrarily-defined past; 

another example is how the concept of privilege is applied.  Privilege can be useful as a way of understanding how individual racist or sexist institutions combine to change the lived experiences of some people.

The icky kind of SJW has turned it into a notion of ""original sin"" which allows people who experience life differently to use privilege rhetoric to silence the views of others, essentially turning public debate into a contest to see who can play the violin for themselves better."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389646962.0,"Just for the record, her sarcasm was toward you, not to him.  Infer what you want, I suppose, but my online persona is not the same as how I am in person.

And I get what you're saying, but you also miss the possibility where she isn't necessarily in the wrong, or at least not as severely as you've stated.  Like I said, I've been in a similar situation.  Just as an example, on the way to an event, I said something like ""We really need to work on not running late.""  She figured that if I brought it up, it must mean that she was responsible and that I was blaming her for it.  In reality, I recognized that it was a problem, and just wanted to talk about it so it wouldn't happen again.  Any normal person would have said, ""yeah, maybe we should _____ or we shouldn't ______"" but not everyone is that rational.

Having said that, what if he really is overreacting to everything?  We can't know.  Just because people are biased, doesn't mean that what they say necessarily is.  For all we know, she's not displacing responsibility, and is actually putting it where it belongs.  If all he does is try to blame her, it's totally understandable that she might get a bit defensive when his actions toward her are irrational and filled with anger.  *My* whole point is that assuming one way or another is a waste of time.  You're using random bits of information mixed with thinking her entire statement is heavily biased and must be wrong since it's one sided, and using that to make an argument that might not be relevant at all."

think of it this way: if you were straight, you'd do the same thing, right? if you wanted a hook-up, you'd go to a bar or post an ad, and find a girl who wanted to shag. if you wanted to date someone, you'd begin by looking at the people you know or people you interact with, and start finding out more about the women you were interested in. yes, the pool is smaller because there are fewer gay men, but the same idea applies. look at the people around you, that you know, who are gay, and get to know them better. if you don't know any gays, you need to meet some."

So let's put all this together with some extrapolation. You select for women who:

a) are established or establishing themselves in their own career, thus demonstrating that they don't need someone else to pay their way in life

b) rely on things other than looks to get by in life, i.e. are willing to put in effort to get where they want to go

c) are not demanding in terms of what kind of activities, or how pricy of activities, they consider a good time

d) have an appreciation for economy and charitableness apart from what it can gain them personally

e) have interests and motivations in life apart from getting as much stuff as they can for themselves

f) demonstrate interest in your career for itself, rather than focusing strictly on the paycheck, *and I will tell you now that you can very easily determine this in a short amount of time simply by talking about the non-financial aspects of your career and watching her reaction to what you say*

g) this one wasn't mentioned in the thread, but it ties into the ""don't choose women solely on the basis of their looks"" part, and guys on reddit who complain about ""no nice girls out there"" are ALWAYS doing this: DO NOT LOOK FOR HAPPY EVER AFTER IN THE PARTY BARS. No one goes to party bars looking for happy ever after. People of both sexes go to party bars looking for a good time. You go looking for a LTR in a place where people gather specifically to have short term fun, you're gonna have a bad time.

If you go to the party bar hoping to find a mature, down-to-earth, long-term-equal-partnership-relationship-quality woman with an established career, and then go out of your way to pick the hottest drunk 21 year old woo girl that you can find and take her home, you are destined for disappointment.

Necron_Overlord,Cascadia,1389647149.0,"&gt;The grand congress would only function as a means of voicing the issues of the community the delegates represent and coordinating defensive and economic efforts. All power would lay within the communities and the people. The beaucracy wouldn't be there, because a centralized state doesn't exist. 

There's a fundamental contradiction though, in that this ""grand congress"" will be powerless without some form of institutional bureaucracy to carry out its orders.  A government that must reconstitute all of its institutions every year is a government doomed to failure.

Consider the problem of a military.  We can't not have a military, that's a ridiculous proposition in the modern world.  At the very minimum we need to have a ready response to large scale disasters and a force that can participate in international peacekeeping missions.  It is impossible to maintain a ready military force without a bureaucracy.  It can't be done, someone needs to requisition and pay for bullets and food for the soldiers while they train.

You can't fire your entire military every year and restart it the next, it won't work.  It'll be a complete disaster unless you hire all of the exact same people to the exact same position every year.  Do that, and you'll end up with the exact same situation we have right now, where our constitutionally-prohibited army gets ""renewed"" every two years but keeps on being the same beast its always been.  A system where the bureaucracy that controls the military -- the Department of Defense -- ends up determining military policy.

No, career politicians are not the problem.  They are an effective counter to the problem of unaccountable bureaucracy.  The problem is when politicians are unaccountable to the public, which defeats the purpose of having elections.  That's the problem that needs to be resolved."

FollowerofLoki,pagan,1389647453.0,"I worship both Loki, the Nordic god of trickery/change, and Airmid, the Celtic goddess of healing and herbs. 

Because I am an eclectic pagan (one with no specific dogma) I don't have any rituals or practices that is specific to the worship of Loki or Airmid. Obviously, there are things I do to respect them, and to let them know I'm thinking about them. But they are things that I created for myself, to work within the context I understand. 

For example! Separate altars for Loki and Airmid. Not, Airmid tends towards being a more gentle and understanding goddess, but Loki can be jealous. So if I do ritual for one or the other, I tend to try and keep them in specific places, on opposite sides of my apartment. The reason I do this is because I want to respect the fact that Loki wants a set territory. 

And it's okay if you ask me questions. :) "

TJDG,feminisms,1389647471.0,"That's a much more measured reply, so I'll try and expand a bit more. To be honest, I have a bit of a thin skin when it comes to anonymous comments, so it means a lot to me that you took the time to respond in a balanced way; thank you for doing so.

I can appreciate why it's ironic and a little annoying to discuss men when the female experience is the  focus of the movement, and I do appreciate the work that's done to try and de-construct the idea that women should be accommodating and helpful. I apologise for any misrepresentation as well; I was trying to illustrate the fact that, due to a lack of a proper initiation, I ended up believing in that misrepresentation for a number of years. I also admit that I could have been inappropriately generalising; perhaps many teenage boys find it easy to understand feminism and act in the way that feminists want. I also realise that I'm an adult now, and that I have an obligation to work to understand the movement better.

I appreciate that it's clearly detrimental to the academic discussion to recover old ground, and this is no doubt what's so tiring about having to constantly educate people like me; if you want to dig deep into old ideas and really mull over what makes society tick and how it could be improved, then I can definitely appreciate why it's irritating to have people barge in and ask for a 101 every 5 minutes. It is worth noting (as I'm sure you already know) that there are people who view feminism as a purely academic critique with no political arm, and there are those who want to discuss rarefied points within purely feminist spaces, and from that point of view it's perfectly ok to slam the door on the right-wing, the men, the ignorant and uninitiated. If you don't want to campaign, I accept that it must be very annoying to have the role of campaigner thrust upon you.

However, I think that if you *do* want to bring about non-violent social change, there's real value in education. There is real value in there being a group of people who go around initiating people into feminism, and there's value in that initiation being patient and tolerant. There's real value in easy-to-understand slogans and rallys and petitions and protests and placards, even though they might be simplistic ideas expressed using inexact language. There's value in standing on the metaphorical doorstep and being persuasive. You don't have to be accommodating or helpful to be persuasive, but you do at least need to explain what you want in language that the person you're trying to persuade can understand. That's what I was crying out for as a teenage boy and that's what I was trying to illustrate to the OP; the demand for a clear and effective 'feminism 101' (which does not misrepresent the movement) far outstrips supply, and I view that as one of the biggest problems facing feminism.

Yes it's tiring and annoying, but I think it's important to recognise that it's worthwhile. If you think it would be a good idea for people to act in a certain way, then there's value in communicating that to them."

DirtBurglar,AskReddit,1389647502.0,"Our Spanish teacher had a daughter that went to our school. She was also on her second marriage with a man who had a son from a previous marriage as well.

Our story begins when the Spanish teacher committed suicide. The daughter blamed the stepfather for the mom's depression and suicide. She decided that to get even, she should kill her stepdad. Since the stepdad had also abused his son for his whole life, the daughter figured she could convince her step brother to go along with it. They hatched a scheme where they would fake a robbery and kill the dad. They shot him and tied up the daughter for the police to find her. She told a story about a burglary gone wrong. Of course they weren't able to get away with it and are now both in jail.

1 non-fatal shooting

1 fatal shooting

1 pistol-whipping

1 face licking / sexual assault

2 people knocked unconscious, possibly by a blow to the head / neck?

4 other people knocked unconscious possibly by tranquilizers in their tea / punch?

multiple slaps

multiple pokes in the face

1 sprained arm/elbow


(I am sure I have missed some stuff but you get the idea)

Characters are also threatened with guns, a knife and a tire iron.

I am not necessarily disagreeing with OP, but Sherlock is not a great example. A few slaps to the face is getting off lightly in comparison to everything else that happens.

NumbMyLove,AskReddit,1389647514.0,"The thing is the movement wasn't meant to be full of rapists. This may shock you, but there will always be bad people. I was very involved in occupy. I'm also a female that ha been raped (though that had nothing to do with occupy whatsoever). Your metaphor about ""wrecking a few eggs"" is beyond horrific. It's complete hyperbole. No one wanted people to be raped, the movement didn't lobby for ""rapist rights."" The movement was about holding wall street responsible for their own corruption. As it continued on it became more convoluted. But it had nothing at all to do with protecting rapists. You are calling an entire group amoral because of the few bad.

The 0.005 vs. 0.01 examples show a noticeable change in the number legendary drops after 8,000 simulation runs, to the point where the shape has changed noticeably, and the number of single drops has increased by a fair amount.

However, the developers are also interested in keeping the drop rates not ""too high,"" because you could have lots of outlier/edge cases where somebody gets 10 legendary drops while someone else gets none, and both scenarios are happening often enough (see the long tail in the binomial graphs).  Whereas with the second set of graphs, there is no such long tail, very few people are getting 0 drops, and literally nobody is getting 10 drops.  

The pattern is still not extremely predictable with the second set, because it is still RNG, only in this case, you're not frustrated by 0 drops after 100 hours, only wondering if you'll get 1, 2 or 3 legendary drops within 2-4 hours of gameplay (the peaks in the graphs).

borkedhelix,webhosting,1389647651.0,"Here's a quick overview of what the options do:

    Automatically Detect Configuration: Checks the IP of your MX record in 
      cPanel's DNS, and determines if it should be local or remote.

    Local Mail Exchanger: Accepts and attempts to deliver mail to this domain 
      to email accounts located on the server

    Backup Mail Exchanger: Acts as a staging queue for your primary mail server. 
      If the primary server goes down, it accepts mail for your domain, and holds it 
      in the queue until your primary server comes online again.  Shared hosts 
      often don't support this option, but you can use it by setting up a second MX 
      record with a numerically higher priority (higher than your primary mail server) 
      that points to cPanel.

    Remote Mail Exchanger: Rejects mail for this domain, and attempts to send all 
      mail for this domain to the MX record in DNS.

The reason that it is set to Local by default is because often times people will not use their cPanel server to host DNS.  If set to Automatic, cPanel will check its own DNS for this domain, see that it appears to authoritative for the domain (MX record in its DNS points to itself, and set itself as a Local Exchanger.  

In this scenario, we are not using cPanel as our name servers.  cPanel checks its own name servers, and sees itself as the MX record.  The rest of the world checks the authoritative name servers instead, and send mail elsewhere.  In this case the server would not be able to send email to the domain correctly, but the rest of the internet would.

TL;DR: It prevents the mail server from rejecting email addressed to your domain, no matter what DNS says.  It's the lesser evil setting of email routing."

Remote is used for third party email services like Google Apps for Email.  Automatic decides based on the IP address of the MX record in cPanel's name servers, and backup is is a backup email queue.  

If the domain is using third party name servers, the IP in cPanel's name servers may indicate local, while it should be remote according to the domain's authoritative name servers.  In this case, if you wanted to have the website send an email to an account on this domain, it would try to deliver it locally.  If the email account wasn't configured in cPanel, it would just bounce, and never get delivered."

Did you just ask me why God must present the messiah in the way God said it would happen in the OT?

&gt;If the prophecies of Judaism don't come true, then it's just as false as Christianity if Jesus does not fulfil the prophecies about the Messiah. 

Yes and no. Christianity as a truth value is predicated on those prophecies being integral to the foundations of it. This is not the case for Judaism who claims to be true based on Sinaitic revelation.

&gt;Which Christianity still claims still must be fulfilled by Jesus.

But until then, he didn't fulfill it. Why do you accept somebody who didn't even do half the job and then said it would happen in a manner that contradicts the OT?"

I work in a WINE BAR. It has the name WINE in the restaurant's name. What about that says, ""SUUURE! Bring children!"". We legitimately do not have a kids menu. And our menu has items like shishito peppers, seared scallops in corn chowder and curry duck egg rolls. Not exactly kid friendly.  

If I can get past the mess, the noise and the general obnoxious nature of crotch fruit, people don't realize that at your fancier restaurants, we don't have the high volume or space of your big chain restaurants like  Olive Garden or Applebees. So while those places are rife with kids, servers know that they'll get three or four more seatings at that table during a shift.

If you take up a table (or in this case 3 put together) of our restaurant, you're taking up space for people who might have ordered wine, real sized entrees and cocktails. By insisting that little Johnny can have a bowl of buttered noodles and cheese (because you guys can make that special for us, right?) that you're robbing a server of another table with a higher check average and ergo, a higher tip.

IchBinEinHamburger,AskReddit,1389647871.0,"Guy made racist comments towards some of the black football players, and they sodomized him with a broom.

EDIT: Tried to find the news story, but no luck.

EDIT 2: I have some time to sit down, so I'll give a little back story. There aren't a lot of black people at my school (according to Great Schools, it's 38% white, 38% Asian, 20% Hispanic, and only 2% black), but there generally wasn't any racism towards them or anyone else. Then there was this guy, who we'll call Travis. He was a nerdy ginger guy from a wealthy family (his house looked like a castle). Travis always acted like he was better than everyone, and nobody liked him. He was basically Malfoy without the magical abilities and good looks and friends.

One day, let's just say he went a little too far. I don't know what he said exactly because I wasn't there, but  apparently it didn't go over well. The black guys were offended, and their other teammates had their back. They took Travis into the locker room (or they were already there, I'm not sure), beat the shit out of him, tied him face down to a bench, found a broom, and jammed that broom into a very uncomfortable place.

Several of the players were expelled (no coverups, presumably because the team sucked anyways), and Travis was never heard from again. Pretty much everyone at the school agreed that the act was excessive, but justified. *That's* how hated he was."

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389648082.0,"&gt; Do you really think people who are working to live will go to work for 8 hours for $16? No, they will find something else to do that is more productive. There is an actual floor as to what a person will work for. The cases you find where someone accepts a $2/hour job will be ones where the employee is learning or interning, and the ""payment"" is in experience.

At the very least, illegal immigrants would.

&gt;I agree that welfare SHOULDN'T be wages, but your argument is that we should pay someone more than the free market would pay them, why? What other reason can you give other than a handout to that person?

Because the free market is a code word for allowing businesses to push their workers around. Even with UBI this won't change. ""Free market"" ideals do not sway me. I believe government needs to regulate the economy to keep it from being exploitative. Even with UBI, you'll still need a job for any level of social mobility.

&gt;This is exactly why you don't understand the actual effects of Minimum Wage. It is also why there is no reason for me to continue discussing this with you. You don't care about how it actually affects the job market, so you can't possibly understand why it is a really bad idea.

It would affect it little. The wages will remain identical to what they are now. Unless you think the taxes will have a big impact, there's no reason to really lower it. If some dont want to work because of UBI, we could have low unemployment AND high wages.

I also liked how you highlighted the first half while ignoring the context. At least you included it though.

I'm a utilitarian. I have no loyalty to free market principles, I want the greatest good to the greatest number. Millionaires having a little less money to spend is the least of my problems because 1) they'll still be rich and the relative impact will be minimal compared to the relative gains made by workers and 2) they're a small minority.

For your example to be equivocal, it would have to be a woman saying, ""I only date black guys because they all have huge dicks and play basketball or football and talk in movie theaters.""

The problem isn't with men who are attracted to Asian women, it's with men who claim they are attracted to Asian women when what they really mean is that they're attracted to the stereotype that all Asian women are submissive, demure, won't talk back, and will generally worship the ground they walk on."

In Restoration, you will need to focus on perks relating to healing, cost reductions, and wards. Respite is very important.

In One-handed, you will need to focus on perks related to power attack cost reductions and mace improvements.

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1389648249.0,"&gt; The souls of men leave Arda forever to be with Eru for reasons unknown

Technically we don't know where they go. Could be with Eru, could be into the Void, or to another World. Who knows.

&gt;How is it problematic that an obviously imperfect race can be twisted into something horrible? 

Orcs do not appear to exercise agency in being evil. That is, they are driven by the will of Melkor and his successor, and do not choose or reject evil -- they have no opportunity to do so. Compare to Men or Elves. Feanor refused to heed Melkor. The Numenoreans turned Annatar away. That both eventually fell to the lies of evil demonstrates their ability to choose -- an ability no orc ever demonstrates.

&gt;the idea that the elves are somehow so pure as it would be impossible to twist them into orcs is doesn't make sense 

Obviously not, as that was not what I objected to. It was Melkor's ability to make something flawed into something irredeemable without that thing's cooperation that I was questioning, not Elves' ability to be corrupted. Obviously you need only look to Maeglin or Feanor or Maedhros for corrupt, thoroughly fallen Elves.

&gt;Orcs are an abused, tortured, enslaves and oppressed people who have been indoctrinated over thousands of years into being what they are now. It's possible that there is some redemption, some succor for their souls. Why would Eru abandon the souls of such creatures as these? 

I don't think he would, but the question is about redemption within the confines of the World. Elves get that opportunity; Orcs apparently have no means for redemption and it is never expressed. That's the problem.

&gt;Also, Orcs appear in the first age of Arda, while the race of men does not awake until the rising of the sun much later. So the belief that orcs are men is much more problematic simply because men did not exist yet.

Which I actually noted. Tolkien was considering re-working the timeline of Men's appearance at the time of his death to account for this and help explain orcs."

Feminists believe that men and women are equal and should therefore be treated as such.  Further, masculine and feminine traits are equally important and both men and women have varying levels of masculinity and femininity.

*Some* feminists prefer men keep more of a sideline view because they feel that men dominate most conversations.  An analogy would be black rights activists who welcome white people into their movement, but prefer white people take a sideline approach and let black people who have had the black experience dominate the conversations because white people dominate most conversations.  It's not that they're saying white people are inferior or deserve less rights, just that they feel like they should be allowed to own their own movement.  Many feminists, however, *do not* believe men should have to be on the sidelines.  And many men are *not* on the sidelines.  Every male professor I worked with in academia (mainly English literature and writing as well as some other liberal arts areas) called their selves feminists.  The first feminism professor I ever had was male.  I have never heard one of these men say that they believe they are inferior to women.  Rather, they recognize the harms that the patriarchy causes to both sexes and they recognize the harm of misogyny.  

&gt;If the movement's ideas about you is that your identity is associated with toxic gender privilege, in order to join the movement you have to take yourself down several notches and assume an inferior position in relation to those without the privilege.

Again, this is showing a huge misunderstanding of feminism.  No one is asking you to ""assume an inferior position in relation to those without privilege.""  But getting rid of male privilege so that men and women are on an even playing field *is* what we're looking for.  If you have a problem with being on an equal field with women, then feminism is probably not for you.  Similarly, black activists want white privilege to go away so that people of all colors can being on equal ground.  That's not asking white people to become inferior, but to become equal. 

&gt;One odd thing I've noticed is that feminists often claim that ""patriarchy hurts men too,"" and that feminism therefore helps men, usually when arguing that something like the mens rights movement is unnecessary (which I'm not affiliated with, btw). But then, feminists get angry when men bring up male concerns as part of feminist issues. 

This is probably your best question.  I would disagree with your statement that feminists don't believe a movement for men is necessary.  Many feminists would support a men's movement, but do not support the current MRAs because they aren't really about men's rights.  They exist not to help men be recognized as equally nurturing and important parents; not to provide resources to men who have been domestically or sexually abused; not to bring awareness to the high suicide rate and murder rate of men; not to promote the recognition of mens' emotions as equally important to womens'; but solely to tear down feminism and women.  Check their subreddit, search the word ""c*nt"" and see how many times it comes up.  Check out how many of their front page links are there in order to tear down women or feminism.  

Another point to this question is that some feminists believe that since feminism was started to promote the rights of women, it is in fact a movement about women's rights, and should remain that way.  That doesn't mean they feel men's rights aren't important, just that they aren't part of the movement.  Beyond that, they feel that eliminating the patriarchy will help both men and women and so a men's movement is not necessary.  I personally feel that there's nothing wrong with an actual men's movement that cares about men's issues and doesn't discount women's issues.  In fact, I'd be happy to be a part of that movement if it existed.  Imagine that - a women's movement and a men's movement, both working towards toppling the patriarchy so that both sexes may have more choices in life.  That would be wonderful.  But it's not what we've currently got.

I'm not sure where you got the idea that feminists believe men should be inferior, but it's simply not true.  Please read some books on feminist theory and I think you will see this."

HS: 14 year old kid found dead in the local sandbox with his throat cut. Cops ruled it a suicide because the knife was nearby- apparently a few feet away in his trail of blood.

EOverM,worldbuilding,1389648729.0,"My Guns (G-guns) are fairly unique, I think.  They're handheld gravitational projection weapons - I've not come across any other sci-fi universe with artificial gravity that has weaponised it.  Here's the brief description I put in the wiki I'm using to organise everything:

&gt;The Gun uses a proprietary variant of AG technology to form a ""gravity tunnel"" that accelerates a projectile to a significant velocity - depending on the application, sometimes a small portion of c. The effect is strongest within the barrel, as it is lined with the projectors that form the field, but the Gun is more than capable of continuing to add impetus to the projectile after it has left the confines of the weapon itself. This effect is limited to a maximum range of ten times the length of the barrel. Given that the weapon detects the local gravity field and accounts for it, ensuring the projectile is in lateral freefall during acceleration, it affords complete straight-line travel for a distance of eleven lengths of the barrel. This, of course, means that when used in a gravitational field, normal ballistics do not apply. Special training is required to use a Gun anywhere other than in freefall.

AG is just artificial gravity, in case anyone was wondering.

The one time one's been used in my writing so far, it was used at such close range by an untrained operative that the gravity tunnel actually extended THROUGH its intended target, liquefying a tube through his chest, which was then punched out through his back by the bullet.

It didn't end well for him."

JarlesV3,dogeservice,1389648861.0,"Oh, I should have explained the difference between charge and octet structure. These are two different but related topics. The first part (The charge) is related to the electronegativity, and where the element falls on the periodic table. The second part (The Octet) is related to just the Valence Electrons.

Let's start with our Charge.. I'm going to assume you are familiar with the periodic table, and electronegativity. The charge is whether or not the atom (or molecule) has a total positive or negative charge. There's a formula you can use (charge = # of valence electrons of the element - #free electrons - # of bonds) But I'd rather go over what it means. Take a look at Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen on your periodic table. We say that a neutral Carbon atom has 4 electrons in its outer valence shell. Nitrogen has 5, and Oxygen has 6. This is due to it's location on the periodic table. This number relates to the number of protons in the nucleus. In order for each atom to be neutral, it needs to have a number of electrons in it's outer valence shell equal to the number we just discussed.

**but wait**, is what you're going to say to me. ""Aren't we supposed to have 8 electrons for it to be stable? How can we have 5 electrons to be neutral and stable for Nitrogen?""

Yes, the octet rule says that we need 8 electrons in the outer valence shell to be stable. And here's where we differ between charge and octet.

For the Octet, we count every electron associated with the atom. Every free electron (you'll find them in pairs unless you're playing with radicals), and every pair of electrons in a bond. So looking at Serie 2, Nitrogen has 4 bonds, each bond has 2 electrons, 8 electrons associated with Nitrogen. We have the Octet Rule confirmed!

For the charge, we count every free electron, and *half* the electrons in the bonds. This is because the free electrons are ours, but the electrons in the bonds are shared, more or less equally. So we count the bonds as only 1 electron. Again, looking at Nitrogen, we have 5 electrons normally associated with it, and we have 4 bonds. 5-4 = +1 That's our Charge!!

We can do this with Serie 2 : 1 as well. Take a look at the oxygen, and confirm the octet rule, and the charge. You can also do this with Serie 2:2 and look at the middle Carbon."

Imagine the work ants and other small bugs do when a large mammal dies, the exact same thing happens when ships are put out of commission.  Why? Well, there comes a point in a ship's life when it is more expensive to retrofit/fix it than to sell it off for scrap metals.  Very poor people do most of the grunt work.  Most of the work happens in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and the top place used to be China.  It's extremely dangerous and difficult work.

They can go 3 wide and play match-up with Vereen, but the running threat from that grouping hasn't worked out very well for them, so it's been pretty easy for teams to pressure Brady in obvious passing formations.

What has worked has been a steady diet of power running, and converting 3rd and short with occasional play-action deep shots.

steve496,49ers,1389649078.0,"If we can retain Brown, that would help a lot.  I'm just not sure we can make the money work.  As an established multi-year starter he's probably more expensive than Brock, which puts him in the Boldin/Whitner/Rogers/Gore category of ""we like all these players, but they're $5 million each so we have to prioritize"".  And if you prioritize that list I don't know if Brown is far enough up it to have a real shot at returning.

I was more optimistic about the prospects for Wright a week or two ago, but the fact that he didn't see the field against Green Bay even with Rogers injured concerns me; we played Cox instead, and while he did well, he's also someone we've already cut once this season.  I do think we try to bring them both back on near-minimum contracts, but I'm not at all convinced that they're viable starters for next year.  So if we let Rogers (and Brown) go I think we need to be aggressive in going after CBs in the draft to maximize the chance that we'll be able to piece together a solid unit."

strangestdude,TheRedPill,1389649089.0,"&gt;The problem is that none of this can really be proven or disproved either way.

Feminist theory seems to be based on the anti-positivist approach to sociology which is inherently and intentionally unscientific, and unfalisfiable. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipositivism

I think it's only the feminist 'masses' who believe that feminist theory is objectively true, when it's just an interpretation of data, social dynamics, and culture based on presuppositions. Like any social or political theory IMO and IME.

Based on my analysis practically everything outside of the hard sciences (aside from quantitative research) isn't genuinely intersubjectively verifiable. Partly due to intention (ie. the anti-positivist approach) and partly due to the problem of consciousness.

Everything else is basically practical philosophy (though quantitative research in sociology - that doesn't deal with self reporting - seems like scientific data gathering).

I don't think that makes an interpretation useless or unbeneficial (after all the redpill paradigm is not scientific, despite some enthusiasts claims), but it does nullify it's claim to being intersubjectively verifiable or 'objectively truth'.

I think the only thing that can successfully challenge feminism on wide-scale is popularizing an alternative paradigm for analyzing gender issues. Right now the only popular paradigm analyzing gender issues is feminist theory/the patriarchy.

• She tends to fall in with ridiculous fads, and when I was younger I was forced to participate too because I had no other choice. Where to begin...

1. She believes in astrology. She's got a calendar with phases of the moon that I'm pretty sure she uses to guide her decision making.

2. She believes in homeopathy (for those that don't know, it's essentially sugar pills that are supposed to cure illnesses but when it works it's because of the placebo effect). I don't know if she still believes in it but when I was younger and had a headache or a cough, instead of being able to take actual medicine I'd have to take these sugar pills which didn't work, so I’d have to continue on in pain. 

3. She spends hundreds, probably thousands of dollars on a ""doctor"" whose sole purpose is to touch a metal pointer (hooked up to a computer system) to my mom's hand which tells her everything she's allergic or sensitive to. Riiight. She made me go when I was too young to be able to refuse. And it's not just a one-time visit. She goes back like once a year because her allergies ""change"" and then she needs to go buy new vitamins from this doctor's store. 

4. There was a period of time when I was younger that she claimed I was lactose intolerant and refused to let me eat dairy even though it's my favorite food group.

5. There was also the time I wasn't allowed to eat sugar. That didn't last long, thank god!

6. And then there were the months of the disgusting vitamin drinks. The most retched tasting things ever. I had to drink them three times a day. 

7. She's on a strict budget and is complaining about money but will shell out $30 a pop for her ~50 bottles of various vitamins and supplements that she NEEDS.

• My birthday is a week or two past the deadline for kindergarten admission, and it’s well known within my family that she thought I was smart enough to start a year before I was technically supposed to so she lied about my birthday so I could start kindergarten early. I always kind of appreciated that she did this because even though I was always younger than my classmates, I routinely pulled excellent grades and did really well in school. I can only imagine how much more bored I would’ve been if I was a year behind. However, my grandma and I were recently talking about this and she informed me that she never really liked how much my mom stressed intelligence when I was little. I don’t remember this, but my grandma told me that my mom used to drill me with flashcards to try to make me smarter. That kind of made me realize that while I had always thought she got me a year ahead because she thought it was what was best for me, it might have just been that she wanted to be the parent with the smartest child. I don’t even think it was about me. I always got good grades because it was expected. I had to do well.

• I try to be the responsible adult in the house so I try to explain to her when I have issues with something she does (instead of resorting to her silent treatment behavior), but she never really listens. For example, she tends to throw out any food that has reached its expiration date, even though those dates don’t always mean much. I’ve told her that it drives me nuts when she throws away my food that I bought with my own money because all too often I’ll be looking forward to eating something and I go to make it but can’t find an ingredient because it turns out she threw it away because it expired YESTERDAY. I’ve talked to her about this and asked her to just leave my food alone and if I get sick eating something expired, it’s my fault and I’ll take responsibility. She initially agrees and says she won’t do it again. But then SHE DOES IT AGAIN! The cycle repeats.

• My extended family plays cards a lot when we get together at my grandmother’s house. If you accidentally discard a wild card, you’re not supposed to get to take it back because “a card laid is a card played.” My grandma does this a lot though, and we usually let her take the card back. Actually, almost any time anyone discards a wild we end up just letting the person take the card back, although it’s technically against the rules. But whenever I’ve accidentally done it, my mom is always adamant that “a card laid is a card played” and I never get to take the card back, but when someone else does it my mom is fine with letting them take the card back. It’s not that big of a deal, it just irritates me that she has a different set of standards for me than for anyone else. It seems like she constantly has the attitude that she needs to treat me a certain way in order to ensure that I don’t end up a spoiled brat.

• She feels like anything I do that she doesn’t agree with, I’m doing it for the sole purpose of hurting her. The only real boyfriend I’ve had was in college and we dated for three months, although we’d known each other for about a year beforehand. I was really happy in that relationship, and I went over to his place a lot during that time so she knew I had a boyfriend. I’ve never really been comfortable talking to my mom about boys though, so even though she repeatedly tried to get all kinds of details out of me about him, I didn’t want to talk about it because it was awkward. I don’t feel that type of bond with her. Even though I liked him a hell of a lot, our relationship ended before it got to a serious stage where we met each other’s families or any of that stuff. So I didn’t meet his family, and he didn’t meet my mom. Anyway, anytime I criticize something she’s doing with regards to a relationship, she says “you have no right to butt into my relationship! You dated a guy for THREE MONTHS and *I* didn’t get to meet him!” Really? First of all, it’s not a normal thing for a relationship to have progressed to meet-each-other’s-parents levels after three months. She says three months like it’s five years. And second of all, it has nothing to do with her! She thinks that I purposely kept her from meeting him because I wanted to hurt her. She doesn’t realize at all how ridiculous she sounds when she whips out this argument all the time.

Alright, I think I'm done now. Thanks again for letting me get all of this out. And if you've read it all, you are awesome.

I didn't actually sell them, I just worked with our ""warehouse"" and in fiscal. As soon as I was told ""I was found out, but thankfully nobody else yet"" we quickly sold off the rest at equilibrium, split the profits, and I destroyed any evidence that was left.

yourdungeonmaster,pics,1389649332.0,"Snake keeper/breeder here (own eleven snakes currently).  I don't agree with all of #4:

| NEVER feed ANY snake in the same cage they live in.

Most of the breeders I know feed snakes in the same cages they live in without any problems.  I don't typically handle my snakes during typical feeding time, and I've never been mistaken for food in this way.  If I absolutely must handle a snake during feeding time, I'll touch its nose with a snake hook first, real gently.  In my personal experience that pretty much sends the message that this is not what they were expecting, i.e., a feeding.  I WAS mistaken for food once when feeding a snake in a separate feeding cage (because I bought all the rule #4 hype when I started out 8 years ago), but that bite was because of an unrelated rookie error on my part.

| Never feed a snake with your bare hands.

Agreed.  Use forceps instead.  Otherwise the snake might miss the prey and get your hand instead.  See rookie mistake above.  Not fun.  Also, if you're going to go on to feed subsequent snakes, now your hand smells like prey.  Pythons and boas use heat and scent more than sight to target their prey, so once your hand smells like prey, it's prey.

| Never handle a snake after feeding without washing your hands first.

Agreed.  See above.  Even if you're using forceps, you tend to get that scent on you when preparing the prey item (whether you're stunning live prey or thawing frozen prey).  EDIT:  In general, you shouldn't handle a snake after it's eaten anyway.  This stresses the snake and may cause the snake to regurgitate its meal.  This is bad because it costs the snake a lot of energy to ""kill"" its prey (quotation marks because they typically go through the motions of striking to kill and constricting the prey even if it is pre-killed), and now they have nothing to show for that energy expenditure.

| Always wash your hands after handling your snake.

Agreed.  Germs.  Also never let your snake crawl around kitchen counters.  Not good for you or the snake."

They just took a zero tolerance type of stance on it instead of allowing a gaping hole for people to take advantage of.

I just want to know, they didn't cover it, how the cards were tampered with and managed to get other types of cards in to the packaging without showing they were tampered with.

Shaming creates a self hate at times that creates a desire to be better than others of similar height prejudice.This causes them to distance themselves from others due to things like different gender or same  nationality in order to fit in. Fighting heightism requires a maturity level that most will not acquire until sometime in their 30s.

To fight heightism one must think outside the box of your own emotions and insecurities to ever have a chance of succeeding. Heightism is not natural, it only flourishes as it does in 2014 because of lack action that was needed 10 years ago, but never happened because fools like me thought it was just a passing thing that would not expand to its extreme form as it has today.

If you get shot, go unconscious, and are given saline, all you do is get your blood back, the damage the shot did to your health is still there, and it won't regenerate until you are at full blood and appropriate energy/water levels.

That being said, I think the ideal fix would be to reduce the amount of blood saline restores, and leave the blood bags the same. You don't have to worry about blood typing if you have a buddy draw your own blood and give you the bag."

But its not. You're a white kid, saying BHM is ridiculous. You need something, to turn a *throwaway opinion* into a credible argument. Yes, being black gives you some authority, more than being white, on the subject of dismantling BHM.

&gt; Nothing in that addresses anything I specifically said.

Because that bit didn't address specifics, the specifics were addressed elsewhere in the reply and you haven't responded, and by claiming incorrectly the point of the quoted was to address specifics, is an erroneous dismissal. 

Your argument lacked thought, consideration, and its only under pressure and prompting that it has developed any substance.

The subject has always been fascinating to me, so while reading the article, Nisbett immediately came to mind, as he is a foremost scholar on Eastern vs Western cognition, specifically the culture-cognition connection.

I knew his work would indirectly be involved and sure enough when I checked on Joan Chiao, and sure enough a lot of her work was inspired. 

The research already done on this subject actually does validate a lot of East vs West stereotypes, but it's important to note that the causes are generally regarded to be cultural. This is something Nisbett himself, premiere expert on the subject, supports. While I won't link to every single study on the matter, here is a short passage an APA article which happens to quote Nisbett:

&gt; ""The frontier doesn't really exist anywhere anymore,"" Kitayama says, ""but its myth and discourse are still powerful.""

&gt; Another strand of evidence comes from Asian Americans, who often are raised with some blend of Asian and Western cultural traditions.

&gt; ""In studies that look at Asians, European Americans and Asian Americans, Asian Americans usually fall somewhere in between the other two,"" Nisbett says.

http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb06/connection.aspx

The study you linked to itself seems very similar to other cultural epigenetics studies on the matter, how culture affects genetic expression (as you mention), and also how that relates to epidemiology. HBD folk will favour a certain unidirectional causal relationship more than the other, of course, but that isn't really what the study was about."

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1389649614.0,"Really, you can pick a cause. 

I mostly help feed hungry people and people in food crisis where I live. Where I am, it involves poverty, race, class, and care for families. I don't have qualifications either to be able to work out the logistics of everything (really, people just go by experience where I am), I don't plan to make a career out of it (I don't get paid), so I'm mostly do whatever they need me to (serving food, cleaning, and other grunt work things). Somebody's gotta do it. 

When I was a teenager, I did more grunt work with advocating for inner-city schools, including mine. This work was tied with racism and classism since our area is very, very segregated, and if left unchecked, the black, Latino, and Asian population's kids would have been royally screwed over. For the inner-city schools, we were raising awareness, had marches, protests, and petitions for legislature or against legislature. We managed to expose the corruption of the school board years before they were officially investigated and found corrupt. If we didn't, it's unlikely they would have been checked out, due to the racism and classism.

Cheaptrix5150,AskMen,1389649730.0,"It took me and my wife a little over 5 years to have our first child. I had already accepted that fatherhood was not in my future. Then one day she sent me a picture of the pregnancy test. As soon as I realized what was going on, I started tearing up. The first time I held my son, I was crying more than he was. You see, he was perfect. Not one flaw (in my eyes.)  I'd never loved something so deeply in my life. Not my mom, wife, nobody.

The next several months were challenging but well worth it. I always felt inadequate though. Like I was scared that I wasn't doing something right. If I got frustrated with his behavior I felt guilty.

Then number 2 came along. I still cried the first time I held him. Another perfect human being. This time it was different, though. I didn't feel so overwhelmed. I knew how to handle my frustrations at this point. I was a lot more secure in my emotions..if that makes sense.

Finally, my princess came along. Again, cried like a baby the first time I held her. 

The best part of being a father, for me, is seeing them grow.  The first time I could hold a semi-coherent conversation with my son was amazing. Now I can have a conversation with all of them (4 year old spaces off pretty quickly but that's to be expected.) Whenever I get stressed about bills or my job, all I have to do is talk to them and they don't give two shits about any of that...they just want me. That's the most amazing feeling in the world.

It is a challenge every single day. It's stressful (different than money/job stress, though.) It's aggravating sometimes. Sometimes you may want to go scream into a pillow. All that melts away when I kiss them goodnight and they give me monster hugs.

If you consider supply as simply the ability to produce a viewing experience, then the supply is effectively infinite as compared to the demand. This should make the cost negligibly small. But it doesn't.

When I started middle school (7th grade in my area) my locker was next to this girl who was incredibly strange and awkward. Never talked much, and I tried several times to make small talk. She would hardly look at me in the eye. I would say ""hi"" every damn morning and get a grunt as a response. Her last name was almost identical to mine so she was next to my locker again in 8th grade. Same awkwardness, same odd looks.

High school starts and when my buddy and i go to the hs to get our locler he makes the comment ""Hey at least your locker won't be by the girl from The Ring anymore!""... We turn a corner and there she is, right next my fucking locker again. I found out the next year that lockers don't change from year to year. I had to endure 4 more years of scary girl. 

It gets pretty weird here. My first day of classes at college, I get on the bus and she's sitting in the first seat! I couldn't believe it, but I said hi anyways and got the same grunting response. Never saw her agin after that until...

oberon,AskReddit,1389649803.0,"I have never told this story in its complete form before now.

I went to a small private military school for my freshman and sophomore year.  (High school years, not college.)  There was a medium sized storage room between the pool and the gym with a lot of stuff stored in it, but mostly just a lot of cases of soda.  Well, *someone* figured out how to jimmy the lock with a student ID and get into the soda storage room.  He, being an idiot, told his friend... who told someone else... who told someone else... pretty soon the entire freshman and sophomore classes were stealing soda from that room.

Someone got caught, and they squealed.  After everyone was done naming names, about 200 (if memory serves) people out of a school of roughly 500 had been caught.  There was a huge conference with the kids and all their parents.  My god, the air was just THICK with shame during that meeting!

I forget what exactly we had to do except pay them back (collectively) for the soda, do some community service work, and our ""file"" had a ""notation"" in it (I still don't know what this means) but that's about it.  If it'd been less widespread it would've led to expulsion, but you can't expel half of your students.

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1389649850.0,"&gt;It seems to me being a male feminist is a bit like being a gay Republican.

&gt;The gay Republican analogy was basically that: it's technically possible to be a gay Republican, in that you can be gay and believe in the most basic doctrinal points of the Republican party (smaller government, lower taxes, focus on business, etc.), but the Republican party has at the same time become increasingly hostile to your identity, and thus you're expected to put aside your own identity in service of the larger movement. That seems to be how feminists treat men.

Feminism doesn't fight to restrict men's rights, so I'm not seeing how this is in any way an accurate comparison.

Feminism is not hostile to men identifying as men. They are, reasonably, hostile toward men who are prejudiced against women.

&gt;but my point was that in feminist spaces men are considered inferior to women

No.

&gt;and male feminists themselves seem to think that as well

No.

&gt;Look at this response from a male feminist when asked if male have any role in shaping feminism. He seems to think that men have a purely submissive role in the whole scheme, and must defer to female authority.

No link provided.

&gt;One odd thing I've noticed is that feminists often claim that ""patriarchy hurts men too,"" and that feminism therefore helps men, usually when arguing that something like the mens rights movement is unnecessary (which I'm not affiliated with, btw). But then, feminists get angry when men bring up male concerns as part of feminist issues.

It's not odd. Feminism is a worldview that focuses on gender equality by eliminating built-in cultural and social preferences for men and disadvantages for women. Correcting these issues is seen to have an overall positive effect on society that has a calming effect on many of the disadvantages men face as well. This is not to say that feminism, as a movement, is interested in tackling men's issues directly. There are movements centered around men's issues, who in parallel do not focus on women's issues directly.

&gt;Look at this, for example. This, combined with the quote from the male feminist I posted earlier, suggest that men's role in feminism is exclusively deferring to women in all matters of gender and merely trying to get other men to go along with feminism.

No link provided again.

&gt; I certainty get why feminism is needed and helpful for women, but for men it's not very dignified.

As if you're not allowed to fight for other peoples' rights? How selfish of you."

IndependentBoof,Redskins,1389649884.0,"I left out net yards for that reason. Even if ""garbage time"" boosted his stats a bit (and I'd bet this impact is over-exaggerated), constantly playing from behind probably also increased his interceptions since it's easier to jump routes when you know the opposition *has* to throw. Tannehill similarly had to play from behind quite a bit and RG3's stats were comparable.

*Edit - And same could be said for every other QB we've had in this 20+ year drought of lack of success... yet most still did not perform on par with RG3*

I don't have numbers for it, but I bet if you analyze QB stats for how all QB's perform when playing from behind and when playing with a lead, the only big difference is yards thrown. While defenses tend to play a little softer and allow for short passes when they have the lead, it is not terribly helpful for an offense to always have to play catch-up. Having to change the game plan and essentially give up the running game is not beneficial for QB's."

I say go Mossberg 590. Little better than the 500's.

Both shotgun's are great. They each have their perks. Go to a gun store and ask to hold each. Feel their weight and how it sits in your hands. Feel where your safeties and release are. If there is a place that rents guns, shoot both. 

The mossberg has everything close and even people with small hands can manipulate all of it. The 870 is a bit more spread out and to some can be awkward. Which is why I say, go pick them up and get a feel for them. 

Regardless of what you choose, either is great. Just remember... pick each of them up and hold them before you buy. Nothing is worse than buying a gun, then finding out you like the placement of the safety on another gun right after."

*Dear Judy Hedding 

It is with trust and believe that I write to you. I am Barrister Franklin Ali, a Solicitor at Law. I am the personal attorney to Mr. William Hedding a National of your Country, who used to work with Shell development Company here in Nigeria. 

On the 21st of April 2001, my client, his wife and their only daughter were involved in a car accident along sagamu express road Ondo State. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several inquiries to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. 

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in recovering the fund valued at US$15.4Million left behind by my client before it gets confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Security Finance Firm in where this huge amount were deposited. 

The said Security Finance Company has issued me a notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account confiscated within the next twenty-one official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek the consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the deceased since you bear his last names, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. 

Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer. I have all necessary information and legal documents needed to back you up for claim. All I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. 

I would be grateful if this mail will be favoured with an early reply via the above email address. 

Best regards,

procrastinagging,italy,1389650036.0,"Qualche esempio concreto si può trovare con un po' di google-fu, ma se ti accontenti di un aneddoto, a me è stato chiesto di rifare da zero il sito di un locale (cms per pubblicare eventi e serate etc), con restyling grafico, riprogettazione dell'architettura dei contenuti, predisposto per integrarsi in futuro con una sorta di social network dedicato. *In cambio*, potevo occuparmi di fare le pubblicazioni su questo sito per 100 euro al mese... fico vero? No, intanto mi paghi il lavoro che mi hai chiesto, poi se vuoi che ti gestisco anche il sito affrontiamo l'argomento.

La persona che mi ha fatto questa proposta è venuta da me proprio perchè *sa* di aver bisogno di un professionista, non del Cugino50euro. 

Ci sono un sacco di fattori che entrano in gioco quando si parla delle problematiche dei lavori creativi, e non sono tutte riducibili alla ratio domanda/offerta.

Altro esempio: disegno da che ho memoria, e non me la cavo male. Quando ero piccola, insicura e desiderosa di approvazione, non dicevo mai di no a chi mi chiedeva un disegno (ed era un'occorrenza quasi quotidiana), neanche quando non ne avevo voglia. 

Riflettendoci adesso, è come se, dal loro punto di vista, visto che avevo il ""talento"", la cosa non mi richiedesse alcun impegno, come se nemmeno il tempo necessario per fare il maledetto disegno avesse valore. 

Io sono convinta che questa dinamica scatti sottilmente anche a livello professionale. Ovvero, per il non-creativo, il non-artistico, la produzione creativa/artistica avviene in un limbo senza tempo in cui conta solo il ""talento"" e non l'impegno e lo studio per raffinarlo, le conoscenze pratiche degli strumenti per la realizzazione e il tempo effettivo di realizzazione. Come a dire, ti viene naturale e ti piace, quindi *ti sto praticamente facendo un favore* a chiederti di sgobbare, tanto tu lavori per la gloria perchè è così fico essere consierato un artista!

Concludo questo pippone con un terzo aneddoto che può voler dire tutto e niente, ma che è fico perchè include una categoria lavorativa che viene spesso portata ad esempio-contrasto. Il mio miglior cliente da freelance è stato proprio un idraulico, per il quale ho realizzato il logo della ditta. Non solo ha concordato senza problemi un prezzo *prima* di iniziare il lavoro (diverse volte già alla sola menzione di ""preventivo"" ho visto gente mettere le mani avanti), ma mi ha anche dato più del pattuito alla fine, tanto era contento del risultato. E ti assicuro, la sua scelta finale non la metterei in un portfolio (perchè il suo gusto non coincide esattamente col mio!), ma lo rispetto perchè il suo atteggiamento è stato quello che si riserva a ogni altra figura professionale: ho bisogno di te perchè io questa cosa non so farla, e in cambio ti pago. Per contro, se dovessi avere bisogno di lui in futuro, non gli andrei mai a dire ""eh, ma il mio amico Pippo questa cosa me la fa per un piatto di carbonara"". 

Uh dimenticavo: già il solo fatto che esista una talk come [""Fuck you, pay me""](http://youtu.be/jVkLVRt6c1U) è indice che il problema è decisamente diffuso."

it seems potentially productive to keep a holistic idea in mind when we speak about personalities instead of immediately pidgeon-holing ourselves.  i certainly think INTP's are less susceptible to the tendency to do this than other types, but cultural rhetoric has an enormous impact, even on well scrutinized thoughts.  besides, who among us hasn't seen a thread here with someone using introversion as a blanket excuse for all their problems?

in the current language, i am self-assuredly introverted over extroverted.  i tend to consider other people to be a chore more often than not.  i wonder, though, if we collectively could better communicate our personal experiences to others if we were able to better discuss the multi-dimensional spectrum of personality needs instead of adhering to strict dichotomies.  while i don't think one word like ""ambiversion"" is going to do this, it seems like a potentially great first step."

1. Has to be simple enough to be recognizably played by any instrument, kinda like Beethtoven's 5th. 

2. Can't have religious specifics (sorry Babu Yetu). 

3. It has to somehow capture the horror of the past and the hope for the future, how so many lived and suffered and died to give us the present and future we have available, with a kind of message of a sort of depth command or obligation to make the most of the future, and appreciate every moment to come. To achieve, to know compassion, to celebrate and to remember those who are gone. A song that sounds like time lapse of clouds. That sorta thing. 

All without coming across as camp or cheesy: 

Here's a few songs I think are kind of in the ballpark of where we'd be aiming, but honestly, I think we'd likely be better off with something new, but somehow not feeling like it was 'written by comittee' like ""We are the World'. Something people would be happy singing in bars or playing at funerals. 

Something truly sublime. 

And I think that song would be like a nebula, discovered somewhere in the following constellation of songs: 

-Circle of Life [Elton John](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSKkKrUzUk)  Spoilers! first 4 min of The Lion King. 

-[""El Morro"" trailer song by Corner Stone Cues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMNLrjFjA9o&amp;list=PL892F0A09DF73571E&amp;feature=share&amp;index=28)Is pretty inspirational, generic, and powerful.

-Some kind of adapteed version of [""Pompeii""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F90Cw4l-8NY) by Bastille wouldn't be the worst thing: 

-Ulrich Snauss &amp; Jonas Monk's [Chasing Rainbows](http://youtu.be/OLsi1vAuCkw) Has a nice hopefull feel to it, kinda in the ballpark methinks. 

-No list like this would be complete without U2's [""Where the Streets have no Names""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FsrPEUt2Dg)

The less work we have to do to read your content, the better. If you INSIST on posting a blog post, make it a self post, include the contents in the body text, and add a link to the blog at the end for a source. 

So what you're saying is if I ever run across a blog I think is informational and that gunnit would enjoy, I should make a self post, link to the blog, then fill it with reasons on why I feel the blog is a good read and start discussion that way. You know, instead of just submitting a link post to the blog and showing no reasoning behind why I am posting it here.

Give in and spend a little more of your free time talking, but know that your feelings will eventually calm down. You are not doomed to a life of unfulfillment. Plus, remember an SO should not be the only thing in your life fulfilling you; they should simply be there to support you while you fulfill your own ambitions and desires.

The reason to shove here is to show hand strength.  Someone in the SB or BB probably needs JJ+ to call.  I think if you shove you take down 16k more in chips.  Your stack is sitting at a nice 41k.

Also, I recommend only shoving/folding if your stack is less than 10BBs. Blinds and Antes will be enough for you to float until someone open shoves and you wake up with QQ+.  Patience, my friend."

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1389650390.0,"&gt;  Like if I was 30 and knew him for a few weeks it would magically be okay.

I think assuming this hurts your case; people don't think getting married young is a bad idea (in general) because the people don't know each other per say; they think it's a bad idea because the people don't know **themselves** or who they will be as they grow, mature, and change.

At 22 you're a very different person than you were at 16, and yet you're still together.  What people worry about (I assume we're talking about logical and kind people) is that while you grew and changed together - in the same direction of life - from 16 to 22, you may not change together from 22 to 30, and the years in your 20s are very very informative.  

I think a lot of people do their soul searching in their 20s and have a grasp of who they are by the time they're 30.  Then there's the people who dicked around and did nothing of personal value until they were in their 30s and thought ""damn, I guess I should start being an adult"" and don't start that introspective personal journey until after their 20s.  Then there are the mid-life crisis folks who NEVER took the time to examine themselves - who they are, who they want to be, and WHAT they want to be - and they've already been married for years, have kids, and realize it may be more trouble than it's worth to change, so instead of trying to be happy, they just settle for what they've already got.

I'll be 28 by the time I'm married, and have been with my FH for 8 years.  We've gone through a lot together and have grown a lot together, and I'm not saying my 8 years are better or more special than your 9 years, but I think we're **not** getting flak for getting married young **because** those 8 years have been during the generally-agreed upon formative-years of the mid-20s."

However, even as the number of women using the most lethal means increases, the suicide rate in women has slowly declined.
""So it really goes back to the same thing -- that women, when they intend to do it, can be just as effective as men in committing suicide. But they aren't so inclined,"" Murphy says.

I have simply learned to not voice my cynicism. It is better to just laugh internally when it comes to pass on those around you.

Best thing to do around others is this: Fake it. Fake it all the time around people.  I liken this to putting on a ""mask of sanity"" when around others. They don't want to hear what you really have to say anyway, and even if you are correct 100% of the time, they won't believe it and will tell you to cheer up and be optimistic. You are 100% right: people are self motivated. So just play on that. If they are talking about Football, just pick a team and say its your favorite and pretend like you know what you are talking about. Ask who their team is.

On the bright side, you can fit in very easily with most people by being a complete idiot. Just parrot back things you hear on Sportscenter or the news at them and they will yap away about it for hours while you say things like ""yep, I never thought about it like that"" or ""yeah I know, right?"". Really once you master ""small talk"" you will realize how pointless and stupid most day to day communication is. It makes it all the easier to bite the bullet and do it yourself.

TryUsingScience,pagan,1389650654.0,"1. ""Pagan"" and ""neo-pagan"" are umbrella terms that cover a lot of traditions. Wicca is one tradition. So are Greek and Celtic and Norse reconstructionism. So is Feri. By some interpretations, so are Afro-Diasporic traditions like Santeria. Some pagans belong to a tradition, and some are eclectic. Most eclectic pagans I've met incorporate a fair bit of Wicca into their rituals because it's simple and popular and fun. But a Wiccan ritual and, say, an Asatru (Norse recon) ritual will have almost nothing in common.

2. This really depends on the person/group. I'm a big fan of not basing rituals around deities I haven't worked with, but I have seen groups who go, ""We're doing a prosperity ritual! Oshun is in charge of that, right?"" and include her in the ritual without doing more than the basic research. 

Most individuals worship the deities they feel called to, whether that's simply because they identify with what the deity represents, or whether it's because they've had some dramatic experience with the deity. There are no set in stone limits, but there are practical limits to how many gods' demands you can keep up with. Most people have 1-4 gods they work with closely and regularly, and then an entire pantheon or more that they call on as needed based on their domains. I don't work with Poseidon much, but that's still who I'm going to ask for help if I'm about to go on a long sea voyage.

3. Depends on the tradition. Some, like Gardnerian Wicca, are incredibly hierarchal. In Asatru, you'll typically have a gythia/gothi who knows what they're doing and is more or less in charge, but that's about it for formal structure.

Basically, for any question, ask three pagans and get five answers. Each tradition is very different, and people in the same tradition will be different based on who they are and who their gods are. If you're trying to include a character that worships a specific god you're better off asking people about that god and how they're worshiped in different traditions. An Asatruar Odinsman is going to be very different from a Wiccan who happens to worship Odin is going to be very different from a Roman syncretist who worships Odin as Mercury. "

My advice would be, make the packing a game. I don't pack at school, but when I first got my packer I would be so excited I was showing my junk off all the time. My partner and I often do bdsm play, and once during a scene where I was dominating him I made him suck my cock. I did this for my enjoyment and he did it for my enjoyment, and I told him all these things about how to do it better. It was a huge gift to me, and I haven't needed it since.

When it comes to binding, just make sure your partner doesn't bind for more than a few hours at a time.

You can help by complementing your partner with traditionally masculine phrases when appropriate. Talking about how they make both a beautiful woman and a handsome man will help them to be more comfortable in the center.

As for pronouns I feel most comfortable when they are avoided. I prefer to be referred to as a partner and by name (gender neutral given name). Your partner might be more comfortable with non gendered pronouns...ask.

Edit: You're totally allowed to rant or complain, I've reread this paragraph and I disagree with what I said here in hindsight. But I do think it should be directly related and like I said later done in a way that invites conversation, and won't make people hate themselves for being short. Especially not make people see playful ribbing or joking between friends as genuine teasing. I joke with my friend who's short and he jokes with me about being bald. No hard feelings.

The prevelent negativity turns away people who would otherwise bring positive light or good discussion to the sub. This place is called /r/short not /r/shortproblems. If someone is hatemongering, either vote them down or start a discussion as to why they feel this way, if they're a troll they're a troll and vote them away.

Your opinions should not be stiffled, though. I know a lot of people here resent their stature and it's fine to talk about that, but I think there's much healthier ways of doing so than what's currently the normal. Something that wouldn't negatively affect readers who are also short. Your words have impact on others and they can and will hurt others if you let them."

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1389650972.0,"It was about $17k in improvements. House was a short sale, cosmetic and depreciation related issues in an area with a slow market.  Honestly, I have bought 3 residences for $20k or more below market value, so it's not that hard. House was in a nice neighborhood where average sale price is $180k-$200k. That money bought a kitchen remodel (didn't replace cabinets, stained them and added hardware for the custom kitchen look at 10% the price), paint and floor throughout, and resolved deferred maintenance.

You are right that it's easy to waste money on improvements, which underscores why you need to buy under market value: if you buy for $70/sqft where average sale price is $70/sqft an high is $75 you have no room to force appreciation. If you buy for $55, you can drop $15/sqft and at least break even if you aren't totally wasteful. 

Improvements can be very profitable when the house is well below the standard of the neighborhood. 

It is definitely some work to learn how to do that stuff, but given the ROI, in terms of $/hour most of us won't do any better. Seems like a worthwhile use of time to me. "

My best friend in high school grew up with a dad who thought she didn't belong to him. His wife was dying of cancer at the time, so it was never really spoken of, but because my friend didn't look like her siblings and weighed more than them he thought she wasn't his. He treated her like shit. He made her clean the house and raise her siblings. He was abusive as hell to her, and really fair to them. 

And finally, in her 20s she had a paternity test done and he is totally, 100% positively her dad. He's a lot kinder to her now, but she had previously pretty much told him to screw off and continues to.

*He is always late and we miss shows or events.  When this happens, we can't address that it is because he was late, but just what to do now.  

*He disappeared for days whenever he is upset.  Which left me upset.  With the no-blame game, the disappearing isn't the problem, but I should just figure out how not to be upset.  

*He repeatedly cancels on trips at the last minute.  But that isn't the problem with the no-blame game, the only problem is how I am going to get over it.

Ended up going on vacation and coming back to find out that my friend quit by posting an expletive laced note on the manager's bulletin board and another guy screamed in a manager's face after she demanded he run all the kitchen stations by himself because she didn't want to get on the line and help him.

We would eat desserts everytime we went into the fridge.  One guy would crack open bottles of juice or soda and leave them half-finished in the fridge.  We'd bat around fruit like a baseball using the industrial rolls of plastic wrap.  We hurled pre-cooked bags of rice and pasta at the dishwashers and at each other.  We hid meat products to let them rot so the managers would spend all their time trying to figure out where the horrible smell was coming from.  We did so much shit but they weren't in any position to fire us so we all got away with it until we all eventually snapped and left the job.

0x_,offmychest,1389651242.0,"&gt; The people who wanted to protect themselves or didn't trust the types of people carried out violence against them weren't radical; that would be the normal thoughts of a person during that time.

If i am not mistaken, you are talking about MLK's non-violent approach to peaceably assembling, and Malcolm X's approach to personal safety, i.e. if the police cant or wont protect you, arm yourself, but you're talking about them at the same time, like they were addressing the same thing, and were in opposition to each other.

Am i correct in believing Malcolm X implied nonviolence as a code of conduct in protest was the philosophy of the fool?

Did MLK speak out about not exercising blacks second amendment rights to own and bear arms? At all?

I need to know that i guess, before i let the two positions gets mixed up.

I will say, that peaceful protest is moderate direct action, and premeditated violent protest is radical direct action.

Exercising second amendment rights to arm yourself for personal defence, is not radical.

&gt; He wanted drastic change within the legal system and broke the law to draw attention to that cause.

And he took a moderate approach. Ban a protest? Make it illegal? Thats an unjust and unconstitutional law, and he engaged in moderate, civil disobedience. It is dangerous to acquiesce with this being called radical.

&gt; A moderate approach would be that of Thurgood Marshall

Correct, an evolutionary and moderate method/goal. But to say only this is moderate is to blur the lines between moderate and radical, perhaps you are trying to legitimize radical methods/goals? 

&gt; ""Radical"" isn't a moral judgement as sometimes status quo is immoral.

Do you mean like civil disobedience is OK if a law is unjust? In any case i dont see the word ""radical"" having any moral connotations at all, its mostly a synonym for revolutionary in my understanding.

&gt; However, although I'm in favor of multiculturalism over separatism, I think there are good arguments for alternative viewpoints.

Good arguments, like Malcolm X came across, because of his revolutionary ideas, show how radical thought can have its place. But i dont think the paradigm shifts, the big cultural changes in a society, are generally brought about through revolution, but evolution.

Good arguments for alternative viewpoints, whatever those might be, can help with that overton window effect i mentioned, so i do have some respect for radical thought."

I agree with that. He's more or less had to carry the team on his shoulders (with some help from Morris) so when he was a superhero it worked, but with any imperfection, the team collapses.

antoniocarriedo,AskReddit,1389651330.0,"Couple things. One happened long before I was there. This is a private, Catholic high school.

A long time ago, back when almost all of the teachers were priests or nuns, one priest and one nun suddenly disappeared one day. They were oddly close, so the assumption is they ran off together and eloped. No one ever saw or heard from either of them again.

More recently, just a couple years ago actually, An unknown substance was sent in the mail to the school. Main office opened the letter, and a bunch of white powder shot out of it. Instantly, the whole school went into lock down, the vents were all shut down, and there were six police cars in the front circle in under ten minutes. No one was allowed to leave the room they were in. After awhile, they let us out of classes, and no one ever said anything about it again. Someone asked, and was denied an answer.

evilbrent,AskReddit,1389651335.0,"Your objections to cloth nappies:

Uses chemicals in cleaning: not anymore.

Uses water in washing: not if you run your rain water tank into your washing machine. I don't know where you live but in Melbourne every new house gets a tank and most of the old ones have one. I personally have a huge tank. Certainly if you're radiating a child then you can factor the cost of the tank into the cost of the nappies and it's still thousands of dollars cheaper.

Electricity: well actually it turns out that it's not that much energy, but it is possible to put in solar, still for less than the cost of the disposable nappies.

So other than electricity, water, and chemicals, what else do you have to support this claim of yours that cloth nappies are worse than disposable? You understand that massive amounts of water are used in cloth nappy manufacture right? That they are driven around by diesel powered truck? That they're packaged? That the dump truck runs on diesel?

Kaisharga,DnD,1389651337.0,"It's not that they can ""prepare"" those powers. It's that that's how many they have access to until they level up, and they can't change the powers they have until they level up and either gain more or retrain.

So at first level, any character has two At-Will attack powers (three if human), one Encounter Power, and one Daily Power, *plus* any powers granted by class features or race features. They all have to be level 1 powers, because the character is level 1. If your paladin took, say, Bolstering Strike (L1 at-will), Holy Strike (L1 at-will), Radiant Smite (L1 encounter), and Brilliant Delirium (L1 daily), then that's what he can do. Any day, that paladin can use Brilliant Delirium once per day, and Radiant Smite as many times as there are encounters during that day but only once per encounter, and Holy Strike and Bolstering Strike as many times as he wants. 

The next day, if the paladin wants to use On Pain of Death (L1 daily) instead of Radiant Delirium, well, too effing bad. He knows Radiant Delirium, and can use that, and can't change it. None of these powers take time at breakfast to ""memorize.""

Here's the thing, though. Your wizard is under exactly the same restrictions. If a level one, the wizard wants to use Acid Arrow instead of Flaming Sphere that day (both L1 daily powers), that's just a shame, because it's not going to happen. (That is, unless they called Flaming Sphere as their second daily power under the Spellbook feature. At which point they can use Flaming Sphere, but then they can't use Acid Arrow later on in the day. I believe the only other class that can do this is Swordmages, with a feat.)

Now, when both of them reach level 2, each can change one power, skill, or feat--so if they wanted to trade out Radiant Delirium and Acid Arrow, respectively, for On Pain of Death and Flaming Sphere, that'd be fine. But then they lose access to Radiant Delirium and Acid Arrow until such a time as they pick 'em back up again.

At level 2, they also get a utility power. This is necessarily also an encounter or daily power (or very rarely, an at-will) with respect to timing, but it's still considered a Utility Power and not an Encounter Power or Daily Power by classification, and doesn't count against a character's limit on Encounters or Dailies. That is to say, a paladin doesn't have to stop being able to use Radiant Delirium in order to have access to their level 2 Martyr's Blessing utility power. 

Hopefully that clarifies things! Questions?"

No, man wrote the laws and then claimed Gods made them.  Mankind has always written the laws, so we're not replacing anything.  We're simply acknowledging reality.  God's laws (and all laws) have been ignored and modified constantly by mankind 'interpreting' them to fit their purposes.  This is also maintained by the 'culture' of what the majority will tolerate and accept given their reality.

If Kaep gets jumpy like he was at the beginning of the panthers game + at times in the SB, then the 9ers could be in trouble.

Was just curious how it worked within the EU. So it seems there is no ""EU law degree"" that is transferable from country to country.

At least the law background will help you form the corporate entities for the bar. And I dont think that is lacking ambition. Owning a bar is a lot of work. Owning any business is. "

JaybirdLT1,AskReddit,1389651834.0,"My first time went like this:

My 4th year of college I was living by myself. Mom and dad were visiting, we watched a movie at my place till almost midnight. After they left to go back to their hotel I went out to the bars to hang with some platonic girl friends of mine (ie I had no chance but they were still fun). I'm a tall/skinny lightweight nerd so I was too drunk to drive home after the 3am last call. I walked with the girls back to their cars. Somehow I got talked into driving one of the girls (who I hadn't met before) home in her car. As soon as I started the engine she ""forgot"" where she lived...so I ended up driving us to my place. When I came out of my bedroom with a blanket and pillow for her to sleep on the couch with she was topless and telling me how she'd seen me around campus a few times and wanted to fuck me. Yikes? This was a big big girl, arms the size of my legs big. But seeing as how I was drunk and a virgin, I went with it. I pounded and pounded and pounded that girl until almost sun-up and I could hardly walk. But I never ""finished"" if you know what I mean. I couldn't stop thinking about how much ridicule my friends were going to give me the next day. She finished, plenty of times in fact, so there's that. She drove me back to my car around 8am and I met my parents for breakfast at a local restaurant. Dad gave me a $100 bill to have fun with, little did he know... They left for the long drive home shortly after.

My new ""friend"" called me that night. I didn't give her my number, still not sure how she got it. Oh well, nobody knows what happened right? Let's give it another shot then. What's the worst that could happen??? I made her bring herself, beer, dinner, and she added a couple movies to the list. Half a movie and three beers later and we were back in the bedroom for a repeat performance. Same story, no finish for me. I sent her home first thing in the morning. She insisted on buying me breakfast. It was a buffet....I watched that woman devour probably three plates of food. I had two eggs and some bacon.

I never answered another call or text from her. Over the next TWO MONTHS she kept asking. Nope nope nope nope nope nope! It was the grossest, smelliest, most rolly polly sex I'd never had.  

TL;DR
Kind-of lost my v-card to a fat girl but got 3 free meals and $100 by the end of the weekend. Yay college!"

Been there, done that, and it's not worth it to go online and have a dozen mails in my mail account that i shouldn't log NA for such a cool geocache and that i'm just mean and an asshole and so on....

But on the other side i'm from a region where geocaching has seen alot of conflict with the authorites because of all kind of stuff - because lets face it, more often than enough it's either malicious injury of property or trespassing.

except that for the next 18 years you probably need to save up about $100-200k for their college education on top of what they cost...

not trying to be discouraging, but i think it's important to realize that tuition just keeps going up and up... When I went to UIUC, the ""expenses"" estimate was $6k/year for in-state residents. Now it's ~$12k/year and will likely be $25k/year or more in 18 years.  That's $100k for a 4 year education, and that's a CHEAP school with in-state tuition discount.  UIUC for someone from out of state is more like $24k/year **today**.

* the ""expenses"" estimate includes a bit for room and board etc, but isn't ""all inclusive"", either."
blue_eyes13,MakeupAddiction,1389651978.0,"Good news, there's this thing called color oops that they sell right near the hair dye. The box has a red label and three women on it I think. It worked for me when I used it and yes my hair was pretty dry afterwards, but just deep condition the fuck out of it for the next week or so and you'll be back to normal. Also if you want major super conditioning power slather your hair in coconut oil and leave it for as long as you can (a few lazy days around the house if you can)- this has saved my hair a few times. You can find it in grocery stores near the baking supplies/olive oil. 

If you don't feel like changing it- which from the picture I kind of like the little blue/green streak in the front- it brings out your beautiful green eyes! Seriously though, I'm jealous of your eye color. 

Edit: [Here's a link](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/color-oops-extra-strength-hair-color-remover/ID=prod2180463-product). you can get the color oops stuff at walgreens, walmart, cvs, target probably... It really does work too. I was trying to remove a good amount of henna from my hair (which is 100% permanent and never washes out or fades, and it did an ok job with that, plus removing whatever natural instincts shade I used on top of the henna. Try it if you want! Fair warning- it stinks like rotten eggs). "

wicksa,nursing,1389651995.0,"Just a normal resume template will do. keep it short and precise, anything over a page and they will stop reading. no need to go in depth into what you did in clinical, they know what you did because every nursing student does essentially the same thing. 

Do mention your preceptorship/capstone/externship experience (if you have one) under your professional experience , especially if it was within the hospital you are applying or on a similar specialty unit you are applying to. but dont put more than a sentence or two ie, ""University Hospital - Surgical ICU, Senior preceptorship, 180 hours. Responsible for the nursing care of complex surgical patients under the supervision of a Registered Nurse.""

If you have a preceptorship, try to make a very good impression with the staff, the managers, and especially your preceptor-- you can use them as a reference if they are willing!

If you have the time, try volunteering somewhere before you graduate, it could give you a small leg up on someone who has absolutely no medical experience. Sometimes getting into a volunteer program at a hospital is hard and time consuming. I volunteered with a hospice and a nursing home, and also worked as a nursing assistant at a nursing home, then the hospital. If you are close to graduating you may not have enough time, thats ok!

Also list any certifications you have (BLS, ACLS, PALS, phlebotomy, EKG monitoring etc.) You should at the very least have BLS since you are in NS... If it is about to run out, renew it!

That's all I have for now. Unfortunately, half the battle is networking. If you know someone, your resume will have a higher chance of getting looked at. 

edit: Make your resume shortly before you graduate and have one of your instructors look it over for you!"
AliceA,depression,1389651997.0,"Well first of all I don't agree that suicide is for cowards. I think it would be a very difficult decision to make as we have a built in desire to live that goes beyond our minds.

Having said that may I encourage you to get some therapy before you do anything? I don't think you are out of line to have hated your sister under those circumstances and I don't think you are wrong to hate yourself for having had those thoughts at the time. Are you aware that many times when a husband or wife dies the one left behind can get extremely angry at them for having died? this is all part of the human experience and sadly, or fortunately, we spend our lives trying to understand and/get over our childhoods and move beyond that.

I think you could explore all this in the safety of counseling and find out you are a far better person than you think you are.

Taxing consumption is a giveaway to wealth hoarders, as workers spend more of their income on consumption than not, and thus effectively pay a higher tax rate.  A graduated income tax places the tax burden on those who benefit most from the economic activity in the region, and thus have the greatest obligation to fund the state which makes that economic activity possible by maintaining both infrastructure and, more generally, the peace."

Also, abortion is not self harm. Pregnancy is a serious medical condition which on most women has life lasting effects, some very severe and some not. Not being pregnant is the best health move one can make.

They are really indispensable to most criminologists, and it's an extremely marketable skill.  I would also suggest any and all methods courses that are available. Then after you've nailed down those foundational skills, you can focus more on topics courses.  Doing things in that order allows you to be more critical in those fun topic courses and ultimately get more out of it.  Also if you have time get out into the field via internships or part time work.  Get a feel for what is actually going on in your field and what the current problems exist in the field.  This will help guide you into a research focus or give you an idea of whether or not you like the type of work you might do as a cop, parole officer, etc.

What stood out to my employer was the fact that I had worked for a police department for a number of years while I was working on my undergrad and graduate coursework.  They got many applicants who had worked various part time jobs, but none who had actually worked in the criminal justice field.

Well one day I was loading up lumber in the back of a pickup truck for a customer (I work in a lumberyard), and this guy who I didn't know from Adam's ox got out of his truck, walked up to me and said, ""Man, I can just see the hand of God on you.  I want to let you know that you're going to be okay.""

Maybe he saw the pain on my face.  Maybe it really was divine.  Who can say?  All I know is that this complete stranger set aside social norms and personal space to put words in my heart that I have mulled over for a long time since.

He crossed some major lines in S2. I cheered when Hannah had him arrested for being a major creeper and hoped we were done with the character. Then he came back and we saw him returning the dog with Ray and we saw him at an AA meeting and I started to kind of like him. He treated Natalia like garbage, but ended on a good note with the shirtless running to Hannah.

Now, I'm kind of in the middle, almost like a real person. He's flawed, but we have more perspective on him, so I can accept it. I've warmed to him a lot. I'm even kind of rooting for him and Hannah now, although this is Girls, so I can't see it going well for long."

Kaisharga,changemyview,1389652484.0,"The value of a good PvP game is not in its own assets, but in how well it enables players to interact in a deep and overall fair way.

League does this pretty effing well. Once you get past the hump of knowing what characters can do what, who goes where, what a team needs, and how characters develop over the course of a game, the real meat and potatoes of League is player psychology and the war between minds. There's a bit of this in the micro--if I look like I'm walking left, Caitlyn will shoot me with her skillshot, but I know it's coming so I can dodge right into a better position anyway--but there's also a lot of psychological interaction and tactical planning at a larger scale--if we keep our Fizz guarding top, he can hold the line while we keep their 5-man chasing us around the map and stave off teamfighting while their Baron buff ticks away, and our Kog'Maw can get in some pokes while we do it if we can keep him safe.

It's not that League itself is good. It's more appropriate to say it's good *at* giving players a place to compete.

DotA2 doesn't really work as well. Tactics matter less due to how easy it is to get in and out of spots on the map and how you can buy things from anywhere without inconvenience (and thus snowballing is very much a thing; the early winner is more often the overall winner), attacks can often come from more than a screen's length away and so your ability to react to changing situations is sapped, and possibly worst of all is the myriad crazy skill and item interactions that do some very strange and unexpected things that must be learned and are not accessible to a new player (this can make the game more 'fun' for a player inasmuch as exploring and figuring stuff out is cool, and victimizing people who don't know is gratifying, but it is anathema to the concept of fairness; if you've ever complained that a game is all about memorization and not skill then you know what I mean)."

I definitely understand your feelings.  I know it was a let down when he opened the door, but I think its the kind of Steven King ending we grew to expect.  And I want to think that somewhere there is a deeper meaning to it all.  That Roland is what is keeping the Tower alive, with all of his cycles. 

As for the significance of certain characters/objects.  To me that all just lends itself to the philosophy of Ka.  No one ca escape it. Flag and the CK did their best to escape it, but in the end, everyone has their purpose in the wheel.  Adding to that, of course Patrik was deus ex machina. The whole series was deus ex machina.  I'd like to think that is more of a plan by King, leading into the Ka philosophy. But I may be wrong.

As for your previous posts, I can see why people are turned off by the last three books.  They were rushed, and I  think it has to do with King's accident and him wanting to finish this series more than anything.  It becomes apparent in *the Wind through the keyhole*  (which takes places between 4 and 5).  It was well written, and a return to the older books.  King wasn't rushed and took his time and it shows.  But I'm willing to forgive a lot for the amazing journey we were given,"

quickonthedrawl,fantasyfootball,1389652761.0,"It's actually pretty simple! At least on the first or second level. :) Let's use Manning as an example.

First level analysis would be to average his 16 opponents' QB Fantasy Points Against and compare it to his average score per game. But that's flawed - his opponents FPA includes Manning's scores too! So you need to find his opponent's FPA and take out each game they played against Peyton Manning.

So let's say (fake numbers, since I can't look them up right now) Manning averaged 26 points per game. His opponents allowed 18 points per game to opposing QBs. However, if you take out the games they played against the Broncos, perhaps that number drops to 16 points per game (since Manning's prolific scoring makes his opponents look worse than they actually are!). You can then compare the Adjusted FPA with Manning's actual scoring average to figure out how good or bad he was, adjusted for his schedule.

You can go deeper though - now imagine you do the exact same exercise, but starting from the opposite direction!

Hope that makes sense. I posted a thread back around week ~5 that walked through doing this for D/STs, and the process is the same.

That's 4 hands in the deck.  Why would we possibly want to flat this? So one of the blinds or the raiser can hit a flop?

I don't know how many tournaments that you've gone deep in, but when the blinds are large and it is near bubble time there is a pattern that occurs.  People try to steal blinds with min-raises (or just above) because they know other players are afraid to bust before they're ITM.

I think with pot odds the original raiser folds without a monster.  Therefore showing the STRENGTH OF OUR HAND is a contributing factor to our opponent mucking and us taking down a sizable pot at this particular point in the tournament. "

p3ndulum,poker,1389652812.0,"Hand 1 - I like to 4-bet before the flop here. I know that my opponent knows that I could be opening a wide range of hands here, especially if I've tagged him as a competent player. 

If he's 3-betting from the blinds, he either had a hand that is much stronger than ours or much weaker - by just flatting his 3-bet, we give him the opportunity to play both ranges with the betting lead, which will undoubtably lead us into having to make extremely difficult decisions post-flop.

If we flop an Ace, we have to be worried about being out-kicked or completely crushed by a set, and if we flop a Ten, there are a bunch of over pairs for us to worry about - either way, we can't play our hand aggressively and with confidence, feeling pressure to fold much of the time.

And, because it's unsuited, we don't have any flush equity to add to the number of ways we can win the pot.

By 4-betting, we put our opponent where he has to either turn his best hands face-up, which reduces the number of difficult decisions we have to make, as well as minimizing the amount if damage we could possibly take during post-flop play by leaving us with a relatively easy fold without having to risk any additional chips. 

It also adds support to the story that says that we have a very strong hand ourself, which makes it increasingly more difficult for him to 5-bet with anything other than the top end of his range, forcing him to concede the pot or just flat with his speculative hands, forcing him to play a bloated pot out of position with a marginal hand. And kudos to him I he can find it within himself to 5-bet raise or shove with air.

If you're calling raises in position before the flop, I would suggest doig almost exclusively with drawing hands or premim Aces, at least. A hand like AT becomes a bit of a problem hand because of how regularly it'll be out-kicked by opponents who have raised with stronger Aces.

The 4-bet would at least give you an additional way to win the pot versus villain's calling range via fold equity in the event you miss the board.

Hand 2 - Personally, I think that this is a tough spot, and I'll typically lean towards giving my opponent the credit that they are representing in a tough spot - meaning, I'd like to think that I would fold to the $4.75.

The first reason being that the online poker world is absolutely in love with 46-suited. Second, because a set is super possible, and third - because that's a ridiculously huge raise - one indicative of a player who is trying to get there whole stack in.

Also, in terms of relative strength, your Kings fell from 2nd strongest pre-flop to 8th strongest on the flop. Personally, I don't like committing my whole stack without a top 3 or 4 strongest hand, looking to maintain more control over the pot while still tryin to extract value from the players and hands I think I'm good against (but while not holding the nuts).

So I don't mind the continuation bet even though I wouldn't mind a check behind.

It's the type of flop that players flatting out of the blinds would either completely whiff or completely smash, so I think I could check here and then make my c-bet in the turn if it gets checked to me again, while calling most reasonable bets as long as an Ace or another middle card didn't hit the turn - just in an effort to keep the pot small while holding such a vulnerable hand.

And always try to take inventory of your chips before committing your entire stack. If you will still have a ton of chips left in your stack after you fold, those become chips that you can use later in much more favourable and profitable situations.

It's said that a chip saved is a chip earned in poker, but I think that a chip saved is worth far more than that. If you lose a chip, you gotta win it back before you can parlay it into anymore, but if you save a chip, your immediately put in a position where you can turn it into another chip.

Oh, and if you think about the types of hands that would put in such a big raise and then call your massive shove, you're almost drawing dead against that range, seeing as you'll most often be up against a straight or a set.

So try to think of folding hands that aren't close to the nuts to massive action as ""easy"" in NL holdem. It's better to save your chips for stronger hands.

As far as your general question about 3-betting from the blinds go, my personal philosophy is to never raise with premium hands.

I don't want to make it obvious what I'm holding. So if I do raise, I'll be more likely to be raising with something closer to 58-suited than AA.

I only want people to *think* I have AA, for in them into a position where they would be making a huge mistake if they flop something like two pair or a set against me when I hit my straight, while still having a ton of fold equity on a lot of boards that *look* like they would help me.

Other than that, I'll just flat knowing that my premium hand is goin to hold up enough times to keep my head above water while I wait for my big pots to come. And by flatting with a hand like QQ+, it becomes almost impossible for my opponents to correctly range me post-flop, deceiving them into making much bigger post-flop mistakes.

One of my pre-flop golden rules is to always make the ""wrong"" play - or, the opposite of what most players would do - so that I can trap them later in the hand.

Ok, hope this helps."

Max_Insanity,Shadowrun,1389652876.0,"Thanks for elaborating.

Just to check, let's suppose I make a charge attack (ran up to the enemy on my previous turn, exceeding my walk rate), the one where you get the +4 (effective +2) bonus on melee attacks and -2 on everything (again, things might be called differently, I'll elaborate each a bit) and no other situational modifiers apply. I attack normally first, then with the spell.

Relevant stats etc.:

* Magic: 6
* Agility: 6
* Unarmed combat: 5 (+2 specialisation which I named magical 
combat, let's assume it only applies to the first hit, not the touch attack)
* Adept power Deathclaw(already activated): Ignores certain magical immunities, can be used for Astral combat, gives choice between dealing stun or physical damage with unarmed strikes.
* Spellcasting: 6 (+2 specialisation combat spells, +2 activated focus)
* Astral limit: 9
* Physical limit: 6

So, I suppose if I actually split the actions up, I would get further +2 on the second unarmed attack check made to see if I connect it (since it is a touch attack made to deliver the spell).

So, I get +2 for my first and second unarmed attack for making a charge, which gets me overall 6+6+5+5+2+2+2+2 dice for the unarmed attacks and 6+2+2-2 dice for the spellcasting.
Overall, these are 38 dice, which need to be divided by 3, so let's say 13-12-13 for initial attack, touch attack and the actual spell.

So I make the first attack, the enemy tries to evade. Let's say I have two net successes (my 13 against his Rea+Int), which I can carry over to the damage, which is (I chose stun) 7S. Due to my Limit, this gets capped at 6.

Then, I make the touch attack, let's say I get 1 net success, but this doesn't give me anything, right? Then I cast a level 12 punch. The armor piercing is 12, the damage 12+[net successes my 13 dice against his Rea+Int], which he resists with con and his (probably at this point non-existant) armor. I don't know wether the astral limit plays any role anywhere here. Then I resist a drain of 6.

Did I overlook anything?"

Dustl,civ,1389652966.0,"The main points of how the game went:

* I got NC up late and never got a fourth city because I focused on getting Petra in Tiwanuka.  It was worth it. I got NC up around turn 120.

* I wanted Desert Folklore very badly, but I found I had Byzantine right next to me and she was also on desert.  I thought that DoW'ing her might stop her from building shrines (since she doesn't have any starting building to get faith), and it worked. I picked up Desert Folklore around turn 45 I want to say. She never even got a religion because of her slow start.

* Greece spawned next to me and I spent most of the game checking my boarders to see when he wanted to attack and then bribed him or someone else to go to war.  He attacked my capital only once, around turn 85, and I was able to fend him off with 4 Composite Bowmen.

* For those playing on earlier difficulties, keep this in mind: When I was fighting Greece, he had a good 20 units. I was able to fend off him very well for 2 reasons: 1. My city had a great location for defense. With the hills, forest, and jungles, he couldn't move very well and was bottlenecked. 2. I went after his melee units **first**.  Without melee units, there was no way for him to take my city, even though he was left with 4 Archers. You can defend against a bigger army by positioning well and smartly taking out their units.

* I wanted my third city, Machu, in that desert hilly area, but I was torn between getting a third Observatory and not losing land from Byzantine as her capital grew. I decided to forward settle her so that I didn't have to buy any tiles to block her border growth. When I forward settled her, we had been at war, so I didn't get a diplo hit from her then. When we made peace, she DoF'd and never coveted my lands. I'm not sure why this is, but I'm assuming it's part of her AI.

* I picked up Education around turn 160 I believe, after I picked up workshops and the guilds. It was around this time that my population growth in Tiwanaku was faster than my cultural border growth. This allowed me to put in specialists into the guilds rather early without sacrificing pop growth/food. This helped a lot early game as I was able to get more Great Artists and Writers early on than usual and was able to keep up with other civ's tourism.

* I missed Ufizi to Songhai early on, which sucked. However, I didn't realize I could still get hermitage until I happened to build all of my Opera Houses.  I almost switched my victory condition because of this because I had 2 Great Artists that were hanging around that I couldn't put anywhere.  It was tough losing all of these early wonders because I would have great people sitting around sometimes.

* Songhai was beating me in tourism and culture for a while because he grabbed a good 15 wonders early on.  I'm not sure if he usually wonder whores so bad.

* Unfortunately, this caused some problems late game when I was trying to gain influence with him. His culture was HUGE, so it took so long to beat him.  I could've won 20 turns earlier if this wasn't the case.  Anyone have any ideas on how to combat this?

* The best thing I did was bulb into the Internet. For anyone on lower difficulties trying to get Cultural Victory, keep in mind that Great Scientists are **still** very important because you need the Internet. If you don't do that, you'll be stuck rather poorly waiting to get to the end of the tech tree.

A few things I think I could have done better:

* Researched Frigates earlier so I could explore the world earlier. I should have been the first to find everyone. If I had, I would have been world congress host because I hit Printing Press first

* Get to those cultural techs faster. I could have gotten them faster if I hadn't screwed around early on and been more focused. It made me lose some early wonders that would have slowed Songhai's cultural progression.

* Try a different ideology other than Order. It really didn't do much for me at all, and I wish I hadn't chosen it. At least it got me the achievement.

A few questions I have:

* For some reason, every civ took my spies over 25 turns to steal techs. Why is this? Usually it's more around 15 turns.  

* Does Songhai usually wonder whore so hard?  I've never seen him do anything but warmonger.

* What turn do higher difficulty players get their cultural victories?  What are some of your go to strategies?

If anyone has any questions or suggestions how I could have done better, feel free to comment. I love having conversation about how I can improve my game.  Turn 351 is a bit late, but I don't think it's horrible, especially with a wonder whoring Civ.

*1. Your expectations are too high, you're chasing perfection you'll never find and you're a bit scared to commit.

*2. You're with the wrong person, and it wouldn't matter what she does you're not gonna be happy in this relationship


you probably shouldn't rush marriage if you're engaged and if you're already married you need to reflect on yourself and maybe do some soul searching"

Ha. That's cute. The sexual education in some parts of the US is deplorable and it's mediocre at best to be honest. Also, the way your media censors anything sexual (not just talking about boobs in movies) doesn't really make is sexually liberal in my opinion. Sure, in comparison to a lot of third world countries, it's really liberal. In comparison to most developed nations, however, it's terrible.

Keep in mind that fiction isn't supposed to reflect reality.  The reason a bumbling father is enjoyable to watch is because it's inverting the common realistic trope of the competent father, which is amusing to kids.  

I guess I feel like art is art, and they know kids associate with these tropes because they inflate the important of the children, which is interesting to kids who often feel unimportant.  Kids like silliness, and it can be enjoyable to imagine a world where the kids are competent and adults are not, but most parents are wrong to think that kids don't realize the difference between the story and reality.

Is it 'fostering a culture' or is it fostering imagination by presenting something abnormal.  Honestly, they might look at these fathers and be glad of the dad they have."

ShamelesslyPlugged,Colts,1389653068.0,"I've found that guessing what they're going to do an need usually ends with me being wrong.  

Obviously we're set at QB. I wonder if we keep Hasselback another year, otherwise backup QB will be interesting.  

We basically had 4 starting running backs during the year, and you need 2-3. I would suspect that 2-3 come back. I don't know the the running backs are the problem as much as run support. Havilli was reliable most of the year, but fullbacks are very replaceable and he didn't show anything irreplaceable. Choice has been quite the journeyman RB, but I wasn't disappointed with him as a backup.  

We're all excited about our young wideouts. Brazill, Rogers, and Whalen all showed some sparks. TY is the real deal, and I'm optimistic about Wayne's return. I still think we need a genuine WR2/WR3 threat.  

Allen coming back is great for the TEs. Don't think much of Doyle/Saunders. We probably could use a skilled blocking TE.  

OLine. Center and guards could all be improved. Khaled Homles has been mindboggling this year, since it would seem like a good idea to have given him a chance against Satele. I'm hoping our earlier draft picks go here.  

DLine. Needs shoring up. Not sure who's on FA, but I suspect Grigson will make a FA move here.  

Linebackers. They were decent. Mathis and Freeman were standouts, I suspect we can hold onto them. Angerer is coming off contract, so we're probably not going to resign him (seems like our guys in that position end up getting snapped up by the Chargers or Bucs for some reason). I don't like Walden, and I hope we're not stuck with him - although he played well. McNary and Studebaker seemed very good at special teams, and rotated in - but I'm not sure if they're primed to get the job. Probably need a pickup or two here from FA or the draft.  

DBs. Bethea was excellent, and I hope he stays until he retires. Landry had some monsters hits, but missed some big tackles. It would be nice to see Toler truly healthy. Davis and Butler had good games and bad. Gordy might be okay. We probably need another safety and corner."

You don't think that sales values of franchises don't increase by $30-50 million if you know that purchasing a new franchise comes with a free #1 overall pick?  Top draft picks sell tickets on the short run and put you in the best position to win in the long run.  

The thing is, I could totally see the owners colluding on that deal.  The other owners might baulk at the idea of gifting the top pick to LA or Boston, but I could totally see them sacrificing a draft position to make franchise sales more enticing.  

The league decision makers aren't just David Stern and Adam Silver sitting in New York, the decision makers are the owners.

No, I said KEEPING it won't change anything.

&gt;Seriously, go back to /r/politics. Free market is not ""code"" for anything. It is simply pointing out that many of the issues we face today are because of Government manipulation of the system, and that removing that manipulation would allow things to work much smoother. If you are unable or unwilling to see that, then there is not much I can do to help you understand the situation we are in today.

Except if you remove all government regulations, you put us back in the late 19th century. It was called ""gilded"" age for a reason...that gold layer is only skin deep.

Here's the thing, you're clearly a libertarian, and that philosophy is a FLAWED one. it tries to sell you freedom and crap, but it really doesn't....well...unless you're an elite. I dont deny that government regulations sometimes favor the rich, but the solution isn't to get rid of them...especially one meant to help WORKERS.

&gt;So would you rather have two people working $5/hour jobs on top of their UBI, gaining work experience and working up the employment ladder, or one person at $10, with no incentive to improve himself to anything beyond that?

There's no reason to assume that wages would be linear.

Seeing how we have an 8% unemployment rate, if UBI caused 10-20% of people to leave the work force, then we could have low unemployment AND high wages.

I'm glad you're seeing the positives of your personality now, and I'm sorry there was a negative tack for awhile. You're absolutely right about my experience; my parents weren't perfect, but they recognized and valued my perspective from an early age, and that made me precocious. In nearly all matters they consulted me, and took my ideas and concerns seriously, which was equally a burden and a gift. 

It was a little awkward for me when I got into the real world, where people don't automatically put stock in my perceptiveness and foresight. I got reality-checked at age 16, so hard it felt like I was being persecuted for simply being present, though I understand the unusualness of my upbringing and attitude now. "

derleth,TumblrInAction,1389653218.0,"&gt; Neckbeards: Stop enjoying AAA console releases! They're not meant for you!

The idea that casual gaming is somehow killing the industry is also idiotic. Casual gaming is what saves the industry, time and again:

The Game Boy had Tetris, which is a pinnacle of the entire casual gaming experience. All casual games aspire to the condition of Tetris. And that meant the Game Boy sold in massive volume and could support games like my beloved Faceball 2000 (FPS with deathmatch! on the Game Boy!) which could never have supported the platform on their own.

The original NES had Super Mario Brothers, which isn't quite as casual but is pretty damned close to the casual end of the spectrum by today's standards. Again, the NES sold well and supported the Zelda franchise and so many others that, alone, could never have supported the console on their own.

Arcade games, now in deep decline, were founded on casual games. Pong? Two-person casual. Space Invaders? Pacman? Galaga? Casual as pinball, which is what they were designed to replace. And therefore the manufacturers can make games like Robotron 2084 and others that stretch the limits a bit and provide the harder-core gamers more to chew on.

It isn't just that nobody makes anyone play a casual game, although that does figure into it. It's that the casual games give the industry enough cash to even think about making the serious games. You can't have a AAA Master Race without people around the world buying Super Smash Bros."

It was a hyperbole to imply it should be strongly encouraged to explore each other sexually before you decide you're going to spend a life time together. As someone who's had to go through a rough period in my relationship, which was entirely due to sexual reasons, I can tell you, it's not something I'd like the have to deal with all my life, because the other person is not sexually compatible with me. Luckily for me, it was something physical that is resolved in the mean time, but go check our /r/deadbedrooms and see what it does to people mentally when them and their spouse are not sexually meeting each others' needs."

And that's okay. They're allowed to have an opinion. The problem comes in when they try to use those ""fears"" as justification for denying a portion of the population rights that those afraid currently enjoy.

I love both my parents and get along with them 95% of the time. My mother and 3 half-siblings are currently living with myself, dad, full-brother, and brother's gf, and this is the longest I've lived with that side of my family.

I love my parents and siblings, but it's really easy for me to notice personality flaws with them. Both of my parents are stuck in the 80's for the most part. Especially my dad. They both become very reminiscent when drunk, especially my dad.

My dad is a borderline narcissist parent (shout out to /r/raisedbynarcissists which i'm not actually subscribed to) and his ego has recently conflicted with the fact that I'm an adult and can do what I want and most of the time I don't give a flying fuck for his opinion unless I ask for it.

I can't say much about my mom since I never grew up with her. She was never absent from my life, but she was never around to actually watch me grow up.

Both parents have had their fair share of a crazy life style, and those choices have made themselves apparent. My mother is a little ""off"", which I attribute to her hard drug use when she was younger. Luckily she kept clean while she was pregnant with each of her 5 kids. "

We've had some of the greats in baseball (Cy Young, Babe Ruth, Carl Yaztremski, Jim Rice, Curt Schilling), hockey (Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito, Gerry Cheevers, Ray Borque), football (Drew Bledsoe, Teddy Bruschi), and basketball (Larry Bird). There was a lull through the late 80s and into the early 2000s, but sports are still an integral part of Boston life.

I imagine if I were to go watch a cricket match I would have the same response you would have to baseball. I'm not really a baseball man either, but, like I said, Boston sports family = watching the Sox all season long.

You'll definitely notice a winter time and a summer time. I like to say there are 4 special ""New England seasons"": Almost Winter, Winter, Still Kind of Winter, and Building Season. Maybe someone else from Boston will understand what I mean. It gets cold quick, usually fall weather ends in early November and the winter lasts till late March or early April. Then in June summer hits and it's just sticky, humid heat. It rarely breaks 100°F alone but the humidity is the biggest thing that makes it feel worse than it is."

It pays high salaries to research scientists who spend much of it, and invest a good amount of the rest. They're not obscenely high income, so its not usually hoarded and not put to use. 

It seems there has been a political compromise for now, but who knows if it will last.

I agree with him. 

It cracks me up when I see guys who think 'their girl is different' when the odds are, she isn't. 

I've literally laughed in a friend's face who thought that the girls he was fucking bareback from nightclubs; ""They didn't seem like they normally do that kind of thing, I just think they really liked me"". He met his fiance in a nightclub and I think it was based on a 1 night stand (If memory serves me right).

lingual_panda,sex,1389653661.0,"I'm in Tokyo. There were a few things that made me stop having sex, actually. The biggest was that I kept encountering scented toilet paper, which triggered eight months of chronic yeast infections. I've finally started masturbating regularly again, but I haven't had sex since September and I haven't had good sex since before coming to Japan. 

Another thing is that I'm taller and thicker than most Japanese people. I'm not overweight by American standards, but I'm a giant in Japan. It's very very hard to feel feminine and sexy in Tokyo. Which is strange because when I first got there I was about to pounce on every cute guy on the train. 

I had some bad experiences with a few men about a month after arriving, and coupled with the infections it just made me stop wanting sex. Threw myself into work, tried dating again over summer, threw myself back into work, and now I don't even want sex when it's offered to me. 

My resolution is to get my mojo back, but that's not going to happen in Japan. I'm planning to move back sometime this spring."

The_British_One,AskMen,1389653711.0,"Met a girl online. She was literally my perfect girl. A year or so prior, as part of trying to find my way in life, I just wrote a list on a notepad the features of my perfect girl. Just wishful thinking more than anything else. But she ticked every single box. She was beautiful, smart, funny, everything I looked for and I genuinely admired her. 

We talked and talked and eventually decided we should meet. I spent £140 (~$200) on a nice hotel room and train tickets to go see her. Considering I was a student with only a Saturday job at the time, earning £250 a month...it took a lot for me to spend that.

But we met up. And we fucked (she took my virginity too) and it was amazing. She mentioned she wanted me to do ""that thing with your mouth"" again when she came down to see me. So she was down to see me soon? Sweet.

We went out for the day at a theme park and I started feeling nauseous after going on one of the rides. I wasn't even supposed to be going on them because of a medical condition but I did it to be with her. She starts pressuring me to keep going on rides even though I'm by this point genuinely feeling really ill. I run to the bathrooms and throw up and she insults me for being a pussy and not handling rides. 

That's where she started losing me. With a precarious self confidence at the time, I couldn't take a girl I was sure I was in love with insulting me, it really upset me and it shattered my illusion of her completely. And it didn't get much better. She started going on about how she couldn't tell her friends about how we met because she'd be embarrassed, like it mattered...? And even though I had lots of (like a whole pack of each) mints and gum and water and it had been a few hours since I was sick (and I wasn't massively sick at all), she didn't kiss me goodbye and she didn't reply to my texts that night. 

I gave up after a few nights of trying to text her and resigned myself to the fact she wasn't interested any more. She was pretty shallow if you ask me but hey, I should've known better really. 

We ended up losing contact apart from the odd courteous ""how are you?"" Then one day out of the blue she texts me saying she's coming down to where I live and if I wanted to see her. I was incredibly tempted to, because as I said, she was, heck probably still is, my ""perfect girl"". But I know she's not perfect. I know she'd only break my heart again. So I noped the fuck out and saved myself the heart ache. "

&gt; What would you do in my situation?

You answered your own question:

&gt; What matters to me is a loyal woman that shares my culture and cares about me.

You want a loyal woman who shares your culture.  So that means you want an Indian girl who isn't a liar.  So meet an Indian girl offline and your chances of finding a cool one will probably increase significantly.  You can find women of other races that will respect your culture, but they likely won't adopt it.  

&gt; How do I get girls to be honest to me about their past and not think I am some chump they can lie to.

Avoid online.  Meet people through friends so you can get the real story from your friends.  Call them on their obvious lies and if they continue to lie.  Walk out and don't look back.

&gt; Is it better off me just going to India to find a true virginal gal? 

A virgin is that important to you?  An Indian girl in India is just as likely to lie so she can come back to America with you.  In fact she's probably more likely to lie than an Indian girl already living in America.

2) Unreliable if you have bad aim. That's along the same lines as claiming Zyra E or Leona E is unreliable. It's all about personal skill. Q is fairly low mana cost, charging it on minions or using it to harass is no big.

3) AP scaling doesn't matter much, especially with supports. The ability  to bomb people at 6 and have low-CD stuns makes her viable throughout the entire game, regardless of if she has gone AP (DFG) or support build. Either way, with increased gold gain of S3, gold isn't really a problem.

4) Abilities are actually rather large range. 600 - 625 is larger than almost everyone's autoattack ranges. You CANNOT autoattack trade without getting something thrown back at you.

5) Fifth point flawed based on assumption in fourth. Flash-Tibbers is the standard initiation combo. Extremely difficult to predict without proper vision. Even with proper vision, the window of opportunity to dodge the stun is very small."

bored_criminologist,AskSocialScience,1389654051.0,"Well, that's a big question. Online marketplaces definitely are part of the future of drug trafficking.  Marketplaces like SR and others have shown dealers that they can run a lean, mean operation with relatively few people, while maintaining or even increasing profits. This is possible for a couple of reasons. One is a larger customer base.  The other is the potential to cut out middlemen if you are near the origin of the supply. This only works if the trafficker is willing to wait longer to generate the profits.  

Access to the marketplaces has definitely been a game changer for users.  To quote one of my research subjects, ""Man it's like the world is my oyster now.  Drugs I could only dream of trying are available to me any time I want. And I don't have to go to the fucking ghetto, I don't have to worry about getting robbed. That shit comes to my door!  It don't get no better than that.""  This highlights his feelings on the matter and I'm inclined to agree.  The other thing the access provided by a marketplace has done is create an opportunity for low level dealing.  Individuals who know there's a market for a substance in their area that is not being filled can order drugs online and charge a ridiculous markup because they are the only game in town.  Another subject of mine put it this way, ""All these festival kids love Molly, but no ones reliable. Nobody has a steady connect and those that do get shit each and every time.  I come along with that fire and just give them a taste.  Then I charge like $120 a G[ram] even though I pay $40 from Canada. It's too easy.""  This becomes even more true for more novel substances.

Law enforcement will have their hands full for the foreseeable future. Ultimately busts and seizures aren't going to do much to deter this behavior. There is no way to search everyones mail, and it wouldn't be legal to do so even if they could. Seizing websites is a temporary fix. In the wake of the original SR seizure I can think of about 7 or 8 replacement websites that are currently up and running.  There are also individuals who doing direct business outside of sites with their favorite dealers.  Ultimately the question really becomes do we want to completely stop this behavior.  If it can remove dealers from streets and reduce the violence associated with dealing perhaps it's time to shift focus from enforcement to harm reduction and health."

Mary was the sister of a drug dealer that all my friends and I hooked up through, and one by one she had slept with all the guys in my circle of friends.  Then I guess it was my turn.

She made her move by jumping in my lap and squirming around, grinding on my crotch, all classic moves that totally worked for her.  Then she decided it would be playful and sexy to bite me.  Which actually could be kind of sexy, except she **really fucking bit me**.

I was wearing a fairly heavy denin jacket at the time, and she bit right into my bicep.  Hard enough to break the skin and draw blood.  *THROUGH DENIM.*  I jumped to my feet and yelped, grabbing my arm and unceremoniously dumping her onto the ground.

Figure out what you're interested in.  Do you like any sports, working out, even playing video games.  Do those things and meet people who share your interests.  Right now you're just meeting people and hoping you have shared interests.  Also look at the list of clubs.  Most colleges have 100s of clubs and some might appeal to you.

If you do that and realize you really have NO interests.  Then I suggest you start going to the gym regularly and maybe consider talking to a therapist/counselor to work through what is likely depression. "

"
Klaue,books,1389654225.0,"&gt; hey, let me add some noise here that you probably won't read.

not reading the replies would be kinda ironic in a subreddit about reading.  

My main bone with MB is that it feels like you get a tiny piece of story and then page after page of (what I'd call) filler. Also, Queequeg was built up in the beginning of the book like he was the most important character since jesus and a love interest to ishmael (the homoerotic tension was so much, you can't tell me melville just wanted to show friendship between the two), only to be nearly never mentioned again later on. He had maybe one tiny appearance every 10 chapters.  

An abridged version with about a tenth of the size would actually be a nice book if you ask me. I would pretty much toss out every single chapter from the boarding to the white wale that had not ""meets other ship"" or ""catches x whale"" in the title. There's really no need for a whole chapter about how the spout may be water or steam, for example. But I'm not even sure if I'd call such a book great or just ""nice"". Just as an example, the fight with the first whale they catched got about 4 times as much ""screen time"" as the fight with moby for which the whole book served as a build up.  

&gt;as for Dan Brown... eh. his prose is forgettable. his plots are implausible. i appreciate that his craft is accessible and commercially successful. but to me it's like a ton of candy. it's like a Michael Bay movie.  

I'm not even contesting that. DB is the equivalent of an action movie blockbuster. I don't try to say that he's great or super intelligent or anything, just that his books are pleasant if forgettable reads and the plots, while implausible, are interesting enough. What bugs me is articles like the top post here, they don't say ""he's mediocre"", which I could agree with (but then, why write an article to begin with), but that he's shit. The ""dumbest thing ever"", as this article put it.  
And I've seen that time and time again, DB books treated like they where the fistula on the ass of the written world."

Humans didn't try to trick them and they were being earnest but the wrong people took control of the Dredge and didn't allow for any alliance.

Summary: 

Tier 1 stats are higher at level 60 than at level 70. MF is practically missing at 70, so you don't want to reroll these tier 1 stats.  Tier 2 stats are stats you want to keep in ROS, will not be rerolling these, so you want as close to max as possible.  Tier 3 stats on level 60 items will not scale well into ROS, so you want to reroll these ""lower tier"" stats.

* Tier 1 stats: magic find, pickup radius, attack speed

* Tier 2 stats: all resist, life%, sockets, crit chance, crit damage

* Tier 3 stats: main stat, vitality, armor, regen, LOH

Legendary items to keep:

Sun Keeper

1) Crit damage 2) Weapon damage% 3) MF 4) Elite % 5) Main stat

Ice Climber

1) MF 2) Tier 3 stats

Witching Hour

1) MF 2) T2 stats 3) T3 stats

Depth Diggers

1) MF 2) T2 stats 3) T3 stats

Mempo

1) T1 stats 2) T2 stats

After progressing to higher torments, you need the newer legendaries to progress, and level 60 legendaries become phased out, but good rolls will last up to torment 4.  For example, max crit Mempo and good trifecta Immortal King gloves will last a long time.  Also a well-rolled Compass Rose and Traveler's Pledge set can be viable to use.

---

My personal thoughts on this video:

I disagree about the value of level 60 Ice Climbers, as the level 70 version makes you immune to several crowd control effects and is much superior.  If you have money to invest in MF gear, get some, but in my opinion MF gear will lose most of their usefulness at higher torment levels due to their reduced effect on legendary drops.  Sun Keepers are also not good at 70 for some classes, for example wizards much prefer level 60 Chantodo's Will for rerolling, because the arcane power on crit stat will no longer be rolling on weapons in RoS.  And Crusaders will be mostly using 2-handers with a shield.

The stat that will continue to retain usefulness into higher torment levels is pickup radius, but there are limited slots for it, and 7 pickup radius on one item is enough with a few 1-2 rolls on other items.  I would opt for this on the Witching Hour personally, and prioritize it very highly along with a 9% attack speed and 48-50% crit damage roll, and one more useful defensive stat such as all resist or life%.

Finally, I personally would not spend a lot on old level 60 items, because the beta could still change.  Also, rerolling old level 60 legendaries costs the level 70 legendary crafting material, so there is a barrier.  It may be better to keep a few decent level 60 rares, as rerolling those is cheaper and does not require the new legendary crafting material.  They will be replaced sooner or later by legendary drops, but in the meantime they will serve a fresh 70 well."

Lecks,AskMen,1389654284.0,"This turned out kinda long.

Went on a blind date a friend of mine arranged. This girl was tattooed, pierced, had dyed bright blue hair and had squeezed herself into a tight, leather dress. When I saw her I was ready to nope the fuck out and ask my friend what she was thinking because this girl was clearly not my type.

I decided to stay because she was still hot and maybe I'd be surprised, I was also bored. Anyway, the first few hours went by very well, we talked about stupid shit, laughed, drank, danced (stepped on her toes, almost tripped, the usual) and I invited her over to my place.

When we got to my door she pushed me against it, nibbled my ear and whispered ""open this door now or I'll kick it down"" so I opened the door. When I turned to face her she had the dress pulled down to her waist, things were going quite well.

So we had sex, it was great, bit freaky but no big deal. Got up the next morning, started making breakfast and then I heard the door close, checked the bedroom and she was gone. Weird, called my friend to ask if that was normal behaviour for this girl and she said it wasn't so I texted the girl asking what was up but didn't get a response.

Fastforward a week and my friend calls me up, starts cursing me out, I ask what I supposedly did and she tells me this girl's been going around telling people I beat her. I laugh, ask my friend ""Really? You think I beat someone. Me. Beat someone up. A chick covered in piercings and tattoos, no less. Me?"" -silence- then she said ""yeah, that doesn't sound like you, actually"". Couple other friends broke off contact with me over this, but I didn't lose sleep over it. And I obviously never saw that girl again, my friend also broke contact with the girl when she refused to explain why she said those things.

TL;DR: blind date went well, ended up being accused of beating up my date, lost some friends over it, dodged a bullet."

I first began getting in contact with drug users in person through an associate who was into that life.  He introduced to me to a dealer and I had to pay him for his time.  As time wore on I was able to make more contacts through those types of introductions.  Then after I had exhausted those contacts I began learning how to meet this people in the real world.  This involved many late nights in less than safe neighborhood bars and parties. I have been at more than one club during altercations.  In fact not too long ago I was at a club trying to meet a new contact when a fight broke out outside the establishment.  Unfortunately, an innocent bystander was shot as a result of the altercation.  That scared me pretty good, but overall I love my work so I keep doing it.

In order to work my online contacts I generally just ask.  A lot of these online vendors and users are eager to tell their story.  They see online marketplaces as a good thing that will increase safety so they want to advocate for them."

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1389654507.0,"I get what you're saying.  The numbers worked out a lot better for me (I have a few rehabs under my belt at this point, and am pretty good at 'bang for the buck') this way, and I generally try to tie up as little capital as possible in a deal e.g. if you crunch the rate of return numbers on $45k in yielding $35k in equity ($18k after cost of sale), vs. $22k in yielding $35k equity (still $18k after cost of sale), you get:

18k/45k = ~40% ROI

18k/22k = ~80% ROI

The latter is definitely sexier.  Real estate is kinda funny that way... the amount of cash you have to put into the deal is one of the biggest factors in your final numbers (hence the 'create value' vs. 'buy value').

$9k would really have only covered the deferred maintenance... a lot of the upgrades were cheaper because I was having to replace stuff anyway (i.e. if I just did deferred maintenance, it would have cost me a hell of a lot more overall to do the upgrades later).  Demo + replace with builder grade is not that much cheaper than demo + replace with nicer stuff (that was one of the things we were looking for... a house in really rough shape so we could redo it the way we wanted without spending a mint).  And it makes the wife happy to be in a place with a custom kitchen etc, and you can't put a price on that!

I understand where you're coming from, and I used to think the same way.  Eventually, I came realize that it's all cash-in/cash-out/ROI.  If you put 20% down and have to sell for what you've paid, you lose just as much money as if you put 0% down and have to sell for 20% less than what you've paid.  You've just also had to suffer not having that down-payment earn you a return in the meantime, assuming you are a person with enough financial discipline to invest the money rather than spending it.  

You don't take on any additional risk by putting 0% down (you take on some additional financing costs, but 4.5% of tax deductible interest is pretty tame).  That 20% you might lose is 20% regardless of whether you put 0% down or 100% down, if that makes sense.  The risk is not having enough capital to COVER that loss, which is more a matter of financial discipline than one of risk/reward.

With that said, paying down a mortgage isn't always a  bad thing.  As I said, we plan to pay off our secondary in ~6 months, and the whole thing in ~2 years.  We'll use the equity in the place for a HELOC, and use that as funding to do cash purchases of property, and pay off the HELOC debt with a cash-out refi after rehab/lease is complete.  

Nothing makes me sadder than seeing someone with a $200k net worth sitting on all $200k of their capital in a property earning them absolutely nothing.   That same $200k earning them 7% for 10 years turns into a whole other $200k.

Just my 2c."

VooDooBarBarian,technology,1389654608.0,"Not necessarily. When Kurzweil coined the term that's what he was envisioning, but really the singularity is a place holder for the coming time when computers are able to match our cognitive abilities. The Borg reached a singularity and gave up their individuality to become part of the larger whole. SkyNet reached a singularity and decided (for one reason or another, depends on who you ask) our time was over. In Shadowrun we reached a singularity and... well, really not a whole helluva lot changed. Though it may have been overshadowed by the return of magic... hard to say for sure.

Until it actually happens though, it's all just speculation and sci-fi.

2 - I'm going to take the probably unpopular opinion that we should avoid getting too deep into the medals thing. The circumstances of /u/das_mime's award were just too amazingly special to deserve crowding. I agree that we want to see more meaty work, but I think it's worth keeping in mind that a lot of it isn't arising out of lack of effort but rather that's what's out there. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit that Just Doesn't Stop Growing.

I think that you might get further out of this by doing more tagging of posts, like which hell its in for the mundane stuff that we come across, as opposed to the more unique ones that show up, allowing people to sort the whole thing better. 

3 - Likewise, I think I'd suggest more a lax treatment of meta posts about bad history than trying to come up with a specific topic for it. We already have some good discussions that get a bit lost in the general conversation threads, and I recall that we've had good discussions when someone has asked a more general badhistory question. Not that special day is worse, I'm just not sure which version is better.

It also depends on how the relationship ends.  If it's just because you aren't compatible romantically, then it could be easy to go back to friends.  But if it all blows up, then maybe you weren't so compatible as friends either, and you won't mind so much.

It got everywhere, beneath clothes and boots, skin and soul. It sank beneath fingernails, and his face was a think mask of dust from which two eyes stared, unnaturally bright. Grains of it ground against his bare forearms, little diamond pinpricks of pain at the back of the mind, or like shafts of sudden light, almost out of perception, but always there.

 You got used to it. 

Fingers trembling slightly, he swept the lens, as one might wipe away a tear.

“400 meters.”

Is earpiece crackled painfully, sending another sparkle of pain across the back of his mind. Shaking his head gently to dispel it, he replied.

“400, confirmed.”

He hooked back the bolt.

The valley spread itself before him, broad, gently narrowing as it approached the far rim of snow-capped mountains. Huddled in this natural bowl, the haphazard cluster of buildings, single storey shacks mostly, seemed perilously exposed, bereft of natural cover besides a screen of straggly trees on the war side. It all had a windswept, unreal feel to it, just a model town. 

It wasn’t as if it were real. 

He let the cold gun slip to his shoulder, felt his warmth flow from him, sensed his breathing slow, unbidden, to a long, controlled draw.
A broken-down car, a crumbling wall. The scene swirled sickeningly as he panned to one side. Image after image flickered past. Just a specimen under a microscope. Nothing more.

Nothing more. 

Movement caught his stare, and focus, focus…on the faces. Two faces, no, he cursed in mental correction, hostiles, standing in a side street, uniforms ragged, dirty and discoloured from days beneath an open sky. One figure offered the other a cigarette, to have it waved off, smilingly.
He trapped the man’s grin in the bars of his crosshairs.

Focus, let the rhythm your breathing take over, let the rise and fall of the scope become you world. Each sense, each muscle was twisted around the moment. The tiniest sounds seemed amplified, the ring of crickets a rising crescendo like breaking waves, the subtle ticking of his watch a second metallic heart in counterpoint to his own, beating away the seconds.

He blinked, letting a tear of sweat streak down his face.

Up and down.

Up and down.

Tendons like taught wires stretched tight his throat, his finger coiled about the trigger.

And held.

The face was still smiling. Funny, from here, from the heavens, untouchable, detached. Why does he smile? What would anyone have to laugh about, here? The man’s…the hostile’s companion clapped him on the shoulder.

The sniper followed the sway, unthinking.

Hold…and...

They sighed out together with the release of it, the tension flowing shatteringly from him. 
The spent casing clattered, nerve-tearingly loud, bouncing once, twice, and settled, lifeless. 

The man watched it, waiting for it to move again, watched the bloody haze it held in the reflected brilliance of the setting sun. 
The sound of it falling had been louder than any gunshot. He sat, heaving, for some minutes, feeling the warmth return, feeling the cold call of the wind.

There was grit in his uniform.

 He could feel the bloody rawness where it was worn a wound in his shoulders, taste its tang in his parched mouth, feel its prickle at the back of his mind.

You got used to it.

JDRPG,WritingPrompts,1389654764.0,"""Will those be the only books you're checking out today?"" The librarian asked smoothly. With her hair up in a bun, sharp, horn-rimmed glasses, and business dress that showed all the right curves in all the right places, the poor teenage boy could barely stammer a yes.

""Good, and make sure to return them on time, or you'll be..."" the librarian paused. ""In trouble."" With those menacing words, the teenage boy stopped looking at the librarian's boobs and dashed straight out of the library. Watching him go, the librarian turned to her paperwork. She grabbed a pen, the top piece of paper on the stack, and-

""ARIAN!"" The shout startled the librarian, and she made a large mark on the paper. With a short sigh, she tossed it and headed towards the shout, with frustration marked on her face. *What did the chief want now?* She asked herself as she trudged towards the large office. Entering the door, she gave a quick look around, but the same things were still there as usual; the chief's monitor, probably blinking with all sorts of important notes. Two chairs, one taken by the chief and the other empty. The chief's plaque, which read **Chief Avida Reeder**. And finally the chief, with her death glare and the wrinkles on her face.

In her 40's, the chief's black skin started to show signs of aging, along with a permanent crease to show her unhappiness with her employees. She had gained weight from sitting behind a desk instead of getting late fees from delinquents, but she still had a spring in her step. The chief, feigning politeness, motioned to the seat and said ""Libbie, please sit down.""

Libbie sat down, wondering what the chief would yell at her for now. She didn't have to wait long.

""Why did I receive a report from the hospital today that said 5 young adults were seriously injured today from one of my top librarians?"" The disapproval was etched into her face; Libbie believed that she was born with that look.

""Did you receive my report about 5 large late fees being taken care of as well?"" Libbie said, avoiding the question.

""Damn it Libbie!"" The chief yelled, smashing her fist upon the desk. The desk was brand new, after it had been replaced from the last desk which only lasted six months. In fact, 8 months was the longest a desk had lasted under Chief Reeder. ""You were simply supposed to remind them, and if things had turned ugly, asked for backup!""

""Chief, with all due respect, they had plenty of reminders! It was time for them to pay. And I don't need backup."" Libbie stared down the chief; the chief turned away first, letting out an exasperated sigh.

""Libbe Arian, you are the best at what you do. No doubt about it. Because if you weren't, everything you've done would have gotten you fired a long time ago. But soon it won't be enough. Which is why-"" A knock at the door interrupted her sentence. Suddenly, a pleasant look formed on the chief's face, and this scared Libbie more than anything. ""Come in!"" Reeder said in a happy voice.

The door opened, and a man dressed in business attire entered the room. Topping out at 6'2"", with a short head of hair and sharp angles in his face and a sharp look in his eye, Libbie knew a new recruit when she saw one. The eyes were hopeful, a look that Libbie once had when she first entered the librarian profession. But after 5 years, the hopeful look was gone, replaced with a stern-ness that one could only get by seeing the scum of the earth not return their library books.

""This is our newest librarian, Rook Keeper. He's been assigned to you as your partner."" Before Libbie could react, she kept talking. ""And you have a new assignment as well. Here's what you two will be working on."" The chief handed Libbie a document. Libbie opened it and skimmed it. As she did, outrage appeared on her face.

""WHAT!"" Libbie exclaimed. ""First, you give me a partner. I WORK ALONE! And he's still stocked in the 'newest books' shelf! And then you give me small time work?!"" She tossed the document back on the desk, open to the main page. The details of one Jeff Pierce were on it, and the fine was up to $4.95. ""This is absolutely ridiculous! I'm your best!""

""You're also the one in most trouble, so you will do this or turn in your library card. Got it?"" After a few seconds of silence, Libbie nodded her head and grunted. ""Good. Now go on, it'll do both you and the kid good."" Libbie stormed out of the office, with Rook grabbing the file and following.

I find ideals and bullheadedness like those found within this sub to be diminishing to the overall quality of discussions, the best way to debunk such things is to downvote it and point out the silliness of their inability to understand the other side, or inability to understand they could be wrong. (I recognize this too, yes.)

It doesn't help him feel better or understand anything, that would be next to impossible. What it DOES help is it helps other readers who pass by the comments realize how ridiculous he's being. That he's not the norm, and by doing so you perpetuate a positivity based on his negativity, and invite those who are less negative remain so, and maybe even be vocal themselves.

It doesn't need to be a 'positivity cirlejerk', but it shouldn't be a negativity one either."

prairie_girls,Calgary,1389654980.0,"I think it depends a lot on where you live.  I commuted by transit from the core to my workplace in the suburbs for a year, and it wasn't a great experience but it could have been worse.  For me, the biggest problem was that in bad weather I would have to leave almost an hour early because buses simply wouldn't show up, and CT wouldn't have a lot of info about whether or not a bus was coming (much less when).  I've moved since then, and now I frequently see buses getting stuck on my street when the weather isn't great.  If your employer is flexible about this sort of thing it's fine, but if you're an hourly employee and you have to be at work at 8:00 no matter what, you might need to leave two or two and a half hours early to do a trip that normally takes forty-five minutes.  

I have also had a few noteworthy bad transit experiences unrelated to weather.  In one incident our driver experienced a medical emergency and the bus went off the road.  It was at a slow speed and we just rolled onto the grassy area between the road and the sidewalk.  An ambulance was called and the driver asked me to call Calgary Transit dispatch using her cell phone.  The dispatcher then verbally berated me, accused me of being a prank caller, and hung up on me.  CT did later apologize.  On another occasion I was scolded by a C-Train driver when a physically and mentally disabled passenger got his wheelchair stuck in the train's exit doors and none of us on the (relatively empty) cart were able to dislodge him.  The door wasn't closing and none of us could do anything, so I hit the help button.  Apparently that's not what the help button is for, and the driver spoke to me like I was an eight-year-old who'd stolen a Tootsie Pop from 7-11.    "

The ER doc said that I'd done it so well he didn't even need stitches, just butterfly bandages.  The exact replacement and extremely tight bandage had permitted it to start healing in the 2 hrs it took to get him to the ER.

I have seen a lot of ""experimentation = trust"" here.  I think it is an interesting issue that I never thought about in that way.  

For me what I want to do is based on 1. if I think it will be physically enjoyable 2. if I want that as part of who I am (ex: though I am sure an orgy might be fun as hell, I don't want to be someone who has orgies.)  I realize the latter condition may equal a ""hang up"" or ""conditioning,"" but it still holds for me, and I think I am pretty liberal about sex.  I never see experimentation as an issue of trust for me, but I feel that I have read that a lot of guys on here do.  Anyway, it is a good opening for conversation.

WalterFStarbuck,changemyview,1389655418.0,"&gt; Star wars canon explicitly says that stormtroopers are extremely accurate and precise. Yet when confronted by ""main character defensive magic"", they always miss.

I hear this all the time and I don't think it's a movie trope so much as it's part of the story. Years back before the prequels came out, I had a printed copy of the script from A New Hope. It was pretty great. It had concept art and things from cut scenes in the movie. One of those scenes involves Luke and Biggs talking about joining the Empire to jump ship and find the Rebellion to get off Tatooine.

Part of that discussion talks about the empire needing to recruit people from all over, even the outer rim, to shore up numbers and maintain control. The empire was stretched thin and having trouble maintaining order. This is why the Death Star was important in the first place -- ""Fear will keep the local systems in line."" 

So why are the stormtroopers in 4, 5, and 6 terrible shots? They're conscripts forced into service with minimal training. The elite clone troopers we're shown in 1, 2, and 3 (no matter what you believe about these films being good or bad) are doing exactly what they were created to do and doing it very well. There was an entire war they fought against machines (droids). And they crushed it. But they took heavy casualties. And by the time Ep. 4 rolls around, most of them are dead. All the stormtroopers with the exception of the Emperor's guard and probably troopers in command are shitty conscripts just doing what they're told. 

When Obi-Wan tells Luke that only stormtroopers are this precise, he's still expecting them to the clone troopers he saw fight an all-out war. Before 1, 2, and 3 we just take the ""Clone Wars"" for granted when Obi-Wan mentions them in passing. And as bad as the prequels may have been, the Clone Wars were pretty goddamn epic. Obi-Wan has literally been living in a cave for the last few decades. I think it's safe to say he doesn't exactly know what the hell he's talking about.

There are plenty of stupid movie tropes in Star Wars. It's an exercise in archetypes. This isn't a movie trope -- It's a plot hole that would've been filled if the Biggs scene wasn't cut. And what makes it better is it foreshadows how the Empire is slowly crumbling around Vader. The Emperor couldn't give two shits about it. He's on top of the power pyramid. But Vader's drug around by the neck and the conscripts outnumbering what's left of the clones is the first sign that the Rebellion is really gaining the upper hand. All Vader needs is a way out -- that's ""the good in him."" Luke is his way out.

What all that says about Boba Fett is that if he's not a badass (and I'll agree that he certainly is), it's not from genetics. Jango was good at what he did -- he only failed because he wasn't a crazy space super-samurai. And the Clone troopers which were dialed-back clones of Jango and Boba were still bad ass. With the element of surprise they nearly wiped the Jedi Order out. The only problem in 4, 5, and 6 is that there aren't enough of them left."

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1389655448.0,"A lot of us here have different perspectives on how to invest, what type of lifestyle to live, and many other things.  What we all agree on:

1) Save as much as you can.  Your savings rate is vitally important.  At your age, if you save 50% of what you earn, you will be able to retire in under 20 years.  Don't try to keep up with your peers... they will almost all be living above their means.  Beware of lifestyle inflation, and wasting money on useless things, or things you'll be throwing away in a year.

2) Grow your salary.  This is the second lever, and IMO every bit as  important as (1).  Get a good job, preferably one that you enjoy.  IT and medicine are probably the two easiest big ticket industries right now.  Work hard, work SMART, and be nice to people.  Networking and recognition/respect from your superiors are honestly more important to your success than just about anything else (this doesn't mean you can be a shitty performer, but being a good performer is not enough to get you rapid advancement).  Wish I had known that earlier in my career, not that I can complain too much.

3) Invest your money well.  If you don't want to spend the time and effort to learn active investment strategies, dollar-cost-average into vanguard mutual funds.  It's what 99% of the people here recommend, and it is the most utterly dead-simple strategy you can follow.  Don't buy into gurus or get-rich-quick schemes.  Note that I am not saying you can't consistently beat the above strategy in terms of returns with a lot of work and education, but anyone promising you an easy way to 'beat the market' is full of it. 

Hope that helps... IMO that is FI in a nutshell."

I stole a term used in The Hunger Games - a ""hollow day,"" where you can gorge yourself all day and still be ravenous.  Woke up starving.  Had my usual breakfast, hungry an hour later.  Had my light snack at my usual time, didn't so much as dent the hunger.  Just had a seafood salad wrap, a cup of tea, a bunch of water and a few small squares of dark chocolate - starting to get hungry again 20 minutes later, when that SHOULD keep me satisfied for hours.  I'm also very dehydrated, which happens like a week and a half after my period for some reason.  Anyway, usually I only get like this when I've been having a lot of carbs/sugars, which I haven't.

Ugh.  I just have to make it for another hour and a half - then the cafeteria with all its fried foods and baked goods will be closed.  If I can make it today, I can make it any day (although at this rate I might start gnawing on my work phone)."

I know how far I can get in 5hrs just by car and I live in the middle of nowhere. So obviously more nowhere than me. The East Coast is pretty densely populated to have that problem leaving limited number of remote locations. Lack of roads has to be the issue given how many people someone can reach in just a 2hrs drive. I'm guessing somewhere brisk and northerly as opposed to more southern regions given your username. So I'm thinking either you are either significantly to the north like Labrador, or on an island or both. MDI, Maine? PEI perhaps? 

You are also tied to your remote location due to your job. So the work itself must be remote by it's nature and not possible elsewhere. Plus your social circle is international. Maybe due to family? Or academic collaboration necessary for work? Then there's that geneticist reference... All the little details make me think marine biologist or conservation.

Then there's the chocolate... Did you spend a lot of time in Europe while growing up? Maybe a red passport instead of a blue one? What about Fruit &amp; Nut? Jaffa cakes? Those more your style? Not kit kat... maybe Balisto?

Another example of a non-Skinner box would be Minecraft. The fun part is exploring, which you do for the joy of seeing the sights, instead of any in-game motivation. The other fun part is building.

The_British_One,LiverpoolFC,1389655943.0,"United &amp; Spurs have been horribly inconsistent. If they strengthen in this transfer window I'm inclined to agree they could make a surge but right now I don't see it.

United are relying on a 40 year old 10-years-past it CM and an 18 year old who isn't as good as Raheem Sterling to drag them through their matches. Spurs are just generally under-performing woefully. Sherwood seems to have it sorted one minute. Next minute back to square one. 

I agree Everton don't have the depth to see it out. But some would say the same about us.

I agree we need a LB, goal scoring winger/CAM and another strong CM but I think we're in the best position for top 4 of our rivals. We have Enrique to come back, as well as Flannagan, so we should have decent depth at LB soon enough. I'd like to think Coutinho and Sterling can eventually learn to finish goals like they have proven they can at lower levels. And then we just need a back up to Lucas - hopefully we can land M'Villa.

I have AGCTW and a NARS duo in Kuala Lumpur and I love them both. I find them to be equally or more blendable than most other shadows that I have. Naked 3 and LM Artist's Palette are about the same in blendability, KvD Ladybird is less blendable for me. LORAC Pro Palette shadows are more soft and buttery than the NARS ones. 

As for pigmentation, I do think that the NARS shadows are less pigmented than Naked 3, LM, and LORAC, but I guess I don't see that as much of a bad thing. I'd rather have to layer on shadow to get the color intensity that I want and have an easier time blending it than get the color intensity in one swipe but struggle to blend it out. It's not like I've ever hit pan on anything, anyway.

ThoughtRiot1776,AskReddit,1389656065.0,"Snappa.  All day, every day.  It's a great game.  

You have a table (pingpong works) and set up two cups on each end about a hands distance from the back and the side.  Two players per side, both sitting in chairs (you want a fair amount of room between you and the table).

Playing is pretty simple.  One team throws the dice high in the air (like 5' minimum).  If the die bounces between or over the cups, the defensive team has to catch it.  They are not allowed to trap the die against their body or use two hands.  If they miss, you score a point.  You also score if the die hits a cup and shows a 5 or if you sink the die in the cup.

You drink if you miss the table or give up a point.  Most people play a beer being 4-6 drinks; it's a pretty hard drinking game.  If a cup is sunk, then the team whose cups got hit must chug all their drinks.

It's pretty fun.  Good level of activeness and coordination while still being pretty chill. 

edit: you also can't catch the die until it has gone of the end of the table. "

sd2iv,Economics,1389656142.0,"I don't think we can have a universal basic income just yet. Not for monetary reasons, but for psychological reasons. People who are very successful tend to work long stressful hours. When they see people abusing systems like welfare they tend to lose empathy for those who are working hard to provide for themselves. I think the first step is to have a general base case jobs program managed by each state.  
Raise the private minimum wage to say $10 an hour, and make a public jobs program at say $8 an hour. This would provide an incentive to people to work in the private sector over the public sector while still providing a fall back plan for anyone in need. Make the public sector jobs accept everyone, indexed to your ability to work. E.g. if you're in a wheelchair then you may be a greeter in front of a government building or something that you can do given your limitations. Make it extremely hard to be unqualified, but with little say in which position you are placed into, to encourage going private sector. Add anyone who is mentally handicapped or elderly 70+ to this same wage category (although exempting them from work). Then do away with social security and most other social programs.  
Once we have had a program like this running for a number of years, it would be an easy transition to do away with the program altogether and just give people the money outright.  
It will take a while for the hard workers of society to adapt and realize that not everyone needs to or should work as hard as they do, and I think this would be a decent stepping stone path of doing so."

It's an abysmal idea and I don't advocate it in any way, shape, or form, but it's not just a bunch of sadists at it's ideal level.

&gt;Users cannot independently log in and out, saving their sessions. The machine must be powered down in order to save the state of a single user?

Are you talking about [xsm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_session_manager)?  I didn't think anyone was still using it. It looks like every application has to implement checkpointing and support the protocol. I don't think many developers are bothering with it these days. Also, I don't see how it could allow non-X11 programs to survive a reboot.

Windows supports ""switch user"" which allows one to detach from the current session (without closing any processes) and log in as another user.  You can do the same thing in Linux by running multiple X servers. Gnome and KDE both have user switching options, and if you're using lightdm you can do it with any DE/WM with dm-tool. You can also do it the old-school way with startx.

When the machine is suspended, all currently logged-in user sessions are preserved.  However, if you're actually going to have more than one person logged in with GUI sessions, 'tis best to have lots of RAM."

I was out by myself a lot with no metaphorical handholding; she was busy trying to help my older sister with school and other stuff. I started working as a teen, primarily so I could pay for Japanese lessons during high school. My parents dislike Japanese and wouldn't help me out on that, which was fine. I traveled abroad on my own during the summer of age 16 to Japan, again on my own dime (but really thanks to a hefty scholarship I was able to earn). I began college while I was 17 and worked two part time jobs during that time. First year foundational lessons were easy so I didn't find it hard, and hey, financial aid AND loans just aren't enough to pay tuition. I was good at holding my liquor by this age as well, since I started drinking casually by age 12. When I graduated at 21, I paid off my loans and was debt free after 6 months....while people aged 28+ are still paying it off. I worked so hard I almost failed school.

stln00b,funny,1389656372.0,"Time to break out the RES Big Editor to break it down for you.

Actually, I took a smoke break and *then* got the Big Editor out.

&gt;I'm assuming you don't have an ass or titties that get grouped by strange men, so you don't get to make that call, douche bag.

Well, kind sir/madam/gender neutral pronoun of your choice, you are incorrect. I'm sorry to break it to you, but even though I'm a man, I do have breasts (just as all mammals have), and I do have an ass. And yes, they have been groped by strange men, and even strange women. So, I do get to have at least a little bit of a say.

First of all, lets look at the statement - ""One in four college women in USA are raped or sexually assaulted during their academic career."" That's a powerful statement. *Very* powerful. Because rape evokes, and *Should* evoke a powerful emotional reaction.

But that's not the statement. The statement is ""One in four college women in USA are raped **or sexually assaulted** during their academic career."" And this is an important thing to note. Why? Because they classify things like ""attempted forced kissing"" as a sexual assault. Inappropriate? Oh absolutely! But there's a problem here - the question doesn't allow for context. It's a simple yes or no.

So why is context important? Well, lets look at a few very simple scenarios:

* Friends are out partying - lets say 5 guys and 5 girls. They're having a great time, getting hammered and Johnny playfully tries to kiss Jill on the cheek. Jill knows it's all in good fun, but still screams ""Ewwww!"" pushes Johnny away, and everyone's laughing. They continue on with their night, nothing changes between Johnny and Jill and everyone lives happily ever after.

* Jill, a few months later, is out with the same 4 girls dancing, drinking, and having a great time. Until an asshole singles Jill out. They're dancing and having a good time, and the asshole suggests they take a break and get a drink. Jill agrees and they leave the dance floor. They move to a more secluded part of the club and the asshole tries to kiss her. She screams ""Ewwww!"", breaks free, and rejoins her friends.

The context of these two scenarios is very different, but for the purposes of that survey, they are the same. See the problem?

Additionally, you're trying to make the subject of sexual assault a gendered issue, and it isn't. So while you may think me a douche, it proves that you're a sexist.

I really hope this opens your eyes a little, and if it doesn't, well, I'm sure /r/ShitRedditSays would love to have you amongst their ranks.

I just view women as selfish individuals like myself who are trying to get the most out of this short time they have on the planet. Wish they could be more honest about it, but I understand why they keep up the facade.

I'm a free man now. It's so liberating not to feel the tug to pursue, or the shame of not being enough man for someone else, constantly questioning what it is that I don't got someone else had. Now it's all so simple. It's about what I want, and ""Does she live up to my standards?"" Honestly, I haven't been this happy ever since I was a child, and that's tragically saying something.
 
It's unreal women are sexually attracted to dominant behavior but swear up and down it's the supplicating nice guys they crave.

Me, personally - I grew up in the church, I was born and raised in the Southern Bible belt, so it was very normal where I grew up. Giant United Methodist Churches with a Starbucks inside, kind of church.

I think some of the Bible's teachings are more than just Bible stories, lots of them are life lessons as well on how to be a good person, how to treat others, etc. Books and TV shows like Veggie Tales are great for things like that. It's not all about Jesus all the time.

We likely won't baptize our kids (DH was, his family is Catholic, and I was as well as an infant). We will likely get pushback from family on both sides, but times are changing and I want my kids to make that decision themselves instead of having it forced on them.

If they want to be a devout Christian, that's great. If they want to be Buddhist, that's great.

It was a big part of my life growing up, but I don't want to force it on my kids. If they meet a friend and want to go to church with them to see what it's all about, that's fantastic.

On the other hand, it's not fair to put all Christians in one mindset. Lots of denominations are open to the LGBT community. It's not a Christian's place to judge people. At least in the church I grew up in. I know some are different.

AbstractAngel,ffxiv,1389656624.0,"I'm a Bard and when I first did my Primals, I had geared myself out in Darklight for Titan HM, but not before that. What I would suggest is doing your daily roulette options and runs through dungeons (like AK/WP/Etc). Doing this will get you your full darklight fairly quickly, and then you'll be set for Primals. 

If you can't do the Darklight route for whatever reason (time, patience, etc) you can always get some crafted gear that works very well also. And running the Hard Mode dungeons drops some accessories that can help you as well!

The Primals are the first major learning curve. You're right - the mechanics are much more difficult than anything you've faced before, which is half the fun! The reason people suggest ilvl70 (ish) for Titan HM is so that you have enough HP that if you mess up once, you aren't necessarily dying instantly. That and some of the fights are a DPS check, such as the heart phase during Titan HM. If you don't have the DPS in the group for this fight, it's an instant wipe, so having full DL gives you a better chance at being able to successfully kill the heart in time. 

As for Ifrit and Garuda, I don't see the need for it. Even with the lower HP and lower DPS they are fairly easy to get through, ilvl60 should be fine and in the case of a non-existent PF or failure to get one going yourself - just use Duty Finder because chances are high levels will be doing their duty roulettes for the day just looking to make some quick tomes for alts/max out their myth.

Not to mention that a lot of Party Finder Groups are hit and miss altogether. One of my absolutely *favourite* things to do when I'm bored is jump into something like Titan HM (completely over geared for it) and help people who are struggling. What most people who are over geared for those fights do not do (imo) is help some of those ridiculous PFs like requiring ilvl80 and requesting only players who have beaten it  multiple times to come (yadda yadda yadda) - stay away from them for your first run as either they are looking to farm and are typically an unforgiving group, or are looking to be carried and won't put the time and effort you will into it. You're in it to learn it and win it while having fun - not be screamed at by someone saying L2P who bought a carry.

A little long-winded, but I hope this helps! If you're on Faerie and want any help along the way, PM me! :)

Edit:  I'm trying to think of other cartoons with respectful and nuanced family dynamics.  From when I was little I watched *Magic Schoolbus*--the kids always spoke positively about their families and when the parents were on screen they were caring and supportive of the kids, and *Arthur*, where the parents were silly but worked as a team and set limits and were viewed as an authority figure who modeled good behavior, and *Recess* where all the families were kind of flaky, but they weren't the butt of the jokes and they weren't dumber than the kids.

bertrussell,AskMen,1389656642.0,"A woman I knew was not very attractive, but was nice enough. We became friends. My roommate was moving out and she needed a new place, so I suggested she take the empty room.

After living together (platonically), I got the impression that she had a thing for me - and I might have been open to reciprocating, in enough time - but she went out of her way to get attention from me in very negative ways. She got so annoying that our ""friendship"" was destroyed, and I just started treating her as terribly as she treated me. A lot of ""fuck off""s and ""get the fuck out of my way""s were uttered. I abhor conflict in person, and so for me to get to that point it took a lot.

(An example of her behaviour: I liked to watch certain shows, and she would watch with me constantly asking questions no matter how many times I asked her to let me watch the show. So I started watching the shows on my own, wearing headphones. The questions didn't stop. So I started ignoring her. So she started pulling the headphones off my head and/or snapping her fingers inches infront of my face until I paid attention to her.)"

The cloth nappies get transported ONCE. you're not really trying to make that comparison are you?

We're talking about frugal, careful, thoughtful and motivated individuals here in this sub.

And yes, by the way: movement. Even right years ago it was almost unheard of to use cloth nappies. We had to go to speciality stores.

The decline in voter engagement, apathy, low attendance at community hearings and such...these imo are the problem. We made our problems. Politicians feel they can run around being crooked because nobody gives a shit, in a month all will be forgotten. If we held our politicians accountable for shitty moves that make no sense, I think things would very swiftly change. 

The original question was ""what can be done to improve Chicago."" The answer, in terms of local politics can't possibly be ooooh, keep doing what we're doing and hope someone will come around to save us. Improving anything takes effort, it means *working* for a change. 

Look at gay marriage, at one point very few people would dispute that it is an abomination. It's unfortunate that the acceptance of gay marriage came at such a glacial creep, but because people were raising awareness, having intellectual discussions, protesting, engaging in politics at a local and national level, gay rights legislation is finding it's way into state bills. The same is now happening with medical/recreational MJ. 

Yes, human rights issues vs corruption are two different animals. But ultimately politicians need to romance their voter base in order to get votes. If we create an environment where politicians know they will not win unless they produce results, we can see a change. It's easier to make waves at the local level than it is at the national level. So...that is the most logical start point. "

I humbly suggest you please use one of them. You can upload a GIF (or video) and host it there, and it'll be converted (if necessary) to a video.  A 10MB GIF download equates to roughly a 1MB HTML5 video download, usually - thus  making it FAR more mobile friendly than a GIF despite assertions to the contrary.

iVikingr,asoiaf,1389656947.0,"I've been thinking a lot about the 'rightful' succession lately and was wondering since according to the wiki the Targaryen ""practiced a highly modified version of agnatic primogeniture, placing female claimants in the line of succession behind all possible male ones, even collateral relations."" 

If females are placed behind all possible males that means the Targaryen succession would be Aerys -&gt; Rhaegar -&gt; Aegon -&gt; Viserys -&gt; Robert -&gt; Stannis -&gt; Renly -&gt; Unknown/Plumm/Martell/Maybe Velaryon?

mkvgtired,europe,1389656986.0,"I agree some of the fees are absurd. There is a huge disparity between the costs depending on the state and even the medical institution. State law typically controls malpractice lawsuits, so malpractice insurance can vary greatly between states, adding considerable costs to the same procedure. So you're right, it can be a mess. There are many factors that lead to increased costs. Luckily national regulators seem to be taking note, and states are also clamping down. So hopefully in the future things will improve. 

One thing I will say I am grateful for is the availability of very specialized treatment for rare diseases. I am not sure how it is in all European countries, but I know the UK wont offer the treatment my family member gets unless the disease is life threatening. The problem is these treatments are what keep it from getting to that point. After a few years of it some people are even able to be weaned off of it. They are lowering my family member's dose on her next visit because of her improvement. She definitely would not be able to start her business without these treatments, she would be bed ridden. 

When I was learning about the disease a woman from the UK was talking about how she was going to have to leave to get treatment. I think the US medical system is definitely a clusterfuck, but I am grateful for at least that one aspect of it. "

People cry for different reasons - being sad, feeling weak, feeling relieved, etc. Do you tend to cry when you are admitting that you need help? Or is it when you are mad at someone? Etc. If you can break it down, maybe that will help you to ""own"" those feelings prior to your conversation so that you don't feel that they sneak up on you.

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,WTF,1389657427.0,"Well, since sarcasm was lost, I'll ease your mind. No, I didn't tell my toddler niece that she killed her donkey. I explained to her that that is how doggies play with toys and that Pete (my dog) likes to chew things. He didn't do it on purpose, he was just being a puppy. It was the same lesson her older brothers are taught when she inadvertently destroys their toys because she is a baby. And she was fine. She quickly moved on to something else, mostly playing with Pete. That is what childhood is about: learning how to deal with the ups and downs of life in a controlled environment so that you have the tools to deal with similar situations when you are out on your own.

And now she is more careful with her toys when my dog is around. She understands that if she pushes a stuffed animal in his face he might try to chew it up. She also better about moving her favorites out of the way and will give him a different toy to play with instead. Just like how her brothers will move their legos to a high tabletop if they see her coming because she will go godzilla on everything if they don't. My dog is just the little sibling that she will never have, teaching those lessons that are key to dealing with life. 

It was an accident. They happen. It was heartbreaking to watch, but it wasn't planned. If that is in your top 5 worst things of hearing (especially on the internet) you have lived a wonderful life and you should be very thankful for it.

You keep it maintained and drive it nicely (no dry steering, no slamming on brakes, etc). It can last you easily 6+ years depending on how you drive, how much you maintain it, how much mileage you put on it. Now let's say you lease it, you'll spend the same price to lease it for 3 years as you would to buy it outright. In three years, you have to take a lease on a new one. You put out the same price. In 6 years, you've now put out double the price you would have to just buy the vehicle, you have to watch your mileage carefully (because they have a mileage limit), you likely have to insure it even more thoroughly than you would choose to if you owned it.

* Everybody playing drinking the same thing, beer is a great example
* Anything that has 50/50 odds (coin works best but a die can be used with odds or evens)

How to play:
The player with the cup ""wagers"" an amount of beer and pours it into the cup. They flip the coin and call heads or tails in the air. If the call is correct, they pass the cup of beer to the next person who repeats the steps. If they are wrong they chug the beer and the game continues with the next person starting with an empty cup.

People think you need playmakers and shit on the outside, but if you can't manhandle the other team in the trenches, chances are you won't go very far.

With all that said, we have a lot of positives to look forward to next season. I'm loving the physicality the offense showed against Seattle. I about jumped through the roof when Ingram trucked Earl Thomas. Our line is playing better, our backs are running like men possessed. If we get that power running game going early next year, Brees will be even more deadly than he already is. Ingram and Robinson look to be a great one two punch next year."

2.Take up an expressive, calming hobby. There's a lot of meditative coloring books that are really *very* good.  Shit like this : http://mandalacoloringmeditation.com/mandala-coloring/.

Just focus on calming yourself down. You might not understand what just happened, but try removing yourself from the situation. If your husband did this to you, he was a shitty guy way before and it's good you found out while you're still pretty young. 

&gt; I doubt he loves me, I feel unlovable and unwanted

SC was under a [federal lawsuit] (http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=382) for about 13 years which resulted in many changes to conditions and how the state deals with juveniles.  As a result there are more programs, less juveniles in secure facilities, and a greater focus on community programs. 

The juveniles now receive mandatory counseling, while in the facility as well as skills training in various areas in preparation for reintegration.  Now this all sounds expensive, but they are able to accomplish this by reducing the population in secure facilities. That freed up the money for the type of reform that advocates want to see both inside the facility as well as in the community. I personally agree with buddymercury that money would be better spend on adults since the juveniles will likely age out of crime.  That being said I believe SC's example outlines an approach that could be taken to reform juvenile facilities without taking away from the budget for adults."

Mephrael,AskReddit,1389657820.0,"&gt; How is personal identification unacceptable in the form of writing but somehow OK in the form of images?

Over the course of days, weeks or even months, someone may inadvertently give out enough details to give away their identity. The mods are specifically discussing when someone specifically trawls someone's posting history looking for these fine details and collating them to try and identify the poster. One could surmise that doing the same with posted images to try and pinpoint geographical location is basically the same thing. 

The major difference here is how easy certain information is to use in identifying someone. Posting faceless nude pictures from an indoor location is only going to give someone away if another redditor recognises identifying body features (ie. piercings, tattoos etc.) or background details. This would often require a pretty close relationship with the poster to allow for positive ID.  Posting your name gives someone something they can simply drop into a search engine and start hunting. 

In terms of crawling someone's posting history and simply saying ""no GW pics here"" this makes the poster an asshole, and truth be told, if you started banning assholes, soon enough there'd be about fifty people and a bunch of tumbleweeds here on reddit, and that more or less defeats the purpose of the whole website. 

TL;DR: play by the rules, and ignore people when they're being dicks. Kinda like life away from the computer really!"

I get uncomfortable in groups of people where I'm expected to be social but don't know anyone very well (sounds similar to what you described).

To help along that line of thought, how did it all begin? Did one person find writing therapeutic, and got everyone to do it? Do people get something from reading the old journals?

Other questions I have are if anyone writes fiction (or just makes up what happens to them), and where do they get all the paper? Also, who reads all the books?

You are letting her define who you are. It seems that your personality is nothing more then an extension of hers. Time to be a grown-up, stand up for yourself and learn how to be your own person.

stln00b,funny,1389657962.0,"Here, I'll copypasta my reply to another fledgling SRSter:

&gt;Time to break out the RES Big Editor to break it down for you.

&gt;Actually, I took a smoke break and then got the Big Editor out.

&gt;&gt; I'm assuming you don't have an ass or titties that get grouped by strange men, so you don't get to make that call, douche bag.

&gt;Well, kind sir/madam/gender neutral pronoun of your choice, you are incorrect. I'm sorry to break it to you, but even though I'm a man, I do have breasts (just as all mammals have), and I do have an ass. And yes, they have been groped by strange men, and even strange women. So, I do get to have at least a little bit of a say.

&gt;First of all, lets look at the statement - ""One in four college women in USA are raped or sexually assaulted during their academic career."" That's a powerful statement. Very powerful. Because rape evokes, and Should evoke a powerful emotional reaction.

&gt;But that's not the statement. The statement is ""One in four college women in USA are raped **or sexually assaulted** during their academic career."" And this is an important thing to note. Why? Because they classify things like ""attempted forced kissing"" as a sexual assault. Inappropriate? Oh absolutely! But there's a problem here - the question doesn't allow for context. It's a simple yes or no.

&gt; So why is context important? Well, lets look at a few very simple scenarios:

&gt; * Friends are out partying - lets say 5 guys and 5 girls. They're having a great time, getting hammered and Johnny playfully tries to kiss Jill on the cheek. Jill knows it's all in good fun, but still screams ""Ewwww!"" pushes Johnny away, and everyone's laughing. They continue on with their night, nothing changes between Johnny and Jill and everyone lives happily ever after.

&gt; * Jill, a few months later, is out with the same 4 girls dancing, drinking, and having a great time. Until an asshole singles Jill out. They're dancing and having a good time, and the asshole suggests they take a break and get a drink. Jill agrees and they leave the dance floor. They move to a more secluded part of the club and the asshole tries to kiss her. She screams ""Ewwww!"", breaks free, and rejoins her friends.

&gt; The context of these two scenarios is very different, but for the purposes of that survey, they are the same. See the problem?

&gt; Additionally, you're trying to make the subject of sexual assault a gendered issue, and it isn't. So while you may think me a douche, it proves that you're a sexist.

&gt; I really hope this opens your eyes a little, and if it doesn't, well, I'm sure /r/ShitRedditSays would love to have you amongst their ranks.

&gt; Toodles!

Have a nice life."

Blink dagger isn't necessarily more reliable initiation than Shadow Blade if they have some way to tag you with damage, anyway. Shadow Blade can't be disabled and can be useful for initiation even if they have true sight.

They tell you to shave (or do it for you, I opted to do it myself), gave me a numbing cream to put on the skin about an hour beforehand, and even gave me a pill before (don't recall if it was valium or what).  I got nice and loopy and went in for the procedure.  I vaguely recall hitting on the nurse, maybe blurting out how cold it was in the room, and generally just chatted with the doc and nurse the whole time (he was telling me what he was doing as he was going).  I was snipped, cauterized, it was folded back over on itself and clipped with titanium clips.  The whole thing was done in 15-20 minutes.

I didn't really get sore for another 6 hours or so, but I had a bag of frozen peas on hand, and it was never bad enough to require any other pain pills.  I didn't do anything the next day but sit on the couch with more peas or an ice pack.  The day after that I was up and moving (slowly) pretty well.  By the third, I was moving with minimal discomfort.  By the end of one week, the only way I could tell I'd had it done was when my then toddler would run and jump into my arms (they mean it when they say don't lift anything heavy for at least a week).  I wore boxers and didn't have any issues, but snug (but not tight) underwear might have been a better idea.

I did the follow-up test (it was required, anyway) and came back negative (which was good).  ~3 weeks later it was a forgotten event.  The peace of mind was (and is) excellent, though."

Zygomatico,HomeworkHelp,1389658028.0,"In your first paragraph you can delete everything from ""For example, different..."" onwards. You're explaining the possibilities immediately after, so you don't have to give any examples.

Next, you immediately assume you know exactly what needs to happen. You don't. Your first step, whenever you experience delays, is to make a new timeline. Figure out what still needs to be done and how it can be done. In every solution you've got a clipboard ready with a plan, but you first need to make the plan.

Next, you can't ever state ""others have messed up, so work overtime otherwise you might be fired"". That's such tremendous undue cause that it'll get you sued to hell and back again. There are four jobs on the line: yours, and the three workers who are lagging. 

Also, nowhere do you ever call for help from within the company. If it's a big company, they'll have lots of people running around. Yes, you might have to show that things aren't going well, but you can count on your supervisors to help out. It's a big project, it needs to be fixed. Look beyond your own team into the capabilities of the company. 

Finally, communicate clearly with your client. If things are looking bad, communicate with them on time to let them know the deadline might not be met. These are the people paying, so in essence your boss. While a delayed project might harm your image, a delayed project that they weren't told about will definitely cause them to never return. A simple ""We have run into some delays, but have taken measures to solve this. However, we do want you to know what is going on."" will tell them all they need to know.

Instead of listing possible scenarios, I'd list possible areas in which you need to act. These are your team, your planning, your supervisors/company and the client. Describe the various steps you need to take, and the possible steps you can take. It'll make things slightly clearer than what you've got so far."

Kaisharga,changemyview,1389658071.0,"I can't speak directly to the tactics issue, but I hear from people who know DotA2 very well that it is snowbally as fuck, and that unless your opponents screw up really bad, it doesn't matter how well you play once the other team gets a decent lead.

And even though you don't get your items immediately, you can still get deliveries of your items while in the field. You don't ever theoretically need to return to base at all, ever. The price of death is in that gold loss, not in time--and that gold loss can be ameliorated by conscientious use of the quickbuy stuff. And then you're back into the fray with a quick teleport--dying means very little in DotA2, and this contributes greatly to the snowball effect.

Also I don't know anyone who plays League with the camera locked. However, when you get flanked in League, you can see what's happening, even though you're still probably boned--but you're boned because the opponents have you in a bad spot, not because you can't tell what's going on at the same time. This is denial of access to information, and with no good reason.

As far as the skill and item combinations, I didn't spend much time in DotA2 but I do recall some item that puts you in the air for a couple seconds, interacting surprisingly with whatshisface's hook ability. DotA2 is, by all accounts, full of these little surprises that characterize advanced play but for which there is no warning to a new player, even one who reads all the skill descriptions and item text.

They don't seem to realize that taking damage and having enough sense and timing to get cover in time is one of the most important mechanics in BF. They say they want realism, so they play the mode that's tacked on to ensure they still buy the product. They don't seem to understand that just about *everything in the game* is designed around Normal mode. 

I would pull 3D spotting and would agree to buff the miniguns quite a bit. I do admit tapping Q in hopes you'll ""reveal"" players is a huge problem. Shooting at doritos through foliage is also really lame. 

However, reading the mini-map while participating in a huge firefight is just another element that separates good players from average ones and is paramount to teamwork as well. As far as the damage, dropping in two shots and never having a chance to retaliate is just annoying to me."

&gt; no really...what stalker?

[This Stalker!](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Stalker)

&gt; is he constantly invisible?

Nope. The lights flicker for all players, but Stalker will only directly message one player in a party. The player who receives the message is the ""Target,"" and once Stalker spawns into the map, he will gun straight for the Target Player. There are two outcomes:

* The players defeat Stalker, which will result in him either retreating (teleporting away), or straight up dying if you can do enough damage. Either way, he has a chance to drop a Weapon Blueprint.
* Stalker kills the Target Player, after which he will teleport away.

In both scenarios, Stalker will not spawn in the same mission instance again, though he may appear in subsequent missions you undertake.

And Stalker's not invisible. He's just black, smokey, and damn fast.

&gt;  do nontarget players get any indication that he is coming?

Besides the lights flickering, no.

&gt;  is there a best way to get him to appear and/or fight him?  is there a best way to get him to appear and/or fight him?

TheEggKing,FanTheories,1389658243.0,"That song actually kinda ties together with the death of Mufasa, though. Only two people were present besides Mufasa: Simba and Scar. On top of that, that song you linked was all about how Simba couldn't wait to be king with Zazu spending the whole song concerned about Simba's attitude as prince and how he'd be as a king. Removing the rose-tinted lenses as presented by the movie, is it possible that *Simba* was the one that murdered Mufasa?  

Here's what I'm thinking: Young Simba really wants to be king, and as shown by that song could be heading down a dark path in his desire for it. If we assume that the animals in general can speak (as per the linked video), then we can assume that they're intelligent. What if the herd of split hooves was symbolic for a coup? Simba tried to overthrow his father and succeeded in killing him, but was defeated when Scar rallied the royal forces and drove Simba out (""tricking"" Simba into leaving the kingdom), exiling him but thinking he had died from wounds sustained in battle. Simba bode his time in secret and when the kingdom looked unstable and unhappy with Scar's rule he returned as the ""hero"", leading the people to defeat Scar and take his ""rightful"" place as king."

I wonder how the Titans season would have been like if Locker had not gotten hurt? It seemed to me that he was steadily improving. He was very slippery against the Chargers really winning that game with his feet by extending drives.

Mahhrat,AskReddit,1389658337.0,"The Runelords.

In a nutshell, it's a fantasy book series where a unique type of magic exists.  A special metal can be crafted into runes.  You can use the runes to ""endow"", which basically meant taking the attribute from one person and giving it to another.

So, I could endow you with my strength, for example.  I'd become this wretched thing, unable to move, but you would be doubly strong.

You could endow any of the senses, strength, healing, metabolism, wit.

The interesting bits were that you could not make someone more intelligent.  They'd be able to remember everything perfectly, but they weren't smarter, per se.

Also, while you could have the strength of 100 men and heal in seconds, your bones still broke just as easily.

Raj Ahten was a major protagonist.  He had tens of thousands of endowments.  He was basically immortal, living life at six times the speed of most people.

He also had thousands of endowments of charisma and voice, so he was literally the most beautiful person on the planet.

At one point, he took over a city he wanted to conquer just by walking within sight of the walls and asking the Defenders to give up to him.

He was so beautiful and eloquent that that's exactly what he did.

Next, he used the power of his voice to bring another castle crashing down, just by yelling at it for a while.

panthur,marketing,1389658487.0,"CRM Strategist here. You probably wouldn't go wrong with either one, but it depends on what you'd be taught on the MIS side and what you want to do with CRM.

I was a communications major undergrad and then got an MBA. I've been on the client side but now I am working at an agency.

I've taken statistics courses during college and after that have been helpful. If you were to want to become a ""data scientist"" then understanding programming for stats for SPSS or SAS is necessary, and SQL to understand querying databases and how they are structured would be useful.

What I'd worry about in MIS is learning some archaic language or basic theory that won't help you practically. A lot of what I do in CRM involves understanding database structure and how software systems can be integrated together. Then researching different software systems to see what is best fit for each client. 

However you can do CRM more on the IT implementation side where you'll need the IT knowledge more, understanding how to manage the software and hardware implementation, documentation and troubleshooting and maintenance.

You will need: One deck of playing cards, a friend.

How to play:

* One person is the dealer, one is the drinker
* The dealer lays out seven playing cards face up in a row (spots #1-#7 for the example)
* The drinker starts by guessing whether or not the top card in the deck is higher or lower than the card in spot #1
* If the drinker is wrong, they drink and the card gets placed on the table over spot #1
* If the drinker is right, the card is placed over spot #1 and they move onto spot #2, etc.
* This continues up the row of cards. For example if the drinker has three correct answers in a row and misses the fourth, the card is placed in spot #4 and the drinker re-starts at spot #1
* If the drinker correctly guesses seven cards in a row, they win and a new person takes over as the drinker
* The game continues until the drinker gets the seven correct guesses in a row, if the dealer runs out of cards they leave the top cards in spots #1-#7 and reshuffle the deck. Note: I've gone through three decks before winning, my friend went through six once and didn't make it to the bar that night

It's more complicated to explain without visuals but it's reallllly easy to play. Enjoy!

Klaue,books,1389658658.0,"&gt; you have to remember that idioms of masculinity in 1851 were fairly different than they are now. homosexuality was an enormous taboo. men having to share beds, live in close quarters, and even swearing blood oaths were far more commonplace than you see today and readers probably wouldn't have read the passage as thick with homoerotic subversiveness, but would have balked at the unity between a good Christian and a cannibal savage.

Look, you can claim that all day long, but with the levels that was painted in the book, I'm just not buying it, I'm sorry. it didn't even try to be subtle. The narrator described in great lengths how he liked the feeling of the legs of the other on his own and similar things. Acting like they were all just methaphors of unity, friendship, companionship and all that jazz strikes me as dishonest, to be frank. The only way Melville could have been more direct is by outright stating that they were butt buddies.  

But the thing is, that isn't even important. Maybe I'm dead wrong woth that, but if they were menat to be lovers or just friends doesn't matter for what I was actually criticising, namely that queequeg does hardly matter at all later in the book, which is really weird after all that build up. He is made out to be more important than Ahab himself early on, at least it felt that way for me with his whole backstory and stuff, and then does not much more than dive in the head of a whale once."

there is a reason there is so much drama. those of us expressing real bitterness aren't doing so because we have a persecution complex, or because we're pessimistic, or because we're ugly, or any other reason you armchair psychologists want to invent. we're bitter because we look at those countless studies and surveys that show that we aren't respected, women want nothing to do with us, and there's not a damn thing we can do about it unless we become gym jackoffs and buy two ferraris.

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389658885.0,"Marriage and mating are about love, compatibility, and status building. It's pretty common for women to want to date wealthier or more powerful guys, and guys to want to date trophy women, in order to build up their status in society. It's also part of why women are attracted to jocks and men are attracted to cheerleaders - the idea of getting with someone who is highly prized by others is attractive on a separate realm altogether from looks. 

I think that these things play into people's dating choices more than most people would like to admit. Crossing racial lines can be a means of status building. I think it becomes racist if you are objectifying your partner by idealizing his race. That is, if you are more enamored with the *idea* of him being your boyfriend than you are really with him as a person. Another way to think of it is whether you feel like you are using his race to signify something about yourself. For instance, if you are preoccupied with having people see you with him so that you can prove that you can get a white guy, or to show how 'open minded' you are by dating outside your race. These things I think create a false pride in a relationship. 

But it is only normal to be proud of your boyfriend. There's nothing in your question that indicates that you're going about this wrong, but your description of the ""problem"" is weird. You dated a couple of Indian guys, it didn't work out, and now you are with a white guy and it seems to be working. What is the problem?  Remember that dating a white guy doesn't somehow symbolize that you have rejected all Indian guys. "

To give you my own experience, I don't take pills because I would be far too concerned about missing a day and getting pregnant. I was on the shot for 6 months, it killed my libido and I spotted for the first month. I'm on Nuvaring now (I've been on it twice before); it's my very much preferred method. I did bleed/spot for the first month on Nuvaring (I did that before, too) but now I only bleed during the off week. You will probably not find a bc that doesn't spot/bleed at first but they should stop out of period bleeding 1-3 months after starting.

soccerdadak,AskMen,1389658945.0,"Considering the type of question you posted, and the responses you're getting, there's every possibility mine will be a somewhat unpopular opinion, but here goes.

I have a kid (currently an 11-year old daughter).  When I was younger, I *knew* I wanted kids (2 of them), but as I got older, that feeling dwindled until I wasn't sure I wanted them at all.  There were a few reasons, one being I didn't have a father growing up, so I wasn't sure I would be a good father myself.

It's amazing what we'll do for love.  I was still on the fence about kids, but ended up having one with my then wife (now ex).  I wish I could say it was beautiful and worth it, but the first year and a half were a nightmare of digestive issues, colic, allergies and ear infections.  I believe I may have slept an average of 2.5 hours a night that entire time.

My kid's 11 now, so I've had plenty of time to look back and things and wonder if I'd do them differently, knowing what I know now.  Here's what I've figured out:

1 - Kids are pretty freaking awesome, assuming they've been raised right.  I love my kid, but she's not entitled or whiney and just generally doesn't act like a douchebag (which is way too common these days)

2 - I got lucky...both in my parenting and how my kid has turned out.  I was far from perfect, but I tried.  I failed sometimes, succeeded sometimes, and overall the kid's turned out all right.  I'm happy about that

3 - I love my kid, but she requires a pile of maintenance...all kids do.  I may sound like an asshole for this, but I'm glad I have split custody with the ex.  I have one week with the kid and one week without.  So, just when it seems like I might be getting tired of her being around, she's gone.  Then I start missing her and she's back.  Honestly, it's perfect.  I have time with the kid I absolutely adore, and time to myself.  Best of both worlds.

4 - I'll admit, there's something fulfilling about seeing a little person grow and develop with your influence.  I'm proud to be her father, and not just in the good times.  It's seeing her work hard for something, struggle and overcome.  It's just pretty great.  Is it necessary to feel like I've accomplished what I was supposed to in this life?  Absolutely not.

5 - I'd absolutely do it again (as in, if I could go back...no way in hell I want another kid, in fact, I got clipped to make sure I don't).

Finally - Having kids isn't for everyone.  There are some great people who I think would raise great kids, but don't want to.  And I think there are some terrible people who should never have kids, but do.  

Kids, kid free...I get both sides.  As she gets older, I'm getting more time to myself.  I have time to travel, ride my motorcycle, take part in my own hobbies and just generally build my own life.  Sure it was temporarily put on hold as I raised her, but I don't feel like I've missed anything.  Delayed, maybe, but it was worth it (to me)."

When he uses his power hammer I'm pretty sure he uses safety glasses though as sparks are insane with that things and the metal is somewhat cooler in those instances.

He has had a tank of a welding gas explode in his face more times than I can remember and has so much iron in his blood from breathing it in that his skin just goes ""nope"" and he bleeds to try and remove the excess iron.

The personality you see here is not a character. This is Ryan. This is him 24/7. He does this as a living and is his job and career. He makes armour, weapons, but mostly decorative stuff like doors, fireplace items, and other decoration stuff to put in your house. But none of it comes cheap..

Mahhrat,AskReddit,1389659047.0,"Not me, but a mate's dad when we were younger.

He was a prison guard, and they lived close to the prison (prison provided housing).  

One night, a couple of the local yahoos, who fancied themselves some kind of ""mafia"" were making noise around the shed at the back of his house.  We think they were trying to break in.

Mate's Dad goes down there (his house backed onto bushland) and confronts them.  Punks be mouthy.

Lead punk, not liking the tone of this ""old man"", jumps the fence and gets in his face.

To be fair, mate's dad warned him once to get off his property.  Young punk gets further into face.

Mate's dad picks up the punk - with no apparent effort - and puts him back over the fence.  Grown young man, maybe 70kg.  

You would think that'd give you pause, but this idiot probably didn't want to lose face in front of his mates, so he pulls a pocket knife, jumps the fence again and comes after mate's dad.

Mate's dad armbars the kid, kid drops knife.  Mate's dad picks him up again - while maintaining the arm bar, mind you - and throws him over the fence from maybe 4 feet away from it.

Also, your premise is off.  While there are certainly issues that need addressing, most schools aren't that bad nor is our system on a negative trajectory.  

Most statistics that try to paint an ugly picture through legerdemain, but in the end, more students are learning more material than they were 75, 50, or even 25 years ago.

Furthermore, much of the troubles are actually due to the home life of the students, and thus is not something that could be directly addressed no matter how good the teachers are."

* Shields level 2 is an exceptionally valuable upgrade. It only costs 50 scrape and makes you damage immune to almost half the enemies in sectors 1 &amp; 2.
* Mantis ships almost exclusively use energy weapons. While lvl2 doors are nice boarders are generally less dangerous to a run than enemy ship weapons. Especially in such an early sector where many boarding parties will likely only be a single mantis.
* I have never needed Lvl3 doors. The principle advantage would be making it harder for your doors to be disabled by enemy weapons, but at that point why not just improve engines, shields, and drone control.
* Drone control is more valuable than cloak for two reasons (I mention this because I see you bought cloak and thus your probably could have bought drone control instead):
 - Drone control is cheaper
 - Drone control can stop more missiles if you have a DD1
 - Drone control can be used offensively with the second drone slot
 - Drone control lets you store more equipment drops on your ship

He had chances in drafts, he traded a pro-bowl CB for one who failed miserably, he brought in a FA. Nothing he ever did fixed the position, despite it being the most important to fix.

And let's be honest about Rivers. He's always been very talented. Last year he wasn't borderline awful, he had the 11th highest rating in the league. Nowhere near great, but just above average. This year he massively improved, but I have to wonder how much that has to do with the guy Mike McCoy (the guy who made Kyle Orton look like a decent starter and just left Peyton) as much as it does with Whisenhunt.

By saying you wish they ""dug a little deeper"" down plays the achievements that some of these guys have earned. Affirmative action will demoralize deserving individuals just because they don't fit a demographic.

I never said that, so I don't know what you're getting that from. I don't think Forbes owes it to anyone to name more women than they did; that only 10% of the list is comprised of women reflects real numbers in game development. Which, IMHO, is something that should change, and I think will, but I don't know when.

&gt;However, pitching an idea that has been shown to fail in the past is not going to convince investors to give you money. It is nothing personal, just business.

I really don't know where you're getting this from either. What are you talking about, exactly?

&gt;Everyone has difficulties to work through. Harassment should be dealt with inside the company and with employers; judging an entire community based on a few bad apples is just hypocrisy.

This is not a few bad apples. This is an industry-wide problem.

&gt;There is nothing stopping you, or any other woman from creating a company that markets games to women.

they already exist. They are pretty small contenders, however. The *overall game industry*, which includes the really big companies, is not inclusive of women gamers and is mainly controlled by men. They're not going to make or market games for women when they don't know how, and this leaves a sad lack of representative choices for women gamers.

&gt;So what I am trying to say is that boys play video games cause they are interested and like them, girls (in general) do not play video games cause they are not interested in them. 

This is false. Women and girls do play video games, in general, just not always the same kinds that boys and men do (and which and why is a fair question as well - non-rhetorical, of course). Ironically, to address why is largely due to [marketing fail](http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed). Women aren't going to game when gaming culture is built to look like a boy's club, and won't be as interested when female characters in games are often tit-bouncing novelties obviously aimed at straight dudes. (This is obviously a bigger title problem than small indie, the latter of which is helping to change things slowly.) And, as a game dev on one of the links I posted mentioned, a lot of games that COULD have been done well among women gamers were poorly marketed because those trying to sell it didn't actually put any effort into it because they assume, like you, it'll fail anyway 'cause girls don't game!

You seem to be enforcing the idea that shit is because it is, don't question why. That's too bad."

Gertiel,IAmA,1389659662.0,"I don't think males particularly matters. The last few times I flew, they were randomly screening women and only women. 

The craziest time I was entering through a gate with only your standard metal detector. This was several years ago, and many of the gates at the large airport I was entering didn't have anything further then. Even now, lots don't, or so I am told. I fly out of there all the time and have yet to enter a full body scanner so I guess there's something to it. But I digress. I ended up getting my boobs honked and the whole nine yards. Right in front of a waiting room full of people waiting for a plane that was about to leave. It was all I could do not to yell ""Honk! Honk!"" when she squeezed my boobages. 

They also opened my carry on, rifled it very slightly, and gave it back. As the woman was putting on gloves to honk my boobs, another agent sidled over and spoke to her in Spanish something about ""Yes, check her well. &lt;something I couldn't hear?&gt; al-qaeda &lt;something something&gt;. I think even the TSA agents were mocking checking me, since I was clearly a well-dressed soccer mom sort.

It turned out my plane was the next flight out of the gate right in front of me despite original information saying it was leaving from a gate further down. I sat down and watched the security process for about an hour and a half. For about 15 - 20 minutes after I was seated, only business men in suits passed the checkpoint. This was prior to the special passes for reduced scrutiny, but not one of these men was given any once over of any sort.

After that, it was a random assortment. Not a single one of those who looked like business travelers, whether in full dress dark suit / white shirt or business casual company golf shirt and khaki's received the slightest check. Not one! In fact, in that hour and a half, only two male travelers received the slightest screening beyond removed shoes and metal detector. Every single female, no matter her attire, had her bag rifled and her boobage ~~honked~~ I mean inspected closely. Every. Single. One. 

This included everything from business suited clearly professional women on business trips to a mother with her toddler. They opened and sniffed each of the toddler's made up bottles and took away the bottle of previously-boiled water she had for making more formula if necessary. I saw her throwing out all the bottles they sniffed because the woman had a cold and stuck her nose way down in them. She had to pay for a tea to get boiling water from a coffee pot down the row to make more bottles. Her child cried a good bit of our flight because her bottle was simply too hot for her to drink just yet.

The two guys that got extra inspections? One was a wheelchair-bound diabetic. They gave the guy hell about how much insulin he was carrying. He had enough for the flight plus the next day because he was arriving after 10 pm clear across the US and they refused to let him have it! They suggested he could ship home insulin. In case you aren't aware, insulin usually has to be refrigerated. In fact, since this was before that pen that doesn't need it was released on the market, as far as I know all insulin needed refrigeration. They acted all pissed when he told them just throw it away and then also made him get rid of some of his sharps. He asked for a supervisor, and was refused. They told him the super was busy elsewhere and he'd have to wait locked in an office for 3-4 hours, missing his flight, if he wanted to see a supervisor.

The other guy was dressed really casually in rocker garb and had a lot of obvious tattoos and piercings. They made him remove every one of the piercings and dug through his luggage, but found nothing."

Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1389659695.0,"Japanese is a language with phonetic alphabets-- the spelling of a Japanese word dictates its pronunciation exactly, either it has been romanized, or it remains in its alphabets *kanji* and *katakana*.  It takes some work to learn the Japanese syllables (such as where one syllable ends and where the next begins), but once you have, you can pronounce any Japanese word you can read.  Getting the meaning from it, however, is obviously a bigger challenge.  

Also, Japanese people are no more strict about enunciation than any other culture, so you'll commonly encounter the common word suffix ""-desu"" which would enunciate to ""deh-soo"" but usually sounds like ""des'"" (with a glottal stop for the '-- kind of a vocal halt) or just ""deh'"""

poryphria,kpop,1389659793.0,"This is going to be an essay of everything I've felt about 2NE1 since the release of ""I Love You"".

At this point, since 2NE1 is almost never involved in the actual creative process for their songs, they can't give an actual date on the release...they have to wait for everyone else's approval (and not just the heads in YG).  Which is why I've stopped listening to what the members say about release dates unless they're officially backed by the company with an exact date.  

&gt; ""We want every song to have a video, have a concept and have a message and have the right performance style.""

Do they think they're Beyonce? Beyonce's reason for this concept (and she had already done it before on B'Day to a much lesser degree) was because she was able to focus more on the creative process for this album after she kicked her dad out. 

The fact that they've been around for a long time, especially for a K-Pop group, and only have 1 full-length album is sad (Big Bang only has 2, but their overall discography is HUGE and they've managed to gain success in Japan).  In 2009 2NE1 was a breath of fresh air- I remember when they debuted, and there was no one else like them.  No one had Bom's unique voice (which she ruined with bad singing techniques because YG couldn't get her an adequate trainer) and there were very few female idols who had the charisma/stage presence of CL.  I don't know how Blackjacks can deal with the disappointment of these last few years- if SM/SNSD did the same, I would have stopped being a SONE much earlier.  No wonder CL is going off and making lots of friends; she's realized that she needs to just go and take opportunities.

If WINNER becomes a hit (which I'm sure this group will unless a member does something awful), I don't want to know what's going to happen to 2NE1.  I think what everyone refuses to understand is that 2NE1 is an idol female group, and unlike their male counterparts, they generally have earlier expiration dates.  They're not SNSD, they don't have the wide appeal SNSD does, and if YGent can't hurry up and realize what they want to do with this group, 2NE1 is going to have either a sharp death or a painful slow ride into obscurity once WINNER (and maybe YG's girl group) takes off.

This is the biggest waste of one of the few girl groups in SKorea that knows how to perform with charisma.  They have numerous fans that want to see and hear more and generally their songs are good (I don't think there are any duds on their one album).

edit: Oh, and what about Minzy's solo song?  The one thing I've been looking forward to from YG, other than a Lee Hi comeback, and I doubt that's happening anytime soon."

Elementary:

* Music teacher died in the middle of a school day, about to meet with the Principle. The Principle found him sitting in a chair, passed.

Middle:

* Some idiot brought a BB gun to school and several vest-wearing cops showed up to drag him out.

High School(Where the real stories are):

* Spanish teacher had a water bottle full of vodka and was freely chugging it in class. Students easily smelled it, she was gone the next day.
* Weed arrests weekly. Heroine and Cocaine arrests a couple times a year. On-site officer had the most drug-related arrests in the city, just by searching the athletic lockers(grated doors, you can see contents and search at-will.)
* Someone stole a girl's Pepper Spray canister and managed to explode it in on of the upper floors. Whole school heard it, bomb squad called, SWAT, terrorist invasion, defend our babies, murrrrrrrrrrrca. It smelled like piss, irritated your eyes, and wouldn't wash out for like, four weeks.
* Someone shit *all* over one of the men's bathrooms. Floor, walls, cieling, sink, doors. It was later revealed they accomplished this by taking a massive dump into a trash bag, poking holes in the bottom, and swinging it around. The children are our future.
* A Senior girl overdosed when I was a Sophomore.
* A Senior guy died in a car wreck when I was a Junior.
* A male teacher was hooking up with a female student.
* Lots of making-out, groping, oral, and occasional sex in the stairwell darks.
* A girl tried giving a guy oral *during class* while a movie was playing. The classroom was dark, until the teacher heard commotion and hit the lights. IIRC, the guy was suspended for a long time, and the girl was removed by her parents.
* But my favorite, the Band Director stealing money from the PTA slush fund. This guy was a 40-something, short-with-a-complex, ugly piece of human shit. We in Tech Theatre especially hated him because he stole our equipment without regard. Band was taken seriously at my school, and he got results by just following Hitler's lead. Everybody hated him. The students, the teachers, the parents. So when he made several large purchases(laptop, boat payments, car payments) right around the time the PTA fund lost money, the school investigated. Goddamn it, the few days he worked after being found out were the best of my highschool career. Just everybody glaring at his dumb fucking face, watching him try to even act like he's not completely fired and disgraced, was so, so fucking sweet.

AnyelevNokova,beyondthebump,1389659834.0,"My son's 11 months and doesn't talk. Babbles, sure. We get a lot of mumbled garble that is a mixture of a chirp and some random sound. But the only consistent sounds we get are ""k/gyah-t"" (cat?) and ""babababababa"" (indiscriminate, maybe twice a day.) That's it. He babbled ""mamama"" indiscriminately a few months ago, but only did so for about a week before stopping. We've never heard a ""da"" sound. We encourage him, but 99% of the sounds we get from him are grunts, chirps, fart noises, whining/humming, and of course, lots of crying. You should see him when we tell him no! [He does this maneuver](http://i.minus.com/ibqVAEEx3IkDHp.gif). Total drama queen. We name things, sound out letters, read to him, ask questions, try to have conversations, and repeat names over and over again, but we just get stared at, laughed at, or chirped at. Rarely get an attempt at words back.

We've been told to just be patient; he's advanced everywhere else and is apparently *very* far ahead in terms of motor skills. He hears just fine, and seems to understand a lot of the basics (mama/dada, his name, go ahead, no, stop, come here, dog, cat, baby, milk, food, bed time.) But for whatever reason, he seems completely disinclined to try actual talking and prefers screeching and crying.

So I don't know. I guess I'm just here as a person 5 months down the line saying that I asked the same question when my son was your age, and we've had little progression in terms of actual speaking."

Second, can you bring this up to him? If you want to stay with him, you're going to need to communicate your wants and needs and how his behavior is harming your relationship. Now, for how to bring it up, that's another whole issue. 

Have you made any comments on how it's affecting your sexual relationship or that you'd like him to give you something in return in bed? How did he react? 

I think you should try sitting him and talking about it in a non-accusatory way about how you'd like to have some more relaxed sex and receive more from him in bed. See how he responds. If he's willing to listen and perhaps work on some things and if you see a change (or him trying) in the following days/weeks, then keep at it and keep your communication open. If he either straight away denies his habits are possibly harmful and that he isn't giving you want you want or if he agrees to change but doesn't put in any effort, then you might want to rethink putting more effort and energy into a relationship that you're not getting anything out of.

And for the most part, approaching and making a relationship happen is their role. Females are the choosers, and hardly ever show interest unless they demonstrate their worth. Experience of rejection,, perceived low self-worth, the instinctual desire to obtain a partner, the stigma of being single, the male ego and obsession with not being weak or a failure(being considered good, capable enough), etc. it all adds up for that one even modestly attractive woman who returns your affections to feel *very good*. It feels fantastic. Not like love, it is love. The genuine article. She makes you feel things you don't anywhere else. You will pursue her. You will make sacrifices to get her. I don't want to start to sound misogynistic, but to agree with your account, they won't even stop to consider that she is consciously feeding this stuff to him. Or if not that, than at an unconscious level simply temporarily liking whatever feeling she gets from his company.

If I can insert a personal anecdote, I have had eight friends with problems that goes like ""i fall in love too quickly/ with any woman to show me the time of day"" as well as others with slightly less mild forms of this.

 I think you're also underestimating the fact that most men don't even care how much unsuccessful relationships when added up end up costing them, they just want a successful one. The risk to capital is a non-issue compared to the potential gain of ""happiness"". Beta Men, to generalize, will always take the risk, to capital and resources to subsidize their perceived inherent lack of worth. You're right, it doesn't need to be a stupid naive investment, but most people don't know how to make things safer, fairer, happier, and better for them both overall.

There's also those unhelpful narratives to relationships and dating that reinforce this thinking. ""just be yourself to be successful"" means that when you're stupidly unsuccessful and unwanted compared to your female peers and alpha male peers in the same age-group, it means yourself is just not good enough. In these conditions, you will settle. For anyone. Because you don't know better."

Necron_Overlord,Cascadia,1389659942.0,"&gt;For example: groceries are tax-exempt, prepared meals (fast food, restaurants) are taxed. Gas/fuel is taxed, transit passes shouldn't be taxed. Books shouldn't be taxed, big f**k-off jacked-up trucks should be taxed, automobiles with high mileage shouldn't be taxed.

Like, no tax on books?  What about e-books?  What about kindle e-book readers?  I think Amazon is going to pitch a shit-fit if you try to exempt books but not e-books, and then they'll want you to exempt e-book readers.  That gives them an incentive to lobby, and soon you're right back in the mess of businesses trying to shape tax policy to give them a competitive edge.

Why are meals out taxed, but meals prepared at home untaxed?  Are we punishing people who don't have the time and energy to cook?  I often eat out because I just want to be around people, and don't want to keep large amounts of fresh supplies at my home.  Why am I being punished for not cooking at home?

This is why I support a georgist land use tax and a flat, no deductions income tax.  You start piling on the exceptions, and it just creates motives for bad actors.


&gt;I think businesses/corporations should be taxed on income,

This is such a horrible idea.  It's completely counter-productive.  Taxes on businesses only serve to limit growth and investment.  We should instead be focusing on reforming the businesses environment so that workers have a greater say in the distribution of profits.  Do that, and the government won't be needed to provide so many social services, and the tax burden can be kept very light.

We should not be aiming to create a socialist welfare state in Cascadia, but rather a state based on libertarian socialist values, where working people are empowered to create the institutions they need.

I would much rather have a requirement that 10% of corporate profits be spent on community enhancing projects than tax corporations at all.  Mondragon, for example, operates under such a clause and funds neighborhood medical clinics, schools, and retirement homes out of its profits.

Working towards a system like that, we can bring together both left progressives and anti-government conservatives and move beyond traditional left-right political narratives."

First: managing a whole bunch of dukes is a pain compared to a couple kings. All you have to do is park your chancellor on them and they'll be +100 in no time.


Second, and most importantly: expansion as an empire is much easier than as a king. How do you expand as a king? Duchy by duchy? Barring inheritence that's pretty much your only option. As an empire you can vassalize kings, so to take over a kingdom all you need to do is invite a claimant, give him a county in your primary duchy, press his claim then plot to revoke that county back. When he rebels you revoke his kingdom afterwards and can grant it to someone of your religion and culture or hold it yourself. Bam, you've just annexed a kingdom for free.


Third: larger demesne limit


Fourth and least important: more prestige for holding kingdoms and vassal kingdoms"

Pulling on the cable in the glovebox with pliers is the easiest to start with.  I had to do that once on my 71 standard because the OG cardboard is starting to deteriorate so the lever is not longer fully stationary.  Cutting the hood handle would be a last resort.  

I've seen some not so great front aprons from poor repairs, rot, and wrecks but the hood still opened. Though if you whacked it good enough to create a severe bend or jar the cable loose from the bracket things may get very difficult.  If the hood was hard to close after the spare removal incident and you forced it shut, again, things could be difficult.

Whatever you do, DO NOT cut your hood to get into the trunk. 71 &amp; 72 super hoods are those two years only.  Others don't interchange or fit from later years or from standards because of different shapes.  The last time I had one in nice shape (~2008) it sold in a few hours for $200.

Craylee,AskMen,1389660191.0,"&gt;So it makes me question their attraction towards me. If another guy just needs to just text her to hang out at 3AM to get sex as opposed to me who has to take her on a series of dates to have sex well it makes me wary of whether she is truly attracted to me.

Can I try to give you another perspective on this? 
She wants to take it slow because (hopefully) she does not want to end up being your booty call or you ending up as a FWB/sexual only relationship. That's where the distinction lies; yes, sometimes people want no strings attached sex. However, having sex in a relationship that hasn't turned serious yet could make that budding relationship turn into only about sex and that's what people want to avoid when they make the other person wait. 

Granted, I can't say that's the case for everyone. Some people might string you along using the same excuse or whatever. That's when your judgement comes in about how much effort they're putting in to get to know you better as a person and not just a sexual or monetary object. "

Well the base idea I got from the book [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389077749&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people). You'll probaby find it in your local library if you don't want to buy it. I would definitely recommend reading it though, it's damn good and includes MUCH more than what I'm about to say about many more different and equally interesting concepts. A word of warning, if you've never read a self help book before, always keep in mind that everything written is pure opinion. Be as skeptical as possible when reading it and don't be afraid to disagree.

The book offers the concept that there are base principles, objective concepts that everyone would agree are necessary for a happy and fulfilling life. For example the ideas of *fairness*, *integrity*, *honesty*, *dignity*, *service*(i.e. the idea of making a contribution). Things that EVERYONE no matter their background can agree are important. They may have radically different ideas about how these things can be achieved, but they are all important.

&gt; Principles are the territory. Values are maps. When we value correct principles, we have truth - a knowledge of things as they are.

What does this mean exactly? well it means that you should value these principles, you should apply them to everything you do. You may have a different idea of what fairness and integrity and honesty means to you, but you should stick by it. The point is to **judge yourself based on YOUR understanding of these principles and not anyone elses**.

Another concept the the book talks about is what it calls ""begin with the end in mind"". In this context this means to think about who you want to be at the end of your life. Think about the kind of person you WANT to be, that idea of yourself that, when you're on your deathbed, you can think back and honestly say ""I am the person I've always wanted to be"". Obviously this doesn't mean just superficial goals and dreams, it means thinking about the things you value the most and consistently upholding them. 

One way it suggests doing this in the book is writing a ""mission statement"". This is basically a list of the things most important to you, but layed out in an actionable form. To start dong this literally just write a list of ideas that are important to you. I find writing it in a seriest of short bullet points, one ""value"" in each, to be the best, but its up to you. If you have the time, start this NOW, the more you put it off the less likely you are to do it. Don't worry if this takes lots of time, it should, this is quite a big thing. If you start drawing blanks, think back to situations that have stuck in your mind, difficult choices you've made. Think about what values motivated these decisions. If you think you made the wrong decision, again, think about what values or principles you violated that made you feel it was a wrong decision. Write it ALL down.

For example:

* I think back to the many times I've seen someone upset, asked them what is wrong and tried to help. From this I gather that I value compassion

* There have been many small things like picking stuff up that people have dropped etc. From them I would say I value kindness.
 
* I've known all my life that I value honesty. Not complete and total honesty at all times (I believe honesty is subjective... kinda), just like I don't ALWAYS go out of my way to be kind. But it's still very important to me.

* I also look back at the things I've learned and the process of learnng and what I get out of it. So I value the idea of always being in the process of learning something.

* I think back to stuations where there has been someone that needed someone to talk to, to get something off their chest. I realise I value my ability to listen. Not just hearing sounds but to understand and offer questions and comfort as well.

Try not to read on until you have at the very least 10 written down. You should be able to at least 20 with enough thought.

I'm going to have to write the rest tomorrow unfortunately, I've got an exam in the morning. Sorry :(. 

Edit: I just watched [This Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po5jtOawtls) and think it fits in quite well with this subject.

DERangEdKiller,AskReddit,1389660314.0,"**I'm gonna go really detailed, so skip if you don't want to read a lot.**

In the days of the internet's infancy, I was 14 years old. My bedroom is right next to the downstairs bathroom, and it wasn't unusual to have heavy foot traffic when we have parties.  At the tender age of 14, I was still a virgin, which was kinda rare where I grew up.  At least in the crowds I hung with.

Anyways, one night my older brother had a whole mess of people over, and people were constantly going in and out of the house.  At one point, I heard some girls laughing in there, but I just blew it off.  A couple minutes later I hear a couple soft taps followed by a playful scratching at my door.

I open my door and low and behold it was my older brother's girlfriend, who was 15, drunk as shit.  Now her and I never really got a long well, so the hairs on the back of my neck stood up immediately.  It was like that feeling people describe right before they are struck by lightening.  Everything just seemed really calm, and quite.

Not wanting to be a complete asshole, I let her in and we started talking.  It was typical shit.  ""Wow, so this is your room."", That's a nice stereo D, how's the radio?""  That shit.

She wandered through my room towards my bed and my butthole immediate clenched up in fear as she neared my cabinet.  Oh no.  My porn!

I started to walk towards her to distract her from going through my drawers, but I was too late.  She opened the drawer, and without anything to hide it, she saw a couple of unopened condoms that I had just got, a box of tissue, my jerkin' jorgens, and my penthouse magazines.

She pulled the ""Oh my god.  D, what is all of this?  I never thought you were that kind of boy"" routine.  I was shocked.  As I was about to escort her out of my room and crawl into a ditch somewhere, she became dead weight, and sat on my bed.  Fuck.

Once it was clear she wasn't going anywhere just yet, I just stopped.  All my assertiveness, all of everything that made me me just stopped as she looked up at me with a playful fucking smile.  I had never been  more mortified, and she was fucking having fun with me.  To this day I don't know how, but pretty soon she had me sitting on my bed next to her.

As we sat on my bed, she talked to me about sex, and asked me a lot of questions.  Where did I get the magazines?  How long did I have them?  I honestly just answered the questions.  The best analogy I can think of is when dogs try to establish dominance in the pack, and one will stop when the other has its fangs around a dogs throat.  My brother's girlfriend had her fangs around my throat, and I was too stunned to fight.

I honestly remember very little of the bed conversation.  I only remember the way she was touching my arm, a playful stroking/petting, and her smell.  You know, Norcal girl smell.  The  generic girly smell that seems to also come from the purse of every woman I know, but also cigarettes, a slight sent of alcohol, and that raspberry hand lotion that all the girls from my click used at the time.  To this day every time I smell that smell I get hard, and a little afraid.

While I was getting lost in that smell, she managed to press up against me.  That's right, the first boob I ever had pressed against me in an awkward sexual situation was my older brothers girlfriend, but wait, there's more.

I wasn't really paying attention until her hand moved down my arm, moved back and forth across the back of my hand which was on my knee.  Another thing that comes back to me immediately is feeling her hand through every hair in my arm.  I kind of lost myself in the way she was touching me.

I honestly didn't know what the fuck was going on, and the first thing that popped into my head was my obsessive brother coming into my room looking for her, and seeing this shit, but I didn't know what to do.

Her hand was so warm.  That's what was weird.  Most girls I knew had really cold hands, but hers?  It was almost too warm, yet slightly comforting.  Like wrapping up in a towel right out of the heater after being outside in a chilly, windy thunderstorm.  It felt almost like needles, but only for a second, then it felt really good.

I was awoken from the hypnotic effect of her touch when she slid off the bed, and in front of me.  I immediately locked eyes with her.  I didn't know where to look, and that seemed the safest place.  Well it did until she moved between my legs and started rubbing all around my thighs.  First up towards my waist, then up and around towards the outside of my legs.  Then back to the tops, and down in a gentle raking of her nails.  I knew right then I was in deep shit, and I made the conscious decision that although this was wrong, this is the stuff my adolescent dreams were made of, and I wanted to see how far this would go.  Besides, she was doing all the work, and if my brother did come in, I reasoned it was clearly not me taking advantage of her (honestly It wouldn't have saved me from a beating).


It's safe to assume she took my silence as assent, because not long after that she was tugging on my belt, and about start tugging off my pants when I hear my door open.  With a coy smile to give the Mona Lisa a run for her money, my twin brother's girlfriend who was the same age as my older brother's girlfriend (and with whom she was friends) walked into my room. with a ""Well what's going on in here?"".

That was the moment I freaked.  I stood up, pulled my pants the up, and tried to make them leave.  

Every time I almost got one drunk bitch (and believe me they were bitches) out the door, the other would retreat further into my room.  At one point, I just sat on the ground in frustration while one hung out my bedroom window which has a 7 foot drop, while the other was questioning me about my choice of lotions.  I am thank every day that they are not in our lives anymore."

FOR CHEMICAL BASED LIFEFORMS (life as we know it here on earth):

The chances are very slim. We can make guesses about extraterrestrial life based on life we see on earth, which is carbon based and requires water for all of its vital functions. Water is needed as an ionic solvent in every chemical reaction our body requires, as well as to act as a temperature moderator (because it can store a lot of heat without heating up, it can either act as a heat sink by absorbing a lot of heat from the environment or as a heat source by retaining most of our body heat)

However, there are other solvents as well. Carbon tetrachloride, ethanol, acetone and Hydrogen fluoride can act as organic solvents, but then again most of these solvents themselves are carbon based. There are several solvent alternatives to water that have better properties regarding dissolving chemicals but don't quite have the same thermal properties.

OTHER TYPES OF LIFE: this branches into a whole different topic about whether life functions can be performed without the need of chemical processes and can be substituted by simple physical processes (for example: storing energy from radiation in chlorophyll via photosynthesis could directly be substituted by the photoelectric effect so lifeforms can manufacture their own energy). 

So in short, we could have life forms that don't need water and can replace water by other chemical solvents. Also, we could have lifeforms that don't need water at all since their basic metabolic functions aren't based on chemical reactions."

Mahhrat,AskReddit,1389660495.0,"To answer your question, you can't.  If being around kids, engaged with kids etc isn't doing it for her, nothing will.  If you were to engage in some kind of manipulation of her feelings, you run the significant risk of her wondering whether she ever really wanted the kids to begin with.

I've gone the other way.  My daughter is nearing 15 now, from my first wife.  That's it for me; I've no interest in having another one.

My current wife doesn't have children and is significantly younger than me (closer to your age).  I've been straight up with her though; I'm not having any more children.  She knew this before we got married (which was almost a year back now), and late last year I had a vasectomy, which pretty much rules me out for good.

In saying all that, if my wife decided one day that she wanted to leave me and have children, then I wouldn't try to stop her, because my daughter is amazing and the entire experience of watching her grow up has been an enormous part of my life.

If I can give you any advice from all this, it's to be open with your girlfriend.  Talk to her, tell her what you think.  If you can't come to agreement on this, then it's up to you to decide if your lifestyle is worth changing for the sake of a child, remembering that that child will never be your girlfriend's but another girl you'd have to meet and be similarly in love with.

If I had to guess though, someone who views a child as a parasite isn't likely to want children."

A wedding serves as an opportunity both to announce this joining and have the two families meet.  Extended family and close family friends attend to witness the event themselves and give you blessings.  In many ways, it is as much an act for the greater families as it is for the people getting married.

Furthermore, for most of the people in your extended family (the various grandparents, uncles, cousins, and family friends), this may be the only time meeting anyone in your spouse's family.  

Anyways, if it isn't your thing, that is fine.  Especially if you aren't interested in children, the need to become a single family unit is not as important."

That probably applies to many other careers but can definitely hold true with us. Integrity of our work is something that we take pride in. While installing or troubleshooting equipment we stay alert and are always thinking. Being introverted can be a okay, but coordination between coworkers is essential. However, I do feel at times I'm in my own head, making sure and judging my own work. Those attributes are one thing but being hands on and being able to work with power tools safely is most important. Anyway, I love the career I got into and could be great career for you too.

missus_b,TryingForABaby,1389660839.0,"Here's what I can answer based on my visit to the RE in Kirkland that I PM'd you a while back:

* B6 helped me zilch, although I've only been taking it 3 months.
* There's no rush to hit up the RE, unless you desperately need the peace of mind (I did). That particular practice was no trouble at all to schedule (got in within a week of calling) when the other two big practices in the greater Seattle area had a wait of 2-3 months. 
* They had my husband register his info, but did not request a workup at all for him. We have no reason to suspect his swimmers are anything but great. They did not charge him or anything (which was my concern--he's on different health insurance). He was going to go to my appointment, but something came up.
* My intake was a long, comfortable conversation with the RE himself. No needles, no pressure, just an evaluation of my history, an explanation of what might be causing my issues, and a description of the many plan options. Granted, my LPD looked like a ""textbook low progesterone"" case, so this doctor felt 100% comfortable in his plan of action.

Overall, I think the best part of the experience was to feel validated that my cycle *isn't* normal, and the relief I felt when the RE told me he felt confident it could be fixed. He was horrified that an OBGYN said ""come back when you've had multiple miscarriages."" He feels that if he can prevent me from having even one, it's worth it."

Most people use comparisons to other countries or previous test performance, but those statistics are not fair.  

In comparison to other countries, we have dropped in ranking in large part to other countries catching up since the 1950s.  Furthermore, the earlier statistics of ours often did not include segregated schools.  Finally, there is a question as to whether students in those countries are actually learning more, or are just being taught methods (rote memorization) better for taking tests, but not critical thinking.

As for previous performance, two completely different tests covering significantly different material can't be compared.  It is like saying students are getting dumber because the average 12th grader gets a 75 in Calculus while they got a 85 in basic Algebra 20 years ago.

Anyways, simply look at the incredible increase in the number of students attending and graduating college today compared to decades ago.  Doesn't that hint that perhaps we are becoming more educated on the whole, not less?"

Smark_Henry,AskReddit,1389661120.0,"Well, there was one teacher at my high school who had three last names in a single semester because she divorced, took her old last name back, and then married a new man and took his last name. The new man was the male science teacher she shared a backroom with. (It was a small room that was connected by their classrooms.) They would disappear in there for easily thirty minutes at a time and everyone KNEW they were banging in there.

There was also another science teacher who would get high in his backroom. He would occasionally seriously do this with students.

There was the band director who was hooking up with a sixteen-year-old student, too. I don't mean after hours either, they'd go in his office together and lock the door.

Those all probably SHOULD have been scandals... but nope, everyone just seemed to sorta accept these things.

We also had annual ""race wars"". Seriously. The redneck kids would ride their tractors to school and bring in rebel flags and antagonize the black students and fights would break out. Everyone would know the day the rednecks were going to do this well in advance and teachers and security guards would post up by the entrance to try to stop things as soon as they started.

But the SCANDAL probably involved the two gangs in our school. We had crips and bloods in our black students and they took this VERY seriously... despite being in a small town in the Southeast. Also our crips wore black instead of blue for some reason. Anyway, they kept fighting, and one day the Principal came over the intercom and summoned all black students to the lunchroom. Already, this can't end well, right? Well, the Principal told the assembled students that, because of the fights, *no one black could wear red or black anymore*. By the way, our school's colors? Red and black. Yeah, the ACLU got called in on that one, so that probably counts as the big scandal."

4LostSoulsinaBowl,nfl,1389661145.0,"&gt; Playing on ice skates is incredibly difficult when combined with stick handling. 

Absolutely it is. I could never do it. I played roller hockey as a kid, and my ankles would be killing me the next day. I wouldn't last 5 minutes out there. I won't deny the skills of Crosby, Ovechkin, Lemieux, Gretsky, Orr, Hull, etc. But what I don't like about it is that, because of how difficult puck handling is and how hard it is to maintain perfect control on ice skates, it *looks* sloppy. 

I wouldn't want to watch someone perform on the uneven bars of they were 5 feet apart and people were constantly missing jumps or struggling to excel. When I watch other sports, I'm amazed at how they make something so difficult look so easy. When I watch hockey, all I see is something that is so incredibly difficult to do. That's it. 

I will freely admit that I don't like hockey, and therefore I tend to belittle it. These are my opinions on the game. I will not deny the athleticism necessary to compete, but I will deny the enjoyability of watching it.

One last thing: I was surprised by your statement that there ""is usually one fight every couple games,"" so I looked it up. You're absolutely right. It's about 40% of games. My overestimation stems from the fact that I don't watch hockey, and whenever I see highlights of games, all they show is the fights. In my extremely biased and misinformed opinion, this is because there's nothing impressive about the rest of the game."

The eli5  answer is that a force exerted from a center-point gets progressively weaker the further away you go.  It's essentially the opposite of why levers work so well for moving things. In that case, the longer a lever the less force is needed to turn/move whatever is at the fulcrum.  Working the other way in the case of a tire, the force output from the center gets weaker the further away from the hub you get. "
audreyshake,AskWomen,1389661213.0,"I don’t think there really is a fixed age for girls. I have friends and relatives who’ve been masturbating to orgasm since they were in diapers, and others who didn’t figure it out until they were in their twenties. Boys, on the other hand, almost always seem to start masturbating during adolescence. I know Ms. Hite (famous for *The Hite Report on Female Sexuality*) argued that, unlike in boys, puberty in girls is a purely reproductive—not sexual—stage.¹

I’ve also never seen anything to suggest that masturbating at a young age is harmful in any way; I think it’s great that some people are comfortable exploring and taking pleasure in their bodies early on, and I speculate that it’d lead to healthy sexual habits later in life as well.

__

1. *See* Shere Hite, *The Hite Report on the Family: Growing Up Under Patriarchy* 349 (Grove Press 1995) (1994) (“Since girls can masturbate to orgasm from the age of five or so, while boys reach full orgasmic capacity (with ejaculation) only at puberty, is puberty really misnamed when applied to girls? Has Freud made too much of it, basing it on a male model? It is the beginning of girls’ reproductive capacity, not their sexuality.”)."

xSolcii,AskReddit,1389661218.0,"That's okay :) It's a really strange story.

I have some mental issues due to a long history of bullying. I take medication for anxiety and other stuff since the age of 13. I started dating my boyfriend(and father of my daughter) at 16, but had been taking birth control pills for some time before that(even before being sexually active). Never had I been told that my medication for my mental health issues and my BC pills clashed, even when I had asked, so I thought it was fine to have sex without a condom(was told by my mom and by my gyn that it was fine if neither of us had STDs and were monogamous). Just a few weeks after my 17th birthday, I got pregnant.

Now, abortion is illegal in my country. So, after finding out, we spoke to both our parents, my therapist and my psychiatrist. Everybody was upset, but the doctors were visibly worried - because of the amount of meds I took, my baby would have very severe birth defects. Spina bifida, several underdeveloped organs, mental retardation, baby could even have more than two arms or two legs! Boyfriend and I were really worried and sad. After talking it through with everybody, we decided on abortion. An aunt had a friend that could get me some (very pricey and illegal) abortion pills. I took them, and had a horrible night, with cramps, bleeding and a lot of crying, while my boyfriend and my mom held my hands.

The next day the bleeding hadn't stopped and my mom took me to the ER, where we were told I had 'miscarried'. They did several ultrasounds and there was nothing inside me. We were relieved, and we were sad, but we understood this was the correct choice. I had several visits to the gyn, some more ultrasounds, and everything was perfect.

Some months later, my period hadn't come back. I took a pregnancy test and it immediately showed I was pregnant. I freaked out, how could I be pregnant? We were really careful and had only had sex a handful of times since the abortion. Thinking that if I was pregnant I could only be a few weeks along, we decided to abort again. But this time I didn't bleed and didn't cramp. It was weird and it was like the pills didn't work. We freaked out for a couple of days until we found a place where I could get an ultrasound(since everywhere else turned me away).

I was already 18 weeks along and the fetus was perfectly healthy. No extra limbs, no weird defects. Every test I had after that just confirmed it - it was going to be a perfectly healthy baby. And it was, but I was scared my whole pregnancy anyway. The only bad thing was that she was born three weeks early. I still went to school, until the day before breaking waters, haha.

She's really healthy, and beautiful. She's short like me, has my big eyes and her dad's nose. She's 1 and already speaks quite a bit. She dances and makes weird faces. Yeah... I completely adore her :P But I'd never tell her that we didn't want her at first."

nostalgicBadger,AskMen,1389661266.0,"&gt; You post and don't give a fuck about your karma. 

It isn't always about karma. Upvotes draw more attention to a comment, whereas downvotes bury it, and this heavily influences discussion. Furthermore, even though people aren't supposed to up/downvote based on whether or not they agree with a statement, we all know that some, if not most people do, so an abundance of up or downvotes implies general approval or disapproval of the stated position. Suppose, for example, somebody came in here and asked ""do you men prefer blondes or brunettes?"". One guy says ""blondes"", another says ""brunettes"", then SRS show up and mass downvote ""blondes"". To the OP, it's going to appear that men in here strongly dislike brunettes. 

So yeah, some people really do care about their karma, but the primary point of up/downvoting isn't to provide imaginary internet points; it influences the conversation and implicitly conveys popular opinion (which is probably why the only Unpopular Opinion Puffins that make it to the front page are almost never unpopular opinions)."

Smith- released

Thomas- probably released, maybe re-signed cheaply

Strief- probably re-signed cheaply, maybe released

Hill- re-signed cheaply. He did well for us this year as our 3rd stringer.

Herring- released or re-signed cheaply. He was special teams captain.

De la Puente- re-signed. We don't have a backup plan, and he's on the brink of a pro bowl.

Graham- re-signed. We aren't going to let him go, are you crazy?

De la Puente is a very good center in our system, we're better off re-signing him than weakening our struggling line by replacing him with someone new. Strief quietly played pretty well at RT, but could be upgraded. Armstead actually finished strong at LT, but I could see him moving to the right side if we draft a LT early.

I agree that we could use some young receivers. I think drafting someone in the middle or late rounds (like we did with Stills) would be a good idea. Meachem may stay on for depth, assuming he'll play for peanuts.

I think Brees has 3 or 4 years left, depending on how well we protect him and how we do in the playoffs. I think he's definitely playing for 2 more years, but beyond that if we win a Superbowl he'll go out on a high note. He'll definitely be talking to Sean Payton about it and they'll have a plan. Honestly, I think we sign a veteran in free agency if we don't get a shot at the top QB's in the draft."

SixWinged,gainit,1389661565.0,"Vaguely overthinking. Creatine (essentially) fills your muscles with water, hence you need to drink more water than usual.

Drinking more water doesn't mean you can't also eat more food, although it makes you feel more full it doesn't have any calories, and that full feeling doesn't last long. I guess it's recommended for people trying to lose weight as it stops you snacking/overeating if you drink water instead of raiding the pantry.

As far as creatine helping weight gain: you'll put on a good 2-3kg in water weight within a few days of taking creatine, but this doesn't really count as real weight as you'll also lose it within a few days of cycling off creatine. Having said that, the extra water weight allows you to lift a bit heavier or push out an extra couple of reps.

Think of it this way: if you take creatine, you'll gain and then subsequently lose about 2-3kg of water weight, but you'll also gain an extra bit of muscle as a result of being able to work out a little better. This, in my opinion, means creatine and weight gain definitely go hand in hand."

MightySasquatch,gaming,1389661624.0,"&gt; To get practically free or early wonder rushes just wait and get one or two researches and camp ruins.

You don't get to choose the tech though. It can easily give you trapping as it could give you writing, even then if you don't have a heavy production city you still can't get the wonder. Even if you get the wonder it's not always worth it, in fact most early wonders are kind of a waste to rush (except Great Library, and Petra in the right situation).

&gt; My gripe with the culture Nerf is that the best strategy still is to go tradition and free worker with liberty. 

I very heavily disagree with this. Tradition opener into liberty doesn't get you the worker any faster than straight liberty. Do you finish tradition from there normally? I would recommend in most situations finishing either liberty or tradition before diversifying, the finisher for both of those is quite strong and it's good to get that as fast as possible. Depending on your civ Piety can be ok as well. Honor tends to be a second option for culture rather than a first.

I also don't think half the tree is worthless for most of the trees. They have some less powerful cultural options but they're all pretty good (if situational) in my opinion.

El Dorado is pretty imbalanced in general, agreed. It would be nice for an option to turn it off. Also the gold bonus from El Dorado doesn't scale with the speed of the game like it should. On Standard El Dorado only buys a Settler (or two with Isabella).

&gt; Dont get me wrong, I love this game. But some of the balance needs to be addressed.

I agree with this, I think it's pretty well balanced, with some issues than need to be addressed."

But does she know that the reason diets don't work is because they're hard to stick to, not because fat people are incapable of losing weight?

canopusvisitor,explainlikeimfive,1389661636.0,"Monogamy as we know it today is mostly the result historically from land and farm ownership I believe. It relates to being able to determine how much effort people place on relationships in order to protect their potentially limited resources during hard times. 


Back in the day when resources were more limited it was useful to know who was having sex with who because then you knew who the parents were a bit more and hence could focus on preparing the field or cattle or whatever. I think it you look up monogamy on wikipedia it would give a few background pointers. 

But today we don't have farms so much but rather social status and placement within society. So overt cheating is frowned upon because it tends to say you are not contributing to that socio-economic community."

I applied for masters programmes and just had to show that I would be at the right level before the start of the term. I'm not at TU, but the process should be the same (you can email their intl. office). Once you get the letter of acceptance, you go back to Ausländerbehörde and convert the visa into a 2 year study visa which allows 180 half days or 90 full days of work per year (good luck finding soething though). You also get 18 months after graduation to find a job. One thing I had to show when getting the visa was health coverage in Germany. It was difficult because you need a bank account to sign up and no banks would deal with me as a US citizen without residence permit (IRS has tightened restrictions on intl. deposit accounts to combat tax evasion). As far as apartments go, it's gonna be tough. I spent 3 months looking for a suitable place in a good location with a fair rent.

Realizing your parents' flaws I think is a big part of becoming an adult. By high school I felt like I needed to help my parents financially, but more than that I felt like I needed to help take care of them in general. My dad got really sick, both of my parents are depressives. I had to be the stable one.

At 18 I was young and energetic. None of this bothered me. I could get up at 5, go to work,  go to school, go to work, do homework, go to sleep. Over time it wore me out... I grew so bitter. Not having my parents to help me transition into adulthood, my transition has been long and messy. I feel behind. I'm still doing dead-end jobs because it's the quickest way to get money. I couldn't afford internships and stuff. Or more importantly, I *told* myself I couldn't afford to do them. I was afraid to invest in myself. I developed a deep jealousy of my friends who are able to rely more on their parents. So yeah, I matured early but I feel like I haven't matured much since high school. I've become a big baby, feeling sorry for myself and whatnot. Now I look at my friends and I realize, sure they are immature in the sense that they rely a lot on their parents, but they are also taking charge of their lives in a way that I am not.

TofuRobber,changemyview,1389661904.0,"&gt;I thoroughly believe that due to the fact that humans are a part of nature, every human action is a part of the process of evolution. Therefore, if a certain species becomes endangered, it happens because it was unable to adapt to its current environment, which of course involves humans.

If human action is a part of nature and a process of evolution then humans preventing extinction of endangered species is just as much a part of evolution.

&gt;Furthermore, i hold that the sensivity towards the various species which face extinction is hugely subjective.

I agree. But what does that have to do with human intervening in animal extinction.

&gt;I find that the motive behind protecting endangered species, derives partly from the arrogancy of our species, which suggests that we have disturbed natural selection and altered nature irreversibly, while in reality natural selection works through our every action.

Again, if humans caused their extinction and you deem it acceptable, why is it not also acceptable that humans are trying to save them. 

At the core, your argument is flawed. If you disagree with humans trying to save animal species then you have to give a better reason than, humans are a part of nature so if they become extinct because of humans that's their fault."

zataks,amateur_boxing,1389661937.0,"This post or something similar comes up all the time.  Normally I ignore them but seriously now.  You're asking a question about what kind of shape you need to be in to go into a gym and start asking questions about training or lessons?  Just get your ass in there and ask.  If they think you are hopeless they'll tell you to get out.  But I've never seen that in ANY gym.  

You're not starting a training camp for a Pay-per-view prize fight; you're a noob taking noob classes at a gym that, more than likely, no one has ever heard of.  Quit putzing around on the internet and get in there. 
Running 4 miles non-stop is irrelevant.  30 consecutive pushups does not matter.  No one cares that you fucked the prom queen or make 250 grand a year.  You will get your rear handed to you in ways you didn't realize possible.  That may happen in the ring or that may happen your first day inside the gym.  It happens to everyone at some point and it feels great as long as you can learn from the experience. 

If you don't want to get in the ring, don't.  It's your choice and, even though you have a trainer in your corner, you're in there alone.  Except for that other guy.  But he's not going to give you the kind of help you'll be wanting.  It's okay to get in the ring one and decide it's not for you.  It's okay to never step into the ring.  

I've trained with golden glove contenders and professional fighters alike.  Some of them used to be fat.  Some of them still are. I've trained with old men that look like walking is a challenge.  But I wouldn't fuck with them.

TL;DR: just go to the gym and check it out.  If you can get to the gym, you are in good enough shape."

nostalgicBadger,AskMen,1389662010.0,"First of all, I use Pinterest all the time -- I think it's an awesome tool. I develop web applications for a living, and while I'm primarily a back end and sometimes Javascript developer, I don't always have the luxury of working with a full time designer, so I often have to build the layout as well. If I see a great UI concept, color scheme, font set, etc. that I like and might want to borrow from in the future, I pin it, and I follow people who I notice have similar taste, so there's always inspiration available if I'm stuck. It's a lot more convenient than bookmarking all those pages, especially because of how often links break or the website gets a redesign.

That said, when I first signed up for Pinterest, I did it through Facebook, and it automatically subscribed me to all my Facebook friends with Pinterest -- which, as you could probably guess, were nearly all women, so my feed was initially composed of deserts, shoes, wedding dresses, crafty decorations, etc. If that's most guys' first impression of Pinterest, I can understand turning away from it."

They didn't even have any of the footprint rugs or any extra tables for doing the extra body inspections and extra luggage inspections visible, and we didn't see one person have their luggage or person checked. They had plenty of security lines so that even though the place was wall-to-wall people since it was spring break, we were able to just walk slowly through at a pace similar to relaxed window shopping through a street of shops the entire time.

AbusingVitaminK,AskReddit,1389662094.0,"Elementary school (after I left): Got a letter that my favorite gym teacher, and friend of the family, died in a train crash. I was already pretty upset about it--he used to pull me out of gym to send e-mails to another friend of the family and joke around with me; I think he knew I hated gym and the other kids picked on me. Wasn't until years later when my parents thought I could handle it that they told me he stepped in front of the train on purpose, right after one last visit to that same family friend I would e-mail with him, and he was ""acting off"" and ""sad"" and dropped off a six-pack of beer, their shared favorite (they were best friends). Really messed me up. I'm sure a lot of my former classmates don't even know it was a suicide; the only reason my family knew was because he was close to us.

Middle school: Nothing. An uneventful two years.

Junior high: The details might be wrong, but from what I gathered, this girl had a major crush on this guy in seventh grade. He rejected her in what must have been a really humiliating way, because she later came to school with a knife hidden in a wrapped present box and stabbed him in the back in the French room right before school started. I was in the Spanish room right next door. The boy's fine, now, and I'm not sure about the girl but I know she had to go to another school.

High school: Huge drug bust after I left (when I was a freshman in college; I had a few senior friends in high school to tell me about it if I didn't read the news). Apparently nobody realized they signed a form stating that their phones are liable for inspection at the beginning of the year. Lots of weed dealing, but I'm not sure if there was anything more than that. I'm from a rich white northern suburb, so it's possible. Then our openly gay dean was fired for inappropriate text conversations with a male student. They apparently weren't sexual in nature, just too friendly.

Go to class. Seriously. Just fucking go.

Also, do the homework, and assignments. In elementary school your teachers chased you and harassed you to do your work. High school, some teachers might. Some might try and be ""getting you ready"" for University. Those teachers will set and due date for your essay and if you missing. Tough shit.

Feminists only fight for women to have high power positions, they care about CEO disparity but not about blue collar disparity, they care about false wage disparities but not real world data on work related death for mean because men having a higher work related death rate does not harm women so it is a disparity they care nothing about, it isn't about equality it is about fixing these pin point issues they truly believe as an ideology and claim oppression from fictitious forces.

TimDaEnchanter,ProRevenge,1389662477.0,"And this is likely the best possible outcome.  There is also the possibility that the man is actually a real jerk, and is a possessive pedophile.  This person may not even care if they hurt other people, caring only about themself.  When it becomes clear to them that they were betrayed by one that called herself a friend, and that person is friends with the original woman he was sexting, then he might get a bit angry and become violent.  

Sure, this violence may be able to get him put in jail, but at what cost?  At a hair salon, there are many sharp objects the man could grab to stab someone with, or he could just use brute strength and attack them.  An angry man who (potentially) doesn't care about society/laws would be willing to do a lot of harm to people that he doesn't like.  Sure, once other people notice him getting violent, they will likely step in to help, but if it is just the two women from the story that confront him initially without any backup, then at least one of them will probably be injured.  If the man gets really angry and violent quickly, he could likely break an arm or do something else painful before anyone is able to step in and subdue him.

Granted, this is assuming that the man is much more violent and unstable than he is likely to be, but the situation must be considered.  However, if you mention anything about blackmailing him, there is a fairly large chance that he will either get violent, or something else undesirable to get revenge for being betrayed.

TL;DR:  No matter what the guy's initial attitude is, confronting him like this will make the situation a disaster for everyone involved.  Also, if the confrontation is as public as this would be, good luck concealing the whole sexting thing."

With our corner situation, it's likely that Malcolm Jenkins and Roman Harper get cut in favor of having Vaccaro and Robinson at the safeties. Malcolm went from CB to safety, why can't Patrick do that, too. We have Keenan, White, and hopefully Greer won't be a shadow of his former self come next season. If he is, we'll also have Sweeting who, with a little bit of coaching, could turn into a damn good CB.

Also, we'll get back Victor Butler. We never really got a chance to see what he could do in Rob's scheme, but if he can set the edge as a versatile OLB, he will be a welcomed addition.

Also, we'll have Haralson to think about. He might not be re-signed (since we only signed him to a one year deal), but I think he did enough and had enough of an impact on games that we will at least entertain the idea of bringing him back.

I also have old ones from my teenage years around the same area and my inner thighs. The best and cheapest way to help them blend in quicker is vitamin E cream, which you can get from any chemist for under $10.

But in the end, anyone worth their salt won't judge you for stretch marks, and I honestly wish we had more visibility for them so we could remove the sting of something that really *isn't* a sign of being fat - I had stretch marks in my teens when I was 125lbs and 5'10""."

Omega037,changemyview,1389662530.0,"Education standards for most school systems (i.e., *what* they teach you) are generally determined by the government, not the teachers.  

With the recent movement towards ""[Common Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative)"", you will be seeing these standards increase greatly.

What I really think is going on is that you have a biased view based on your own anecdotal experience.  You have particular teachers that you have disliked or thought were ineffective, and have generalized this to a problem everywhere.  

Worse, you are likely suffering from confirmation bias, where you are only looking for bad teachers, and then from that saying most teachers are bad.

I think if you look back at your time in K-12, you will notice that there were a few bad teachers, a few good teachers, and a bunch of average teachers.  I think if you look at pretty much any field, you will notice a similar, Gaussian distribution of performance."

cavalier2015,askseddit,1389662562.0,"It's quite a story, but I'll give you the cliff-notes. This was my first semester at college. My first week of college I met a girl named Amy after one of my classes. I saw her again at a party later that night and got her number. We hung out and immediately I knew she was something special and I started to really like her. 

Fast forward a bit, this is the first night we plan to go out and party together. I had prepared to potentially bring her back to my place, so I got the materials needed to make a mojito as kind of a hook (it was quite a feat as a freshman). Well, I meet up with her before we go out. We take some shots and she insists I see her room, so we see it briefly then leave to go out.

We have a great night out, dancing, talking, playing pong, etc. On the way back to dorms I ask her if she wants to come to my room to make some mojitos. She agrees. We make some delicious tasting mojitos and had a lot of fun doing so. My roommate comes back and sees us and makes up some bullshit excuse to leave and give us some privacy. I end up getting the lights off by showing off my new laser pointer (it was actually cool, haha).

So here's the situation I'm in right now. I just had a great night out with a girl I like. We're both drunk, sitting on my bed in the dark, finishing some mojitos, with complete privacy, and....nothing happens. I spent the whole time talking and kept freezing up whenever I thought of making a move. Finally, at 3am, she excused herself and went home.

I sat downstairs on the couch by my roommate with my face in my hands full of regret. I still regret it today. I grew to really like this girl and 2.5 years later I'm still getting over her. A lot happened between us between that night and now, but we never hooked up and I always wonder what would have happened..."

CapOnFoam,TwoXChromosomes,1389662569.0,"BOOKS!! After my separation (which led to divorce), I immersed myself in books, and they helped SO MUCH. 

I want to recommend two books to you:

1. [The Verbally Abusive Relationship](http://www.amazon.com/The-Verbally-Abusive-Relationship-recognize/dp/1440504636/)
2. [Victory over Verbal Abuse](http://www.amazon.com/Victory-Over-Verbal-Abuse-Reclaiming/dp/1440525803/)

Both are by Patricia Evans.

Then, I want to recommend a book that will help teach you what a healthy relationship looks like, the minimum you deserve from a partner, and how to talk to a partner openly and effectively.

[The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work](http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Principles-Making-Marriage-Work/dp/0609805797/) by John Gottman. This book is incredible. It helped me understand what healthy relationships look like. And, it helped me understand why ""I"" statements really aren't that effective. And what to do instead.

If you use Kindle, take advantage of the Notes, Highlight, and Bookmark features. If you read on paper, use a notebook when you read to mark pages, thoughts, insights, and emphasis. Use a journal to recall your thoughts and reflect on them. It's ok to dwell momentarily - reflect on the experience, understand it, and move past.

Best of luck to you. "

Don't worry, Calgary can fix that. :)

As far as Transit goes...I take it everyday to work, from the central NW suburbs to downtown.  Honestly, the vast majority of days things go off without a hitch.  The bus arrives on time and gets me to my destination in a reasonable amount of time.  When it goes wrong, it is frustrating.

One caveat though...Calgary Transit is largely designed to move large volumes of people from the suburbs to the downtown during morning and evening rush hour and it does that pretty well.  Trying to get to and from other destinations can be a real problem though.

Your best bet is to find a place close to the LRT or a major (and regular) bus route that can get you where you need to go."
beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1389662597.0,"This is how it usually goes down:

Join game. Everyone is nice. Have a lot of fun. Run into an asshole. Okay, whatever. Run into another. Okay, fine. Run into a lot. Meh. Keep playing, game is still fun. Invest a lot of time in game. Get to the point where you have to work with other people to advance. Find absolute shitbeast of a person -- someone who threatens to find you in real life, kill you, and rape your corpse. PMs you regularly. Report his trolling, he makes more accounts. You tell the people you're playing the game with that you're not cool with so-and-so's harassment. They give you some line about being oversensitive. You deal with it. It escalates. You complain less and less. Every time you complain, everyone mentions that you're no fun. Eventually, nobody wants to play with you because of your reputation of being no fun. You can't advance any further. Harassment has escalated. People who disapprove of your offense to original harassment are now harassing and black-listing you. Game isn't fun anymore. You quit.

Is that actively hostile to women in the way that openly ""lol, girls are bad gamers, let's not invite them to the he-man-woman-hater's-club"" misogyny is? No. But it gets *the exact same result* in the long run: women leaving a game.

Some guilds, GMs, clubs, whatever are way better than others in nipping harassment in the bud. But most will label you ""attention whore"" or ""no fun,"" regardless of how bad the harassment actually is, and then shun you. "

ju2tin,China,1389662665.0,"Congratulations on the record and an epic trip.  Just curious, what are the rules Guinness applies for evaluating attempts to break this record?  For example:

-- Can you ride the same road more than once?  Is there any limit on how many times?  As an extreme example, if I just went back and forth on the same short stretch of road until I exceeded your mileage, would that ride, although very boring, nevertheless break the record?

-- How long of a break from riding can you take -- e.g., do you have to ride every day, and if so, how far?  And if you can take ""rest days"" when you don't ride at all, how many in a row can you take before Guinness deems you to have stopped your first ride and started a new one?

-- If you leave the country and return, doesn't that terminate your record attempt?  You mentioned trying to cross into Russia at some point; wouldn't that have made the ride no longer all in a single country?

-- Are you allowed to transport your motorcycle by ferry or other form of transportation at any point during the trip?

-- If your motorcycle breaks down, can you switch to riding a different motorcycle?

-- Does Guinness have any other rules that might not be obvious?

E2DsIE,AskReddit,1389662804.0,"My school surprisingly had some pretty interesting events


This kid stole one of the carts they used to pick up trash and ended up pinning his leg against the wall of a building and basically severed it off, this was a week before graduating.


One of the baseball coaches ended up getting arrested for having a bunch of coke in the back of his truck


The soccer coach at our school slept with one of my good friend at the time's mother who was married. Parents ended up divorcing. 


There was also the cheerleader whose nudes and 3 second video of her doing some sort of naked shower tease got out to the entire school. Her parents had the audacity to say ""thank god hes not my kid"" when i got busted for fighting, as they were walking into the principals office to deal with their daughter lol"

azayii,Fantasy,1389662810.0,"The book is a lot less noir than the film. The film concentrated on the action, but the book is a lot more bleak than that. The book and the film are totally different, and I think the things left out of the film are what makes Do Androids interesting.

I would also recommend Flow My Tears the Police Man Said, also by Dick. It's gritty but less cold than Do Androids, and easier to read, in my opinion."

I mean normally I could have sex three times a day and *still* want more. The minute I get my period--nothing. The minute it is done however my horniness returns. 

In fact that is the only way I have ever been able to track my otherwise completely irregular period. And thanks to my birth control I can count on one hand the number of times I have had a period since I was 16. "

kempff,Catholicism,1389662884.0,What triggered my remark was the fact you sometimes say more than one rosary a day. Be careful about piling on the devotions on your own initiative. Having input from a second person can keep you on the straight and narrow in ways you may not be aware of.

thelittlestsquid,AskReddit,1389662891.0,"To add on to what the other commenter said: I majored in math, and many of our tests were take-home. This was because we had to come up with proofs for theorems we hadn't been taught. We were not allowed to consult with anyone, but we could use textbooks and notes, as those contained the building blocks for the proofs we had to write. Math takes a surprising amount of creativity, putting theorems we've learned together in order to prove something we hadn't."

stln00b,funny,1389662925.0,"&gt; And I'd wager that those were isolated cases

Ah yes, you get fondled *daily*.

&gt; in which friends were joking with you

No, walking in to a bar and having dick grabbed by someone I did no know has happened. As well as having my ass grabbed by men and women that I didn't know.

&gt; Also, given that this was likely an invited or casual thing, had you said ""stop"", they would have.

Actually, I broke up with my last girlfriend for fondling me in my sleep, fuck you very much.

&gt; First off, do you have proof that women were reporting the friend kissing them on the cheek as ""forced kissing""? 

You know what, I will concede this to a point. I can't find the actual questionnaire, and I'm willing to bet you can't either.

&gt; Second, if it was unwanted physical contact, it was still forced kissing, sorry.

Context is key, just like context clues in reading.

&gt; Ahh, ""NO! YOU'RE THE BIGOT!"" I love seeing that, because it's proof that the one spouting it is beaten...

Uhhhh...ok?

&gt; It's being framed in a gendered fashion because it was originally presented by you in a gendered fashion

But it's not a *gendered issue*! What part of that can you not understand? Shitty people do shitty things to other people. Sadly, men are conditioned to take it as a compliment while women get a pussy pass.

&gt; Believe me, I wish you SRSSucks antifeminist types could see male sexual victims as something more than a statistic to try and stop discussion of female sexual assault

My first rape was when I was 4 years old. Go fuck yourself. The problem that I have with Feminists is that they *don't* give a fuck about male rape victims. Not even a little bit.

If I ever *once* saw a Feminist stand up and say ""Men are raped too"" and not get accused of 'what about the menz!'ing, I might be convinced that Feminists actually give a shit about men. Sadly, they don't. They care about women first and all others second.

Take your sorry bullshit back to the Fempire. You, as a person, are fucking disgusting."

* Saved some money by getting the i5 4570 instead.

* Grabbed you a much better GTX 760 model

* Cheaper, but equally aesthetic case

* 750w is WAY more than you could possibly use with this computer setup, not to mention that the Corsair CX is a low quality line. I grabbed a more appropriate high quality model."

Gluestick05,weddingplanning,1389663193.0,"The only thing I wanted was for all the dresses to be the same color.  My bridesmaids asked if I could specify a store, and Ann Taylor seems to be the winner.  We're still working on getting things nailed down.

* I prefer that they get different dresses in the same fabric.
* I offered to subsidize the cost (and offered some cheaper options, like ordering overseas) and there were some loud voices against that.  So right now they are paying for dresses, and I'll pay for hair/makeup/etc.
* The Ann Taylor dresses are ~$150 with the 40% discount.  I am hoping that the $70 Target bridesmaids dresses are a close color match so that I can present that as an option for anyone who prefers to spend less.  I've ordered both to compare fit, quality, and color so that we aren't surprised when it comes time to order.
* We're 6 months out, and I am hoping to get dresses ordered in the next 2 months.  Given that we're just using regular stores, they will come in pretty fast.
* Probably Ann Taylor and Target, but we'll see.
* Nothing crazy difficult!  Actually, nevermind.  We've had a hell of a time finding colors that are actually in stock.  Ann Taylor navy (navy!) is being discontinued, so they only have 0s and 18s.

Oh, and I'm being a mini-bridezilla and I've gone from a totally respectable navy to probably requesting ""mint"" as the color."

There is also a good possibility that I am remembering wrong.

Man I could watch those MGS2 soldiers do soldier stuff all day."
WalterFStarbuck,changemyview,1389663323.0,"On all those points, I have to make what is really the same argument for each of them -- shooting is really goddamned hard. Shooting accurately is harder than that. And shooting someone that you're chasing is even harder. 

I think from so many other movies, we're conditioned to think that if we want to shoot something it's just as easy as pointing in the roughly correct direction and pulling a trigger. But aim is a really tricky problem. The instant you pick up a real gun of any kind and especially after you shoot it, that becomes abundantly clear. On top of that,  aiming while on the move at a target that's also on the move is really tough. 

I think it also needs to be said that stormtroopers do kill a lot of people in 4, 5, and 6. Lots of nameless, faceless rebels and even some beloved secondary characters get shot or blown up. They just don't kill anyone valuable to the plot. That's a trope I can agree is present in the Star Wars films and I think that's the more relevant trope you're bringing up. 

Hell, Boba Fett is one of the few people that can actually touch someone central to the plot. He actually manages to take Solo out of the picture and delivers Luke to Vader. And we know Fett could've killed Solo if he wasn't worth more alive. Vader has to stress to him ""no disintegrations"" as if that's his thing. You fuck with the Fett and you go home in an urn.

But the parroted idea that stormtroopers are terrible shots and shouldn't be has always been a lazy way of poking at actual tropes in the films. There's a good reason for most of it. 

Go back and look at the combat effectiveness of draftees in Vietnam. There's a reason we rely on a volunteer military these days. If you don't want to be there, and aren't particularly good at it, you'll do as little as you need to just to not die today. Compare that with someone driven to do the job like a Navy Seal or Army Ranger on steroids. 

Imagine the most awesome recipient of the medal of honor, someone with balls of goddamn neutron star, now clone him a few million times with a little tweak to make him integrate into a chain of command better. That's the old-world stormtrooper that Obi-Wan remembers. And maybe it's a few left over grizzled ones that came down and blasted the hell out of those Jawas and the Lars family. 

But the majority of the Empire's ground forces are nonuniform, dissidents forced into service by fear and fascistic control. All the general security personnel on the death star, all the outer rim security guards, and the equivalent of space beat-cops that hate their jobs and just want to go home.

---

I'm not really all that heavily-invested in the idea and I don't hold Star Wars up to some crazy pedestal of perfection. There's a lot of terrible tropes and cinematography and storytelling in it. I just really think the bad aim of stormtroopers is a pretty bad example of one."

It is well patrolled so you don't see some of the Shenanigans you see at Blue.

For that Matter, Horseshoe is also a fun little hill.  You can see it from moonstone.   They do offer night skiing, and a good variety of runs.    My only issue with it is that it does attract a lot of inexperienced skiiers and riders.  Due to it lax patrolling they can be a bit of a danger.

If you are just looking for somewhere cheap and cheerful to head out to after work one day check out Glen Eden.  It is small - very small.  But heck, you're just learning you don't need big.     They offer night skiing and riding M-W for $20.  Seeing as though it is just in Milton, it is a quick jaunt, and a great place to get in a couple runs after work.

When you get a little more into the sport - cross the boarder.  Check out Ellicottville.  Holiday Valley is fun!   Same distance from Toronto as Blue, however bigger - less crowded and the town is awesome for a little aprez ski fun."

AbstractAngel,GirlGamers,1389663452.0,"I don't hide my usernames or character names, but usually unless I'm in vent/ts/mumble/xbox/etc nobody clues in until I speak.  When they do, the responses are all over the map for me. 

Honestly it's a mix, as most of my online gameplay is international. I have (personally) found that North Americans have a very mixed mindset and other countries I've encountered seem to be wowed in one way or another when they figure out I'm a girl. Most of my creepy encounters I've *personally* run into were from people in NA, Russia, and Australia. The rest seem to just be chill about it (it may be more commonplace in other countries, I'm not sure) and don't treat me any differently. 

I've had people try to follow me all over the map, give me free things (I never accept, don't worry lol), send creepy messages or talk to me in very inappropriate ways. I honestly haven't had a ton of people trash talk me unless they were already trash talking before they figured out I was a girl - then it's a matter of pride I think and they just jump on what they consider is a weakness. The funny ones are when they trash talk me, then try to be super nice when the figure out I'm a girl, even to the point of messaging me and trying to ask me out after complimenting me on my gaming. Not sure how that makes a difference when you were a total jerk beforehand, but okay... 

I actually had the neatest experience with a group that pugged me for a raid (all male FC apparently) in vent. They didn't mention that I was girl, but were notably different when they figured it out. One guy said S*** in a sentence then tried to immediately correct himself and appologize. I replied ""no you're right. it's so f*** true"". There was a pause, everybody laughed, and the tension melted away. The problem is that there are so many stigmas attached to females gaming that a lot of people just don't know *how* to respond (both sexes). I find my best success is when I just do my thing, don't act like I'm different in any way, and most people follow suit.

**Make Friends**

Farming Bloody Coins on Timeless Isle, come across another person doing the same? Invite them, chat, add them to your friendlist through their battletag.

Flex runs? Talk to people, add the fun ones, chat with them every now and then.

LFR? Joke about how unlucky everyone is being about the drop rate of Secrets of the Empire or Titan Runestones, add the ones that happen to be from your server. 

Queue together, talk to them every now and then, invite them to things like Flex, Challenge Modes or what have you.

Filling your Friends list with people will probably be the best kind of progression you can do in the game. It gets you invited to Flex runs, it gets you invited to fill in for a raider they're missing for Normal, it gets you invited to Scenarios or some other stuff.

It'll also make you one of the first few people that someone will think of when they need to fill a raid spot.

lemastersg,AskHistorians,1389663581.0,"Censuses have been around for a considerable time, actually! It's even mentioned in the Bible that Augustus Caesar ordered a census of the Roman realm around the Birth of Christ (Gospel of Luke, 2: 1-7). My Roman history is fairly sketchy, but this was probably undertaken in order to survey taxation and conscription.

Fast forward to the Tenth Century, and you have the Miniguhud Senchusa fer nAlban, or ""The History of the Men of Scotland."" Although it is primarily a genealogical work, the ""Senchus"" outlines the lineages of kings and the numbers of men in the various kin-groups (""cenels"") across the Kingdom of Dal Riata (present day South-West Scotland and Northern Ireland). This, too, served aid in conscription of men for warbands (as Dal Riatic society did not formally have a levied army), but interestingly it provided legitimacy for the reigning King or High-King of the state. It is thus regarded as the earliest census in Britain.

About a century after that, the Norman Conquest happens. Twenty years after his campaigns in 1066, the new King William compiled a list of the denizens of England's various shires in what is known today as the Domesday Book. William did this to inventory his holdings as King and survey how taxable his kingdom was (he was greatly enriched by taking England) and report on the holdings of the vassals in homage to him.

In short, censuses have been in use for thousands of years, mainly for the purposes of taxation, conscription, and centralization of authority.

I was lucky that the Zulu were on a different continent than I was.  If they were on my continent, I would have had a much tougher time of avoiding wars.

I didn't see really any culture bonuses. I think they start with higher Culture per turn, and they have a worker and settler from the start, so they probably have more culture just from having 2 cities.  That also helps them produce more units and buildings."

I spent years struggling to get into shape, and tried to motivate myself with thoughts of the higher class of women I'd be able to score with.  That didn't work, because I basically don't like women, and so in the back of my head a little voice was always saying ""Yeah, great, we can get fucked over by better looking bitches.  Yay!""

When my dad died, he left me a bunch of money, and one of the things I wanted to do to honor his memory was go on a trip around the world and visit all the places he visited that I haven't seen.  Because of all the things my dad gave me, his appreciation for foreign cultures and the way other people live is the one I cherish most.  And I know that traveling is how he'd want me to honor him.

But I'm fat and out of shape, and my dad traveled to places you have to hike to get to, and be tough to endure.  And I want to go to those places, so I have to get in shape.  After years of diets that caused me to drop 10 pounds and gain 15, I've lost 70 pounds and I'm on my way to hit my goal weight of 185 in about four months, maybe five.

It's hard, and was *really* hard during the holidays, but whenever I feel tempted to go grab McDonald's because another fucking lean cuisine is going to make me ill, I just close my mind and imagine myself hiking through the jungles of Africa, and I remind myself that every cheeseburger is another day delay before I'm fit enough to make that trip.

Grade 9 camp, we're all out in the bush camping and generally being dick 13/14 year olds.

Final night there, we're all around this massive campfire, people had to come up with fun things to act out.

So these two get up, and start pantomiming.  

Now, it's important to realise that we're 13-14 year old boys, and there was a smoking, *smoking* hot student teacher there.  I think every single one of us was in love with her.  Deep, throbbing love.  You know the kind.

Anyhoo, these two clowns are making out about how hungry they are for fried chicken.  They try a KFC, but they're shut.  They try a local place, but they're shut.

Mike turns to Chan, and says, ""Man, we could get some maccas, but I really want a tender bit of breast.""  Chan replies, ""Yeah, I could really go a nice, juicy thigh.""

In unison, they both say, ""I know, let's go to Miss Student-Teacher's Place!!!"" and run off.

Everyone laughed.  Fucking everyone.  The teachers laughed.  Miss student-teacher laughed her ass off.  Every student near wet themselves.

I met some lovely people out there, we partied with one guy for a couple of days and had chats with some wonderful people. Our tour guide when we did the stereotypical trip around Beverley Hills and to the Hollywood Sign was one of the funniest guys I've ever met. 

A lot of places in Hollywood have a reputation for being a bit scummy and rough. Granted, some parts are, but most of the places you'll see as a tourist are nice, and there are some great views from up in the hills. 

The only vaguely scary moment we had there was when getting in to a cab. We were unsure of which street our hotel was on as it was our first full night there and being from a small town in England, we were lost as fuck. Literally, we tried to walk from our hotel out in Bel Air/Brentwood to Sunset Strip. Anyway, this taxi driver took us the complete wrong way and ended up in the scummy part of Hollywood. We told him this wasn't where we were staying and he then took us to a random gas station in the middle of nowhere.

I watch a lot of crime shows... I was shitting myself. Anyway, he comes back and says he got directions and finally takes us to our hotel. He tries to charge us $100 for a $25 fare, so our concierge tells us to give him $30 and just leave. We do as we're told and go get a drink in the bar. Creepy as fuck.

Other than that though, we had an amazing time, the people were lovely, the food was great and Sunset Strip is my favourite place in the whole world. I'd love to go back again."

Judge and his colleague concluded that someone who is 7 inches taller — for example, 6 feet versus 5 feet 5 inches — would be expected to earn $5,525 more per year.

&gt;**Height was found to be more important than gender in determining income and its significance doesn't decline with age.**

&gt;""If you take this over the course of a 30-year career and compound it, we're talking about literally hundreds of thousands of dollars of earnings advantage that a tall person enjoys,"" Judge said then.

Standard curves out much higher than legacy or modern, therefore you will have more high CMC cards in your deck, making Pain Seer a more risky card to play.

The most useful ""combo"" in standard for Pain Seer appears to be Witches' Eye because you don't have to risk losing him in combat and you get ""set up"" your draw a bit better to not lose too much life from him.  Playing Witches' Eye in constructed will reduce the power level of your deck however, as it is not inherently good right now."

The average amount earned through youtube fullscreen ads is roughly $3.3 per 1000 views, at that rate, you'd need 9000 views per day on your videos to reach your goal.

Another thing you could try (more risk however) is promoting affiliate products through clickbank or something, a lot of people make a huge amount of money online by advertising and selling other peoples products via your own website.

I definitely want to be in a forever-term relationship with a woman, raise a family with her, share our assets, and build a life together, but marriage is a legal arrangement and I have been questioning whether it's truly necessary. I have a much higher than average income and would have a lot to lose in the event I get divorced, which is a very real possibility (thinking realistically, not idealistically). 

I did a bit of research into what it actually means to be legally married, and what the benefits and drawbacks are, from a non-emotional perspective. 

I came to the conclusion that, for a number of reasons, it's slightly financially beneficial to be married, and really inconvenient to NOT be married, when you're in a lifelong, co-habitating, asset-sharing, child-having relationship. Romantic, huh?"

Kanta did the Gundam 00 second season key animation, as well as some for Code Geass' 2 seasons - which Tomohiro did some as well. All of them but Hiroki have done work for Gundam,,so yeah, I can definitely see the Gundam/Code Geass mech design vibes in this series.

Honestly, the plot bores me right now, but I'm a sucker for mech shows regardless of plot because of the action, so I'll probably stick around for at least half of it(which would be the mid-way climax and probably around episode 11~14, seeing as how I think Buddy Complex is set for 24 episodes(give or take)."

I am not in politics, and I do not determine age of consent, so I can't be held accountable for what society deems right and wrong.

&gt;Bestiality is generally looked down upon probably due to some innate instinct since species interbreeding generally cannot produce offspring, and also because it's just a general rule of society people have been conditioned to follow.

That's what I'm getting at.

&gt;I'm not sure why you're so aggressive in your views.

Based on the massive response I'm getting, some of it calling me an animal rapist and a freak, I have to be the least aggressive and least insulting person who has expressed their views here. I think I am more probing than aggressive. I like getting such a heated response.

&gt;Everyone is entitled to what they will/won't accept in a romantic partner, and what they are/aren't into sexually. Just like people can be free to have their fetishes and what have you, their potential partners are also free to decide that they aren't into participating in that.

Hours before the date he texts saying the weather isn't nice enough to go to the beach so we should go to his house. I suggest the zoo, but he shoots it down.

We meet up--he has noticeably unbrushed teeth--and the weather has cleared up enough to walk along the shore for a bit. The entire date is me asking him about his life with no return--eventually I give up asking him and just sit in silence until he asks again if I wanted to go to his place because he's cold.

We walk around til we see a pizza place that looks good, while ordering he tells the cashier that we don't need to order drinks because he's got some at home. Finally I just say *fuck it* and we go to his (at this point I know I won't be hooking up with him). 

His house is fucking *disgusting*. He apologizes for the mess but after that much prodding he could have made sure his home was habitable! I eat my pizza and leave. 

Hours later he texts asking me out again and I politely turn him down. Days later he suggests the zoo and I don't even reply.

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1389665143.0,"The difference in sexual response level between ""guy tossing money around"" and ""successful jerk not buying her anything"" is unreal. It's the difference between having her lingering around kinda of IOIing and having her outright dry humping you in front of everyone.

In terms of bang for your buck, there's no single play in all of game that gets you more return than not paying for anything when a woman knows that you could easily afford to. But it does require insanely solid frame control. 

All forms of novelty intrigue women. If you're ""not like other guys"" in a positive way, you are miles ahead of the game.  *Attractive women are used to guys with money trying to buy their affections.* Even attractive guys with money have a hard time tamping down the urge to provide because providership is actually one of those basic male instincts. We enjoy providing for the women in our lives the same that women enjoy raising babies.

In a way, you can think of it as a further extension of aloof jerk game. Just as there's a lot of value in not lavishing women with attention, there's also a lot of mileage in not putting the money out in front of them.

Count me in the ""never buy a woman shit"" camp. Chateau Heartiste calls it the Skittles man game. https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2009/05/19/be-a-skittles-man/ Not normally a fan of Heartiste and frankly I don't necessarily think you have to quite sink *this* low to make your point, but I've also known some seriously worthless jerks who would make the Skittles Man look like a beta provider.

Think about it from the female perspective . . . if you're a 7 or higher there's a decent chance that a few guys who were at least in the bottom of the upper class have tried to use money to sway you (and more than a couple 30k millionaires too). Attractive women have seen this play before. Like anything a woman has seen before, it bores her.

One of your big goals in game is to be something rare and worth pursuing. Guys who throw money around in the hope of getting ass aren't that rare to any woman in the 7+ range. Guys who have money and act like they don't exist are a whole other matter.

It's also worth noting that I'm pretty fuckin arrogant guy when you get down to it. *Getting a piece of ass isn't even my favorite part of game.* My favorite part of game is watching women idiotically stumble over themselves in order to get my attention.

I'll present two stories . . . 

**Story one**

It's been a couple hours in this bar / club that I know pretty well. It's decently high-end in this of underground giant wine cellar sort of setting. Multiple dance floors, mutiple levels, mutlipel DJs, go-go girls, the whole works. And it has this really swank, quiet upper bar area that's basically where they keep all of the top shelf booze that a lot of bars don't carry at all or just sell for bottle service if they do. Being a scotch drinker, this is needless to say a *very good thing*.

I was taking a break from gaming this girl who was . . . ahem . . . possibly too young to be in there. This girl was into me, diggin me, whatever . . . doesn't matter because she's not the object of this story even though she is the chick I end up making out with by 6am. The upshot is that I'm already in solid with a cute piece of borderline jailbait, so I already have an ace up my sleeve and can pretty much game in full jerk mode the rest of the night with other chicks.

There's this chick at the far end of the bar who's dressed to absolutely kill. No one else is there beside me her and the bartender. She's like 5'8"" tall, form-fitting white dress, long dark blond hair (kind of on the lighter side of ombre). She's the genuine article. If Daniel Craig showed up and whisked her away as a bunch of guys started shooting the place up, you would have found that to be completely plausible under the circumstances.

I'm buying a couple doubles of scotch and just minding my business. Understand that I am pretty much the definitive detached solo game guy if there ever was one. I can ignore a women until she's doing handstands trying to get my attention.

She's doing the full bore girl game ""I'm gonna make you notice me without it looking like I'm trying to make you notice me"" thing. Women do astonishingly dumb shit when they want a guy to pay attention to them, but miss white dress chick is one of the more memorably stupid ones. She moves over to the seat next to me. Understand that I'm drunk and I'm in full jerk mode, so *I keep ignoring her*. She moves back to her previous seat. And then two minutes later she moves back next to me again (remember, there's no one else in this part of the fuckin club). 

I smirk at her, she kinda gives me a bit of a ""what?"" look. I bust out laughing at her. She turns dark red in the face, grabs her purse, forgets her drink, and storms the fuck off.

**Second story**

I'm out with friends at the bar at like 1am. I've already busted my nut for the night with a chick about an hour earlier. I'm lounging around the side of the bar with my shirt unbuttoned and just propping my feet up like the overly self-involved piece of shit that I am. I've got layers of nice clothes on -- undershirt, dress shirt, vest, jacket, overcoat -- so basically I look like fucked-out, drunked-out mess of a rich guy.

My one friend who is such an ass about using my money to social circle game other people decides he's gonna start playing that shit up to this group of chicks, one of whom is a married MILF and he's been trying to lay her since the beginning of time. She's a flaming redhead and again in a slinky white skirt (hmmm . . . I never really thought about the parallel between these two stories).

Eventually, this triggers her inner success detector, and she starts playing at the whole ""buy me something"" game. She basically keeps going down the list of possibilities, and I just laugh her the fuck off and tell her no way.

She doubles down so hard it's unreal. She's literally hanging on me over my shoulder rubbing pubic mound against my thigh and running her leg up against the inside of my leg. All I'm doing this whole time is ignoring her, occassionally rejecting whatever she proposes, and then continuing to talk to my friends. By the time I'm done busting her balls she's offering to divorce her husband, claiming he doesn't treat her right, and all kinds of shit. 

And because I am a miserable prick I decide to give her a glimmer of hope (remember: nothing gets me off like watching a woman stumble over me, because I am a horrible human being with serious unfulfilled childhood needs!!). 

I look at her and I say, ""But there'd have to be courting.""

You can see that light come on in her eyes. She leans in and buries her head on my shoulder and asks ""Would you court me?""

I bust out laughing as loudly and obnoxiously as possible and holler, ""Awww, hell no!""

She shoves me back, steps off, throws her arms in the air, and starts repeatedly muttering, ""Hey, I tried, OK."" By this point, there were at least 20 people watching, and she was pissed about all of this happening in front of a crowd.

She eventually ends up asking for my number, and then she tries to ask my friend who started all of this for my number. I look at him and tell him, ""If you give her my number, I'll break your fuckin wrist."" To his credit, not only did he never give her the number, he also gave her the wrong name (I'm now his long-lost Uncle Harry according to him).

FTR, she did end up divorcing her husband and hasn't dated seriously since. (I have an incredibly creepy need to find out what happens to women after they've been around me and a completely narcissistic desire to believe that it was all my fault.) Five minutes of alpha indeed (http://therationalmale.com/2012/01/04/five-minutes-of-alpha/).

BTW, does anyone know if you can change your username on here? I just read what I wrote and I feel like I should probably change my handle to ""theworsthumanbeingever"". Hehehe."

We_Are_Legion,TheRedPill,1389665549.0,"&gt; Women would be in SERIOUS trouble.

Not really. When robotics is advanced enough to reach this threshold, like you mention, make better sexual partners than even humans, 

1) Industry will employ the tech in a diverse variety of forms on a mass scale for numerous profitable applications before you can afford even one. 

2) The demand for labour, especially male dominance over risky jobs will be largely eroded. The last main obstacles to male-female pay inequality, as supported by laws will be open to feminist lobbying.

3) Unemployment will skyrocket. Automation of manual labour, and AI that can automate unskilled non-manual labour will put huge swathes, especially the poor and lower middle class, out of jobs. Even the military will not be a viable option to absorb large amounts of unemployed. As technology progresses, more and more human roles are replaced. The pay for the remaining roles plummets as competition gets fiercer.

4) Wealth will accumulate at the top(if you think Buffet, or Gates family tier is super rich, just wait for the hyper rich to come) towards those who now control both the means to production and the labour to work those means.

5) Massive increase of the value of money. The demand for money is lopsided, the poor need it, the wealthy have it. Wealth is worth more, and can buy *anything*. Those with power will invariably be those with money. Laws have historically only been able to mitigate this. It is a safe bet this can be feared to exacerbate. Society's control on the wealthy will be eroded, and much more excess and corruption will ensue as well as affronts to rights and abuse of power.

6) Breakdown of capitalism. The founder of sociology, Karl Marx, made many observations about the flaws in capitalism which led to a large number of important reforms in every capitalist society worldwide, especially in  richer, western countries(not to say Marx's ideas didn't totally revamp communist countries too). Many democracies are social welfare states today, a mix of socialism and capitalism, while others only employ select socialist principles and systems to mitigate the disadvantages capitalism. In an environment where labour is worth nothing, for most of the population, capitalism becomes the enemy. 

Violent revolution and anarchy is inevitable. Socialist states are left as the only answer, with enforced redistribution of wealth in the form of universal income, additional and far-reaching welfare measures, etc.  

In this environment, even socialism makes little sense for the vast majority of people since enforced redistribution will always be hesitant, viewed as limited and come at cost of political power and influence to an already politically insignificant yet enormous demographic of the lower. Communism sprouts in many western societies, with the ownership of means of production from individuals going to the community and abolition of the concepts of money. 

***7)*** **Women will no longer need men either.** 

Under labour being worthless, everyone will be destitute and the rich will literally buy women while you now singularly compete on your natural charm. You're both unable to provide for yourselves. Both genders for the most part will probably not be affording sex bots.

Under socialism, the source of resources is still NOT men. In addition, Men are still sexually less in demand to women than women are to men. Your commitment is worth less. 

And women will probably have sex bots too. Probably before men if society's views on vibrators and fleshlights is an indication.

He uses a ton of mana in the first few levels making him relatively vulnerable as he starts.  
  
He gets hit pretty hard in the jungle before his damage makes up for his squishiness and melts camps.  
  
He is on low mana during many of his trips to the jungle and at many times, low health in early levels. I try to keep enough mana for a jump to avoid a counter jungler, but you always hover between being totally OOM or not clearing fast enough.  
  
Kha'zix is very vulnerable in the jungle until he hits about lvl 6. Once he does, dont come in alone or you get isolated and eaten alive. His weak laneing phase exists in the jungle too, but in normal games, people rarely come in and bother me. The issue is not with the champion, its with players who let the jungler do his thing without a care in the world. "

m00nh34d,Games,1389665930.0,"&gt; Will SteamOS look the same on all the Steam Machines? Or will manufacturers differentiate? Should they?

The Steam interface itself will likely be the same, as it currently stands. Unless Valve specifically enable customisation of this, OEMs probably won't be allowed to do so. In the future though I'd imagine this changing, especially if some larger manufacturers get on board.

If you look at laptops (which are probably a closer comparison, than Android phones), these are subsidised by all the crap installed on them. Companies pay to get their trial versions of AV and image editing and office suites installed. This reduces the cost for end consumers.

For this reason, I suspect Valve (or at least the OEMs) would be interested in going down this path. That $499 SteamOS box, could potentially be $399 when loaded up with crapware (may be a little optimistic).

Probably one of the areas you will see, very soon, will be trial versions of games pre-installed. This is a pretty easy area for OEMs to exploit, without any significant changes in Steam or SteamOS.

&gt; If they are allowed to put in bloatware/crapware for marketing purposes (Oh our machine has these extra cool stuff, buy ours!) who will push the updates? Valve or hardware manufacturer?

Going back to the laptop analogy, software updates are independent of each other. As is system updates. Microsoft, or Ubuntu, doesn't push updates through PC manufacturers, they go direct to consumers, the same will apply here. Most likely.

&gt; If you look at the Android, Google develops the new version of Android OS but never push out the update unless it's their own Nexus devices? For this reason I always stick to Nexus devices. Should I do the same with Steam Machines?

They're not Android devices, they're PCs. The comparison doesn't really work.

&gt; If the update has to go through the OEM then this will delay the process. Not every machine will contain the latest fixes.

Precisely the reason OS developers don't release updates through OEMs. As these are PCs, I see no reason to push updates through OEMs, an update for 1 should work for all (or, most)."

kuma_k,ffxiv,1389665976.0,"&gt; Not possible to prove anything to you

And exactly why you can't claim that its the other way either.  There was never any way to actually test crafting directions, moon phases, etc. with concrete results.  Having good RNG in one direction doesn't mean the direction was the reason, it just means you were lucky with RNG.  Unless you could actually prove it *was* the direction, which you can't.

My point being, that even if you did all your hocus pocus superstitious mumbo jumbo, you still had the same chance to blow up a craft.  There was no trust in *not* blowing something up, the best you could do is trust someone in possibly reimbursing you by crafting it again, free of charge, when you gathered the mats again, days/weeks/months later.

Blowing up synthesis does *not* make a game better.  It makes it worse.  To reiterate one of my original points, people will believe anything to overlook some god-awful design choices that made it into FFXI.

* If you plan on primarily gaming, the 4770k will not give you a tangible performance benefit over the 4670k

* Single fan/Single wide radiators have poor performance relative to air HSF models in the same price range. Where the X60 is arguably the best model to get, the H80i will suffice for the budget. It's a push-pull system and will out perform the Seidon.

* Please stick to Samsung for SSD's, they actually make the memory modules that most of their competitors use; and generally have the best/near best performance.

* Picked you a far superior GTX 780 model, charts show it has equivalent performance to the Titan. 

* Don't need these C/M fans; C/M fans are generally pretty bad compared to competition.

* EVGA PSU's are known to have some power delivery issues, Seasonic has some of the best PSU's around.

HotzeSchatze,AdviceAnimals,1389666084.0,"I'm pro-spanking, but only under certain circumstances. I was spanked growing up, but never when my parents were angry/frustrated, and I always knew why. I wasn't spanked much because I learned from my mistakes very quickly, but from the few times I was spanked it wasn't so bad, just swats on the butt or slaps on the wrists. The act itself wasn't what I feared, I didn't fear discipline at all actually, but the idea that I'd done something that I wasn't supposed to made me realize how shitty I could be.

By far, the spankings I got were the best forms of discipline my parents had ever utilized.

You should lay off the suspicion when you're dating, at least for the sake of your stress level. If you're that suspicious of a potential date where you think she's living a *double life* , then just do as you do and date casually. Work on yourself and your attractiveness level upto a point where you can naturally assume another person would be genuinely interested in you sexually.

I would think your biggest worry is a bit paranoid. There are lots of women who are attractive, fun, hardworking and genuine that I've met who would never be in close line with the paranoid assumptions you've listed. So have fun and figure for yourself !"

Because Jill was *all* up in your shit. 

I have some girlfriends that I care a lot about. But quite frankly, ""testing"" their boyfriend is just kind of low, especially without the SO's permission.

Which brings me to, if the SO *gave* the friend permission, that's extremely immature and not something I'd tolerate from anyone. You have to have trust if you want to be in a relationship with someone. Having a friend bait or test the guy is the opposite of trust.

Even though Amy had nothing to do with it, it's still fucked up on Jill's part. Sure, she loves her, but she's her own person, independent and capable of making her own decisions. That's not Jill's territory. You can love someone, care about and worry about them, yet it doesn't give you the right to interfere in their choices when it comes to relationships. 

So my issue isn't really with you, and I don't blame you for not seeing that immediately, but yeah, Jill's gonna cause some issues if Amy doesn't move out or set some boundaries.

It feels like... like Braveheart meets Gladiator, with a fair helping of Game of Thrones thrown in.  

The magic systems that the characters use - especially the main character, a wizard named Drusas Achamian - is really, really good.  The descriptions and writing are as realistic as you could hope for - not just violent battle scenes, but bright cities and long desert marches.  There's a lot of philosophy and some psychology, as one of the other main characters, a monk named Kellhus, often understands men's minds and hearts better than they do themselves - just by simple observation and analysis.

The three books in the trilogy are:

* The Darkness That Comes Before

* The Warrior-Prophet

* The Thousandfold Thought

Bakker is working on a second trilogy, called *The Aspect Emperor* set in the same world about twenty years later.  The two completed books are:

* The Judging Eye

* The White-Luck Warrior

* The Unholy Consult (forthcoming)"

If she's a manager then the hiring process is not usually something a company wants to deal with and something as simple as simply picking up a purse and holding onto it so you can sit down is certainly not a reasonable reason to terminate your employment because replacing you is a bigger pain in the ass than they'll let on.

Necron_Overlord,Cascadia,1389666607.0,"&gt;My issues with lower &amp; lower corporate tax rates (my previous ""race to the bottom"" and the ""trickle-down economics"" comments) are based on a Canadian issue of companies hoarding cash and not investing, even though generous tax rates are given.

Corporations are hoarding cash all around the world because there is nowhere profitable to invest it currently, and they have no motivations other than profit.  Your traditional capitalist firm has little incentive to create new jobs through investment and expansion unless such expansion will create new profits; a worker-owned collective is very differently motivated, as it seeks naturally to expand and employ more people -- all workers have families; brothers, brothers-in-law, cousins, nephews, sons, etc. that they want to see employed.

In addition, workers in a collective who see a massive and unjustifiable pile of cash accumulating in the central coffers will naturally either vote themselves a pay raise, new benefits or invest it in some sort of community project

See, the traditional firm only really serves elites, and elites don't want to see unemployment drop because that increases labor power and thus wages, thereby eliminating profits.  They were designed by people who didn't want to see quality of life improve for anyone but themselves, and wanted to preserve class differences.  

Thus traditional firms are only motivated by the self-interests of the shareholders who own them from afar.  Those shareholders get maximum benefit when labor is exploited maximally, giving them powerful counter-incentive to invest profits into channels that will do the most good (in a utilitarian sense of good).

Think of it this way:  A traditional corporation is at it's absolute maximum efficiency when one person owns all the capital, and all labor is forced to compete against maximum deprivation.  The best possible thing for a capitalist is a very high unemployment rate to create high labor competition, a complete lack of social services to create low expectations of benefits, endemic poverty to insure employees are afraid of termination, and a population that is *exactly* educated enough to do the work he needs done and no more.

Firms organized along the lines of Mondragon are more profitable to all members the more people that are employed in meaningful labor; this gives an incentive for constant expansion into new fields, and the maximization of labor potential.  The best possible outcome for a worker-owned collective built on the Mondragon model is 100% employment of all people to the absolute maximum level of utility at the highest sustainable quality of life.

That's what a truly *free* market can accomplish, but it's hard to see that because we're so used to the gross distortions of right-wing libertarians who insist that the autocratic model of traditional capitalism -- a relic of the Victorian era intentionally designed to preserve aristocratic wealth and prevent the rise of the laboring class -- is compatible with a free and democratic people, when it clearly *isn't*.

Take the autocracy out of the market by eliminating the shareholder corporation and extending limited liability *only* to worker-owned collective corporations, and you'll have such a vastly different playground that a lot of free market solutions that seem completely infeasible -- health care, education -- actually become entirely feasible."

The best approach really is what works for you without holding you back. Try different ways and see how they benefit you. The writing process--or any art, for that matter--isn't a solid, linear dictated path. You may, in the end, find that some weird combination of everyone's suggestions is what works for you.

I like Bethany because I just relate to her I guess. And it'd feel awful to have those feelings for someone, especially my brother, and know he wasn't reciprocating them. It'd just suck, you know?

On the other hand, it'd suck even more if he completely cut off contact with me because he didn't want to hurt me, when 3 other girls get him any time they want. I'm actually surprised she doesn't hate Amy.

I also feel like Sandi and your mom try to keep her away from you, but in a nonchalant kind of way, because she's not really *that* much involved with you. Sandi or your mom seem to intercept quite a bit when it comes to that but it could be chalked up to them knowing how she feels + the pregnancy thing.

It's unrealistic for you and Bethany to end up together in the long run (trust me) but it really makes me sad for her that she has all these feelings that probably wont be returned unless you have a huge change of heart. I'm not saying you don't love her, she's your sister, of course you do, but that to be in her position, would suck.

The bracer slot meanwhile can already roll up to 6% crit, so unless you're looking to max attack speed in every slot, the natively rolled extra stat on the lacuni's is not great (melee attackers take x damage).  The pants also always come with a dex mainstat roll that you can reroll to something else, whereas you pay a lot more for 9/6 lacuni's since the crit% roll is not automatic.

Also the bracer slot seems to have some more interesting legendaries than the pant slot.  I saw screenshots of new 70 Depth Diggers which are big effective health, but some new 70 bracers like [Strongarm Bracers](http://diablo.incgamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/leg-strongarm-bracers3.jpg) have interesting effects.

The frozen brick spinach gives off a *lot* of water and still retains a lot even if you defrost it and strain it. You really need to squeeze it out by twisting it in a towel like paneer and use the water for something else. Plus the green water makes everything green.

Reduce the broth by 1 cup and take it from there. If that's not enough, then drain the water off the canned tomatoes and use it for something else.

Devium92,AskReddit,1389667046.0,"I always remember being in class and once in a while a friend would skip a bunch of days and when the test at the end of that unit came they would be freaking out over the fact that they failed. Well durrr if you aren't here to learn the material you won't know it for the test! And no one goes ""oh hey, John you missed Thursday stay after class to learn that lesson"". No it's up to you to talk to your classmates to find out what material you missed.

Obviously circumstances like extreme/prolonged illnesses, family emergencies etc. are often the exception to this. Also if your teacher is awesome. But they usually know when you've skipped. 

Most schools use online attendance these days and a teacher in your 3rd period Math class can see that you went to all your other classes except his. So it's not like it used to be where skipping was fairly easy to get away with."

I can see why she felt second if that was her first visit and Amy sort of ""stole"" the attention away. I'm a pretty jealous person so this entire situation is kind of unfathomable for me, just because there would have been some dead bitches if any of that had happened in my relationship. =/

I like L'Occitane's after shave balm (expensive, but worth it) Clinique's dramatically different moisturizing gel (which I use year round) and CeraVe's Moisturizing Lotion (which I use for insane winter dryness) And be sure to pat dry, never rub your face with a towel, it irritates your skin."

screenmagnet,sex,1389667103.0,"To be fair, there are some girls who may legitimately not care about penis size (vastly prefer oral/fingering to PIV or have a low sex drive) or actually prefer a small one (have vaginismus or unusually small vagina, or really into anal). And some girls who like PIV may not really care about the 'filled' feeling.

It's probably a small minority of women, but you don't have to have a small penis fetish in order to be satisfied with a small dick.

Also, I like to humiliate, emasculate, and dominate men in bed sometimes, but I still prefer for them to have big dicks. There are still a multitude of ways to make a strong, manly dude with a big dick feel like my little sissy bitch in bed. In fact, it's way more fun to emasculate super manly dudes. Emasculating a guy who already feels emasculated is just too damn easy to be any fun. ; &gt; Plus, it would hit too close to the truth to feel comfortable for either of us...."

You might also want to talk about it with a therapist.  A professional who might have some better idea of how to tease out what specifically it is that terrifies you.  But while you figure it out, I think you should keep only doing things you're comfortable with as far as your *own* vagina goes.

Simply untrue, and it's very easy for me to come up with similar scenarios where Blink Dagger gives you nothing while Shadow Blade is still worth something. This is a pretty good example of you buying into the consensus that something is better and something else, and you're grasping to come up with reasoning to back up what you've bought into.

Yes, Shadow Blade is more expensive. That's why of course you would only get it on carries or semi-carries who you expect to farm. LC is much better as a farming semi-carry than as a naked blink-initiator in the style of Batrider or Tidehunter. And it's not like you're throwing away 1000 gold to get Shadow Blade: you get bonus damage and attack speed, both useful on LC, which are active even when you aren't using the item to initiate.

And I still think we will see a level of desperation and wage slavery even with UBI if we eliminate the wage. UBI helps but doesn't completely eliminate the problem. It's better than nothing, but not necessarily a GOOD life. 

What I'm afraid of, is if we eliminate the minimum wage, we will create an underclass. It will hurt economic mobility, because people will still work for paltry wages just to get a level of income above UBI. In a world with UBI, the minimum wage isn't necessarily for survival, but I think an argument can be made for it on the grounds of increased economic mobility and the American dream. Also, income inequality. Given UBI is redistributive, it is meant to mitigate the increasing income inequality in society. Eliminating the minimum wage will reinforce that inequality, and, as I said, potentially create an underclass that can't get ahead. "

Creatine doesn't inherently add or subtract muscle/fat, it really just changes how much water your muscles retain. Taking it on a cut means your scales read 2-3kg heavier than you *will be once you stop taking it*. Which basically again amounts to giving you a bit of an extra push in the gym, which is probably helpful to stop you being too disheartened when your lifts start to drop during the cut.

Again, I don't have much experience with cutting so I could be talking out of my ass, but I'm a pretty big fan of creatine. I equate it to being closer to a preworkout than a protein shake in the sense that it improves the lifting side of things rather than supplements the diet side."

Sometimes, it was satisfactory at the time of purchase, but since then, your needs have outgrown what the purse provides (e.g. you need more pockets or a longer strap or you don't need to carry so much, so now it's too big). 
  
Other times, you bought a purse that wasn't 100% what you needed because you had no other choice (e.g. your last purse's strap suddenly broke and you needed a replacement ASAP, or the other purses that *did* meet your needs were out of you budget).

&gt; Also do you really need all the crap you carry in it.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389668267.0,"Well that being said, even I could be seen as an extremist...especially to a libertarian. For example, I often have very marxist sounding ideas in relation to capitalism, but I myself am not a marxist, nor think communism or socialism or planned economies are workable. I'd say by US standards I sound extreme, but by, say, Europe's standards I'm probably your typical liberal. 

I also wish to convince people of my ideas, so I have no problem with that either.

But those videos kinda drop you right in the middle of the extremism, and they're not gonna convince you if you're...well...educated on the subjects at hand. I spent about a half hour earlier watching them, only to say to myself ""yes, but.."" over a dozen times. The thing is, those videos provide a very biased account of things, and often only tell one side of the story. Like the Stefan Molyneux one. Yes, I would argue we have all kinds of subtle mind control....but the bigger problem isn't the state, it's capitalism. I like how he explains slavery and feudalism, but totally glosses over capitalism and attacks the state. 

Sorry if I'm going off on a tangent here. Just explaining some of my thoughts lol.

Also, I'm well aware of religious evangelism. I used to be religious, became an atheist about 2 years ago, and spent a great deal of time studying the mind control involved. So I can see the mind control everywhere. The thing is, libertarians think they're so smart in picking up mind control about the state...but totally gloss over that they themselves play into some powerful interests' hands. Heck, I'd say in the 21st century, big business is more of a threat than the state is...and heck, most of the problems with our modern government are due to big business controlling the state.  Libertarians blame the state when the state is merely their puppet and that if done away with, we'd then have to deal with corrupt businesses who own all the property, use violence against anyone who challenges their position, etc. In other words, big business would become the state if the state were done away with. Libertarians don't seem to get this. The state merely serves the people, it's just that the businesses are the loudest people and get their agenda heard while we don't."

**WRONG**

&gt;Custom 780 or not, the 780 Ti beats in every aspect

Everyone knows the 780 ti is marginally faster than a Titan. The 780 ti is considerably faster than a stock GTX 780, how ever models like the HOF run neck to neck with the Titan. **If you are going to dodge points with the budget excuse don't turn 180* from your case argument to the GTX 780 ti argument**

With that point made, the marginal performance difference at 1080p doesn't matter much less above.

Simply having a PSU doesn't prove it's of high build quality and a lot of the community will call out the fault in purchasing Tier 3 models like the CX (**oh no the prices don't matter argument return!**).

Orelle,infj,1389668463.0,"My father and mother (now separated) are an ESFP and INTJ respectively, who parented an INFJ and INFP (now adults). Both of my parents are quite transparent, blunt, with a flair for drama. Both have treated me like an adult since I was a child. 

I get along easily with my father (ESFP). He's always been easygoing, funny and individualistic, but also dependable and caring, a sensitive but direct communicator. All he asked was that we be polite, presentable and get along with each other — nothing more by the way of grades, chores or achievements was demanded, just appreciated. We enjoyed outdoor activities, movies and music together — I think I was like the son he always wanted, although I'm female. I thrived with his trust. When I made a mistake, he'd simply give a disappointed look and say, ""Don't let that happen again."" 

We don't have very deep conversations (he'll tune out), and he's been very static over the years; a frustrating lack of self-improvement with only increased sensitivity to criticism with age. But he's a good storyteller (one third fact, two thirds fiction) and he's been so encouraging of us kids I can't ask for any more from him. He's a visibly proud parent who's supported all of his kids' choices, even ones that I know, deep down, he doesn't like. 

My younger INFP sibling has had a more difficult relationship with our father. She's taken his criticism, albeit rare, very personally, particularly with regard to her personal style. Their interests are incompatible. She feels embarrassed by his goofy randomness, which offends him. He tries not to step on her toes, and she avoids him a little. 

My mother (INTJ) has always been authoritarian with high expectations, very possessive of her kids and expecting our complete devotion. There was always harsh rebuke for 'failure' but rarely a pat on the back for success. We have a complicated, on and off relationship today because I believe she has narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), borderline personality disorder (BPD), and other related disorders. But we were very close before I made some life decisions she disagreed with. 

My sibling (INFP) also has a volatile relationship with our mother — more volatile, actually — but neither has withdrawn (yet) as they respect each other's individual goals, feistiness and reluctance to compromise. They tolerate each other's interests. They're currently semi-dependent upon each other. 

As a minor, I respected my mother's rules, strove to surpass her standards and be her friend, and was rewarded with her complete confidence. I was awed by her business skills and ability to make big things happen in little time, even with few resources or allies. It made anything seem possible and pushed me to be more assertive. So, even as she limited my world, she made the world seem less limiting. 

Beyond my family, I haven't been close to any ESFPs, but I've always had important INTJs in my life. (I've also had good friendships with INFPs.)

She had asked him over txt to ask me some probing little questions about me. He turns to me and asks them, I tell him to tell her, ""If she needs a boyfriend that badly tell her we can set her up with a male prostitute."" He proceeds to relay the message, laughing his ass off while doing it.

Uh, your link was a single person espousing their view and their view alone.

&gt; I've given lectures on how patriarchal culture is destroying men

&gt; Men will always have a place in feminist circles.

&gt; but men have a voice.

Have you not been to /r/TwoXChromosomes or /r/Feminism?

Yes, men have a voice, but that voice is only welcome as long as it's approaching on bended knee to the almighty Feminist Ideology.

Look, I 100% agree with gender equality, but feminists turn a blind eye to areas where benevolent sexism benefits them. Show me a single fucking feminist that campaigns against the lighter sentencing that women get in the criminal justice system, or campaigns for lighter sentences for men.

Show me a single feminist that campaigns against the Tender Years Doctrine.

Show me a single feminist that campaigns against the Duluth Model or Primary Aggressor Theory.

The answer is you can't. Because those thing benefit women and actively harm men. And the people that have stood up against them and said that they go against the Feminist Ideology of gender equality have been shunned."

I actually think the article doesn't go far enough, or that you, the OP, could have analogized this to something more broad.

A lot of others may be confused as to how this relates to RP, or ""being alpha"", but when we look at past top-voted comments, ones that glorify men, ones that are calls to actions, ones that mock the idolatry of women in much of society... it doesn't take much honesty to realize that there is a grander picture that we can afford to discuss once in a while.

For me, it isn't about being taken advantage of or being a ""good worker bee"", but a matter of personal integrity and pride to consistently go beyond expectations. If you get into the habit, it eventually becomes part of who you are. It's not something you have to brag about or even be externally rewarded for, any more than lifting weights has to be for external validation.

If you truly believe you've put full effort into doing the best you can, a lot of things come very naturally. Criticisms slide off you. Confidence goes up. You can demand more from others without feeling guilty about it. You naturally have a ""strong frame"". I find that a lot easier than ""faking it until you make it"" as I'm not the best liar. I've shut down so many liars that I can see how hard it is to maintain a lie especially among intellectual peers or superiors."

For example, our December email got into how we weren't permitted to attend Christmas parties held by friends if they worked at any organization involved in government contracting, unless they were direct family members or we paid up front for our estimated share of the total cost of the party. We were also reminded of the anonymous tip line meant to allow anyone to tattle on anyone seen as even slightly crossing that line.

What does he find boring? Obviously he'll have more abilities to play with, but his overall pve rotation will generally not be more than 5-8 abilities on any given class, while in pvp he may possibly use even less abilities to deal damage, but will have many more abilities to choose from to help him or his team in combat while hindering the enemies. As a hunter, he'll be using a selection of traps to freeze, slow, stun, daze enemies, others that will help stealth or cause surprise damage all over the place, he'll have access to a bunch of specialized shots that do specific things like root someone in place or interrupt their spellcasts.

Overall, the system works the same no matter what level you are, but the choice of abilities increases and multiplies as he gets higher.  Hunters are among those with the biggest amount of abilities at their disposal, I would say."

even had the $8/mo is better than $0/mo talk with them all. no dice.

cons:

latusthegoat,wow,1389669410.0,"The answer is yes but the ease with which you can do it depends on your gear level.  

Timeless Isle is a lot easier (pvp aside) than isle of thunder because you can get your toon a lot of buffs.  There are 3 specific buffs that are consumables (2 books and something). One increases your primary stat (so intellect) by 8000 almost continuously, one does about 100,000 damage at random on your hits (it fires quite often) and another heals you all the time.  Then you can get a timeless crystal that increases all your stats by 500 for an hour (cooldown of 15 mins) to help yourself do damage even in mistweaver spec, and add on top of that the shrines around the isle that can give you things like +15% damage, or +20% secondary abilities (haste, crit, mastery), and you'll find yourself able to kill most mobs even without a dps spec.

*Also*, totally situational fix here, but our son started STTN (previously 3 wakes a night) at 9.5 months not a week after we moved. The only change was him moving out of our bedroom. Although he responded loudly and negatively at first, we quickly discovered that our mere presence in the room -- even with us sleeping quietly and even with a white noise machine -- inspired him to get up repeatedly through the night. People will tell you that night wakes become about comfort feeding after 10 pounds - similarly, our son's night wakes were comfort wakes for cuddling. He knew we were in the room, and he knew that crying would result in him being held ((there's no ignoring a baby who is crying at 3 am not 2 feet from your bed on a weeknight.)) Like I said; as soon as he realized that mommy and daddy weren't sleeping in the same room as he was, the night wakes dramatically vanished to the point that he's STTN about 90% of the time.

Obviously this is no help if he's already in his own room or if it's just not possible :\"

**So Tautology.**

&gt; The Pine Island Glacier shows the biggest changes in this area at the moment, but if it is unstable it may have implications for the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet,' says Gudmundsson. 'Currently we see around two millimetres of sea level rise a year, and the Pine Island Glacier retreat could contribute an additional 3.5 - 5 millimeters in the next twenty years, so it would lead to a considerable increase from this area alone. But the *potential* is much larger.'

Skyler827,BitcoinMarkets,1389669549.0,"The ""Tea Party"" label has been used by different people at different times to describe various (very different) attributes or factions of conservatives.

At some point it became ""Death to Obamacare but don't touch my Medicare"" conservatives.  From then on its been a shouting match over the meaning of the term, with political balkanization and confusion.

Today, the Liberal media implicitly asserts that ""Tea Party"" means social conservative, evangelical Christian, but somehow also zealously anti-government or at least anti-taxes.  The Conservative media has split into three parts: Business moderates, libertarians, and evangelical/social conservatives, all of whom are upset by the influence of the other two, want to be seen as independent, and claim to be the real Tea Party (except perhaps business moderates)."

screenmagnet,sex,1389669701.0,"I know this is going to get downvoted to shit, but IME, Asperger's is grossly over diagnosed in men. For a while, it was the trendy diagnosis for intelligent, mathematically-oriented, socially awkward white guys in North America. Just like ADHD is the trendy diagnosis for anyone who doesn't like doing homework. IME, most ""asperger's"" guys who have a strong desire for forming genuinely reciprocal friendships and romantic relationships don't actually have Asperger's. What they actually have is some poorly-compensated combo of social phobia, OCD, and/or obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, or schizoid personality traits. Autism is an irreversible syndrome of seriously abnormal brain development prior to and during infancy. It goes way, way beyond the limitations that most people associate with Asperger's.

BTW, I say this as a former gifted kid with ADHD and social phobia, with a brother who was misdiagnosed with autism as a toddler, a very socially awkward family, and a lifetime of experiences almost exclusively being friends with, dating, and working with high IQ people with poor social skills and idiosyncratic behaviour."

I'd like to think that it's just a reaction for humans too, although we've managed to create a whole lot of rituals and ceremonies and stigmas to go along with it because we are conscious about our procreation and the possible transfer of diseases, while animals are not. Nearly all people have sexual impulse, and so do animals.

&gt;It's innocent on their side of the equation. The same works the other way around, the dog will think it feels good.

I think innocence is subjective in this case. No one can trick an animal into feeling pleasure, except maybe by means of some kind of electric stimulus to the brain. Some of the same things that arouse humans and please them sexually work the same way for other animals. I don't see anyone protesting outside zoos or horse ranches because handlers have to arouse animals to extract semen from them or inseminate them."

There is bad in everything and everyone, you're right about that. But there is also good in everything and everyone, and that includes you. I'm not going to tell you that you were put on this Earth for a reason, because maybe you're not religious or something, but the truth is your existence matters. Maybe not to all 7 billion people, but to those who are in your life everyday, you mean something. If they were to lose you, they would notice, they would care, and they would hurt. 

There are lots of people who have trouble expressing their affection, their love, but that doesn't mean it isn't real. Maybe it isn't the things you wish they'd do, like wait for you to take the bus with them, or give you hugs everyday, but they probably have their own small, little ways of letting you know you mean something to them. Take a deep breath, splash some water on your face, and try to make a list of all the things you like about yourself, or about someone in your family, or a friend, or school; or even just a list of things you like, period.

If you want to make your own to remove water from non polar substances it's as easy as setting your oven on high (get it above 200 degrees Celsius or the monohydrate won't decompose) and then leaving it in there for a couple hours in a dish or something. It's recommended that you line it with tin foil so that it doesn't glue to the inside and then you have to shatter it out of there. After that you can use it to remove water from even alcohol. Although calcium chloride would be better because it's less soluble. Don't forget to chill it before you add the desiccant so that way you can limit the amount that dissolves in.

Lyn_Never,TwoXChromosomes,1389670004.0,"So here's the deal, ASSUMING you feel like your mom is a stable person and fairly practical: she's going to be super disappointed and that will make you feel like shit.  She'll be terrified for you, because pregnancy is dangerous and it's emotionally a heavy deal to go through this so young.  There are a lot of reasons that we (middle-aged people) don't want you (teenaged people) to have to deal with this.  It's like if you came home with a mortgage, we'd be like what the hell were you thinking?!? And when people get scared, they get bitchy.

She's going to be upset.  Exasperated.  She may get a little mean - probably not right away, it'll probably take a day or two, unless she's an exploder.  She may ask you if you're clinically stupid or only intermittently out of your mind.  She may threaten to neuter your boyfriend with a rusty nail.  (He's toast, by the way.  Please don't choose him over your mother, but understand that she's not going to want to be buddies with him ever again.)  She's going to be mad, mostly because she's scared.

But being mad and scared is going to be off on the one hand, and on the other hand is going to be making sure YOU get taken care of, and that whatever legal hoops need to be dealt with are dealt with.  Like, she might be pissed at you, but that's nothing compared to what she'd do to a nurse who took an unpleasant tone with you.

Yeah, it's going to change your relationship.  It may be really rough for a few months, and you may need to work at that relationship in a way that teenagers don't normally have to.  But if you have a good relationship now, you can have a good one again.  This isn't the last rough spot you'll go through.

It's just...given the choice between going through this with your mom and going through it without her, simply because you don't want her to be mad, the latter is the far worse choice.  You need your mom, if she's a mom who takes care of you.  Don't go without that support just because you might have to do a little emotional damage repair.

If she's a pretty good mom you can generally rely on, I guarantee you that nothing would tear her apart worse than finding out after the fact that you thought you couldn't trust her.  And living with keeping that secret is no walk in the park.  It hurts you.

When I was a teenager back in the Neon Age (80s), when our high school forced pregnant girls to go to the off-campus alternative school with the juvies or drop out lest someone be corrupted by witnessing their bumps, I was sure my parents would have killed me stone dead if I got pregnant.  I realize now that they would have crawled with me on their backs over broken glass to get an abortion, or been stunned but involved grandparents if that was my insistence.  Yeah, there would have been a certain amount of hell to pay, but we're talking not getting my own car hell, not tarred and feathered.

If you feel like it is okay and safe to tell her...go tell her right now.  Wake her up if you have to.  Get it over with.  Let her help you."

What I would tell you is this. Imagine if your rolls were reversed. If it was you that wanted a kid would she stick to her guns and refuse, or give in? 

From what you describe here it seems that she is unwilling to respect your choice. I can only go off what you have written here, but it sounds like her mind is made up, and if she is threatening divorce then it can only be summed up as extortion. If she truly loved you, and respected you she would not be trying to force you into something you don't want to do by threatening divorce. 

I can only use my own marriage of 9 years as a reference, but I am married to a woman who wants kids less than I do. (which is saying a lot, because I want nothing to do with the vermin.) 

In the end you have to do what is best for you. After all, if she is willing to throw around the divorce threat so  nonchalantly about this it makes me think what else is she willing to push on you later? If you cave is she going to respect you as a man? It certainly doesn't sound like she does now. 

Life is long. If your marriage ends at least it will be on your terms, standing your ground. Its easier to recover knowing you stayed faithful to yourself than it is knowing you caved. "

Misanthropy-Divine,infp,1389670162.0,"I used to do that, and sometimes I unconsciously still do. I'm pretty sure it's a defense mechanism from back when I was mistreated by many of the people in my life...

The thing is, now that I'm aware of that issue, I tell people that are getting close to that point (i.e., that I'm getting rather close with) that I have a tendency to shut people out and push them away without my necessarily realizing it. That way, they know it's coming, and when they see that behavior come up, they know what's going on and don't let me push them away. The ones that have become my best friends also called me out on that behavior, which brought it to my attention so I could quash it before any damage was done.

So my advise to you is when you're befriending someone and the two of you are starting to get to that point where you know you push people away, you let them know that this is something you do and are trying to work on, so if it starts happening to realize that you don't really want to push them away, that this is something you don't realize you're doing until it's too late, and to keep that in mind in case you start shutting them out. The onus is on you, then, to keep an eye on your emotions and to not get offended when they call you out on behavior that looks to them like you're pushing."

Psythik,AdviceAnimals,1389670236.0,"Brand new Netgear WNR2000v4. On wired I average 60Mbps, on wireless it drops below 5 at times. I also have to reboot it daily. Another Netgear I owned a few years back did the same thing. I'm sticking with Linksys &amp; Motorola from now on."

PoppedAMollyImSweatn,Fitness,1389670237.0,"I recommend Dymatize creatine. It's micronized, unflavored, cheap, and highly reviewed. I leave a teaspoon in the container and just drop a scoop into my mouth and wash it down with a small glass of water. It has no taste and the texture doesn't bother me. It saves the hassle of having to mix it and having leftover powder at the bottom of the glass or risk wasting it in a shake.

macadore,offmychest,1389670249.0,"Meds may provide short term relief, but in the long term, you will need to cognitively retrain yourself to get control of you thinking when it starts taking you in the wrong direction. There's nothing you can do about what has happened and thinking about it will only depress you more and make things worse. Did you see a licensed psychologists or a layman? I'm so sorry you're in this situation. It may take some time to get over. Good luck. "
SirJefferE,DIY,1389670254.0,"&gt;One of the soldiers cleared his throat. “So what is the most valuable talent a man can have?” He sounded genuinely curious.  
“I haven’t the faintest idea,” Wit said. “Fortunately, that wasn’t the question. I didn’t ask what was most valuable, I asked what men value most. The difference between those questions is both tiny and as vast as the world itself all at once.”  
“In this,” Wit said, “as in all things, our actions give us away. If an artist creates a work of powerful beauty—using new and innovative techniques—she will be lauded as a master, and will launch a new movement in aesthetics. Yet what if another, working independently with that exact level of skill, were to make the same accomplishments the very next month? Would she find similar acclaim? No. She’d be called derivative.  
“Intellect. If a great thinker develops a new theory of mathematics, science, or philosophy, we will name him wise. We will sit at his feet and learn, and will record his name in history for thousands upon thousands to revere. But what if another man determines the same theory on his own, then delays in publishing his results by a mere week? Will he be remembered for his greatness? No. He will be forgotten.  
“Invention. A woman builds a new design of great worth—some fabrial or feat of engineering. She will be known as an innovator. But if someone with the same talent creates the same design a year later—not realizing it has already been crafted—will she be rewarded for her creativity? No. She’ll be called a copier and a forger.”  
He plucked at his strings, letting the melody continue, twisting, haunting, yet with a faint edge of mockery. “And so,” he said, “in the end, what must we determine? Is it the intellect of a genius that we revere? If it were their artistry, the beauty of their mind, would we not laud it regardless of whether we’d seen their product before?  
“But we don’t. Given two works of artistic majesty, otherwise weighted equally, we will give greater acclaim to the one who did it first. It doesn’t matter what you create. It matters what you create before anyone else.  
“So it’s not the beauty itself we admire. It’s not the force of intellect. It’s not invention, aesthetics, or capacity itself. The greatest talent that we think a man can have?” He plucked one final string. “Seems to me that it must be nothing more than novelty.”
