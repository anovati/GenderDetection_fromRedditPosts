His Q returns only half the mana it costs if it gets a kill. If used on an opponent, or you miss a cs it charges the full amount. Manamune would be great on GP IF it were easier to stack. His Q would proc the on hit effect, and manamune combos well with Sheen.

Just gotta get both feet back on and it'll be a 100% true caveman, landing with 1 foot is kind of doing the trick half-way, similar to landing pop shuvs with 1 foot etc...

rottenbanana127,DeadBedrooms,1390600086.0,"I have a similar situation at home. My husband prefers porn over me - or at least uses porn more than we EVER have sex. I highly doubt that trying to get involved in his porn regimen will get you anywhere, or curb his porn appetite. 

I think there are a lot of guys who just really can't face having sex with a woman and they choose jerking off to porn instead. My husband has intimacy issues - it's very difficult for him to deal with emotions and ""heavy"" stuff - so he avoids dealing with them. Using porn to ""kill the horny"" is one way to skirt the issue of dealing with intimacy/anxiety issues and quickly take care of his own needs. 

You need to have a SERIOUS heart to heart about this because that's EXTREMELY damaging to have your own partner ditch you for porn right under your own nose. It sounds like you have a good understanding of what is ""normal"" porn use - but this isn't normal. "

You're not cheating on her. You've already stated that.

If you were to post this from her perspective, I can almost guarantee you that there would be several posters suggesting infidelity. A lot of the issues you mentioned leading up to this could start setting off alarm bells in any relationship. 

Also, society has taught us that men ALWAYS want sex. I have struggled dealing with this view seeing as how my bf has a much lower libido than me. I was under the impression that since he is a man, he should get a boner every time he saw my naked ass. This is not the case apparently, and it's still something I struggle with. If he's not in the mood, I try not to feel bad about myself because he may not be rejecting me, but rather he is, most likely than not, just not in the mood.

If it's specifically an FoS for p100 though, there is 0% chance they will give it to you for having multiple sub p100s and their levels add up to 100 :P Obviously having 5 p20 characters and 1 p100 character are two wholly different things.

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1390600227.0,"Not much difference.  Except if you say you're just (best) friends who do all that, then it kinda sounds to me like an open relationship.  Since you are not boyfriend and girlfriend, then one of you might still date around.

But I do feel happy that I can say my boyfriend is my best friend.  He tells me that most other girls he has dated, it was mostly about sex...so he finds it nice to be able to talk to me about stuff we both are actually interested in.

In your case, it sorta sounds to me like maybe the honeymoon phase is gone?  Have you guys stopped going on dates and having adventures outside of the house?"
steadymotion,asktrp,1390600227.0,"Yeah sure. Hard game is when it's really on between you and a girl, and you're either just getting her number for the purpose of escalating on her later, or you're escalating hard on her to get her sexually turned on and willing to have sex with you. Hard game is for when your intention is having sex with a girl.

Soft game is when your intention is just to get the girl attracted to you, but you have no specific intention of fucking her. This is done because the act of getting girls attracted to you makes other girls perceive you as high value, thus improving your results with hard game. It's what you do when you're in a committed relationship, to keep the fire of the relationship alive. You should basically soft game every girl you interact with unless she is particularly old, ugly, or bitchy. In those cases just be abrupt and polite with them. If you sense good chemistry with a girl you can switch from soft game to hard game.

With soft game you'll do most of the same things as you would with hard game, such as leading, negging, teasing, etc, but you'll project more of a ""father to daughter"" vibe, rather than an ""I want to fuck you"" vibe. And you won't escalate more than just basic friendly touching. Soft game is essentially designed to get her to think you're really cool, that you ""get it"", that when you're with her you give orders and make decisions like a real man. You want her to tell all her friends that you're a cool guy. Girls talk to their friends about guys all the time, so use the ""girl network"" to your advantage. When soft gaming, don't pay too much attention to any one girl in specific. In a group of girls, make it seem like they're all just your ""groupies"" or something, like they're all followers under your leadership, and none of them in particular is more valuable than the others. Again, like a father with his daughters.

Another cool thing to do when soft gaming is to do stuff like play matchmaker. Saying stuff like, ""Wow, Jenny, that guy was staring at you hard. I think he loves you."" Girls love stuff like that, because it shows that you're not insecure about your girls getting with other guys (you don't need them all to yourself, because you have plenty of hot women in your life anyway). You want to project the vibe that you're looking out for the group, that you have their happiness in mind.

acouch,sex,1390600271.0,"aaaand now he's worked up over this.  This isn't warranting suspicion in my opinion.   Quite frankly, a healthy relationship does not require EITHER of you to track each other.  You should go out of your way to prove you trust your partner, not double check their trust yourself.  It's out of respect.  The fact is that you were refusing sex (for the first time i'm assuming? otherwise she wouldn't freak out?) and THAT WAS ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR.  Talk to her.  Say you don't want either of you spying on each other because it's not necessary.  Quite frankly, i think you should tell her that you've been working late to save up for a specific piece of jewelry for her that would make her very happy for the rest of her life.  All girls want to be surprised to some extent with a proposal, but at this point the secret of why you're sketching out is not worth it.  She'll feel bad about not trusting you, and she'll be incredibly understanding about you working late from now on. It's important that you sit her down, while not in a heated argument, and you start the conversation with something like ""look i was trying to keep this a secret, but things are getting out of hand with you not trusting me so i need to tell you why i've been working late.""  This way she'll know your serious and not coming up with a lie mid heated argument. This is all a misunderstanding not worth accusing each other of cheating.  If you're now super insecure about her cheating, you can throw cheating in the conversation like ""I've never cheated on you so why question me?  Have you cheated on me? Because if neither of us have cheated on each other i think we should be able to trust where the other is when we're out too late without a gps verifying it. ""

A common misconception among many people is that the Arctic and the Antarctic are very similar places because they are both regions around poles and are cold with lots of ice. Although those things are true, the two poles could not be more different; the Arctic is basically a frozen(ish) ocean surrounded by land, whereas the Antarctic is land surrounded by a frozen ocean. While that sounds like no big deal, it actually makes a huge difference in the livability of each area.   
Because of its continental nature, the Antarctic is much, MUCH colder than the Arctic, with average temperatures of -60C and 0C, respectively. This is HUGE in terms of polar bear survival - even though they have lots of fat and insulating fur, there is a limit to how much that will protect them. The mammals of the Antarctic are all marine mammals (porpoises, seals, whales) because there are no large land mammals that can survive that level of cold. 

'Adapting to a different type of prey' sounds easy to us humans because we can logically evaluate different things to see if they may be good to eat. Animals do not do this. Top predators have what's called a 'search image' when they look for prey - they know exactly the animals they can eat, and search only for those animals. Polar bears survive mainly on ringed seals and bearded seals. Both of these prey items live only in the Arctic. A polar bear in the Antarctic would look at an Antarctic Fur Seal and think 'That doesn't look like what I usually eat. I cannot eat that'. The bears would likely starve, or become extremely hungry and weak before going after something else, and by that point (especially in the harsh Antarctic) they would likely not survive.

It's also important to note the extreme fragility of the Antarctic ecosystem. Because it is such a harsh and severe area, everything that lives and/or breeds on the continent (7 species of seal, 4 species of penguin and several bird species) has adapted to just barely beat the odds on survival. Even just the accidental introduction of the common rat has absolutely devastated populations of albatross, petral, and other bird species because of predation on eggs. 

Basically, there isn't a single good thing about introducing polar bears anywhere except the Arctic. Animals have adapted to certain places on the planet for a reason, and if they haven't appeared or evolved somewhere, there is likely a very good reason for it and we humans have no business fucking with something nature has spent millions of years perfecting.

tl;dr  Different places on the planet are different.


Edit: I reread your question, and felt I should add that 'the arctic' isn't literally ice and water, and even if it was, polar bears don't JUST live in the arctic circle. [Here's](http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/islands_oceans_poles/arcticregion.jpg) a photo of the Arctic region and [here](http://www.discoveringthearctic.org.uk/images/4d_img_beargraph.gif) is where polar bears live"

Letterstothor,atheism,1390600442.0,"I teach martial arts, much of which is to children. I've found that the difference between physical discipline and ""beating"" a child has more to do with emotional involvement.

If a kid is talking during class, he gets kicked. There's no anger in the action. It's just cause and effect. If the kid isn't large enough to take a kick, he or she does something physically painful, such as standing in horse stance for 10 minutes while holding weights or running until I tell them to stop.

The hard part is that now that I'm a parent, I'm starting to see that it's very difficult to become dispassionate when dealing with your own child, physically or not, and that's where it becomes abuse the child begins to take it personally.

When my students complain, I always say ""Do you know the difference between me and your parents? I don't love you"" and then I'd double whatever I had asked them to do.

I can't say that to my own child, because it's cruel and untrue. Parenting is difficult."

You could alternatively lateral to a different company and join as an associate if your current company doesn't have the room to directly promote you.

As for your second question, it's tough to directly compare the two degrees, honestly. An MBA is a two year comprehensive program for all business topics, whereas an MS in finance is a one year program that is focused on only finance, and usually the quantitative aspects of the field. I'd probably prefer the MBA if you want the widest breadth of career options coming out of school. However, if you know you want to do finance and are interested in quantitative jobs like trading, an MS in finance is probably a cheaper and more effective solution."

sleepyj910,changemyview,1390600670.0,"I have no problem with wealth inequality, but extreme wealth inequality will either be balanced by good economic policy, or bloodshed.

When wealth inequality is low, the economy buzzes as people work to play the game, and everyone spends as they try to outcompete each other.  When wealth inequality is high, most of the money sits hidden away, while the poor earn and spend very little, and there's simply less capital to compete over.

So in a system that rewards inequality, you eventually come to a standstill wherein either you redistribute the wealth and recharge the economy and give people something to work for, or the desperation of the millions will revolt and do it for you.

Stagnation is bad for all of society, so well guided capitalism has sufficient reward for competition, but also ensures the pool of winnable money is replenished.

Economic policy exists for the benefit of all of us, and the rich only got rich because they were allowed to under the system, and in order to protect the system from falling, one needs to reset the game now and then."

All of the INTPs I've known:

1. Decisions to be made: they DO make decisions, but chew on the pros and cons of a situation for a much longer time than many. Intuition = imagination = playing out EVERY POSSIBLE OUTCOME = long time decision-making. We INFPs tend to do that too, from a different perspective.

2. Emotions: there is a metric shit ton of emotion in there, but while INTPs may be great at naming them for the sake of a sane and logical discussion about emotions, actually accessing them and expressing them seems to be...difficult. I see them spending a LOT of time poking at their very inner dark and light bits with long sticks to make sure that they are real, that they deserve them, that they're valid and in place before they integrate them. It's really quite endearing.

3. A lot of attention: INTPs give me a lot of intense attention for spurts of time, then they go away and do their INTP things and come back to the bubble. Rinse and repeat. I think this would be difficult for anyone who sought an ""entertaining"" or ""doting"" partner, but while INTPs can certainly be both, they kinda stick around for the bubble of giggles and conversation and general brain and bod massaging.

HumanSockPuppet,TheRedPill,1390600871.0,"&gt;In simpler terms, they're only human, and to expect more might be asking too much. Am I wrong?

Yes, you're missing something.

Men are human too, but we don't suffer from the same kind of crippling solipsism that renders us incapable of introspection, or incapable of abstractly assessing a situation by removing ourselves from the equation.

Women, however, **do** experience this. And they do it to such a degree that we (Red Pillers) have come up with a term to describe the process by which they retroactively ""improve"" their recollections and understandings of past events to fit with their present emotional needs: **Hamstering.**

**To call Hamstering an affliction, however, is to misunderstand the nature of a woman's needs.** Women rely upon men, and each other, to secure resources and safety - and they do this through social manoeuvering. As such, they are occasionally impelled to edit their ""histories"" in order to cope or manoeuver around a past decision which has placed her in *present danger*.

The point that /u/somedickcream is making is that THIS is the immutable nature of women. This is their reality. You cannot leave a sandwich near a dog and be angered and surprised to find it eaten when you return. *You must adjust your expectations for the dog.*"

IndignantChubbs,TrueAskReddit,1390600976.0,"I'm not saying being a manager is easy, I'm saying I don't think you need to incentivize it with higher pay because for many people leadership is appealing because they're good at it and enjoy the power, respect, impact they can have, whatever. I certainly don't think you need to incentivize it by paying a CEO 400 times what a worker makes. People will want to be CEOs if they get paid five times as much -- and, like I said, I think there'd be willing managers and executives even if they were paid no higher than any other worker.

I think it'd be better for employees to get to decide who the manager should be, honestly. I work at a restaurant. My manager is a nice, uninspiring guy who manages ineffectively. He isn't disliked but he isn't respected. We pretty much get by without him, and when we do need him he doesn't do anything special. That's not uncommon for a manager I don't think and I think the rest of us participating in the organization are the people with the best knowledge of the situation and therefore the best judgment about what ought to be done.

The owner fired our previous manager, who was excellent, over petty interpersonal politics, by the way."

Well, how would you like to sell these products yourself at parties *your* friends host, and you get to reap the rewards! 

What you do is you become one of our certified salespeople, and you buy from the company a certain amount of products per month, and then you sell those same products to friends and family. We'll even make it fun for you and provide you with goals you have to meet each month or you'll be penalized! By the way, whatever product you don't sell, the cost comes right out of your pocket, so be sure to really *stress* on your friends and family how much *fun* we have at these parties, and encourage them to buy as much as possible!

tehsuigi,toronto,1390601026.0,"&gt; This initiative wouldn't help that one bit, unfortunately.

Well it could, but in a very theoretical way. If there is excess capacity during off-peak hours (and yes, there is less of it), and there are people who otherwise would not be taking transit but are enticed by the timed transfer, then if those people take off-peak excess capacity transit with a token or cash fare, then the average fare per ride does incrementally go up.

Infinitesimally tiny, but possible.

&gt; Without getting a matching subsidy from the government for the amount they'll lose though, they'll have to cut service in other areas. It's the nature of the beast.

Agreed completely.

&gt; Although your first suggestion should be heeded by lots of people, especially if (when) the provincial budget doesn't pass...

Yes. We need more and louder voices for expanded transit funding. I'm withholding my vote from any candidate who doesn't promise increased taxes or fees to pay for transit. It's getting to the ""shut up and take my money"" point."

I understand it, but it makes me feel misrepresented. Even if I were to agree with what is happening. Part of it, I believe, is that wealth in VA is highly concentrated to the north and, IMO, wealth has a huge affect on even the ability to vote in a lot of cases. So it's more like wealth wins to me. Idk what I'm even trying to say tbh.

I just feel like the people in the north, in large part, dont work here and only live here to avoid high taxes etc from DC.

This Kalos safari does not share the same role at all. It's a post-game place to collect DW abilities without being forced to go to an online website that's sorta gimmicky.

IndependentBoof,skeptic,1390601063.0,"&gt;  I got 2.94 as the margin for error. Does that mean if the poll was a yes or no question that 55% of people said yes to, that would mean anywhere from 52.06% to 57.94% actually say yes?

Close, but not quite. It'd mean that if you polled everyone, the sample should be accurate within a *total* margin of 2.94 points (or between 53.53 and 56.47). However, sometimes polls report margin of error as ""+/- 2.94%"" in which case you would be correct.

&gt; What if it's a poll that returns numbers? Like how much money do you make a year?

These types of polls usually don't have open-ended questions. Instead, income would have an interval scale such as: 20k and below, 21-40k, 41-60k, 61-80k, 81-100k, Over 100k

To me, there's one annoying piece of the puzzle that be helpful to know: what happens to Gandalf's staff the first time he visits Orthanc? There are no details whatsoever about that in the text, that I've found. If Saruman took it from him, I would presume that it was for some reason -- though symbolic as you suggest or as a show of his continued power over Gandalf, is hard to say. The real question becomes where and how Gandalf got a new staff after he escaped with Gwaihir, if Saruman took it. If Saruman didn't take it at all, that suggests the staff is merely symbolic *or* so innately tied to the Wizard that only a special dispensation can allow another Wizard to deprive him of it.

These devs rarely work for one place more than a year before getting poached for a high paying gig the average business can't compete with. Not only that, but google is offering contracts to first year CS majors at Stanford.

There are more people getting into CS but not enough to fulfill demand. I'd argue that this is because our education isn't as good as it could be, so we don't have enough qualified talent getting into it. So instead we have to hire from out of the country. "

Cloud111,Equestrian,1390601338.0,"I always help out with extra chores. It actually happened that I simply took volunteer jobs working at various ranches and eventually was given access to certain horses to do with what I wished. So I actually started with volunteering and aspired to ""lessons"". But that's besides the point.

What I mean to say is, if you ask the ranch owner what you can do they'll give you things to do. And while you're working you'll meet other people that frequent the barn, you might even be asked to help them with something. I got a lot of my barn friends by doing this, for example when I was grooming a mare and they were trying to pick their horse's hooves and couldn't, he wouldn't pick his foot up for them. They asked for my help, I managed to get him to cooperate, and now the three of us are great friends!

Also, when someone that habitually cares for their horse comes around and always sees you flicking here and there doing a lot of work, they see your potential. I've been approached multiple times but older women who can't always make it to care for their horses as often as they've liked. I've been offered money to ride and groom other people's horses. Along the way you can make friends with those people until you become part of the community!

This is also a great way to get on good terms with the ranch owner, in every situation they've been extremely grateful to have someone to help with odd jobs. Sometimes it was just tying up new fencing or cleaning water buckets, but the dirty work makes you appreciate the bonding with the horses and the time in the saddle!"

steve496,49ers,1390601430.0,"I would not assume that Brown will be back.  He's likely to be more expensive than Brock was, so if we sign Brown it will be instead of someone like Whitner or Boldin.

There's also no guarantee that Culliver will be 100% upon returning - ACLs can take a while to fully heal. And while Cox was great in the playoffs, we *did* cut him last year as well.  And he's a free agent.

But lets assume you're right, and that we can run Brock/Culliver with Cox at nickel, and, say, Wright and Morris as depth.  That's fine for this year, but Culliver is entering the last year of his contract, and the most likely way Cox returns is on a 1-year RFA tender.  Which means that for the following year, our CBs under contract would be Brock and Morris.  And that's it.

You can make the argument that we could scrape by for 2014 (although I think more competition would help even there).  But we *definitely* need some prospects for to develop for 2015."

There are a lot of single guys at your age but as I said they never announce it and a lot of guys lie to their friends to seem successful at getting girls so don't trust rumours.

Orelle,blackladies,1390601517.0,"&gt; White people who are poor certainly suffer and are certainly oppressed, but it's not because of the color of their skin. And black people in their same situations are even worse off than they are.

*Yes.* Years ago, I wrote a thesis demonstrating a related issue, and my adviser — otherwise a really lovely and intelligent person who understood all kinds of abstract historical U.S. cultural intricacies (but not intersectionality apparently, somehow) — questioned me at length over whether poor black people could *really* be at more of a disadvantage than poor white people. I was sitting on the statistics to prove it and then some, and she was still unreasonably skeptical. Her argument was essentially the aforementioned comment: ""But there are poor white people, too!"" Yes ... I know .... ""There are more white people in poverty!"" But a far greater percentage of black people ....

We reached a point of mutual understanding, but the relative effort it took (compared to points that were much stickier to demonstrate, the ones I actually needed feedback on) made me wonder whether she debated me for more insidious reasons that go further down the rabbit hole of white privilege, e.g. viewing *me* cynically, or that I was highlighting black scholars who were not the names she was used to, etc. Either way, it sucked that the longest and most intense critique session I got centered on a point that my adviser should have understood if, minimally, she'd taken a 101 course on race or poverty or public policy. 

Furthermore, though this topic shouldn't be relegated to ethnic studies courses only, *this is why* ethnic studies is so important. Because even well-meaning white U.S. cultural scholars at 'progressive' institutions might look at you with a straight face and say, 'You shouldn't write about black economic disenfranchisement because there are poor white people, too.'"

koodeta,LSD,1390601581.0,"Music should be chill but enough so that you don't fall asleep. Nothing like Tame Impala, they're stoner chill where you want to sag into the couch. I'm partial to Griz though as an example.  

Object, nearly anything you think is cool and inviting. You can easily create something with your mind if you see it as such.

Ambiance should be fairly cozy where you have enough to occupy your thoughts and ears and eyes but not to the point of excess.

For food, I prefer to have fruit based drinks. Mango, Pineapple, Orange, and other. For the alcohol if you want any, I would go for a Chardonnay if you so choose.

Electronics are OK. It depends but don't occupy your time with the meaningless trivial pursuits it offers. Talk to people. You'll be surprised at the meaningful conversations you can have with people. Pose open ended questions. Have descriptions that ask about the other person and how they feel about this object, idea, etc. 

One thing I like to do is talk to people with ambient music in the background. Not too loud where it's a primary focus, but low enough so the room doesn't sound so empty when you stop talking. 

If you want some seriously trippy visuals, look at yourself in a mirror. HOWEVER, some people are affected really negatively by it and can ruin an entire trip. Only if you're liking the visuals you get then go for it. Granite is also a good visual mind bender. 

Look at a few paintings. Specifically abstract. They change and shift with your perception of reality and can change to a different setting and personality. If I have the opportunity, I want to take a day and trip in art museum. 

One thing you should do to test yourself is periodically you should take a simple object and draw it to the best of your ability. Then throughout the trip, draw it again. You'll see a reflection of your inner self and the trip at the point in time on the paper. "

sharshenka,changemyview,1390601614.0,"&gt; You'd be given as much time is necessary for each trial to prepare an adequate defense. You wouldn't be assigned X per day or week. You'd be at full capacity at your own pace.

I'm not saying the system would limit the available time. I'm saying your lawyer would have no incentive to take the neccesary time to prepare a good defence.

&gt; Also jury duty doesn't pay $70,000 a year.

Okay, how are lawyers paid in your system? A set rate per hour? Then they will drag every case out as long as possible because they don't know when they'll work again. They won't necessarily be more thorough, though, because their record doesn't matter. Guaranteed $70k a year? Then they'll spend as little time as possible on each case.

This system would just vastly increase the number of people who are poorly represented in the hope of increasing empathy. Why not just make death the punishment for every crime, that would also theoretically make juries more careful.

If you think rich people getting better lawyers is unfair, how about this. Pay public defenders top of the industry rates. Reserve them for people that make under $x per year. Mandate a very high win rate. Now the poorest people are the best represented. That might make the system more just.

maowsers93,texas,1390601623.0,"The pimp costume wasn't unfortunate, it was intentionally misleading. He was never wearing it during the interview and the person in the video called the cops on him. You can film people doing all sorts of stuff but when you heavily edit it and falsify aspects of it, it no longer becomes relevant. You can show a man being compliant all you want but when you omit the fact that he was going along with it out of concern and contacted the authorities immediately afterward you are lying. There is no two ways about it. 

There are multiple parts of this video like when the person calls Wendy Davis stupid that clearly have context being edited out of it. How can you take someone seriously that is showing a video insinuating that a Democratic group is calling her stupid when they're really repeating a retweet from an Abbott adviser. You can film someone quoting another person and pass it off as something they were saying all you want but it doesn't make it true. 

Furthermore, he is clearly trying to tie the voter registrar to BGT when he clearly can't since he had to list the woman's personal name and say that she was just a registrar. She isn't affiliated with a group and/or is just a volunteer. It has nothing to do with anything. Greg Abbott's followers have been calling Davis ""Abortion Barbie"" and ""retard"" since last summer. That doesn't mean Abbott said it and to try and tie the two together is absolutely absurd. 

I'm not distracting from anything and anyone who makes videos who's content can be ""distracted"" by facts, documentation, legal cases, and sources should never be taken seriously.

This may seem like it's fake, but what I'm about to say is 100% true. When my mother was young, she was very sick and needed medicine. Not all people [in the area we lived] liked Native [Americans, which we are], so we relied on a local medicine man. Years later, we discovered that the medicine she was getting wasn't helping her any more because she wasn't sick- she was haunted. She remembers seeing a demonic figure when she was younger, but at the time, she didn't know if it was real or not. This happened from when she could start to remember things up to when she was about 5. Well, thirty years later, that demonic figure started showing up again. But I know she wasn't just imagining it, because I could see it, hear it, and sometimes even feel something, like some sign of its presence. She started having nightmares, and we all knew what was happening. We decided to move back to our reserve to see if the problem or haunting was with the house, but it wasn't. No matter where she want, this thing followed her- and us. I'll be honest, for a very long time, I thought she was basically faking it, until one night. My mom used to cope with this haunting by drinking tea and coloring. This night, she was coping in the living room, and nothing seemed to be happening, so none of us expected that anything would happen. Suddenly, we heard screaming in the living room coming from my mom, and we all ran to see what was wrong. She was crying and screaming that something was scratching her back. I didn't believe her until I lifted the back of her shirt and fucking saw it with my own eyes- she was being scratched. There weren't just scratches already there, but scratch marks kept appearing as I watched, big, long, and red, over and over. I was terrified. I ran to grab some sweetgrass, and I was across the house when I heard the door open- it turns out my mom was walking towards the lake. Keep in mind that it's a Canadian winter, so it was about -35 (Not sure if F or C, but they'd actually be very close in this case) when she walked outside, barefoot and wearing nothing but her pajamas. After it happened, she didn't remember it, and to this day doesn't remember that night, but I still remember everything. We're afraid that it's starting to happen again: she is having brutal nightmares, and the entire family is starting to see black shadow figures. Another terrifying sign of this: We have a cat, and from time to time we'll notice it staring at a fixed point as if it is looking at someone or something, then it'll run away as if it's scared"

Iamsonoob,WritingPrompts,1390601679.0,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*This isn’t good. Not good at all.* Jim thought, as he drove through the darkness of night, down a winding forest road. *It’s been way too long. No. No! I can’t give in! This is why I left everyone in the first place; I don’t want to hurt anyone!* 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He had been visiting these woods for a nighttime drive a few days now, to calm his nerves. The presence of others that used to warm and comfort him, now made him tremble in fear of himself.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*How did this happen? Why do I feel such a desire?* Jim pleaded in despair. He was so successful: a loving husband, a good father, and even a wealthy man as his humble, yet expensive car showed. Jim glanced into the rear-view mirror at the back seats, and cringed as he saw the black, bloodstained leather gloves sitting there, glaring accusingly back at him. *At least out here, I’m alone; I can’t hurt anyone… Yes. It’s for the best.* 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Then, he saw her. *Oh no.* A hitchhiker. And worse. A young girl, likely barely over the age of eighteen. He knew he should keep on driving. He should just pass her by, and forget she ever existed. But he couldn’t. He hit the brakes in despair, cursing himself and his luck. He tossed his long, winter jacket into the backseat, covering his gloves, and then quickly broke in to a welcoming smile as she approached his car.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Thanks!” She cheerfully said as she climbed into the passenger seat. “You really saved me here.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “No problem, where to?” Jim asked, hoping she was going to ask for a city, or a house, or any place that would give him an excuse out of this mess.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “There’s a small bed and breakfast I was trying to reach, just a couple of miles down this road.” She replied.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Jim’s heart sank. “Oh. Okay then. I’m Jim by the way.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “My names Karina, but you can call me Kari.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “So what are you doing all the way out here Kari?”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Kari’s eyes flashed with enthusiasm. “I hoped you were going to ask! I’m going across the entire state and back with nothing except but what I have on my back,” She said, gesturing to the large hiker pack she placed in the backseat. “But I got a bit behind schedule today, and it got dark before I could get to tonight’s stop. I’m just lucky someone friendly picked me up, and not some psychopath murderer, right?” She joked, winking at him.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Oh? Maybe I *am* a murderer, and you just fell into my trap!” Jim retorted, looking at her wry smile. *You don’t know what you just got yourself into, naïve girl…* His smile turned into a grimace.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*You don’t know the irony in that statement.* “Kari” thought. Karina was of course a fake name. She’d forsaken her true name a long time ago, adopting different names over time to fulfill her purposes. She had been playing this “hitchhiker” bit for so long she could flawlessly emulate a weak and innocent girl. The reality was, she was a cold-blooded killer. And this man would be dead before he even knew what was happening. She had scouted out the location for sometime now. It was an old, wooden bed and breakfast run by an elderly married couple and it was so far out into the woods that few even knew of its existence. She was going to kill him there, get out quick, and get back to work planning her next prey’s demise. First, however, she had to find a way to make him stay the night.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Oh no! What will I do!” laughed the nameless murderer, rolling her eyes playfully. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Jim chuckled.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Is the this the turn?” He asked, nodding to a small dirt road trailing into the woods.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Yes, I think so,” Not-Kari said, smiling. They bumped and jostled in their seats until a clearing in the woods revealed a humble wooden house. A dim and modest iron lantern lighted the porch.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Wow, it looks like something out of a horror movie,” Jim noted, glancing at Kari. “Are you sure you’re going to be alright staying here?”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “I dunno. I kinda like it. I think it’s kinda homey.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “If you say so…” Jim looked uncomfortable. “Why don’t I walk you inside, just in case?” he said, reaching for his coat.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*Ha. Nice guys like this are so easy to manipulate, Not-Kari thought. But he’s right about one thing: it’ll be a place out of a horror movie soon enough.*
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Alright, thanks!” Not-Kari said with a smile, as they approached the door. *This’ll be a piece of cake.*

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Honey! We new visitors! Set places on the dinner table for two more!” The old man yelled heartily back into the house.  He was balding with white hair, and laugh lines etched his face. “Come in, come in! We’re always so short on customers these days that we’re happy for the company! I’m Dave. My lovely wife Cheryl was just making dinner, and we’ve got plenty enough for the both of you if you’d join us.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “I was just giving Kari here a ride,” Jim replied with his hands up. “I really have to get back out on the road.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Oh but you must at least stay for dinner, really, it’s on the house!”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Jim cursed the man’s hospitality in his head. *I really need to leave. Otherwise…* “I don’t know… it is getting late and I have still a ways to go until I get home.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Oh come on Jim,” Kari pleaded” you can’t turn down free food, right?” She added a wink at the end.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Oh, all right.” Jim said, resignedly. *Another one. I just can’t stop myself,* He thought with despair. *When will this monster finally be appeased?* He reached into his jacket and felt his gloves… and felt the slight catching of his finger on the edge of a knife cradled between them.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Then it’s settled!” Dave said cheerfully, ushering the two into the dining room. Then he left them alone to join his wife in the kitchen. A few minutes later, they both entered the room carrying serving bowls of turkey, of mashed potatoes, assorted vegetables, and a pot of gravy. After they ate and were well fed, they brought out apple pie and stuffed themselves full.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “I haven’t eaten that much since thanksgiving!” Jim remarked. “You certainly know how to treat a visitor right!”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Oh my! It’s nothing!” Cheryl replied blushing, holding a hand to her cheek and waving the other, “Anything for our guests!”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Are you still planning on going home Jim? It’s awfully late,” Dave asked.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Well-“

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Oh heavens! You can’t plan on going now! It’s so late! These roads are windy and you must be tired after all that turkey,” Cheryl interrupted. “No I won’t have it. You are staying and we’ll get you home tomorrow! And that’s final!”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Well, how can I say no?” Jim conceded. *I don’t want to do it. But I have to. Maybe this’ll be the last time. Maybe I just need to get it out and I’ll be done with it.* Jim continued to make excuses to himself all the way until he, along with everyone else, retired to bed. He debated with himself until he finally heard silence fall over the house. He swallowed. *Here it goes.*

If you want to see if they can use an IDE then just watch how they fix a broken test case. Testing for a remembered shortcut sequence is pointless, not only that but it might be throwing your candidates off balance. There are so many possible ways to accomplish tasks in an IDE that you should never do this. If you want to ask what their favorite IDE feature is or shortcut is then maybe. But you might as well just f-up the Java perspective and see if they know how to fix it in passing when you give them a unit testing prob.

As for the rest, this is a bad question. You are throwing too many things into the mix, the anonymous HashMap is really just too much. Not that it isn't a neat little bundle of stuff but the problem is that one aspect of your question might be obscuring the candidates knowledge of all the other topics. Unless the test is to see how they deal with complexity you should be favoring lots of small tests with low topic coverage instead of a small number of tests with high topic coverage.

Try this - instead of writing or discussing these problems as a team, have each person on your team create a couple of problems. Then in front of the team have each team member solve another members problem solo. If you still end up with problems as complex as this one then your team members are probably better than the average dev and you are going to have a lot of candidates to go through before you find similar talent.

Edit: Knowing that some collections are ordered and some are not is a completely reasonable expectation."

LinguistHere,SRSDiscussion,1390601697.0,"I think you've hit the nail on the head. I'm uncomfortable with the level of hostility and incredulity some posters in this thread are displaying toward the fact that this question is being asked, and how quickly the arguments are devolving into an oppression olympics. Descriptively, people living a BDSM/kink lifestyle are clearly in a sexual minority- fulfilling at least a literal reading of ""GSM""- and all manner of stigma and misunderstandings go along with that lifestyle. It may be difficult to classify that as *systematic oppression*, but then, as you say, the same could be said for what asexual people experience. Given those facts, I don't think it's insulting or appropriative at all for someone to ask the question whether that makes it useful to classify such people under the GSM umbrella. After all, when it comes to GSM issues, isn't the overarching argument the notion that competent, enthusiastically consenting adults ought to be free to express their gender identity and sexuality in whichever way is most comfortable to them, without undue legal or societal hinderance?

On the other hand, the same argument could be made to varying degrees for just about anyone who has a ""nontraditional"" element somewhere in their gender/sexual expression. Do polyamorous people count as GSMs? Do people in interracial relationships count as GSMs (at least in places where that's stigmatized)? Depending on how literally you read ""GSM"", it's hard to know where to draw the line.

Still-- bottom line-- whatever words we use, I don't think we should be in the business of telling anyone that their experience of stigma or oppression is invalid."

What made the problem worse was the fact that the game had a PvP element. Do you remember that level 40 that kicked your ass when you were a level 5?  Well now you're level 40 but he's level 60! It was very difficult to play catch up without artificial barriers to stop them.

bombeater,feelsofjustice,1390601912.0,"I've had a spate of bad games recently and it's been turning me off of solo queue completely.

The thing about people who say ""mute them"" is that, by the time you have to mute someone, you've *already* had a negative experience. And you literally can't mute people in champ select. I've started dodging games where my entire team rages in champ select, but it hasn't really changed much, because people are still just as likely to explode once the enemy team gets firstblood or a good multi-kill.

I love what Riot's been doing with their behavioral team, but man, I dunno if it's worth the frustration to play solo queue. I might just stick to ARAMs and Ranked 5's."

I would like to know how in the hell you got the idea in your head that people would want to watch people introduce and then play board games.

On the other hand, I just watched a couple minutes of it and I'm totally interested in it and think it's freakin' awesome!  I have always wanted a better way to vet games that my fiancee might be willing to play with me.. now we can watch live demos, have the mechanics described, etc and pick games out based on more than the box!

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1390602030.0,"Four reasons for this: 
First, women tend to naturally gravitate only to people with higher social value than themselves. Men who cannot attract women successfully have very low social value, or at least, lower than the average woman. 

Second, men who can't attract women often have weak social and seduction skills so you wouldn't likely be their friend anyway.

Third, the amount of sex partners men have is directly correlated with how much men respect other men, so if you work one or two men who do tame strange regularly, the other men will typically lie about their numbers to not seem inadequate.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not-Kari couldn’t believe her luck. The foolish old couple actually got him to stay. They would regret that when they found him next morning, and she escaped, leaving them with the handbag. She slowly got out of bed, careful not to make any noise. She rifled through her pack, softly humming to herself, wondering what tool she would use this time. Eventually, she found what she was looking for: an ice pick. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *Perfect,* She thought, a small, sinister smile forming across her lips. She tiptoed to the door and slowly opened it. It creaked, and she swiftly pushed the ice pick up into her sleeve. The victim’s room was to the right on the end and the two old fools had the master bedroom set up to the left on the other end by the stairwell and the bathroom. She casually walked over to the bathroom, not bothering to mask her footsteps, and paused to inspect the master bedroom. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *Hmmm… Lights are off.* She listened for noises to indicate that the elderly couple was still awake. Instead, she heard the old man snoring loudly. *Perfect.* Erring on the side of caution, she walked into the bathroom and flushed the toilet. Then she turned on the sink for a few seconds and walked back to her room, opening and closing the door without walking in. Then she stalked over to Jim’s door. *Now the fun begins.*
___________________________________________________________
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Jim heard to door to Kari’s room close. *Now’s the time. I’m sorry, Kari.* He reached into his coat pocket, and pulled on his leather gloves, and picked up the knife gingerly. He approached the door, and his face changed. His eyes opened wide, and an eerie smile split his face. He gripped the knife tight, whitening his knuckles. He felt the thrill fill him. *Oh but I’ve missed this.* He pushed open the door.
___________________________________________________________
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not-Kari reached for the doorknob, and then jumped to the side, as it swung open. *I didn’t hear him!* She thought, pressing her back against the wall as the opening door blocked her victim’s view of her. She peeked out and saw him approaching her room. *What is he doing?* Then she saw the knife in his hand, and shock turned into realization. *Well this is interesting… I don’t think I’ve ever killed a killer before!* She slowly pushed the door back, and let the ice pick drop into her hands from her sleeve. Then she charged at him.
___________________________________________________________
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Jim had just reached her door when he heard footsteps. He turned around in surprise, but he was too late. Kari tackled him to the ground, and his knife clattered to the floor, just out of reach. She had an ice pick pointed to his throat.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “So you knew?” Jim asked. He looked away. “I’m sorry. It’s… an addiction I suppose. I guess part of me is happy that you caught on and were able to defend yourself. Go ahead, scream, alert the owners, get me arrested. I’m just relieved this is finally over for me.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Kari had a quizzical look on her face. Then she laughed. She laughed and laughed, and her eyes took on those of a demon.
 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “You fool, don’t you get it? I’m just like you.” Jim’s eyes widened in horror. “But you are right, it is over for you.” She paused. “Do you feel it? The thrill of the hunt? Your eyes tell me you understand. I bet your blood was pumping when you thought of cutting me to pieces. Don’t you just love it?” 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “I-I hate it.” Jim said, eyes lowering in shame. “I wish I didn’t have to live a life of secrecy, of shame, of wondering if I can hold back the beast in me that wants to kill. I hate living every day thinking that I’m going to snap and kill my wife! Or even… even my beautiful daughter.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Well,” the woman who called herself Kari said with finality, “You won’t have to live with it anymore.” 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Jim glanced hopefully at his knife. She followed his eyes.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ""Oh no you don’t!” she said, raising the pick to strike. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; **BAM!** Kari’s head exploded, her body flying off his. A loud crack echoed through the house, causing Jim’s ears to ring. He looked at her body in shock, and then turned his head. Behind him stood Dave steadily holding a shotgun, with Cheryl standing behind him. Relief washed over him.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Th-thank you! You sav-“ He froze. Cheryl brandished from behind her back a large butcher’s knife. She and Dave both stared at him as a wicked grin split both their faces.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “No. Thank you,” Cheryl said, walking slowly and bending down. “We haven’t had a good meal in so long.” 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Jim screamed as she brought the knife down on his neck."

mrcleanup,confession,1390602171.0,"You are already getting a lot of great advice here. The main thing I would recommend for you is that you need to remember that diet isn't something you do to lose weight, it is a lifestyle change, so you should consider your dietary changes to be a permanent thing, it will evolve over time, but it will never be the same as it was before.

Regarding keto. It isn't necessarily the fat that matters with keto, it is all of the things that the fat displaces, specifically carbohydrates. Carbohydrates interact with your body in a way that tells it to store energy for later (as fat). Everyone has their own thresholds, but when your body gets over a certain level of carbohydrates, it shifts gears, into energy storage/fat creation mode. Right now you are out of balance, the idea is to find a diet that is out of balance, but in the opposite direction. You want a diet that you can lose weight on consistently and gradually, while still getting proper nutrition. Weight loss too fast is hard on your body too, so as long as you are losing weight consistently, don't try and ramp things up to lose it faster.

And lastly, when your weight comes down, remember that your diet will need to change again. A body does need to be able to retain some fat. So as you near your target weight you start introducing more healthy carbs, from vegetable and fruit sources preferably, so that your weight loss slows, and then stabilizes where you want it to be. This is how you convert your weight loss diet to a weight maintenance diet.

I imagine that right now you are doing a lot of research. It is going to take a while for you to sort through what everyone is telling you. For now, here's a good rule of thumb, if you restrict a few key things, it will start getting easier to lose weight. Here's what you want to avoid: potatoes, flour, sugar, fruit juice, alcohol.

atrain728,civ,1390602238.0,"The people that tell you you have to decide from turn one are *wrong*. Unless you're playing Immortal/Diety, but then that's basically true for every victory scenario.

You do have to decide earlier than other victory scenarios, however, but it's much more fluid than Vanilla where you really *did* have to decide at the beginning of the game: Founding more than 2-4 cities was the end of your cultural victory attempts.

A cultural victory in Civ5 is amassing tourism. You can start building tourism in the early game, but it really doesn't blow up until the mid-late game.

Wide or tall doesn't matter as much. You should be able to gather plenty of culture to fill out the requisite trees. I've won a cultural victory (Emperor) with 10 cities, for instance, with several of them being conquests.

If you feel like you're trending towards a cultural victory, get all of the artists guilds built with as many GP benefits as possible. Ideally they're all in the same city so they can get the National Epic benefit. But that can be a lot of specialist slots to fill. Not only will they create lots of culture by working the specialists, but the great people will create lots of works of art to stuff your slots.

So that's the other half: You need to have places to put all these works of art. If you play tall, you're going to need some wonders to provide you ample slots. If you play wide, you'll probably be okay with basic cultural buildings - but the wonders certainly help.

You can also augment this victory scenario with the Sacred Sites reformation policy. Or use that altogether.

There's a lot of ways to go, really. I'd recommend grabbing Tradition, Piety, Aesthetics and Exploration with Freedom as soon as it's available. You may or may not fill out Exploration, but getting the opener so you can grab the Louvre is key. Finishing tradition is nice because that'll let you buy Great Engineers with Faith, which can help you grab some of those late game wonders. It'll also help you if your victory scenario appears to be screwed, you can buy Spaceship parts with Order instead.

But with all things in Civ, just go try it and see how it goes. It's pretty easy to figure out once you're working towards it."

Most are 9-5, $10-15/hr. Some are for more than one day. All of them are painfully easy. If you don't get a job after 2 or 3 hours of waiting, they pay you some flat wait rate and you go home.

While I'm completely for what you're doing, I'm not a fan of this.  If you want to call someone an adult, let them be an adult.

Clockw0rk,AdviceAnimals,1390602317.0,"It goes both ways.

If someone is paying more attention to their phone than the person they're supposedly there to be with, then they're only there for some concept of obligation and they don't actually want to be there.

Passive aggressive reddit posts hoping your phone obsessed friend stops doing what they're doing is not the right approach. You either need to confront the person and let them know that their disinterest in being social with you is obvious and unappreciated, or you need to stop inviting them over and let them decide when they want to participate.

It's a hard lesson, but sometimes you discover the friends that never seem very into hanging out, don't ever call to initiate hanging out. If you're 'stuck' with a friend who isn't interested in who you are and what you're doing, you should stop expending effort and expectations on them and meet people who *are* interested.

Case in point: My favorite bar is a barcade. I invite my gamer buddies to come hang out when I go there. But the ones who reclined more than three times in a row or didn't respond to texts? They no longer get direct invites, they're lumped into impersonal group invites on facebook.

It doesn't mean I don't like them or they don't like me, it just means they aren't interested in the barcade, so I don't bother them with it. We hang out and do other things we're mutually interested in."

Thank you for coming here to do this AMA. I’ve been a huge fan of yours, and I feel that all your movies are beyond brilliant (especially Her, I felt a real connection to Theodore). If you don’t mind, I have a few questions for you, please feel free to answer whichever you’d like, or none at all if you do not feel like it. 

-I read that Chris Cooper did multiple takes for each scene in Adaptation, doing the scene with a different emotion each time. How did you pick which take to choose?

-I also read that you had Nicolas Cage (praise be unto him) ignore his actor’s instinct for this movie. How did you advise him differently?

-Has it been different doing your last few movies without Charlie Kaufman? I also really hope that you two will continue to collaborate in the future, he’s one of my absolute screenwriters, and you’re on of my favorite directors. It’s too perfect.

-I’ve also noticed that you seem to like to use very under-rated actors/actresses in your films (John Cusak, Nic Cage, Catherine Keener, Joaquin Phoenix, etc.). Is this deliberate, or am I just grasping at straws?

-How did you learn to write screenplays? I am an aspiring writer, but I don’t think they have any classes at my university on screenplay writing. Any tips?

-Are you thinking of doing any more short films? I’m Here is one of my favorite shorts.

-Lastly, what was it like to work with Weezer and the Beastie Boys for the music videos you directed (I love the Buddy Holly video, and the video for Sabotage is an absolute classic)

Thanks you again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!

1) While making music videos, Who was your favorite act to work with. Were their any bands that just clicked with you?

2) Those pants in her looked damned uncomfortable, Will you be picking up a pair in the near future?

3) Are you a 'leaf person' as Molina implied in Coffee and Cigarettes?

mehatch,QuotesPorn,1390602814.0,"&gt; hey can have significant value when they are used as proofs that two supposedly unrelated things are actually the exact same thing.

Thats a very, very good point :)

To your second point, that's a totally fair analysis if we grant his premises. 

However, If we further drill down into his premises and structure, what he's really getting at I think is that although from our subjective point of of view as a part of the totality of 'life' we may intuitively find life to be 'special', i.e. separate from and more important than rocks and sand and whatnot, which is a fair point, the life/not-life distinction is a frame of our choosing, and not a truly objective category, since all categories are inherently artificial frames we use to usefully categorize reality (which is inherently without true embedded categories or special essences) into manageable chunks. But a larger view outside of our 'specialness' reveals a nihilistic truth which I (mehatch) do agree with. 

But where he runs into trouble is that what might be a useful critique of our tendency to project reality with (albeit useful) frames and heirachies of specialness with us at the top, get's ironically muddled and unecessarily entangled by Gaiman's use of yet a new and, IMHO, not very useful re-categorization of life as disease. 

The problem here is that 'disease' as a term is only useful insofar as it acts as a category within life which is detrimental to humans or other 'higher order' life. 

To dilute 'disease' to mean 'all life' functional castrates the word, thereby undermining the very impact he'd like the word to have to begin with. 

So, in other words, he just redefines 'diease' to not mean 'bad life' but 'all life', and creates his own echochamber within the quote itself. 

Functionally, the whole thing just folds back on itself into nothingness, and so as a quote, really offers no useful wisdom or insight of any kind. 

If he were to say 'get off your high horse, we're all a disease to some other kind of lifeform' that would have had at least some kind of insightful efficacy, but his definitional sleight of hand does lead me to that same 'meh', but if anything, I give him points for stirring up a fun discussion :)

edit: I very much enjoy your perspective on this though, and pointing out that part I missed, ergo, visa-vis, enjoy the gold."

GunmetalJane,Foodforthought,1390603207.0,"A soup kitchen is where you can go to get a prepared, hot meal.

(not a literal in-your-house pantry)

Soup kitchens tend to attract the MOST disadvantaged -- the homeless and the  essentially homeless...these are people who literally wouldn't have a kitchen to cook in even if you gave them food to cook. It's one hot meal to shore you up at least a little bit.  

Food pantries attract the slightly-less disadvantaged -- the working poor, the elderly, single-parent households; basically, people who don't have enough food to cook, even though they might have a kitchen to cook in."

Four years later, while in high school, my principal noticed that my pants were not ""issued"" khakis.  When asked for my I.D., she noticed that my shirt had a bird emblem on it (my I.D. hid it).  She instantly suspended me for the rest of the school day and I had detention and in-school-suspension for the rest of the week (three days).  Parents found out and flipped their shit.

However, if seafood is some special request of his, seafood alfredo is a good idea.

Pasta: get linguine or fettucine and cook to package directions (i.e. boil about 10 minutes then drain)
Aflredo: http://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/cooking-basics/how-to-make-alfredo-sauce/   - it's really super easy
Seafood: I recommend shrimp. Scallops are simple, too, but can get overcooked way too easily. Get a back of frozen, shelled, de-veined shrimp. A couple minutes before cooking, run them under cool water to defrost. DON'T let them turn pink. Melt some butter in a pan. Toss in the shrimp and add salt and pepper. You can also add garlic and/or worcestershire sauce for a kick. (all this is in a skillet over medium) You do not want to cook the shrimp more than 5 minutes. Just flip them every minute or so. When they're all opaque/pink, you're good. 


But if you don't *have* to have seafood, do steak and potatoes and french onion soup. "

https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9994699/1/Just-What-Needs-To-Be-Thrown-Aside

(Spoilers in link through Chapter 53 of the manga--you have been warned)

**""What is the true cost of final victory? Set after Chapter 52 of the manga. Centered primarily on Armin, but with significant appearances by other characters as the Survey Corps and the remaining members of the 104th confront their doubts, heal from betrayal, and steel themselves for the future struggle.""**

This work is a collection of largely Armin-centric oneshots, though I plan to have chapters from other character POVs as well. Four chapters are now complete, and a fifth is currently in progress.

The stories are largely serious, largely canon-compliant, and very character-driven. Accurate character portrayal is important to me, so I've done my best in that regard (please leave feedback!). I also enjoy expanding on the world of SnK, its backstory, and its minor characters, so I've done my best to give the setting and secondary characters a little development too. I try very much to stay true to the themes and feel of the manga, and my stories are largely set between manga chapters so that they almost fit in the canon storyline.

**I hope you enjoy reading! I'd appreciate any constructive feedback or comments you might have!**"

xthorgoldx,Frisson,1390603611.0,"Decent enough post, but on the afternote:

Frisson =/= ASMR. Heck, ASMR's own sidebar describes how they're different. ASMR is more related to physically-based attention; generally, things like soft whispers, routine noises, and tasks requiring focused attention on a singular subject trigger ASMR.

Frisson, while it elicits some of the same sensations, has a higher-level trigger set, usually related to amazement/wonder in a particular setting. Music with fantastic chord harmonics, pictures that carry accessible and deep meaning, videos that express themes that touch on soft points of human psychological intricacies are what trigger frisson.

**tl;dr**

ASMR = Chills from having a loved one whisper in your ear

Frisson = Chills from experiencing something fleeting and amazing

2. Well, my absolute favorite brand *was* Elomi, but I lost too much weight and they don't make 32 bands so I am favorite-less. Maybe Tutti Rouge, but I've only had 1 of their bras that I love so far.

3. Panache. Nothing they have in larger cup sizes fits well. It's very poorly scaled-up and they put the shoulder straps in my armpits.

4. 2.5

5. LOW GORES! high ones are uncomfortable and visible in even moderately scoop-neck shirts when they scale up a high gore in H+ cup sizes. What looks reasonable on the ~30F model is suddenly up to my chin when I wear it. 

6. Medium-ish. I don't mind when they're wide since it isn't uncomfortable, but there's no reason for them to go back as far under/behind my armpit as they do.

7. Almost never

8. I've only had that problem with Freya (and I *despise* that look)

9. Plunge! also balconette. basically anything that's not full-coverage

10. Fabric cups (but my favorites are fabric with a little bit of lining like the Panache/Cleo Juna)

Bonus: I hate the lack of selection available, and I hate how many different styles have the straps so wide that they could not possibly fit over a normal human's shoulders. Oh, and extra-hate: Why do I not deserve a strapless bra?!"

Riali,ABraThatFits,1390603887.0,"You want the bra to fit your larger breast, and in the 36C you've got some tissue escaping under your arm on the larger side, and the gore is trying to inch away too.  Try some 32Es (This is only one cup volume bigger than 36C), being careful to swoop and scoop everything in.  (In case:  Swooping and scooping means that as you put on your bra, you lean over at 90 degrees and use your hands to shove everything you can into the cups, while making sure the wire sets right in the crease at the bottom of your breast.)  It will gape on the smaller side, and you can deal with this by either adjusting the strap shorter on that side, or using a cutlet, or a combination of the two.  The rationale is that a little gape on the smaller side is preferable to quadboob and wires cutting in on the bigger side.

I really don't think 34 bands are what you want except in bras that run smaller than true to size, and 34D is the same cup volume as 36C, so you'll run into very similar fit problems as you're having here.

No - the *best*. As I demonstrated with the numbers listed above. And as I said earlier, the *very first year* Brady received first-round talent, he had the greatest season a quarterback has ever played at the time. Imagine the roles reversed - give Manning Dobson, Thompkins, Edelman, and a banged-up Gronk for 6.5 games (also, a [torn ligament in his throwing hand](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/01/19/report-tom-brady-had-ligament-damage-in-his-hand-in-october/)) and give Brady Demaryius Thomas, Eric Decker, Julius Thomas and Wes Welker in Denver's style of offense. I'd bet the house that Brady puts up comparable numbers. I'm not saying Manning is a bad quarterback - I think he's one of the two or three best of all time. But Brady, in the years he's had similar caliber weapons, has actually been more efficient than Manning has.

Also, the way the last paragraph of your argument is worded suggests that you realize that Manning has a greater receiving corps this year than Brady ever has. So why is that in Manning's favor?"

LawBobLoblaw,movies,1390603963.0,"When the full trailer came out for it, I sat my dad down to a full-screen on my computer, fully loaded in 1080p viewing of it. I had already seen the trailer, and I brought him in and gave him no heads up as to what the trailer was for. He sat down, I pushed play, and let YouTube do its thing:

A mans body floats in the water riddled with steel and flaming pieces wood, and a child speaks about being an outcast. The man has flashbacks of the child running, hiding from his peers, only for his mother to gently call him out. The man wakes up while still underwater as the next scene is of him in this ice tunnel, speaking to an older man. 

""Who am I?"" The man once in the water asks.

""So much more,"" the older man states.

At this point my eyes are glued to my dad, who is watching the screen like he's just doing it because I asked him. But, when the man questioning his identity steps out from the ice palace while donning a blue suit and red cape, I very clearly remember my dads eyes lighting up and having a ""no way"" look on his face . My dad instantly puts the trailer clues together and realizes who it is:

Superman.

I felt such simple joy watching my dad get surprised at not just seeing Superman on screen, but the first news he's heard of it. It's not even a movie I'm part of in anyway, but it's so rewarding getting that surprise factor in when someone recognizes such a familiar character in an unexpected time.

So yeah, I love sitting in the theater only to see new trailers to movies I'm looking forward to. I've always said to the person next to me, ""the movie could completely suck, but if the trailer lineup is great, then it's worth the money.""

I think some of us just love that surprise to see something new in the cinematic world we love.

That said, stop watching trailers."

Cloud111,Equestrian,1390604054.0,"I love that cute little head cock! I had worked with a mentally disabled paint mare named TC (Too Cute) for a while. She was a joy to work with except that she just wasn't the same as other horses, you couldn't expect her to act like them. Her reactions came very suddenly and randomly. I could feel it countering the horse sense that I  had been adapting to. As an example, I was leading her from pasture one day, and had a reasonably tight lead line because she was new to me. Very suddenly she stepped back, spun, and started running back to pasture, only to stop immediately after the lead had been partially tugged from my hand. She was calm the second I scolded her. The moment felt strange, the way and speed it played out at wasn't like with other horses. But I love the girl, they're definitely fun to keep around! I can't believe people think they're any less valuable than a ""normal"" horse! :P"

So. Loli but without censor bars? You'd be surprised at how many shows are out there that will satisfy this. I'll just point out three of them. 

(I'll also agree fully with Non Non Biyori below. Matches your request PERFECTLY. And absolutely nothing needs to be censored.)  

[Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukenai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10719/Boku_wa_Tomodachi_ga_Sukunai): Also called Haganai!, the loli involved is the sister to the MC. 

[Toaru Majutsu no INdex](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index): The title character is a loli nun. SweartafeckinBran, she is a loli nun. Also has one of the major badass MCs in modern anime.  

[Toradora!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!): She's supposed to be 17 in the show, but the Palm-Top Tiger is very loli indeed.

kempff,Cooking,1390604105.0,"Recipe - traditional, measurements are approximate, cook must taste as he goes.

Yields about a gallon of stew, about 10-12 servings (or 128 servings for people who have never tried it before).

* a couple **cow stomachs**, maybe three pounds total, rinsed scrupulously and sliced with a very sharp knife into half-inch squares (see notes)
* enough **water** to cover, generally around 10 cups
* a fistful of **marjoram**, the defining and therefore obligatory spice in this dish, tied in a bunch so you can pull it out at the end, or several teaspoons dried
* several tablespoons of **beef soup starter** powder or paste or something like it such as bouillon or broth base, enough to give the broth a strong flavor
* ordinary mirepoix, that is, a medium **onion**, a couple of **carrots**, and a couple of sticks of **celery**, diced
* a fistful of **parsley** tied in a bunch so you can pull it out at the end, or several teaspoons dried
* a couple teaspoons of **allspice**
* a couple teaspoons of **paprika**
* a couple teaspoons of unground black **peppercorns**
* a teaspoon of **nutmeg**
* a few **bay** leaves
* a small (6oz) can of **tomato paste**
* enough **cornstarch** to thicken the stew however thick you like it, generally around five tablespoons pre-dispersed in a coffee cup of cold tap water
* a loaf of **rye bread**, that has caraway

1. Rinse and cut up the tripe and put it in a big soup pot with enough water to cover it and set it to boil.
2. Meanwhile chop up all the vegetables and add them (I like to set my vegetable slicer on top of the pot and dice them directly in). Saute the mirepoix first if you like, but use an unassuming oil with a complementary flavor such as butter or beef fat.
3. Also toss in the marjoram and parsley bunches, all of the spices and tomato paste.
4. Boil moderately for about one or two hours, stirring now and then. You may want to boil uncovered, to perfume/humidify the house and to concentrate the stew.
5. After the tripe is no longer tough (it will still be a little rubbery, like calamari), correct the seasonings to taste. Be advised you may need to add a second entire portion of a given spice to get the flavor profile you like.
6. Finally fish out the marjoram and parsley bunches (discard, or eat them as cook's privilege) and add the cornstarch slurry until the stew is as thick as what you'd normally get out of a can of stew.
7. Serve with caraway-flavored rye bread.

**Smacznego!**

Notes

* Cow stomach smells exactly like those frogs you dissected in high school biology. This is normal.
* The smell does not go away when you cook it. Yes, flaczki is an acquired taste. But that's where the marjoram and the caraway-flavored rye bread come in. Something about the interplay of the off-aroma of the tripe with the marjoram and caraway makes it a lot less offensive, in my opinion.
* Raw tripe is as tough as a silicone spatula, so your knife must be big, long, weighty, and above all honed correctly. Use long gentle strokes to cut.
* One method of saving time cutting is to roll up the whole stomach into a log and slice this into whorls, then lay the whorls down and slice them crosswise so that the result is a mixture of squares and rectangles of irregular dimensions.
* Sorry about not being able to pin down exact quantities for the recipe. In the above-pictured batch I happened to have used up all of the carrots and celery that were about to go bad, about twice as much as is called for in the written version, and it just makes for a more deliciously varied batch.
* Sure you can thicken with a buttery or beef-fatty roux of white flour, but cornstarch gives it a gorgeous shine that glistens off the chunks of tripe.
* Notice I didn't add any salt? Because there's enough salt in the soup starter."

**Five favorite things**

1. Freedom- weekends are yours to choose, class habits are up to you, and your parents aren't watching over your shoulder. Even if something comes up and you feel homesick, they're a phone call away.

2. The people- You meet so many people from different places and different walks of life. Embrace it. You become friends with so many different people and that's perfectly fine. You can be friends with someone who does the same things you do, or you can befriend someone who has done all you want to. I mean, I embrace the fact that my roommates don't like pizza or chocolate....kinda...

3. Columbus- campus may seem like a small city, in and of itself, but sometimes we forget that the city is 10 minutes on a COTA bus away. The restaurants and the atmosphere of the city is really nice. The convenience of the Nationwide Center for Blue Jackets game or for a concert. It's a nice break away from school.

4. Pride- Every school has their own school pride, but coming here I can say I am a Buckeye for Life. It's the love for the school and the passion for it that reminds me that everyone here loves it. We all take pride in our band and our sports teams. We have our traditions from singing Carmen Ohio to the Mirror Lake Jump. We have the chants at the stadium and the songs we sing with the band. I have never felt so unified than at this school and going home I will defend this school till the end (I'm from Pennsylvania and everyone usually goes to Penn State)

5. The classes- And I second the previous two posts but while the teachers may or may not be your cup of tea, some classes have taught me a lot and I definitely would not change anything for the world. My friends are in my classes and that makes everything so much better.

**Things I wish I knew**

1. Worrying about self-image is not worth your time. College is to figure out who you are and to not be ashamed.

2. If you want that 4.0 or that 3.8, you are going to have to work really really hard. This isn't high school. 

3. You really shouldn't compare yourself to others. You can only strive for what you accomplish, not what anybody else accomplishes. 

4. There will be a lack of monies. That's not a joke.

5. Do everything. Get over involved because you can always back out but you cant get back in. Joining and participating in clubs and events is not only a way to meet people, but to experience something that other schools can't offer."

But it wasn't something you could come out and say, ""I beat my wife and I don't care who knows!"" Abusers then as now would prefer to keep it under the rug because they didn't want to get a bad reputation---even if no one cared enough to actually DO anything about it, people would still call you names behind your back and think poorly of you for hurting a ""helpless female."" 

Reputation was very important and even a man who saw nothing wrong with beating or raping his wife wouldn't want people to know about it, and certainly wouldn't go boasting about it to his buddies like he was some kind of paragon of virtuous ""natural"" manhood---men were supposed to be the strong protectors of the frail fainting women, not their abusers. That was actually one of the major arguments against women's suffrage/women's rights: Women (of the middle and upper classes, at least) were supposed to be too delicate and fragile to be able to handle the stress of voting or higher education or most jobs that didn't involve a needle. Men were supposed to ""defend and protect"" them by taking care of all that icky political and intellectual stuff for them."

VoxMeretricis,AskMen,1390604442.0,"&gt;I’m really sick of trying and I don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending to be someone I’m not, I don’t know how much longer I can cope with everything being wrong and broken and ugly. I am desperately trying not to be bitter with everything, but its so hard no to. Its so hard not to have negative feelings towards people and things in general when things have been like this for so long.

Here's the best I can suggest: stop trying. Right now, you are fighting a war against yourself, and you are your greatest enemy. Sometimes pain can't be fought or conquered, it has to be experienced. Call a truce with yourself. I know that ""fake it until you make it"" is common advice, and I think in general it is good advice, but right now it's not what you need, because you're invalidating your own experiences and unhappiness. You have a right to be unhappy, you know. You have a right to be angry. You got dealt a shitty hand, and you deserve to have someone acknowledge that. 

Accept that you are in pain right now. Give yourself permission to be in pain. Give yourself permission to be angry. Your feelings are valid, they are worthwhile, and they are deserved. Just... be angry. 

Now, the hard part of course, is that for the sake of your future happiness and peace, you can't continue to be angry forever. But I think the first step along that journey is to stop and say, ""Actually, I've got a right to be angry and unhappy because things suck right now. What I feel is important, and it deserves recognition."" 

The second step is to make your life goal your own happiness. That can be tough, because sometimes our happiness is contingent on other people and that's something we can't control - you can't magically manifest a girlfriend, for example. But there are things that can make you happy that are in your control. I think the first ought to be a refusal to accept the general cultural discourse on beauty. Stop and look around - there are some really hideous people who have found love. Seriously. Been to walmart lately? I promise it's true. *You don't need to buy into what people tell you is beautiful. They are lying to you. Stop believing their lies.* You need to buy into what you value outside of beauty. Intelligence, humor, kindness. Happiness. 

Find other avenues for your goals. Do you hate the gym? It sounds like it. Fuck the gym. Stop going. There are other ways to stay fit and healthy. You don't need bulking/cutting to help your skin, you need to realize that your skin isn't that important. Find something that you enjoy - your happiness is what matters, not how you look. 

&gt;why should I have any obligation to the world when it has rejected me?

You know what? You shouldn't. Stop trying to fulfill the world's obligations. Fuck them. Fuck what they think about your weight, fuck what they think about your skin, fuck what they think about your money. *Make yourself happy.* You don't owe anyone anything. You don't owe them your beauty or ugliness. You don't owe them your happiness or bitterness. 

You owe yourself peace.

TofuRobber,changemyview,1390604471.0,"&gt;What happens with Hinduism, zen, buddhism, jainism, Tao, etc, is that there is no one scripture. These religions are 'spread out' if I may. They encompass thousands of stories and hundreds of characters, and as you grow up listening to those stories, you realize that the aim is only to make a certain point, and 'historical validity' is ignored to such an extent that today, no one cares if Hindu heroes like Ram, Krishna etc. were real people, immortal gods, or just legendary figures. Being so, you are left with hardly anything concrete as a 'precondition to believe' as a part of the religion.

Exactly. If you're wiling to cherry pick any story from any religion, you can still tell the story without the context of the religion. If that's the case then there's no point in actually keeping to the religion. You seemed to miss my main point. Religious story can help people, for sure, granted that you can cherry pick those from those stories. But that will require cherry picking which isn't a good thing because it spreads misinformation, good and bad. You can encourage that or you can simply avoid it all together and teach morals though and many other means out there without resorting to a fallacy.

&gt; I can not discard religion away entirely, because it has an important archaic value at the least. 

Then you can leave it to the historians. I don't know any reasonable person who would argue that religion should be completely destroyed with no remnants left. I would say that atheist argue that religion should be left behind, not forgotten. Religions are historically significant. 

&gt;A person who talks of discarding science over religion never wants to see science flawlessly at work, and one who wants to discard religions entirely, also has not seen the entire picture...

You seem to misunderstand what I was saying. I'm not arguing for the complete removal of religion. I'm presenting the question, If you only want to follow the good parts of religions, why follow any religion at all? You seem to simply defending religions now, without considering my arguments. You're making excuses and you're not rebutting what I've said.

1. Cherry picking is inherently bad therefore you should never cherry pick even if it's for a good cause.
2. Good does not override bad. Good is good and bad is bad and you have to respond to each accordingly.
3. Bad people are bad people. It doesn't matter what they believe. People should accept others for who they are not what they believe. Arguments should however always be made according to rationality and evidence.
4. If you're not following the religion in it's entirety then you are not following the religion at all. If you are only choosing what you want to follow you are still free to follow it without following a religion and if you're already doing that much then you might as well not follow the religion at all."

Explicit 


Dean/Sam


Summary: In Jefferson, Texas a man ends a generations-old curse and saves all the town's children, but completely loses his memory in the process. When it's discovered that he's a wanted criminal, the town comes together to conceal him out of gratitude for what he's done for them, giving him an apartment, a job and a whole new life. It takes seven months for Sam to find Dean, and when he finally does, he has to adapt to being around a man who has no idea that he used to be Sam's brother.


Commentary: I've kind of got an obsession with amnesia fic and this is one of the best I've read. I adore the struggle we get to see in Sam and the decisions he makes, especially in the very beginning, feel so in character to me. I want to hug him and cry and smack him on the back of the head and make him see reason. Also, I love the OCs in this fic. The POV switches between Sam and a guy that becomes Dean's friend and I just couldn't help loving him.


Dub-con because Dean can't properly consent without his memory. "

You probably don't imagine the image as clearly as you think you do.  It's easy to convince yourself that you do, but when you really drill down and start asking yourself questions about the details of the image, you'll find that it's actually quite fuzzy.

The best thing you can do for yourself is to stop worrying about getting everything right the first time and just draw for fun.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't try to advance your skills, or that you shouldn't try to produce work that you're proud of, just that you shouldn't really care if you don't succeed.

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1390604645.0,"OK, first current and power are not the same.  Current is measured in amps, power in watts.

Next, if you're running the same power to each coil then they will perform similarly, but not necessarily identically.  If made with the same wire the higher resistance coil has more length.  If the length is the same then the higher resistance coil is made of thinner wire.  Regardless, different mass being heated and different surface area.

&gt;...then how do the benefits to using subohm, high power setups come about if you shouldn't be going above ~8.5 watts on these charts?

Those charts are for your typical clearo.  I prefer somewhere around 28-30 watts on my mechs.

&gt;Or is it a way to safely leave that ""safe zone"" in a way that is still safe?

This is where current becomes important.  Batteries used in mechs can safely provide amperage to a certain point before they become unsafe.  By knowing your battery's limitations and knowing the math to calculate the amp draw, you can safely maximize your power by building lower resistance coils without destroying your battery.

Clockw0rk,AdviceAnimals,1390604664.0,"I disagree. And I'm going to use drugs as an example.

The reasons black markets exist is because the way to obtain a product through traditional channels is either difficult or impossible.

Let's look at the legalization of pot in Washington. Prior to legalization, the price on the black market was high and quality wildly fluctuates. Black markets have little to no quality control because they're operating outside of regulation. If your dealer fucks you over with some mexican ragweed, who exactly do you complain to? You don't, you find another supplier.

After legalization, there's regulation. The dispensaries don't cut their product with other substances that could either elevate the effects of ragweed or enhance the addictiveness for return business. Prices plummeted due to availability. Black market dealers can't compete with legitimate businesses are selling lower than the cost of smuggling.

I fully expect that part of doing business is the ability to understand and compete with the black market. Part of why DVD and Bluray extras exist is 'value add'. If the original product offers superior quality or value, people will prefer it to the cheap knock-off.

In a less desperate analogy, let's look at toilet paper. Scott 1000 sheet rolls aren't exactly 'black market', but sheet for sheet they're an extraordinary value compared to something like quilted charmin. On the other hand, charmin doesn't feel like receipt paper on your bunghole. Charmin quality is superior, so even though they have a competitor which severely undercuts them, they remain profitable and successful because their quality is arguably better than the value of the higher sheet count competitor.

I surely don't expect them to adjust their business model to something that's not affordable. But that isn't the case here. I'm asking them to adjust their business model to include people that want *reasonably* high quality content with *reasonable* DRM at a *reasonable* price.

Any time I download a movie, it's 60fps, 2D, reduced color palette for compression. I'm getting an extremely inferior product, compared to a 20 dollar bluray. So price it appropriately.

If I can go to Redbox and pay three bucks for a new release movie at full quality with all the extras for 1 night, why I can't I legitimately download a movie with no extras and compressed quality for a 1.50 for 1 night?

Official delivery channels. That's the only piece not in place. Because if I can get it now, for free, literally the only thing missing is the official channel where I pay money to do the same thing I'm doing right now. The technology is there. The demand is there. Where's the page where I enter my payment information? That's the only thing not there."

Philosophical concerns about the subjectivity of aesthetics aside, it's clear that some people are better artists than others, and you should absolutely look to their work to learn about techniques and concepts that can improve your own.  If you work in your own little bubble and only focus on your own work, it's easy to stop improving, because you're not letting other people push your limits.

Another issue might be smaller niche search engines who might not have the capital of google could have a difficult time blocking the images. 

I can understand courts forcing hosting companies to remove something from their servers. It is easy to say ""remove the image located at URLxyz.de/jpg"" from your servers.

thecupcakedragon,teenagers,1390605028.0,"&gt;that is certainly not "" reducing an entire person down to how they look, and borderline disrespectful.""

Yes, actually, it is. Sometimes intentions can be good (which removes the disrespectful part), and sometimes it's a genuinely nice thing to hear, but appearance shouldn't be treated as a catch-all ""this should make you feel better"". There are pages and pages written by others how obsessed society is with the female appearance (to the point there are entire markets dedicated to dictating what women should look like) and how unhealthy it is for the women raised in these societies; I will not repeat them.

Imagine you approached your friend, told him you had a shit day and are feeling depressed over it. Imagine his response is ""Well you live in a developed country, so you shouldn't be feeling unhappy"".

The good thing has nothing to do with the problem at hand, and treating it as something that should fix the problem invalidates the other person's feelings. 

I'm not saying everyone who tries to cheer up a girl by telling her she's pretty is an asshole. I'm just saying that, done in the way of pneumon's original comment, it has the opposite effect. Based on society's obsession with female appearance, you can understand how some people get the idea into their head that ""being pretty will automatically make a girl happy!"" But at the end of the day, comments like that reinforce the idea that beauty &gt; emotional wellbeing. Unintentional, but still discouraging. She isn't wrong for being irritated over it."

However, I revelled in my notoriety and that became part of a vicious circle that led me to consume vast quantities of alcohol and drugs, doing all sorts of crazy shit and fucking almost any available guy or girl.  
  
Thankfully you don't seem to be exactly the same as I was and it also means I can keep that Pandora's box of memories closed :). I'd repeat that 22 is way too young to worry that you don't have control of your future, that nobody will want you because of your past, that you can't stop or even that there's something wrong with you. I'm 38 now and I'm not the same person that I was 3 years ago, it's quite possible if you read this post at 25 you'd barely recognise yourself.  
  
Be careful of too much self analysis though because it can often be a subconscious way of justifying not changing your behaviour. Sex is an enjoyable activity and the hunt for sexual partners can be a fun way to pass time too, so it's natural that some people find that hard to give up. Maybe it's just as simple as you've not met the right guy yet.   
  
I'd definitely recommend talking to someone in person, typing can keep you more emotionally removed and potentially stilts the conversation too.

cawkstrangla,pittsburgh,1390605205.0,"If you don't mind going to Station Square there is Sesame Inn.  Get the Amazing Chicken, for 13 dollars you can feed two adults.  Buca De Peppo (family style Italian - better than Olive Garden), and a few other restaurants are in that area as well.  The only downside is paying for parking, but you might end up doing that on Carson Street anyway.  Kiku is hands down, the best Japanese sushi/food restaurant in Pittsburgh, but it is expensive.  It is also in Station Square.

On the South Side, Thai Me Up is fantastic and cheap Thai food.  Mike and Tony's has good gyros, but isn't much of a restaurant experience. Fat Heads has great food, though the wait can be long if you don't get there before the dinner rush.  Piper's pub has good, hearty Irish food.  I highly recommend their shepherds pie.  They are half bar, half restaurant; they have booths in the back that are separated from the bar.

The Cheesecake Factory and McCormick&amp;Schmick's are the only two restaurants in South Side Works that I usually go to.  They are both good, though MC&amp;S is way better than Cheesecake Factory.

If you want the best pizza in Pittsburgh, you're going to have to go to either Fiori's or Beto's.  Beto's doesn't cook the cheese with the pizza, so it is a bit different, but still excellent.  Personally I prefer Fioris, though neither of them are in the South Side, but they aren't too far off.  They get pretty crowded later on, especially Fiori's because they are in a smaller building, so try to beat the rush.

For three drop, I'd maybe run 3 brimaz max because of his legendary status, and run maybe two -3 banisher priests. 

personally, I'd run 4 of the best (after voice) gw card in standard, advent of the wurm. He's just so good. 

I'd also try to fit 2-3 ajani s in there somewhere. A 5/5 flying double strike trample wurm usually ends games. If not, make it a 7/7 with a selesnya charm and watch their face as you deal 14 damage on turn 5"

When you go into the pits, you inevitably pass the finish line and it still counts whether you're in the pit lane or not. You could finish the race in the pit lane if you wanted!

Also, even if you did lose your lap going into the pits, everyone else would too as everyone has to pit at least once in the dry.

Also, in case you're confused about timings, when you cross the finish line in the pit lane, the lap time starts over again as it normally would. This means that the lap that you come out of the pits on is usually around 15-20 seconds (depending on where the line is in relation to the pit lane/entrance/exit) slower than your average race pace."

hytone,AskWomen,1390605489.0,"Oh, god, I just wrote a super-long comment detailing every damn thing I could tell you about jeans, and wouldn't you know it, my browser crashed. I'll give you the mostly-truncated version... anyway, I work in clothing retail and know way too damn much about jeans.

I recommend Levi's 505 straight leg jeans or 501 boyfriend jean (without rolling up the cuffs, unless you want to). Unfortunately, in the basic 505s, there's only one wash with gender-neutral contrast stitching and no flap pockets. It's kind of hard to tell on the site, but IRL, the black's stitching is metallic silver, and the darkest denim wash has pink/purple stitching. However, from the looks of it, the majority of the Curve ID 505s have gender-neutral, very basic stitching and pockets.

Now, curvy fit jeans (or the aforementioned Curve ID as Levi's calls theirs), in the most basic terms, are jeans that are contoured in the butt/hips/thigh areas, and tighter in the waist. I typically recommend trying two sizes in a curvy fit depending on how you want them to look--if you want them to look fitted, your usual size and a size down. If not, your usual size and a size up. Because of the extra room in the butt/thigh areas, your usual size is most likely going to be a little loose in those regions (most women are kind of taken aback by this because they're used to wearing jeans with a vise-like grip around their undercarriages), but it depends on your body shape whether that will be the case or not. Levi's has four Curve ID fits, and they have a little test on their site that will tell you which fit might work best for you.

Also, depending on your height/what kind of shoes you wear, getting a longer length will add that sorta slouchy menswear look to a pair of women's jeans.

So, um, that's about the best I can do without actually being able to grab you a bunch of jeans and have you try them on. I'm probably forgetting a bunch of crucial stuff I had in my original comment, but I've been half-asleep all day. I need a nap."

MATH! 7 is 20.59% of 34. It may sound like 100% of a subscription, but it's really not.

I think it's entirely reasonable to value cable service by the total number of programming hours available versus consumed. After all, cable internet is valued by your bandwidth cap.

Morality is relative, and the concept of morality as it applies to digital copies of actual media doubly so.

Too complex to answer

Several answers to this. 5 months, 1 yr 8 months, 1 year 9 months retroactively to 5 months. Haven't yet. Reasons for this complication: We had a collaring ceremony, which contains within it all the agreements of marriage, plus extra, at 5 months. Then we had a courtroom wedding. Then, when we did our taxes for the previous year, we used common-law marriage to say we had already been married before that. We still plan to have a normal wedding ceremony to invite our families to.

We've been together for 2.5 years... The answer to this gets complex, but you can do the math.

It's a *fact* that [sightings of sea monsters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipogo), of various kinds, [have been around for centuries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken) and [going as far back at least as the bible's writing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan).  Not to mention the idea of a Moby Dick or ""Monstro"" sized whale, Giant Squids, and god knows what other recorded creatures we have actually discovered that could be used as a sea battle.

PacmanInYourFace,IAmA,1390605764.0,"Mr. Jonze, I hope you at least have the time to read this even if you can't answer. 

My sister talked me into going to see ""Her"" a few weeks ago, and I'll admit that I was hesitant at first. I hadn't read much about it, but she's studying to be an actor and was very convincing. It was, obviously, a wonderful film, and for days after I found myself reflecting on how incredibly profound the ending is. I won't spoil it but the way the AI's had such understanding of human nature that they made the decision they made was just beautiful. Thank you for that, and for what is hands down the most awkward sex scene to watch with your sister. 

It was also so refreshing to watch a movie without this tragic dystopian view of the future. However, after my aforementioned reflection, it was dystopian in a way that we wouldn't typically expect. The machines have become self-aware and essentially taken over, but not for malicious intent. Just a great job through and through. From the writing, to your work and Mr. Phoenix and Ms. Johansson, bravo.

I have to ask, what was with the clothes and style of dress? It was very subtle and didn't stand out, but the basic colors, high-waisted pants, etc. were very throwback. I liked it, but what was the motivation to style the characters as such?

Mr. Jonze, I've been a fan of your work since the first time I learned Christopher Walken was a classically trained dancer in your video for ""Weapon of Choice."" Thanks for all you do. "

What we need now is an alternative to Giroud that can take over both when he has a streak like he had in the last part of last year, and be an alternative to Girouds holdup play, a more creative kind - the type of player that Wenger has turned wingers into in the past, the kind he *could* turn Draxler into.

I pay a lot for a Sky subscription and will watch and often rewatch TV shows because I like them.

And if the show doesn't get broadcast in NZ, how else am I supposed to watch the show? 

As for movies, I'll often download so I can put them on my phone and watch conveniently. Most of the movies on my phone/laptop I own on hard copy DVD as it is and legally paid for them. I'm not gonna pay for them again to put them on my phone. If I particularly enjoy a movie I'll want to watch it again anyway and buy it because surround sound and HD graphics make the experience worth paying for.

If people actually *did* thrown in jail for torrenting, people would become outraged, the law be changed, and the police wouldn't be able to use it selectively as a means to silence political dissenters, oppress people of a different race, etc.  If the police actually did prosecute based on stupid laws, we would have far fewer stupid laws.

Graffiti can be art, yeah, but you can't just go arting up all the private property without permission. ""We are the city"" is great and all, but you are totally missing the ""we"" part of it. YOU are not the city. WE are the city. Don't YOU ever forget that. This we includes the owners of the property you just tagged, and the business that lose customers over it, and the homeowners in the neighborhood with dropping property values. 

Some graffiti isn't art, period - there are tons of gang sign, swastikas, hate speech, penises, and other shit people graffiti on shit because they are a 12 year old with a spray can and they can. Does that make it right? I can go tag your mom's house right now, see how she feels about it. This is how business owners feel. If you are going to be part of a community you better respect your community members, otherwise you are just a joke.

There are laws and stuff. Your city has a bridge devoted to graffiti, that is kickass. I love some graffiti. It's great! I have seen some talented artists, we have murals all over the city, art parks, classes, etc. It's lovely, but the thing that separate the artists that are respected and loved by the community is one thing: permission. 

I don't love people tagging private property and giving their gang/whatever a bad name. Bad form, yo. ""But the art is SPEAKING to me"" you say? Do that shit on your own property or with permission, or you are giving Doge and graffiti artists a bad name.

halfwaythere88,loseit,1390606329.0,"I was more guessing that the animalistic/instinctual part of our brain tells us to find food and shelter when we are stressed out because that ancient part of our brains might only have those things on it's list of what could cause stress since it is mainly based off  of survival. So when we get stressed, our primal brain is like ""Eat something"" which might explain why a lot of people like to stress eat. 

I included the other two because they are listed as the other two ""primal needs"". I think we as modern people are pretty much sheltered at all times. When it's hot, we find shade. When it's cold, we go inside. Tons of people spend their entire day indoors. Sex on the other hand is different. One, you need someone else to do it with. Two, it's not a primal need in the same context that food and shelter is. Although sex releases endorphins and actually does relieve stress,  I don't think it is on the primal instinct list because it is a stress reliever. It is on there because it is an instinctual urge that most animals feel in order to survive from an evolutionary stance through procreation. In fact, humans as well as many other kinds of animals have been shown to procreate less when there is less food and shelter available, so procreation tends to come from lack of stress. 

Also, humans have many more parts of their brains than the primal part, or else many of us would be walking around humping each other. Just look at an un-neutered dog. That should give you a pretty good idea of what it might be like.

Monosentence,leagueoflegends,1390606330.0,"I'm not too sure since you didn't give much context of the early laning, but I'm going to take a guess for the fun of it and say that every single time Nunu's snowball was up, he hit you with it and you were unable to trade back.

Then his jungler started messing with you, putting you on the defensive. About right?

Sometimes in those cases the best thing you can do is just keep your distance and poke as much as possible. A lot of the time when your opponent finds out ""Huh, I can get away with x if I do y"", they'll milk the hell out of it. You can take advantage of that if you're already at a disadvantage, because it gives their play an element of predictability.

Like when I find out that when I move in, they move in to prepare to hit me, I'll fake out a small step and throw a spell their way, avoiding their counterpoke. I pretend like me and my enemy laner(s) are a line of water, in a sense. If they push, I pull, but I push back before they have a chance to pull away. 

Don't get bullied by unconventional picks. I've rolled Lux, Ziggs, and Heimer top against fotm champs and came out ahead just because I was forcing them to build magic resist and miss out on farm. I like doing a top/mid lane swap when the other mid laner is an assassin, and my top laner can handle them better. Then top has to build magic resist or get burned to death, which makes them weaker to midgame adc/jungle/bruisers.

Its a whole lotta fun."

After a while you play like you're experimenting, cataloguing the game's response to a particular set of actions. It's almost as physical as, say, Super Meat Boy - you have to rely on muscle memory and enter this sort of trance-like state.

This [Gamasutra piece](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/166972/) talks about that phenomenon a bit, actually. 

&gt; In the 1970s a psychologist named Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi experimentally evaluated Flow. He found that a person's skill and the difficulty of a task interact to result in different cognitive and emotional states. When skill is too low and the task too hard, people become anxious. Alternatively, if the task is too easy and skill too high, people become bored. However, when skill and difficulty are roughly proportional, people enter Flow states.

&gt; While in these states, people experience:
&gt; 
&gt; Extreme focus on a task.


&gt; A sense of active control.


&gt; Merging of action and awareness.


&gt; Loss of self-awareness.

This requires some clarification.  For example, in the sixteenth century, residents of the Polish-Lithuanian state frequently identified as ""members of the Polish state, (then) of Ruthenian/German/Lithuanian ethnicity.""  Primary documents frequently used Latin language identity terms such as ""Natione Polonus, gente Ruthenus"" or  ""Natione Polonus, gente Germanus."" (Literally, ""Polish by nationality, Ruthenian by tribe,"" etc...).  To borrow from Norman Davies' ""God's Playground,"" this functioned very similarly to the way a British subject would simultaneously identify as ethnically Scottish or Welsh."

ParksVS,reloading,1390606583.0,"Okay, so I actually found some more information when I dug a bit deeper. 

&gt;Just to help people out with some info so they can decide if they need to get the Berdan primer available from Canam.

&gt;I had hoped that these primers were going to be good for reloading my Swiss 7.5x55 ex-mil ammo Berdan cases (have lots left over from shooting my K31), so before I bought some I checked them out on their website and noticed that the product code id's them as - DAKV24NPRIME primers.

&gt;Now from previous research on these Russian Murom Primers I have found this info from a well known reloader on the web - 

&gt;""I've reloaded a lot of Berdan primed cases, and they can give spectacularly good results, but there are a lot of caveats. I could afford to shoot all factory ammo, but I like working with my hands, I'm rather tight with a buck and Berdan primers let me lower my brass cost effectively to zero. For the same .217"" diameter, you will find many different heights, hardnesses and explosive strengths. DAG has brought in TulAmmo KV-24N and KV-762N, both made by Murom in Russia. The former is intended for the 7.62x39, is shorter, harder and has less explosive strength than the latter. The latter is intended for 7.62x51-class calibers, is taller, seems softer to me, and has greater explosive strength. 

&gt;Batches of these two primers have been brought in before. Both are made by Murom in Russia. PMC brought in a lot of the KV-762N about 12 years ago, and I have shot them in 7.5 Swiss, FN and SA .303 brass, Albanian and early Bulgarian 7.62x54R and other calibers. They worked great in every bolt-action caliber I tried them in. Swiss 7.5x55 brass loaded with them has been used by me in 4 of the 5 Vintage Military matches I've shot in at Camp Perry, and I got a Gold medal every time. They seemed to get really flat as I approached book maximum loads and velocities, indicating to me they were pretty soft, so I was afraid of using them in loads for semi-autos without firing pin retraction springs. 

&gt;Several years ago a batch of TulAmmo KV-24N primers were brought in, and I bought a lot of them. I tried them in Lapua Berdan 7.62x39, Yugo 7.62x39, and Swiss 7.5x55. I used 680 powder in the 7.62x39 loads, and with US jacketed bullets the Lapua shot better than the Yugo in an SKS. With the 7.5x55, I got mostly hangfires and duds even with easy to ignite 4064. Others have told me that if they opened up the flash holes on 7.5x55 brass, these primers worked fine. 

&gt;As an experiment, I primed 7.5x55 cases with both primers and snapped them in a K31 rifle. The KV-762N gave two violet colored, 3 inch tongues of flame out the muzzle. The KV-24N showed just a little orange flame out the muzzle.

Not just that, but one game for instance was a Diana game I played today. I simply said in in the pregame lobby ""If a role is open for it, I'm playing Diana to practice."" Y'know, top/mid/jungle. I wanted to give top a go if it was open, or jungle/mid otherwise. Okay.

All four players jumped down my throat. I stated, ""I'm not going to be playing her as a marksman if thats all thats open. I just load slowly, and I wanted to make it known what champion I was going with.""

More swearing, flaming. I was third pick, top and jungle was filled, I took mid.

The other guy below me apparently had called mid, didn't say anything about it, then more raging. ""HE CALLED MID FIRST JACKASS NOOB"" etc, etc. None of us did well in game, but Jayce top was still ""Report Diana for feeding..."", and they all raged during the game.

&gt;&gt;Does any one have any tips on meal variations for people who aren't huge into vegetables...

&gt;The other is (tough love incoming), stop being a baby and just eat your damn vegetables. Eating right means not every meal will be rich, heavy, and make Paula Deen's panties wet (oh God why did that come to mind?). Some meals will be a bit bland and boring. If you don't like your vegetables, eat them first before everything else.

&gt;The good news about that plan is that your taste buds change every 2 weeks. If you cut out all salt in your diet for 2-3 weeks, a potato chip will be so over salted you won't be able to grasp how you used to eat them. I used to hate raw tomatoes, love 'em now. Used to hate broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and a bunch of other veggies - I love them now.

&gt;Dig Deeper *[a common term said during Insanity]* isn't just about pushing play and flailing your body around, it's a mental game about the whole package. Your taste buds and mental blocks will eventually get used to the veggies and you'll want to eat more of them. Unfortunately, getting past this is just as hard as Max Interval Circuit and Fit Test in the same day.


I really hate the term picky eater, it's an excuse to not eat properly.  As I said, I started at 320 lbs (I'm 200 today) and I didn't do it by being picky.  I started to force myself to eat my veggies first so I could enjoy my meal.  Grilled chicken and steamed broccoli?  Inhale that nasty broccoli and get to my chicken.  

You won't progress if you refuse to eat right and being picky is a choice you make - not a physical barrier you can't get around.  I originally read this on /r/fitness, gain muscle in the gym (in our case, living room with Shaun T), lose weight in the kitchen.

Force yourself onto a good eating plan for at least 1 month (2 if you have the will power).  You'll see and feel the results.  

I should also throw this out, /r/keto will say you can eat bacon all day and lose weight and they have people there who are **very** successful in their weight loss journeys.  It might be a road for you to consider.  I personally don't think too highly of it, but I'm not a nutritionist/dietician and their style doesn't work for me.  It's also a bit controversial among some nutrition circles (but so is my diet, Plant-Strong).

Be careful with what you choose and always keep in mind that diet is just as important as exercise. "

Many Buddhists believe that the historical Budai is destined to be reborn in the human domain after Buddhism has been long forgotten.

They all wear collars to signify this relationship. They all walk around naked when at home. They all make me happy.

The relationship with my girl is more complex than the relationships we have with our cats. I also have lust for my girl, which is a pretty big difference. The ability to speak and have my words understood makes things far easier with my girl, but the issues that might exist are far more complex. The cats are also more tame, while my girl can more easily succumb to her basic animal instincts, which adds an extra layer of challenge to that relationship. The greater the challenge though, the better it feels to overcome it.

My girl also improves my life in ways beyond just making me happy. She helps me improve as a person. For example, she's helping me towards being able to handle a better diet. She's helping me start to say ""I agree"" instead of ""I know"" when someone is trying to be helpful, but is telling me information I already know. Etc...

Quidagismedici,AskMen,1390607181.0,"I'm 24 so right within the age range that I surmise you're talking about. A few important things to remember:

1. There's a story that goes around about a study or a class-project or something done by a group of college students where they looked through various facebook pages belonging to people suffering from depression to identify common themes in how they present themselves in public. One of the things that stood out to the people doing the report was that the people they were looking at were all smiling in almost all of the photographs of them. Now that story may or may be true, but it illustrates an important point about unhappiness which is that it's quite a private thing. Sure on reddit, where you're anonymous, it's easy to let it all out, but those who are unhappy about anything generally don't wear it on their sleeves, particular since they may be unhappy about one particular aspect of their life but otherwise be quite content. What I'm saying is that telling the men you're talking about from the rest isn't easy.

2. Sorry to presume, but in all likelihood the men you find attractive are probably also considered attractive by a lot of other women &amp; the men who aren't attractive to other women are probably not all that attractive to you either. I know of course that I'm presupposing a lot about your taste in men, but given the nature of majorities &amp; without knowing anything about you it's obviously more likely than not that you're in the majority when it comes to what you like in a man's appearance &amp; personality. Obviously disregard this if I'm completely off the mark, but it seems likely to me that the men who are being filtered out as unattractive by women generally are also being filtered out by you, because if they were attractive to begin with, they wouldn't be in that category at all. There's a thing I've found as an unattractive man that I've heard back from both men &amp; women with the same problem, which is that being unattractive often makes you invisible to others &amp; perhaps that's why you can't bring to mind any guy you know who's in the category you're talking about.

Other than that, from personal experience I can say that I no longer ""put myself out there"" if I can help it, since the reality is that nothing good comes of it &amp; I don't doubt that a lot of other men (&amp; women too) who are as unwanted as I am are the same; it just plain isn't worth it."
RAND0M-HER0,dogs,1390607185.0,"If you are that scared of dogs, put your foot down. Your room mate will survive without a dog, even though it sucks, but this is not a permanent situation for anyone. 


As a side note, a friend of mine used to be scared of dogs. He went through some military type school/training when he was a kid, and his experience with dogs was they were used to attack and work. Police dogs for example, so dogs made him nervous. 


My boyfriend got a puppy, and encourage him to be around the puppy while he grew up. He knows my boyfriends dog well, and my boyfriends dog grew up with him in the house and he's incredibly comfortable around my boyfriends dog. 


I'm not saying this will be the case, but it's something to consider. Puppies don't have a mean bone in their body, they haven't grown into their breed instincts yet, they trust everyone and just want to play and love. But don't be afraid to simply put your foot down and say no. Home is supposed to a place of safety, not of fear and anxiety. "

    // To change the independent variable: replace the 12 below with 
    // your number multiplied by two
    for (i = 1; i &lt;= 12;  i++)

That's an incorrect way to provide an input.  Here are some tips, just on these three lines alone:

* Call ""the independent variable"" something meaningful, like ""average"", ""mean"", or if you want it to sound very mathy, ""x""
* If the average is a compile-time input, use a #define to define it somewhere - typically in a header file.  In your case, at the top of your snippet.
* Consider rewriting these snippets such that they are functions, rather than a self-contained program.  Most code in the wild isn't spitting things to STDOUT.
* If you feel it's necessary to print to STDOUT, put the 'math stuff', in its own function and call `generate_gaussian_variable()` multiple times from `main()`
* What if what's really needed is multiple gaussian generators with different averages, defined at run-time?  How would you model this in C++ or C?

I don't mean to insult you.  But anyone who takes the time to view your code snippets is going to want to see something a bit more professional and a lot more substantive.  You don't even have your tabs aligned properly.

I will say one positive thing: I liked how easy it was to find your code examples.  No messy splash page or anything."

TofuRobber,changemyview,1390607920.0,"I disagree. I also see the value in live music but that isn't a reason why production music is any less valid than live performance music. You say that seeing music played live allows people to appreciate music.The differences is that playing with instruments live is also a performance art. That doesn't make it more specifically music. It just makes it music and performance.

Let's take a look at the popular Japanese software Vocaloid. It allows people to simulate human speech and thus create synthesized vocals for a song. It doesn't require an actual person to sing the part but it requires just as much understand of singing as a music goes. There's a huge fanbase revolving around Vocaloid and there are great music made from it. just because the vocals aren't made from person's body doesn't make it less than music.

Furthermore, you can also see the production of music that aren't made from usual instruments. It's not at the level of live performance but it's just as impressive and allows a better understanding and appreciation of said music."

ibbity,TwoXChromosomes,1390608229.0,"Well, the only adult in there IS another man, and the other people in the sauna are obviously much younger, small children even.

TheLittleGoodWolf,MensRights,1390608230.0,"Well the argument could be made that it's like having your nails removed. I'm not fully sure on their exact function actually (although I do know what the foreskin is for) aside from scraping stickers and biting on. I'm also not sure of if they would grow back if removed.

What I do know is that the membrane that holds your nails to your fingers is the same kind of membrane that holds the foreskin to the glans in a young boy. Sure this changes with age but while attached it's pretty much the same way a fingernail is attached.

With your nails removed quickly at birth there will only be small wounds and you don't use your fingers much at that time anyway so it's no real harm. There will never be problems with cuticles, clipping the nails, getting dirt under the nails, accidentally scratching someone etc. Also since you are so young when it's done you won't know what you are missing. 

Note that I tried to use similar rhetoric to that used to argue for circumcision. I in no way think that nails should be removed even if I actually don't know their actual purpose I do enjoy a good scratching every now and then.  "

In the first 4 months, the sex had no emotional meaning for her.  **But in the last 2 months, she has actually connected with you on an intimate level.**

How is this not a good thing?

If it was me, not only would I not view her past as a red flag, if I really liked her, I would want to show her that her past sexual exploits aren't all there is to it, and that there IS intimacy in sex.

FireSail,tall,1390608405.0,"You nailed it.

I mean, a good amount of discrimination goes on. It's very comparable to the body image issues forced on women. We're told as boys that we should grow up ""big and strong"" and I've heard many times girls trash a guy for his height. It's a real thing. But it's over blown. 

Problem is though most of those guys get so fixated on it and use it as an excuse for sexual frustration. Like, ok, you gave a disadvantage. Fine. Everyone's got something. Be grateful at least that you were born in a country where you can log on to the internet to bitch about it.

Most of the stigma of being short isn't about the height, it's about how the dudes act. I'm often mistaken for being taller than I am because I don't exhibit the negative stereo-types: over compensating, whiny, aggressive but at the same time shy. Little dog syndrome is real and it's the biggest thing holding short dudes back. If they just manned up and chilled out I guarantee fortunes would change for 90% of them.

The66Ripper,electrohouse,1390608541.0,"I was talking with a friend about this and I made the parallel between Zedd now and Calvin Harris in 2010. 

Coming off of the late 2009 release of Ready For The Weekend, Calvin Harris was absolutely unstoppable. Songs like I'm Not Alone, Flashback, the title track Ready For The Weekend and so many more made that album pure gold as far as pre EDM-Boom pop house goes. He started getting courted by various pop artists like Rihanna, Kelis, Ne-Yo, etc. When that happened, he definitely got as my friend put it ""radio thirsty"" and started producing pop tracks that were absolutely not up to par with his former album. 

Zedd, coming off of the release of Clarity saw a bunch of popular success and radio play for a bunch of the tracks on the album. Prior to that, he had been courted a bit by artists like Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and Eva Simons. Now he's releasing really generic pop, which has never been his suit. He's always produced poppy sounding music, but it's never been generic, and it's never been boring. I mean, the vocal line in Find You has a bunch of the same chunks as the line in Spectrum and Clarity, and the synths used are almost exactly the same as the synths in Spectrum. The only real difference is the chords, and those still are very similar. It's boring and nothing about it sounds new, much like what many people could say about Calvin Harris' 18 Months. "

This is actually the same reason why some people who are experts in their fields are bad at teaching (like some professors at research universities) - they lose touch with how difficult it was to learn that stuff for the first time and get frustrated that their students don't see things that they find obvious immediately."

I've found one paper on Calorie restriction however: the calorie controlled groups only lost about 10%-15% weight. 
If you were a 70kg 1.8m adult, that would be equivalent to going down to 60kg. Importantly, that's still within the normal weight range (just - it's 59.9kg to 80.7kg). To be size zero you'd be weighing something like 45kg or less, which would be unhealthy.

2) Só vai quem quer. Há inclusivé esclarecimentos sobre o que se vai fazer sem estragar a surpresa. A qualquer momento podem desistir sem qualquer implicação.

3) Na praxe na qual participei enquanto caloiro não houve barbaridades.  A praxe divide-se em 2 dias, no primeiro conhecer Lisboa e no segundo conhecer a Faculdade. Passeamos pelas zonas turísticas de Lisboa superámos desafios e no final do dia assistimos a concertos da tuna. Nesse dia fiz amizades que de outra forma não seriam tão fortes. Os veteranos que me praxaram ajudaram-me e ainda hoje me ajudam na minha vida académica quer seja dando dicas como no empréstimo de material.

4) Enquanto veterano exerci a praxe sobre os novos caloiros. O objectivo não é a humilhação mas a perda do constrangimento. Foram elaboradas danças, inventadas músicas, houveram pequenas cenas teatrais. 

Seria desonesto da minha parte negar existem veteranos que exageram. Mas tenho de reconhecer que esses caloiros são os que vão mais tarde integrar a tuna e integrar-se melhor na vida académica."

She tells me that only monks ""back home"" actually *study* religion (or know anything about it, seemingly). She thinks it's weird that I'm a layperson who has actually read the sutras. She's also under the impression that there is a creator-god in Buddhism (this is explicitly impossible given the teachings) and that the buddhas are in some way angelic or divine or whatever, servants of God (like saints, I guess?) with magical and deity-like powers.

codayus,AskMen,1390608909.0,"&gt; * she is currently 19 and has for the past 3 years never been without a boyfriend (shes been with 3 before me).

That's not a red flag *per se*.  4 boyfriends in 3 years isn't crazy, especially at that age.  And depending on how things ended, a fairly smooth transition to a new boyfriend is not a particular problem.  I admit, this could be a sign that she can't stand to be single, which *is* a red flag.  It could also be a sign that she's 19, in high school, and people are constantly getting together, breaking up, and changing partners.

&gt; * prior to this point she considered herself unattractive and didnt go out with guys

Would be an issue if she was older.  If she's 19 now, you're basically saying she didn't date when she was 14 and 15?  There's a lot of variation between regions and cultures, but I, and all my friends, and all the people I've ever dated all started dating after that.

&gt; * the first guy she was with talked her into sex and made her think of sex as nothing but a physical activity with no emotion.

Eh, it *is* a physical activity, and like any physical activity, the amount of emotion involved is highly variable.  You can have empty sex, or a really romantic game of tennis.  If you were saying ""she can't see sex as anything but a physical activity with no emotion (and I see it otherwise)"" this would be an issue, but you haven't (yet).  (And looking down, you actually say the reverse—that she does view sex with you, now, as an emotional thing.  So I don't understand your concern.)

&gt; * the boyfriend she had after that was a purely physical relationship during which they did everything under the sun sexually

Sounds normal to me?  Why do you even list this?  Are you trying to suggest that it's not normal to have physical relationships and experiment sexually?  'cause uh, no.

&gt; * the boyfriend after that was verbally abusive and caused her to be depressed but she stayed with him for nearly a year and had sex with him every day even when she didnt want to and would basically lay there til he finished.

I won't say that a history of abuse isn't a potential issue, and this does sound moderately serious.  But lots of people go through stuff like this, and they react in a thousand different ways.  If you were saying ""hey, my girlfriend acts like X, and this really bothers me; could it be her past abuse?"" then the answer is ""of course it could be"".  But you aren't.  And the past abuse is not the ""red flag"" it would be her current behaviour, which you're awfully vague on.

&gt; * she and i dated immediately after the ex mentioned above and there was only a 2 week gap between when we had sex and when they last did.

That's a big issue if she was emotionally involved with him right up to (or past) the point she started being emotionally involved with you; it makes you a rebound relationship.  It's not an issue at all if she was emotionally checked out before the physical part of her relationship ended.  You don't say, and I certainly can't guess.

&gt; * while she has always said how much she loves me and is emotionally invested in me

Good...

&gt;  she admitted that for 4 of the months wed been together the sex (while ""amazing"") was just a physical activity to her separate of her feelings for me. 

So?  That's not uncommon.  More for guys than girls, but still.  Besides, according to her, that's not even true any more.

&gt; this bothered/hurt me a great deal because for me sex is conveying something not just feeling good.

That sounds like the core issue for you.  But it's *your* issue, not your girlfriend's.

Honestly, I feel like you are young, and you have a somewhat unusually romanticized view of sex.  I sympathize!  Sex is super important to me, *and* it's strongly tied into emotions for me.  Although I can have (and enjoy) empty, casual sex, for me meaningful sex in the context of a romantic relationship is incredibly important.  And it would be very awkward, and somewhat painful, if I found out my partner considered the really amazing meaningful sex I thought we were having as casual meaningless fun times.

But!  According to you, that's an old problem; your girlfriend is telling you she's moved beyond that, and now shares your view of the sex you have.  (Could be her past relationships, or hey, maybe she just falls in love slowly.)  So what's your problem?  Your long list of bullet points makes it seem like you're looking for a problem, yet nothing you've articulated actually seems to be a problem.

If I was writing a TL;DR of your post, it would be this:  ""I've dated a girl for 6 months.  Her dating history is perfectly normal, although her last boyfriend was a bit abusive.  For the first 4 months of the relationship the sex was great, but she wasn't very emotionally involved, but everything has been perfect for the last two months.  Is this a red flag?""  An the answer is:  ""Are you nuts? Accordin to you, everything is great.  No, everything being great is not a red flag.""

Stop trying to dig through her history looking for something that could explain a problem that doesn't exist.  Look at her current behaviour.  Is there a problem?  If so, can it be resolved?  As part of trying to resolve it, you could, yes, look at her past for clues about what caused it and how to fix it.  **IF** she couldn't seem to view sex with you as an emotional act, then sure, look at her past relationships for a potential cause.  But you haven't identified a problem yet; you reckon that for the last 1/3 of your relationship with her everything has been fine.  WTF are you trying to do?

TL;DR:  You're looking for problems that don't exist, and since you can't find them, you're now asking internet strangers to tell you that there are problems.  This whole thing is lunacy.  Until you can articulate a problem that you are having *today*, stop looking for possible causes.  And the only problem I can see is that **YOU**, not her, are hurt because months ago (but no longer) she viewed sex as a purely physical thing.  That hurt is your issue, not hers.  If it's a problem, then you need to get it fixed, but it's fixed by *you* finding out how to deal with it. "

Mikuta,killingfloor,1390609018.0,"The commando is a very specialized perk, and so is his guns. The guns originally fell into three types, but all the ""new guns"" has blurred out the lines a bit.   
Which combination of guns you want has a lot to do with your playstyle and experience, but I'll just touch the basics here.



1.  The holy-shit-this-gun-never-runs-out-of-juices



2.  The all-round standard guns


3.  The heavy hitters


The first category has guns like the Bullpup, Dr. T's, Rising storm tommy. It's the guns with less damage and fuckton of ammo. They're good for guys who know how to headshot and do not want to think too much about ammo. These guns fare best against Clots, Crawlers and Stalkers. (Standard Zs, spiders and invisibitches)


The second category has guns like the AK-47 and the Tommy Gun. It's guns with decent damage and decent clip size. They are for guys who want the Zs to drop down quicker, and don't really have time to wait for them to bleed out. When using these you should still know how to headshot, but if you don't, the small Zs will still die. These guns drop Gorefasts and Bloats at a satisfying rate. (Red chargers and big fat ones)

The last and final category is for the SCAR and FN/FAL. Even though the magazines have decreased greatly in size, they pack quite a punch. They are the guns you'll see at the bottom of the trader list for the commando. Apart from of course dropping down the earlier mentioned zeds much faster, they'll let you take on Sirens and Husks (Screamers and gunners) with much more ease, and even Scrakes (chainsawdudes) on the lower difficulties. 

As you might (should) know, all perks have special abilities and bonuses. The Commando, apart from having higher damage with his perk specific weapons, has a faster reload with ALL guns in the game, which makes him great for playing offperk when you get a little bit more experience. Apart from this, he can see all invisible zeds. This includes the Patriarch, which is a huge advantage when he goes away to heal.

The Commando's guns may not be as varied as the other perks', but he has a lot of variation himself. Plus, if you use a commando gun as a mainhand, I don't see what stops you from using a flaregun, ZED-gun etc. as an off-hand.

Yes it is, but it is your deal to deal with, not his. If he loves you, like you said he does, then he's going to stick around and be supportive, like he's doing. So that's all good.
  
That sentence told me that you're already expecting him to leave because you got drunk and crazy, so you're making it a bigger deal than what it seems to be. **Take care of your issues**, and be thankful that you have a loving supportive man who will help you in your journey."

Music in its roots is explicitly tied with performance art. Originally, in fact for 99% of music's history, music didn't exist beyond a performance art. The only way to hear music was to go and see people do it or to be able to do it yourself. And now in the last 100 years we've found a way of grabbing that and recording it and allowing people to hear it anytime they want, and very quickly we've come up with many new ways to create this recorded music. My point was that, in a recording they are equivalent (real and electronic), but there is more to music than a recording, music started and I think will never stop being tied explicitly to performance art. And an artist that can not only create a great record but can also play that music live has arguably more value than an artist that can create and equally good record but cannot recreate it live without simply pressing play (basically the movie screening metaphor I used earlier)."

There are a few Irish pubs on Decatur that have pints and tv.

Finn McCool's in mid city should be rocking and packed with locals.

Quick fact the number of baby boys circumcised today in the us is about 32% whereas 30 years ago that number was in the 80% range or higher. I wonder why it dropped...?

Secondly about mutilation, I copied from wikipedia (since the oxford dictionary failed me)
&gt;Mutilation or maiming is an act of physical injury that degrades the appearance or function of any living body, sometimes causing death.

Circumcision is an act of physical injury that degrades the appearance and function of the penis, correct? It causes around 100 yearly deaths in the U.S alone, so there's the sometimes causing death part too. Wouldn't this be enough to call it mutilation of boys genitals? I.E genital mutilation?

Don't shy away from the word because it sounds horrible, people live through plenty of horrible things and are just fine. It does not change what happened though, they still went through an ordeal.

In case you wonder why Oxford failed me they said mutilation was:

&gt;the action of mutilating or being mutilated

That's some shitty justification.

I wanna stay at the Hilton but $100 is a little out of my price range.  They've got empty rooms; do I have the right to sneak in and crash?  I'll change the sheets; it won't cost them a penny.

No, of course not.  If I don't want to pay, I don't go.  It's their property and they have the right to limit access to it however they want.  If they knew people would be allowed to use it without paying they wouldn't have built it, and since it's in societies best interest to incentivize people to build and create things, we agree to recognize physical and intellectual property rights.

If you make something, it's yours, and the right to distribute it on whatever conditions you like is yours as well.  I don't get to infringe on those just because I don't like your price.

Jobbin,IAmA,1390609406.0,"Here is reddit's best sandwich ever, compliments of /u/unidan 
&gt;One time I was given free reign of a bagel store I worked in. I was in charge of everything. Everyone was gone for the day.
I made a hero out of bagel dough. Whole wheat dough, everything bagel toppings. I made the bread into garlic bread, with REAL garlic and REAL onions that I sauteed up in fresh butter.
The day before, my boss was having a family party so he ordered REAL Italian gourmet meats from Italy, to do it right. He made all the platters ahead of time, but still had leftover meats that he said we could use for our own delight. Real prosciutto, real salami, real provolone cheese that was unprocessed and unpasteurized. Capicola ham, spiced ham. I made a spiced mayonnaise myself, in the store. Roma tomatoes. Romaine lettuce that I delved through to find the perfect pieces. Red onion.
I stacked the meat so that it would be fluffy, folding each piece and making sure that it was in line with the bread-horizon. I used a perfectly sharpened bread knife to cut it on a slight diagonal across the hero-bagel-bread.
I roasted some red peppers that we had over our grill, and used the true, raw olive oil that he had used for the party for antipasto trays. I used a few olives to make a small tapenade that went into the center of the bread, injected via turkey baster. After I cut it, I wrapped it up and put it into our walk-in refrigerator to marinate for about half an hour.
I made a sandwich whose street value was easily over 150 dollars. I made two of these sandwiches. I gave one to my friend Kenny for his birthday.
The other one I ate over the course of a day. I ate nothing else that day.
I wept. Guys, I don't want this to sound like some bullshit story, but I fucking cried. I fucking cried over this sandwich, and I think about it every few weeks. This was almost four or five years ago."

It would have been much better to retrofit pre-existing laws to ensure that they applied to electronic mediums, than to create a new law about ""abusing a new medium"".

kuma_k,worldnews,1390609573.0,"Having been circumcised when I was like 10 years old, I still didn't really have much of a choice.  What exactly is the proper age that people want to see, anyway?  

Don't even ask me WHY I was circumcised, I have no clue.  I was born with a hernia on my stomach, but it was never an issue until I was about 10 years old when I started getting nasty stomach aches everyday which resulted in me throwing up every night.  Right before I got my surgery to fix it, we saw a doctor who also decided I should be circumcised too, iirc.  My mom seemed to just go with it, I think.  Especially considering that she's Catholic and my dad isn't circumcised.

I vaguely remember the doctor saying that I'd thank him for it later.  So when I went in for the hernia, they also snipped my junk.

I'll be honest, I don't miss it at all.  Its easier to keep clean (you have to work to actually get it dirty, even more so to maintain it), and in my experience, most girls seem to prefer it.  I'm sure they wouldn't *actually* care, or maybe all the girls I've been with were just being nice, but it seems like most do.

Anywho, I will admit, I just find a circumcised penis far prettier.  I'm not gay, I swear.  Well, maybe a little.

To be clear, I'm not for or against circumcision, I just want to know what age parents should wait for.  Or would it just be something a man (adult) would decide to do for himself when he's 18+ years old?"

so me and my friend are high and we're driving to the concert, but the thing about downtown miami is that it's mostly one way streets so the corners are rather large and high me was like

hmm, there's no cars around, I should totally downshift and drift these corners (I've done this dozens of times before with no problems)

so I got 2 or 3 corners in, then on my last one I came out of the drift and heard a FLAP-FLAP-FLAP-FLAP-FLAP

And I was like, I know I just didn't blow one of my tires, then my power steering went out and was like what's happening, car then started over heating very quickly

went to the concert and was hoping that if I let the car cool down it'd be fine (Don't know why I thought that logic worked) but after the concert we ended up having to stay the night in a hotel until my dad drove 3 hours to pick me, my friend and tow my car back

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1390609683.0,"True story: I was at the Berghain in Berlin walking out of the bathroom high as fuck on molly. If anyone is familiar with German club culture, it's basically loaded with MDMA, alcohol, and partying, so it's not like I was out of place. Anyways, I'm walking out of the bathroom and I start peaking, losing myself in the music. Right as I stopped to regather my composure, this is when what I'll soon discover stunning French chick walks by. 

Being pretty fucking high and not really being aware of my actions I just grabbed her, moved my hands down the back of her back and said, ""You are the absolutely hottest woman I've seen all night."" Turns out, she doesn't speak much English at all, and with all the noise, I'm pretty certain she had no idea what I was saying. But that doesn't matter. I could see in her eyes she was hooked. I grabbed her ass, picked her up, and pressed her against the nearest wall. During this time she just kept saying ""No, please, No"". But it wasn't like a cry for help, it was more of the playful LMR. Eventually I just get over it. The physical game was definitely on point, but I was way too fucked up to try and get through that language barrier. Yeah, I could have probably kept gaming her, but I just didn't fucking care. All her ""no""s and me being really high just was too much for me to care. 

So I dropped her and walked away towards a sort of more private area. I just really wanted to smoke and meet some new people, and honestly completely lost all interest in her. I can't explain it well, but unlike US clubs, this club has a bunch of sort of public/private spaces where you can jump into, and hang out with your friends. Imagine like a cubby with a bunch of pillows. Usually friends just chill in these areas since there really aren't VIP areas. And when hooking up, people usually close and latch em shut. 

Well I was sitting in the entrance of one just BSing with some strangers when she just full force tackles me into the cubby thing. This chick that was pleading me to stop 2 minutes earlier was now the sexual aggressor. We end up latching it shut, making out, and eventually fucking. Again, if you never been to this club, it's unreal. These cubbies are sort of positioned right next to the main dance floor and if you were to stand up in the space, you can see right into the dance floor. Well we start fucking and it was surreal. I was high as fuck on molly, fucking some random French chick a good 10 minutes after meeting her, while essentially in the middle of a club looking on and even seeing some of my friends in the background. It was seriously one of the best fucks of my life just because it seemed unreal. 

After I finish, we make out a little bit and some dude starts pounding on the door. She starts yelling some French at me but I have absolutely no idea what she's saying. I do speak some French, but when I'm high as fuck on molly and post orgasm, I really don't care for trying to think that hard. So I open the door and it's some dude just yelling at her and giving me really dirty looks. 

After noticing something is clearly not ""okay"" I decided to use my terrible French/English to get a grasp on the situation. Turns out, that was her brother and she was their wither her fucking FIANCE! The brother saw her head pop up a few times in the cubby and knew exactly what was going on and spent the last 10 minutes distracting him to ensure the fiance didn't see what was going on.

Oh no, but it gets better. So after this happened, we sort of parted ways. I tried to give her my email, but she just wasn't interested. So I just went back to my buddies and kept partying. It was like it never happened. Well two weeks later I'm in the office (huge company with like 300 employees), and am just running around doing what I need to do, and guess who I see?! Yep. She's a recently hired intern. I smiled, she smiled, and our relationship was never acknowledged again. "

codayus,AskMen,1390609970.0,"That number gets thrown around a lot, but studies repeatedly show no difference in sensativity between circumcised and uncircumcised men.  This is true both when attempting objectively measure the sensitivity of men who were circumcised at birth, *and* when asking for subjective reports from men who were circumcised as adults for health reasons.

For example, [this meta-study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23937309) found that ""The highest-quality studies suggest that medical male circumcision has no adverse effect on sexual function, sensitivity, sexual sensation, or satisfaction.""  The only studies that found male circumcision had **any** negative effects ""contained flaws in study design (11), selection of cases and/or controls (5), statistical analysis (4), and/or data interpretation (6); five had multiple problems.""

TL;DR:  The only way anyone has ever found that circumcision lowers sensitivity is by fucking up the study design.  It's about as clearcut as anything in medicine is."

Mughi,quityourbullshit,1390609973.0,"&gt; there actually is an official romanization

Unless the government decides to change the damn thing again. I live in a small town just outside Busan, and even though we're years post-RR/MC2000, the mills of progress can grind exceeding slow in the countryside, and you can still see the odd sign with McCune–Reischauer on it; an example being my town, Jangyu, spelled ""Chang Yu."" 

Also, there is still *some* unofficial Romanization in Korean; the name 이, for example, is spelled ""I"", ""Lee,"" ""Yi,"" and even (in the case of the first president of Korea) ""Rhee"" (yes, I know that 리 is closer to the traditional pronunciation and is still used in the DPRK, but 이 is far more common here in the ROK).

And that doesn't begin to scratch the surface of the seemingly random Konglish one finds on posters and t-shirts. There is an official Romanization system, but as far as pop culture goes, it's open season on transcription.

It doesn't take credit hours or years of life experience, as you put it, to know that impoverished communities lack safe sex practices to an extreme. Therefore the idea that circumcision can help prevent STI/STD spread is still valid. I understand that it doesn't validate circumcision, just that you can't deny it as a fact.

* Most targeted skill have a shorter range than 675

* Most all Auto attacks will be completely unaffected

* It does help in disorientation, but the low range and still large sight range ruins most of that.

I said almost useless for a reason. On paper a AOE blinding skill would be amazing, but the way Graves' W is right now it's almost completely effective for anything other than a slow.

I started this year wanting to get back into a weightlifting routine, but I didn't want to do SS again. I started ICF on the 7th(of this month) and was injured at work the next day.

artthoumadbrother,changemyview,1390610395.0,"&gt;The issues that dominate the political process don't have a 'right' answer.

You're right. Because most of the issues that dominate the political process are red herrings designed to distract ignorant people with short attention spans. The political stage as we know it today is such a ridiculous circus that you don't even realize what a vicious, sad joke it is. It's that way because the voter base is so ficklie, so ignorant, and so easily distracted. There are issues (i.e. size of government, amount of foreign influence we should exercise, privacy vs. security) that are genuinely worth debate. Most issues are not that way. We shouldn't have an omniscient intelligence agency. We shouldn't be subsidizing wind power while making it impossible to open a nuclear power plant. We shouldn't be subsidizing energy companies that are in no danger of failure. There should be term limits. It shouldn't be illegal to purchase health insurance outside of your state.

The problem is that the current regime throws up a goofy show via the news networks that keeps people distracted. They keep intellectuals distracted by occasionally discussing actually important issues---but only the ones that are actually debatable. We currently live in an oligarchy because that oligarchy is doing such a good job of agreeing on most issues while keeping that knowledge out of public hands.

The situation as it stands is this: The very rich are in absolute control of the political process in this country. There is no challenge to their dominance, certainly not from the uneducated poor. The addition of a test would limit the amount of manipulative influence that the very rich have over the voter base by cutting out their political slaves. It would pit the very rich against the merely well off, which, while not perfect, is better than what we have now."

TofuRobber,HPMOR,1390610805.0,"&gt; So, why do we (does Harry) value consciousness/human life so highly? Why not other virtues like beauty, honesty, or innocence? Was it an arbitrary choice? Can there be virtues/things more important than a human life? 

This isn't a question that I can answer with any amount of certainty. We value life/conciousness above all because it is what allows us to experience anything else. You cannot value beauty, honest, or innocence if you are dead or have no understand of those concepts. So no, choose life wasn't an arbitrary choice. Furthermore, life is a very real thing. Values of good, evil, beauty, innocence, are all really quite subjective. However, life is universally equivalent. You are either alive or you are dead and once you die you can't ever be alive in the same sense anymore.

I think that the reason why we should care about human life is because we are humans ourselves. That will not change. We can't be any more or less human and so our priorities will be to place humanity ahead of most things. There are aspects of humanity that makes us who we are and if anything shares these unique properties of being human then their lives will be just as important as a human's.

I'm sure other people have better answers but this is how I see it."

JohnStamosAsABear,TrueChristian,1390610839.0,"Seriously? This isn't about comparing the physical characteristics of A to B, the point is about trusting without evidence, or having faith. 

The Nigerian prince is making quite an outrageous claim, but who wouldn't want a million dollars! So its only natural for you to ask for some proof that what he is claiming is in fact correct. If the prince was unable to provide you with convincing proof, you wouldn't believe him. 

Now if you showed up to my door and told me that if I believe in your God I will be loved and rewarded after I die, but if I don't, he will punish me for eternity. Well of course I don't want to be tortured for the rest of time, but this is a pretty outrageous claim to make so naturally I'm going to ask if you for evidence. Now if you can't provide me with convincing evidence, why would I believe you? Telling me just to have faith that you're correct isn't going win me over either. Now imagine this was your house and a scientologist, mormon, hindu or any other religious missionary came to your door making the same claims. Would you believe them?

If I knew God was real I would be dancing and singing praises in the front row everyday. You admire biblical figures like Abraham, Abel, Noah and Moses etc for their steadfast convictions, but the bible states that they've actually seen God. How easy it would be to be a faithful Christian if you actually saw proof of God. Imagine if Jesus had go though life without actually seeing God and having to believe he was the son of God without any proof but some reassuring words. 

So the point is, why is it foolish to believe the Nigerian prince without any convincing concrete proof, yet it is a virtue to believe biblical claims without any convincing concrete proof."

My own laptop had just died so I was a little desperate to replace it and got overwhelmed by the deals, it's certainly a mistake I won't make again. I don't mean to get down on Staples but I probably won't buy a computer from them ever again. I understand why they have a 14 day policy but I don't think it's enough for a laptop. You shouldn't have to rush home and performance test any possible problems asap to make sure if you got a bad deal you can return it in time. That being said, I have bought an external hard drive from Staples that was perfect, so I'm not anti-Staples or anything, I just dislike their laptop policy. I really should have looked at the return policy before I bought it but I guess I'm not cynical enough.

jianadaren1,CanadaPolitics,1390611056.0,"Well the easiest one that no one appears to have done is to measure teachers by measuring how their students perform in subsequent years. It doesn't work universally, but should be very good at measuring performance in cumulative subjects at larger schools with multiple grades.

For example take a grade 10 math class from last year taught by Mr. X. Note those students' grade 9 percentile ranks. Compare that with their grade 11 percentile ranks. If Mr. X's former students did considerably better in Grade 11 compared to Grade 9, it's likely that Mr X did a great job actually teaching.

This system controls for the quality of the students as it only measures improvement (or regression) compared to their peers and is practically ungameable by the teacher because it relies on the grades given by other teachers."

 But there is a grey area when it comes to acronyms and initialisms that start with a consonant but when pronounced, it phoentically starts with a vowel. For example STD, it stands for sexually transimitted disease. So you would say 'I contracted a sexually transmitted disease'. But, if you were to use the initialism (STD) then you would say 'I contracted an STD' as you're pronouncing it as Es-tee-dee. Some people are saying that despite writing 'STD' you still read it out as 'sexually transmitted disease' so 'a' must be used instead of 'an.

They are generally awesome about it, so I tend to tip them as well as I did when I drank.

Champagne, champagne is a tough one. You know how everyone expects you to have birthday cake, no matter what diet you're on or what food intolerances you have? Birthday cake is part of the celebration in most people's minds. People tend to treat champagne the same way. I've actually had people say ""I know you don't drink, but this is champagne!"" Refusing it has been such a pain in the ass at points, that I basically now take the glass, raise it in toast, then put it down without drinking any. This is not something I'd recommend for anyone who is feeling at all tempted, or who really loves champagne.

Omega037,Stargate,1390611294.0,"Actually, that might not be a bad comparison.

The hyperspace technology seemed based on opening a stable window into a contracted hyper-dimension that exists in parallel to ours but does not interact with it normally.

With Destiny's FTL, there seemed at first to be a window forming, but then it just continued to move forward around Destiny in normal space.  Furthermore, the windows would show normal space outside, just stretched.

From this, we can theorize that the ""window"" of Destiny's FTL was more like a bubble akin to a warp bubble.  Destiny creates a bubble around it that warps space time, making the ship far larger relative to normal space.

While the effect is the same, it is basically the opposite of a hyperdrive, where the ship enters a region of space where space itself is smaller, but the ship remains constant."

I just got the rack and am still figuring out where I want the pins.  I was thinking this felt a little too low to start, so probably 1 hole higher would mean I don't have to push up so much when unracking, if that's what you meant.

Usually I touch the bar right below my pecs, so it may just be camera angle making it look high. Elbow flare might just be me being bad.  Should be in tighter?

Also, what camera angle would help to see things better in the future?  Higher elevation?

AJinxyCat,fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,1390611431.0,"The point is OP is portraying shit she made up in her head as something that not only actually occurred, but is the prevailing logic of an entire system of schooling.

It really isn't entertaining as simply an imaginary situation. The absurdity of a possibly suicidal person being denied help from the one entity that should be promoting the help *actually happening in real life* is what makes it ridiculous enough to be entertaining.

It's like the Billy Madison scene where Chris Farley is talking about banging the teacher when it's so obvious that it never happened. What is the point of bringing it up? It's a worthless conversation.

Not to mention the fact that this exact post is a good example of a shitty LiveJournal post in the first place. Which makes it all the more strange that someone would make it up (which OP almost certainly did) since it is so painfully mundane.

EDIT: Furthermore, making an entertaining story up is just fine considering that's what 99% of entertainment media is. It's the fact that so many reddit posters just flat out lie about experiencing something that is irritating.

Well, Daniels looks to be much older than Schur, and while I don't know how long each have been in the business of screenwriting and producing...I'd say Daniels probably just has the advantage of age and experience, if I can make a presumption.

TryUsingScience,pagan,1390611792.0,"&gt; Some Runes have reversed meanings when they are upside down or on their sides.

This is a modern concept that came about after Tarot. Some rune readers do read inversions but those who try to be more historical do not.

One thing you missed from your list of ways runes are perceived is that white supremacist groups also get runic tattoos. Most commonly Sowilo or Othala or Tiwaz but sometimes others.

Other than that, very solid post."

Yes. They do. This is *exactly* what my initial post is about.

Maybe I should have started my post by ""SORRY BUT NOT ALL MEN FEEL THAT WAY, HERE'S SOME ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE"" but where I come from not everything needs to be spelled out.

&gt; It's not ""weird"", it's because some men on reddit have some different attitudes than some men that you know. This is an ok thing.

It *is* weird, because of the sheer volume of these complaints online, compared to the amount of guys I meet who are ok with a woman making the first move.

Insurance valued my car at $8400 and I was surprised because kbb had it for much lower. I also searched for listings in the tri-state area (nj), and sent the insurance everything I found for what it's selling for. I then sent them invoices showing I had 4 new tires purchased the same year, new rotors front and back, new brake pads front and back, plus new serpentine belt, and a wheel bearing. Yeah, it's just maintenance, BUT it showed them that I took care of the car. It was my final attempt to get every damn dollar. Value bumped up to $8,663.48. 

I was about to replace the timing belt but thank goodness I didn't lol I would have been way more pissed off about it.

But my point is, don't rely 100% on kbb. It's good for a ballpark figure I suppose. I also checked out nadaguides for values.

HumanSockPuppet,TheRedPill,1390611888.0,"&gt;It seems to me that the guys here, in fact, manipulate women into remaining on the ""cock carousel"" that they complain about.

**Consider this: it is not my responsibility to teach a woman how to be attractive.** I had to figure out the things that would attract her and keep her around. She must do the same if she expects to keep me around.

Women are in a mental state where they expect to get the sex, the attention, and eventually the marriage and families they want. But slowly, men are abstaining from marriage over the course of the marriage strike. In time, as securing a husband becomes nigh impossible, it may force women to reconsider their strategies.

But regardless of how long it takes them to figure it out, it's their problem.

&gt;What is the male equivalent of the ""cock carousel""?

**The male equivalent is the [Time Ho](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9QOQNcpuiA).** A man who gives all of his time away thinking it will win women over, but who lacks masculinity, or backbone, or personal boundaries.

&gt;It makes sex seem dirty for women, but acceptable for men.

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390612124.0,"In part, I agree with you. There are, indeed, positives and negatives on both sides of the fence. And I agree also that people should learn to be grateful with what they have and not just look at what they don't have. I think that would make for better people everywhere.

But, firstly, envy and greed are not exclusive to poor people.  In fact, I haven't met a single ""self made"" wealthy person that wasn't driven by an almost obsessive desire to build wealth, buy beautiful things and attain status. There are probably people who stumble into self making a fortune, but I've never met them. 

*My background, relevant:*

*I'm self employed and my clients range from middle class to upper class. Over the years I've worked for dozens of different families. I enjoy my work, and don't work for anyone I don't like for very long, if at all. But no one is perfect, and these are my observations.*

*I grew up poor. My parents are academics, and before they were tenured, we were really poor. I wore thrift shop shoes until they literally fell apart and went to free health clinics until I was nine. After that we were middle class, but I was out of the house by the time my parents were able to make it out from under the previous decade of debt. We continued to live poor my whole adolescence.*

These are the issues I find non-wealthy people have with the wealthy:

(1) When people are purposefully, intentionally wealth building, it is extremely common for them to be so focused on making and saving money that do whatever they have to and can be real assholes. I commonly see them: taking*serious* advantage of and underpaying hardworking employees and contractors, condescending to and/or screwing over their wait staff and retail workers, paying for only cheap shoddy work when they can pass the buck onto someone else, selling items for well over their true value, etc. 
*To be fair, there are cheapskates everywhere. But it is much more infuriating when someone wearing a thousand dollar watch and driving a hundred thousand dollar car argues with you about your modest hourly rate than when someone with holes in their clothes does it.*

In fact, after seeing so much of this, I am generally more wary of ""self made"" uppercrusters than those that inherit their fortunes.  Many of the practices I see ""self maders"" using to ""self make"" I have moral issues with. Heirs can be really obnoxious, but I don't see them using/abusing those around them out of greed, just habit.

Now, once people have gotten to the point that they feel ""established,"" this changes pretty drastically, and generally I find ""established"" wealthy people very generous.


(2) Non-wealthy people commonly interact with wealthy people in the following circumstances:

* Employee to boss/employer relationship

* Seeking out their (wealthy person's) services where the price is high, standard across the profession, mostly or entirely non-negotiable, circumstances are usually fairly dire, or the service isn't entirely optional. ie doctors/specialists/surgeons, lawyers

* Being hired by them for any number of things rich people can and do pay for

* Serving them in restaurant and retail establishments, hair salons, etc

These circumstances are breeding grounds for resentment in general. 

When you don't get a cost of living raise and your boss gets a huge bonus, that chafes.  When people around you are let go and your work load increases without your pay increasing, and upper management gets raises for ""cost cutting,"" that really chafes. There are also really great employers out there. But it is more difficult to make big money when you're being a great employer, I observe them building wealth much less quickly, if they ever even make it to the point I'd describe as ""wealthy."" *(again, in my experience)*

Doctors work very hard to learn their trade, and what they do for us can be miraculous.  But we pay out the ass for it, aren't allowed to know the costs of appointments, procedures or tests ahead of time, and so can't shop around.  And frequently we don't have any real choice about whether or not to go through with them. *long, detailed, drawn out continuation on this that I don't see necessary unless someone insists*

Being a contractor has its advantages, and I dare say wealthy people are taken advantage of frequently by contractors. But goddamn, when really wealthy people argue with me about $20 and I realize that would be like me arguing over 50 cents, or *less,* I come close to losing it.

It's also really easy to resent people when you're serving them, regardless of how much money they make. But wealthier people have more money to throw at these things, use services more frequently, and have more opportunity to be resented.

Receivers: Calvin Johnson, either Marshall or Jeffrey opposite and Cobb in the slot.

derleth,TumblrInAction,1390612704.0,"&gt; 'Different perspective to code'. Excuse my ignorance, but isn't this almost the same as asking someone their perspective on a math problem? 

Once you get beyond solving solved problems (which is all you're taught until post-graduate mathematics), there are different perspectives in mathematics which are all valid. As one example, do infinite sets and other infinite objects really exist? Most mathematicians say yes, and see no problem with sets which can never be written down, even in principle. Others say that they're ill-founded, and prefer [to take a finitist stance.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitism)

There are other examples, but they'd likely require me to recap a goodly portion of an undergraduate math course to get you up to speed on what the basics of the controversy even are. If you want to research more, a good place to start is [the Axiom of Choice](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/axiom-choice/) and why it's not universally accepted: It's trivial to state but it leads to some very counter-intuitive (weird) results.

None of those other perspectives are founded on identity politics, though; there is no 'black mathematics' or 'female mathematics' any more than there is a 'white mathematics' or a 'male mathematics'. They're all founded on mathematical logic, which is no respecter of persons, to steal a concept.

Now, some things in Computer Science are not open to debate. For example, there's no way to determine whether a given program will always halt when fed a given input. That's called the [Halting Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) and there is a mathematical proof that it's undecidable. There's no 'other perspective' to have there: There's one correct answer, and all others are incorrect.

However, once you get beyond that and move towards the more applied side, there are an infinite number of tools and methodologies to use to make software, and none of them are miraculously better than others in widespread use. (Some of them are obviously moronic, but that's true of anything.) There might well be a 'black programming' or a 'female programming' we haven't discovered yet, but if we do find it, it will be based on actual work and honest inquiry, not SJW-style victimhood-claiming and the shouting down of everyone who disagrees."

We usually use them to determine flow rates in production plants. We measure the difference in pressure and we're able to figure out how fast/how much is flowing.

Venturi meters are more expensive than orifice plates and take up more space but allow for a smaller pressure drop to occur.

Some venturi meters can be hundreds of feet long.

**Oh, and this device is not complicated at all.** I don't know who made this video but this is an extremely simple mechanical meter that takes no digital or extra computation.

Many college teams utilize a spread style offense.

Due to the field change, the spread offense is not used as much in the pros.

I rented a Caravan for a road trip once and got 28MPG out of it, and I've got customers who complain about barely cracking 20. Worth knowing about the base model is that the rear passenger compartment does not have any heat/air conditioning and the windows don't go down, so if you often have passengers they'll probably be uncomfortable. Incentives are regional so I'd have to check on them (not at work now) but I can tell you on a base model at sticker price the dealership has about $700 total profit not counting any incentives. It's a loss leader for Dodge so don't expect gigantic discounts outside of the rebates. Based on what you say your needs are this model sounds like a good fit.

For your boot shopping adventures, I strongly recommend Clarks. (Their online selection is a *lot* better than their in-store selection.) I bought a pair of black combat boots, wore them nearly every day to my job as a teacher in a home for insane children, and I'm pretty sure they're indestructible. They're a little more expensive than boots from Target/Payless/etc, but they'll last you (at least) three times as long as cheaper boots, so it's cool.

I bought a couple of pairs of boots from Etsy - one pair was AMAZING and ridiculously comfortable, and the other pair gave me giant terrible blisters and I had to (tearfully) throw them away. So, it's an option, but be careful.

As far as what to pair them with - almost anything. Don't wear them with pants that aren't fitted at the calf, and don't wear them with swimsuits, and...that's it. You can even wear them with [dresses](http://www.pinterest.com/niyasisk/boots-and-dresses/) if you want. The sky's the limit, the world is your oyster, etc etc."

I fought with the guy twice. Chased him away once, but he came BACK for more as I was leaving. Tripped her and literally curbstomped her before I ran back and I hit him. Got a companion to call the cops. He ran away because I didn't bother restraining him.

Lets say premium was pumped last and the current customer was mid-grade, all the pump does is mix in more low-grade to compensate for the extra volume in the hose.

They don't; that's why LFR can be difficult.

In the water treatment industry, clarifiers encourage particles to clump up and either settle or float. The particles are then much easier to collect with a skimmer or filter.

Mostly these are used to get colloids and suspensions out of the water by taking all the tiny particles and getting them stuck in a floc we can later pull out.

Most of the clarifiers we use are nonreactive and totally bio-inert. They are chelating agents only, which means all they'd do to a bacterial bloom is attach to the bacteria and get them stuck in the filter as the water cycles.

I can't assume aquarium clarifiers are the same as water treatment agents, but there's surely some similarity."

Under about 25F, I layer two pairs of regular running tights, a long sleeve base layer, a warm jacket, hat, and maybe gloves. Above 30F, I lose the extra tights and swap my warm jacket for a light jacket over the base layer. In between those temps it is a guessing game and I'm usually wrong.

After it fires, you can refresh (without reloading) the tableview with  [tableView beginUpdates]; [tableView endUpdates]; to get it to look for your new cell height.

So:

1. User swipes, this fires the gesture recognizer's delegate method
2. In gesture recognizer's delegate method expand your cell and tell your controller which cell is expanded.  Then call beginUpdates and endUpdates.
3. In heightForRow, check to see if the current path is the swiped one, if so return the larger height - else return the normal one.

If I'd been in a relationship at that time and my partner had started to spend less time with me, didn't seem to be as affectionate and then turned me down for sex, I'd probably have reacted exactly the same way your girlfriend had. And it's not that she's necessarily a crazy person; she's dealing with something huge for the first time in her life, and she's not really sure she's going to ""make it,"" whatever that means to her.

InspectorVII,AskReddit,1390613782.0,"It is a little counter intuitive, but reflux is caused by an over production of acid.  What happens when you neutralize or ""nuke"" all the acid is that your stomach produces more, to compensate of the acid which is no longer present.  Over time constantly taking things to neutralize stomach acid will result in your stomach constantly over producing, ie chronic reflux.  BUT if you add a little acid to the mix, your stomach is like ""well shit, everything is good here"" and will cease acid production.  

Basically a shot of acid will trick your stomach into ceasing production of unnecessary acid."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390613821.0,"I see from the other comments that a messy room or neat room doesn't make a difference to you.

I think that, if you really want to see what this is about, you need to go somewhere that is a *seriously* dirty mess and spend at least a few hours there then return to your clean house. If you truly experience both environments equally, then there is no difference to you.

But, for most people, this is not the case.  

Doing little ""neatening"" things, like making your bed, makes it MUCH easier to keep dust, grime, etc under control. 

Many people are more at ease, calmer, and think better, in a clean organized environment than a dirty disorganized one.

Something that might give you an inkling of this: have you seen any of those shows about hoarders/hoarding? Does watching that footage not make you feel uncomfortable?

Granted, hoarding is a FAR cry from an unmade bed. But keeping on top of little things means it can never get far enough out of hand as to make you feel uncomfortable."

mysled,AustralianCattleDog,1390613839.0,"MEET PINK! Pink is a young (about one year old) Cattle Dog mix that is looking for a home!
Pink has been staying with us at The Animals’ House for a few weeks to work on some basic obedience and manners while she looks for a family of her own. We are fostering her through the Australian Cattle Dog Rescue Association.

Pink is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, and has no known allergies or medical conditions. She is great in the car, house and crate trained. Pink is a very bubbly girl that LOVES toys, food, and will happily work for both of these! She absolutely adores any and everyone she meets. Pink gets along well with many dogs, but would do best in a home to be the only pet. While she loves to play, she can be a bit of a handful for most dogs to handle, and has a strong prey drive instinct that makes her unsuitable for a home with small pet animals. Families with pre-existing dogs would be taken into consideration on a case-by-case trial to adopt Pink.

The best potential home for Pink would be someone that loves to be active and wants a canine partner to be active with! She will happily join you for a hike, bike ride, play session, or most any canine sport!"

wolfkin,divergent,1390613882.0,"ok you have more questions than I had. I was able to just accept it. But I will first of all say that your uestions do have distinct answers.

&gt;then is that it's believed that someone raised in one faction can grow up to embody all (and only) the ideals of another faction. 

traditionally in the book it hasn't been all and only. People have traded factions it's a thing that happens. It's not everyone but it' snot no one. Even the test means nothing. The test tells you where you can do best but you are allowed to choose the faction you go to.

I actually found their society believable. Very much so because my comparison was The Hunger Games. Which expected me to believe that for 26? years people let the capital take their children with no fight.

The story is that people were at war. there was an event. and then after the event they established societies based on traits. that's reasonable right? well those societies kept evolving and hardening. Maybe in the beginning people switched and whatever it was a thing but by now in the book everything is tight and focused and switching is more rare and more notable. The factions aren't just different ideals but different families. Cult-like in their exclusion of everyone else.

Personally, I couldn't just take money out of my business account unless I was paying an employee, paying myself, or using it for the business. I understand, and I feel for you. And you know what? I went to the ""physical abuse"" direction because *your post indicates that you have been physically abused*. The thing is, you havn't really said *what you were afraid of* that led you to give her the loans. You say it was fear and vaguely talk about how I don't understand emotional abuse and then wave stockholm syndrome in my face and don't give the reason why, which is what I asked. The answer could be as simple as ""I don't know"" or ""She asked me to so I did it without thinking"". But don't jump on me for just asking a question I am curious about. For all you know, it could wind up explaining the root of some of your issues. Or, better still, prevent anything like that from happening again next time you own a business, which I fully believe you can and will do eventually.

Best of luck. Didn't mean to touch a nerve with you. But just to clarify: I am well aware there are other forms of abuse. Your OP was what led me to believe you were in a physically abusive relationship."

I want to compare last year's (n-1) performance, with next year's performance (n+1) to gauge the quality of this year's (n) teaching. So you take the student's grade 9 relative performance (e.g. 50th percentile) and compare it to the student's grade 11 relative performance (e.g. 75th percentile) in order to judge how well the grade 10 teacher prepared that student for the next grade. 

If, on average randomly-assigned students going through a teacher's classroom consistently improve their relative performance, then that teacher is clearly better-preparing his or her students for the next grade. "

Drop_,DotA2,1390614167.0,"Puck is clearly a special case, because the ""downside"" of blink dagger on puck is negated basically entirely with phase shift.  

It was kind of like when you could orb while using Ghost Scepter.  

It is something hard to balance, situational items v. generally great items.  But for the purposes of something like Blink it's clearly better on about 10 heroes, all of them focused on initiation.  In every other case, Force Staff is a much stronger item pickup.  

Maybe that is balance, I'm not sure, but I don't think items should be balanced around heroes that can make them powerful, but rather that items should be a sort of baseline.  Icefrog didn't nerf Ghost Scepter because heroes with orbs made it too powerful, he nerfed the ability to orb while ethereal to balance it.

3. This is a hard question; because bras in this size are so scarce and expensive, deciding to order one requires a lot of care. Any 'duds' are generally returned as quickly as possible, and I should probably have kept better notes since I didn't have lasting experience with them.
4. One pinkie.
5. High, I guess, since I've never met one that I thought was too high.
6. Narrow. When the bra is off my body and fastened, the wires should be narrow enough that, together, they aren't wider than the back band is long.
7. All. The. Time. 
8. If I find one like this, I exchange it for another style. I find molded cups do this more than unmolded. 
9. Balconettes and Demis tend to work best for me; at this point I select style for function, I don't yet have a preference among equally-functional alternatives.
10. Fabric. molded cups always seem to try and force my boobs into unnatural shapes

Bonus: That you can't try anything on in stores. I guess, theoretically, one could order like 10 bras in various styles and sizes to try on at home, planning to return 8 or 9 of them, but laying out a grand just to buy one bra seems a little unreasonable, no?

Function, the natural state of the glans is to be moist, it's an internal organ and when the foreskin is removed it dries. The function of the foreskin is to keep the glans clean, moist and healthy. This is done with smegma, which is actually antibacterial and antifungual, it is produced constantly so the excess needs only to be rinsed off and all is well. Removing the foreskin removes it's function.

Now to your sources, checking the citations for the first statement of sexual function you have this quote
&gt;Circumcision in adolescence or adulthood may evoke a fear of pain, penile damage or reduced sexual pleasure, even though unfounded.

So while unfounded it is still a possibility meaning it's not disproved. But it gets better.
&gt;The Royal Dutch Medical Association's 2010 Viewpoint mentions that ""complications in the area of sexuality"" have been reported.

and then:
&gt;Additionally, the procedure may carry the risks of heightened pain response for newborns, castration anxiety for boys in the phallic stage, and dissatisfaction with the result.

There's also this about the studies made in africa:
&gt;Three studies in Africa several years ago that claimed that circumcision prevented AIDS and that circumcision was as effective as a 60% effective vaccine (Auvert 2005, 2006). These studies had many flaws, including that they were stopped before all the results came in.  There have also been several studies that show that circumcision does not prevent HIV (Connolly 2008). There are many issues at play in the spread of STDs which make it very hard to generalize results from one population to another. 

From wikipedia about HPV:
&gt;...a randomly selected circumcised man is less likely to be found infected with cancer-causing types of HPV than an uncircumcised man.

&gt;No strong evidence indicates that it reduces the rate of new HPV infection

Condoms make these points moot either way since neither of them are protected against by circumcision, there is only a decrease in risk.

[Here](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/more-circumcision-myths-you-may-believe-hygiene-and-stds) is some light reading about myths and facts about the foreskin and circumcision.

Some citations from part 3 about sexual impacts:
&gt;Circumcised men are 4.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with erectile dysfunction, use drugs like Viagra, and to suffer from premature ejaculation (Bollinger 2010, Tang 2011).
&gt;Men who were circumcised as adults experienced decreased sensation and decreased quality of erection, and both they and their partners experienced generally less satisfaction with sex (Kim 2007, Solinis 2007).

&gt;In a landmark study of US women, 85% who had experienced both circumcised and intact men preferred sex with intact men.   Sex with a circumcised man was associated with pain, dryness and difficulty reaching orgasm (O'Hara 1999).  In another study, women were twice as likely to reach orgasm with an intact man (Bensley 2003).  Even when a woman said she preferred a circumcised partner, she had less dryness and discomfort with intact men (O'Hara 1999)."

The difference?  A quick double-take can be very flattering.  It says, ""You're pretty, and I'm hard-wired to want to tap that, but I can control my basest urges.""  In contrast, a really slow once-over that makes me feel like you're mentally undressing me (and worse) makes me want to take out your eyeballs with a red hot spoon.

So yes, I think checking out a woman is inherently objectifying, since it can only be her physical appearance that led you to do so, but that alone is no crime.  After all, women size each other up and check out guys all the time.  It's the fact that some guys stare as though the woman's sole purpose is to serve his viewing pleasure that crosses the line and makes everyone feel gross."

The Amalgamation is way too complex for flair though. Shrunk down it'll just look like a mess. Also I think it would look better is the split was vertical vs horizontal. Maybe I'll google up the images and try it out. 

The one from the movie frankly looks weird. And where did we see that frame? I don't remember seeing a Divergent symbol in any of the trailers I saw.. I must have missed it.

And the Allegiant Cover symbol... I'm not sure that's the Divergent Symbol

&gt;A short note about that symbol: no, it is not a faction symbol. It is, however, a symbol that appears in the book.

wraith313,MapPorn,1390614624.0,"I don't agree with that. But I will say this: I think we need to find a different way to represent people here. Because it honestly isn't fair that this small and dense contingent in the northern part of the state that is, again, primarily made up of people who don't even work in the state, have the overwhelmingly large say in how everything runs in the *rest of the state*. When you look at the geography of it, it doesn't make a lot of sense. At least, it doesn't to me. For instance: I have no reason to vote really, because even if I and the rest of the state (outside of the north) *all* vote for one guy, if the north all votes for the other guy, they will win. It makes the rest of us kinda feel worthless. Because even if we all band together, we still lose (which has happened in the last couple of elections, if the voting maps are to be believed). It's a sea of red and then a pinpoint of blue, and blue wins out. 

This really doesn't have anything to do with democrats or republicans, tbh. I think it's more to do with a lot of people in my area just feeling non-represented. I don't wanna cut them off. But maybe change the voting rules to fix the issue. Maybe make it so you have to live *and work* in the state at least 9 months out of the year to vote in state elections or something.

Idk. I just know a lot of people from DC and maryland keep residence here and vote in our elections and dont even really live or work here."

wotmate,videos,1390614799.0,"This is becoming more and more common in Australia, especially with newer european trucks.  I have heard it on brand new kenworths, macks and western stars as well.

The real reason why they have done it is because of residents around construction or delivery sites whinging about the beeping noise, especially at night.  

I worked on the first ever large event at Sydney's Luna Park after it was redeveloped a few years ago, and we were under strict instructions that all vehicles had to perform reversing maneuvers INSIDE the building so that certain neighbors on the 6th floor of a nearby apartment building wouldn't complain.  When I got outside, I looked up at the apartment building beside the precinct to see 3 people standing on a 6th floor balcony, at 3am, in inclement weather.  These fuckwits were deliberately trying to hear ANY noise so that they could complain.

After that, if I was ever going past in a truck late at night, and there was no event on, I would make a point of sitting there for 15 minutes with my truck in reverse, just to piss them off.  On the next event that I worked on there, the restrictions were removed, because the management of Luna Park had sued the residents for malicious and false complaints made while the precinct was closed, and won.

Exactly. I think there's *a lot* more men suffering from eating disorders than the statistics report. Partly because men are misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed and partly because it's taboo for men to have body image issues. There's pressure for men to be lean and ripped, just like there's pressure for women to be thin.

We'd be a little weak on rim defense, but I imagine between him and George Hill getting through a p&amp;r would be impossible. I genuinely don't think we'd miss a beat, and still be potential title contenders this year if he was our 5. Also the ball movement makes me drool.  Hibbert would probably thrive without Rose, and I could see him putting up 20 a night with maybe a slight defensive let up, but then again... Thibs is God.  He really can hit the open 15 footer and has nice moves with both hands and I don't even want to think about how he'd pair with Rose.  I see some lethal high screens and drive and dishes."

Yes, it's that specific and I am particular on how I cook it. I usually have a small pot for cooking. I open the bag, take out the noodles, break the square in half so the noodles are pre-cut, separate the layers, and up it into the pot. I pour the contents of the flavor packet on top. From there I pour water on top of that until it's about half way up the noodles. On to the stove on high heat. It's not long until one layer can be moved with my cooking utensil and I get the other layer submerged and the power mixed. I periodically move it around to get the water equally absorbed. It's done when the water is boiled off or absorbed.

I already mentioned those limitations.

&gt;Also, this also does not account for changes in students' lives - even one student going through a crisis event, where their grades drop precipitously, can affect your averages and thus your salary.

There are two ways to fix this. One is to further compare that student's math performance to their performance overall. If, for example, that student is doing bad in all subjects in grade 11, that's likely a sign of a student in crisis in grade 11 and not a reflection of the grade 10 teacher's performance.

Second is the law of averages. All teachers get students who go into crisis. In the long run they should all get about the same amount and that shouldn't skew the results.

&gt; I do NOT care for any system that puts changes to me salary in the hands of other teachers.

If your students are consistently struggling in next year's classes in your subject, while the other teacher's students are thriving, then you are not doing as good a job as a teacher.

No, it's not the only one. In fact, I listed a couple other options. You even quoted them in one of your higher comments. Of these other options, I suggested talking with him. As in, kid to kid, sit him down and explain that when he stabs people, it hurts them, and it makes other people not like him. Or, if you told the teacher, she wouldn't start stabbing the kid with a pencil, she would put him in time out, or send him to the principal.

&gt;We've reached the limits of your understanding. You're just a monkey. You have no ability, apparently, to conceive of something like counter-intuitiveness.

Well, okay then. I suppose that is a perfectly valid argument and not ad hominem at all /s. In all seriousness, though, I'm not going to try to defend myself against petty insults from the internet, since they don't really affect me (they made me feel a little sad, I admit), and have nothing to do with the conversation.

I'm just going to ask again: how will doing nothing affect positive change? I understand that many times, problems will go away on their own if we wait long enough. I also have a vague, probably not-so-correct understanding of the philosophy of ""everything is as it is meant to be, so there is no need to do anything or feel bad about it"" that is put forth by many sects of both Western and Eastern religion.

However, I fail to see a reasonable argument for indifference as the best policy for all times when bad things are happening. Another example: Say you come upon a woman in the middle of the wilderness. Just as you first see her, a bee comes up and stings her on the arm. She frantically starts rummaging through her backpack, and passes out on the ground just as she removes the epi-pen from her bag. An indifferent person would say ""oh, well I guess that happened"" and move on. A person who is even slightly reasonable and empathetic will take 30 seconds out of their life to apply the epi-pen and save the woman's life. Please explain the fault in my logic, or how I am misusing some part of my or your argument, because I don't see it."

ibbity,SubredditDrama,1390615295.0,"It's in [this thread](http://www.redditlog.com/snapshots/53821) (redditlog snapshot, so I can't link just that conversation.) About 2/3 down the page. Dude called ""celda"" who either was previously or is currently a mod said 

&gt;...I have no problem with all genuine claims of rape through the form being ignored - that is essentially non-harmful...

The commenter with whom he was talking replied:

&gt;I'm afraid I'm not seeing your point here. How is a genuine rape claim being ignored not harmful?

To which celda replied:

&gt;I think you're missing the point. If there were 100 cases of real rape that went unnoticed because of this extremely limited one-two day action, a hundred or about 1 in 4, it wouldn't matter one fucking bit...if just one of those accusations is/was false it completely negates every single legitimate accusation.

The thread, topic being ""It is hypocritical for feminists to be upset about what we did!"" was posted by a definitely current mod called ""sillymod"" who has gone on record as saying that the Occidental incident was [absolutely not wrong at all](http://www.redditlog.com/snapshots/53233) (it's in the comments, not the topic, but the topic is relevant to the comments), after initially blaming the event on [outside trolling](http://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1t4p2s/why_did_sillymod_remove_the_occidental_college/)."

*Relative performance*. If that teacher isn't teaching to as high a standard then your former students will be acing the class.

&gt;there are other issues that could cause a students grade to fall such as home life issues, abusive parents, divorcing parents,, extra circulars, work, student ""drama"" such as girlfriend/boyfriend stuff.

A) you can control for that stuff easily. It would show up in the numbers if the student is in crisis and struggling across the board.

B) All teachers in the same school with randomly-assigned students deal with that factor to the same degree. It averages out in the end.

&gt;I know a girl from High school was a year away from valedictorian but in her final year almost flunked out because her mother died and she was off for more than a month. Going to blame a teacher for that?

See A) and B). Furthermore, when comparing 30 data points and looking at the median, one girl's crisis won't throw anything off.

But as far as balancing our nation's budget (Note: while, working under the accusation of a ""Tax and Spend Liberal"" -- which we still amazingly hear to this day without irony), a flawless military record and bringing together both parties against Newt Gingrich by refusing to play politics with the nation's budget, it's pretty clear that Bill Clinton had a better run than most.

I was a troubled in kid high school, always keeping to myself. Various psychologists ordered me medicine, but they never helped. Every time I took them, I was never myself. 



I was just a regular kid who never joined a sports team or had a girl reply to me when I tried to talk to her. I started hanging around stupid kids and breaking up a few laws. Had some problems, painted some walls.



15 years old, just another victim, just another kid that would end up dead or in prison. I never hurt a soul in my life I'm a family man, so tell me how bad of a man I am?

abcd_z,kotor,1390615757.0,"&gt; SAVING LEVELS:  
&gt; This is an important topic among KotOR players. If you turn off the auto-level-up feature in the game, you will have to manually level up your character once you gain enough experience for each new level. If you wanted, therefore, you could hold back and not level up... ever. You could be level 2 when you leave Taris, so that you can gain more levels as a Jedi. Here are the reasons you may or may not want to do this.  
&gt; \- Pros: More FP, more Powers, you can calculate your levels in each class to maximize feats, skills, or whatever traits you desire. This allows you to create a completely perfectly tailored class to suit your desires and play style. You can roleplay better or powergame better because of this.  

&gt; \- Cons: Not leveling can make Taris a bit harder (or a LOT harder), and a MAJOR BUG: If you hold off on leveling up, the game will get confused, and stop giving experience points (XP) to members of your party who are chillin' back at the base. The more levels you hold back on, the worse the effect. This bug cannot be avoided, but the damage can be lessened by holding back as few levels as possible or only using two other party members the whole game. I HIGHLY recommend against only using 2 NPCs the whole game, however, since its a lot more fun to play with them all, and you experience a lot more dialog with all of them out and about. If you experience this bug, you can run around on Dantooine after you've become a Jedi and make up the experience by killing Kath Hounds in the wilderness and using all your Party members.  

&gt; \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  
&gt; BUG DESCRIPTION: Basically, the game looks at how much XP you saved. A level 5 character on Dantooine has generally saved back 20,000 XP. When you become a Jedi, the game will stop giving XP to a given NPC while they are at the Ebon Hawk, until they even out at about 20,000 XP behind you. They will gain XP while with you, but still not gain XP at the Hawk until they reach the right distance behind you. This means that for most of the game, they will be 2 or 3 levels lower than your main character. The effect is lessened as you reach higher levels (where 20,000 XP isn't enough XP for 1 level gain), and if you kill some extra respawning enemies you can make the extra back and reach level 20 with all characters.  
&gt; \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  
&gt; In the end, I still save levels, even though some party members are held back a bit as a result. I normally kill extra Kath Hounds on Dantooine while running around, or a bunch of Wraid on Tatooine (which is good because Wraids drop Wraid plates that you can sell for extra money too).  

&gt; Level Saving Tips:  
&gt; \- 5/15 is the magic number. Why? Because all Jedi gain a feat at level 15, and all starter classes gain one at 5. If you check it out, you maximize your potential number of feats by holding at level 5 with your initial class. If you hold back at a lower level than 5, you will seriously ""gimp"" the rest of your party, and more than that won't have as much benefit to your Jedi class since you lose Force Powers.  
&gt; \- What about extra Powers for Consulars? If you go 5/15 as a Consular you will miss out on the extra Force Power at level 17, but again: holding back below 5 is bad for the rest of your party. Really bad. Even I don't like to go under 5.  
&gt; \- What about Bonus feats for Scouts? If you start as a Soldier, you needn't worry about that of course, but scouts get extra feats at levels 4, 6 and 8. The Level 4 and 8 feats are Implant upgrades, and you can grab Implant 3 on your own, after you become a Jedi, if you want. (I highly recommend you do) The Level 6 feat is Uncanny Dodge 2, which you don't really need, in the end, as it is one of the crummier of the bonus feats. In my opinion, 5 is still best, because a Scout gets feats at 1,2,3,5. And a Jedi would gain a feat at 15. Any more or less in either direction and you lose a feat.  
&gt; \- And Bonus feats feats for Scoundrels? Scoundrels get Sneak Attack Upgrades at 1,3,5,7,9,etc. and Scoundrel's Luck upgrades at level 6 and 8. However, I feel that the increased Sneak Attack damage and the Defense bonus of improving Scoundrel's Luck is outweighed by the benefits of more Force Powers and and FP. Not to mention that Jedi get more feats than Scoundrels. However, I will note that certain builds can be centered around Sneak Attack, and may want to level up to 7 or 9 as a Scoundrel to get the extra damage. I recommend that you hold off on that sort of strategy until you feel you have a solid grasp of the topics in this guide about Character building.  

&gt; Thus 5/15 seems to be the way to go 98% of the time, regardless of class combination.

Thursday: The happiest day of my life. It snowed at school, which is a big deal, considering I live in Louisiana.. and, well, I cried for 20 minutes (shhh guys can cry) out of pure joy. I had so much fun with my friends in the snow.

Friday: School wasn't canceled, but it was delayed for two hours (which was hella dumb). I got interviewed in the morning whenever I was playing in the snow again, but I'm pretty sure I looked like a dingus. I was really self-conscious because of my looks/voice, but I went with it anyway.

The school day was exhausting. I felt so tired by the time I got back to my room, but my roommate was having some emotional issues, and I wasn't feeling up to supporting her.. I ended up sleeping for 2-3 hours (not sure), and I have no idea where she ran off to, so I feel really bad. Also, the snow is gone, and I miss it.

Things like lack of protest, or flirting earlier, consent by coercion or deceit, and a lot of other things aren't seen as rape even if consent isn't there. Because, it's like they say, it's not just ""no means no,"" but also ""yes means yes."" However I do disagree with their implications that only men can rape.

Instead of teaching men not to rape, we should teach people about rape and consent and what constitutes it in sex ed. This could also remove a lot of SJW beliefs that looking at a woman is rape (even though they'll probably just say that white men wrote the curriculum and it's therefore invalid)."

fnredditacct,sex,1390616103.0,"I think establishing a comfort level with gentials is a good place to start.

From there it will be at least somewhat easier to think about oral, if not also to try it. And I believe it would also give you time to slow down, not 'just try to get off.'

I'm reading *(maybe incorrectly)* that you are experiencing a real disconnect between person and genitals/sex. 

I have an idea. Maybe it's good, maybe it's not, but here it is:

What do you think about just spending time around each other naked? Perhaps in completely mundane contexts, but not sexual ones. Maybe just talking to each other. I think that seeing his whole body, genitals included, when talking to him will help you associate them with him. Then they wouldn't  just be 'genitals' they'd be part of him. Less to be embarrassed about.  Same for you. Try to just look at your own genitals a few times a day. Not just by themselves, but as a part of your body, a part of what makes you you.

If you can establish comfort with both your and your husband's genitals, then I think you'll be halfway there.

The only people I took my son to see were my dad, grandmother, and brother, and that's because I wanted to get out of the house.  Everyone else came by if they wanted to see the baby.  

&gt;and then immediately passing her off when she needs a diaper change because 'she only had boys, and she doesn't know what to do'

Sorry, this isn't supposed to be a funny post, but this cracked me up.  How can she not know how to wipe a vagina?!?!  That's forgetting the fact that even if you're a guy and only have boys, you still probably know how to do that.  Wow.

You should let her know that you would love to see her, but that it would be much better if she came to you and the baby.  Let her know that you're open and excited to schedule a time when she can come to you.  Then, when she's there, if she tries to wake the baby up to take pictures, tell her not to.  Either, ""Please don't wake her, she really needs her sleep,"" or ""Please don't wake her, unless you want to be the one to put her back to sleep.""

I can tell he really understands the disorder. I've actually really appreciated how Abed's been this season, it feels even more like his Asperger's is affecting him, if that makes sense. Tons of times in my life I thought my brother was the biggest dick in the world. But now I understand that he just thinks and feels totally differently than everyone else. The not paying rent thing is a perfect example. He's not doing it because he's a jerk. He's doing it because he doesn't understand why he needs to. Abed avoids things he doesn't understand. He puts them off until the very last moment and then doesn't know how to react when something happens (like Troy leaving).  Like I said, I'm no psychologist.

ahazelgun,AskMen,1390616486.0,"Story from my boyfriend about a college ex:

She came to his dorm room, most likely expecting a breakup, since this visit was preceded by some kind of, ""We need to talk,"" conversation.  He broke up with her, and she seemed to take it really well - no freaking out, no tears, just a calm, understanding acceptance.  At some point in the middle, he left the room for a few minutes to let his roommate in.

In the ensuing days and weeks, he would discover random surprises around his room.  A random disc of a TV show broken (still in its box), or a chapter ripped out from a textbook, or a random file folder missing from the computer.  How she managed to orchestrate all this in the few minutes he was gone is still a mystery.

Moral of the story:  Don't break up around stuff you value."

I'll let Bush have the 2000 election through Supreme Court decision, only because I wouldn't challenge it if the shoe were on the other foot.  Now if there were court jury convictions about ballot tampering (which there isn't, but should), that would be another story.

Winning the popular vote does not, Constitutionally, decide a Presidential election.  It sure works good at throwing it in the apologists' faces.  The other one is how the 2004 election was the closest re-election of a President.  As opposed to say, Reagan's comical re-election results."

Literally everything people survive on in urban and suburban environments depends on a truck to get it there.

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1390616591.0,"Well, very technically. It's in the DSM, and is treated like a disorder.

Err, rather, disphoria, which is the mental disconnect between what your mind expects your body to be as opposed to what it actually is, gender-wise, is in the DSM. Someone with Gender Disphoria is constantly made aware of how wrong they are in their body, and it leads to depression and suicide. While it is in the DSM, which traditionally handles mental conditions, the only real cure is to alleviate some of the disphoric elements of and individual, usually adding hormones or surgery to make them feel more comfortable. Someone undergoing such a treatment is considered to change their sex, both physically and socially. A person that does this is called a ""Transsexual.""

Transsexuals usually don't drop the ablism, and I find it odd being used here. Still, I have seen the medical condition side being used as a reason for discrimination in states that don't offer any civil protection for transsexuals.

Only 17 states have employment discrimination laws concerning transgendered people. That said, a large number of multinational corporations have added this to their hiring policies, here's a Huffpost link of a few, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/22/transgender-employees_n_3795522.html but given research, there maybe much more."

silly87,beyondthebump,1390617124.0,"I can tell you how we do it.  I go to law school full time and I work part time.  My husband is a stay-at-home dad.  I'm not sure how much I buy the ""isn't good at domestic things"" excuse.  My husband grew up as the most pampered, spoiled kid.  His mom was still doing his laundry and buying his clothes until the day he moved out.  He never had to cook a meal, clean a bathroom, vacuum, or anything else.  But now?  He does most of the general picking up and I do more of a deep cleaning because I'm a bit anal about it thanks to my dad raising me to be that way.  But he cleans the bathroom, does the vacuuming, does the laundry and puts mine and his away (I put our son's away because anal), used to do all the cooking but now we split it about 50/50, and of course takes care of our son all day.  

Our son isn't the easiest, though he doesn't scream all day, and he's also 11 months old.  The second I get home from school, I get handed a baby.  It's a little overwhelming because I'm usually exhausted, but I'm also excited to see him.  The one thing I ask my husband to understand a little more is that when he gets breaks from the baby, he gets to play video games; when I get breaks from the baby, it's generally to do schoolwork.  Anyway, I usually hang out with my son alone for an hour or so, then we play with him together, and I don't touch schoolwork until he's in bed at 7:30.  If I have a paper due or something and it's the weekend, my husband will ""take one for the team"" and just stay with him most of the day, and I'll give him short breaks.  

I feel like we both end up doing about half the work.  He doesn't do all the cooking and cleaning, but he does the majority.  When I'm home, I'm with my son as much as possible, but he doesn't get a free pass all night either.  I guess I feel like his job is being a dad right now.  So when I get home, we're both done with our ""jobs"" but we still have a house and a baby.  That means I'm not allowed to say, ""I work so I don't have to do anything,"" and he's not allowed to say, ""I already took care of the baby and house all day, so I'm done for the night.""  It works to generally keep us from resenting each other pretty well.

If your baby screams a lot, though, he might just be having a really rough time.  Is there a parent, sibling, or friend who might be able to help him out?  Maybe if a parent or someone could just come over and sit with the baby for a little while, he could work on getting some cleaning done.  Our son used to scream all the time if we weren't holding him, and it was exhausting, but it's not really the best excuse to not do *any* picking up.  Sorry you're having to deal with this."

That said, if I were to make a highly uneducated prediction, I'd say I expect to see more of them hit SteamOS when an official Steambox is officially released. At that point, there will be an actual ""console"" to develop for.

The fact that developers will be able to hit a secondary market for free (those running SteamOS on their PCs, rather than as their console) is a nice perk as well, assuming the actual install base of SteamOS is high enough to tempt them to begin with.

On the other hand, it would pay to remember that this is an entirely new brand, and not proven in the console market. Not proven means risky, and while some developers and publishers will take risks if they see the profit is there, some will shy away, and some may not see enough profit to think it's worth it.

In the end, it's going to matter what kinds of connections and deals Valve can form with developers and publishers to get the games started, as well as how much interest they can drum up longer term to get people interested in making games for it, just like any other platform."

ScipiiRye,TumblrInAction,1390617169.0,"That's the thing. It's super easy to shut down arguments by saying ""I was raped,"" and I wouldn't put it past an SJW claiming to have been raped in order to shut up whoever they're arguing with. That, and they insist on defining things that clearly *aren't* rape (disagree with a woman, all PIV, ""male gaze,"" sex I regret, for example) *as* rape, so who can tell if they were ""raped"" raped or *raped* raped?

On the *other* hand it wouldn't be a stretch for an SJW to go all ""kill all men"" as a result of being actually raped, so it really could have gone either way.

The thing about either side is that the feminists insist on saying that false rape accusations never or rarely happen, which isn't true. That's putting a lot of faith in trusting women not to lie when it would turn things to their advantage, and women are people, and people are self-interested by nature. Meanwhile the MRAs treat *all* rape accusations as potentially false, which clearly isn't happening either, rape is still a thing, just not nearly as bad as the feminists are shrieking that it is.

There is no fair, easy solution here."

However, I doubt libs will stop crying about Indians in light of this, after all being a rightful American in the 16th century had NOTHING to do with ethnicity; the settlers were just as American as the Indians.

Did they read the BUGS Mantra? When did liberals or anybody important for that matter say that only American Indians are real Americans. Oh and immigration can be compared to the situation in Tibet and Kurdistan when immigrants try to repress ethnically British British citizens for a lack of a better word.

The trip just felt like it went on, and on, and on. If I'd have drove, it'd have taken half the trip time. The layovers and sitting still with no breaks for 4-5 hours at a time was terrible, and you can absolutely forget taking a nap unless you just sleep easily.

It was humid as fuck in the middle of the summer and a pretty relaxing place to be in. The people were nice and polite for the most part, and I got to enjoy those little sausage things (Brainspasm- forgetting what they're called!) for the first time. Never had heard of them prior to coming out there. All in all it was a fun trip.

DivineVodka,OnePiece,1390617555.0,"You have to bear in mind the shortening of his life that Lucci explained was a theory complete speculation.  Furthermore his entire theory surrounds the notion that Luffy's body is that of a normal human.  How else would he come to that conclusion?  That's the only thing he can go off of, he's not a doctor nor did he examine Luffy's organs to see if they are made of rubber.  In other words, consuming this fruit could have well on made him live even longer than his initial intended age.

Just like how people realize things with their fruit ( G2, Aokiji's leg) the wiki says Luffy's oragans are rubber and Imho they are so we can't use basic human concepts to try and understand a man made of rubber.  The stress a regular human would go under to speed up the flow of blood ( is that even possible manually) means they would shorten their lives but we don't have a clue as to how it affects a rubber body.  We don't know if because the organs are rubber now they are more durable or go under less stress...  So to accurately say what's happening with his life span is quite hard.

People have a problem with this narrow, 'object' view because it becomes too easy to deal with people in a really narrow way, in many, if not all, contexts. And although a person might just be presented in one particular context, they continue to be a whole person during that context. Treating them as an entire person is consistent with their experience and makes for better interactions. Objectifying them down to one context is greatly different from how they experience themselves and makes for really difficult interactions.

Like you said, it's probably best not to say anything to the older women.  They're not going to change.  I've tried to explain certain things to my MIL, who is about 15 years older than my mom, but she never listens, never learns, and ends up rolling her eyes at me.  My mom, on the other hand, has very feminist beliefs, but is from a different generation so I expect it more from her.  

As for women your age, I think you have the right to *not* engage in these ""chivalrous"" deeds.  Those women are no more important than you, and you are under no obligation to treat them as such.  If they ask why you aren't carrying all their grocery bags or whatever, just be honest.  ""I feel strongly about my feminist beliefs, and that women are equal to men.  I also believe that doing these things for you is patronizing to you.  I'd be happy to *help* you carry your groceries in, but I'm not going to do it for you.""  I mean, say it more smoothly than that, but I don't see a problem with letting that type of woman know how you feel.  Likely, they have been raised like you to believe that's how men should act.

get yourself a nice mask with thermal lenses (check my post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/1vm6ap/german_bloody_beginner_looking_for_gear/cetuxmr) for some recommendations), a Proto Primo and an Empire or Ninja 48/3k tank. you don't need to spend a whole mortgage payment to get out there and have a good time. remember you can always upgrade later, the used market is very active. i strongly recommend **against** buying a used tank or mask, you will not save money in the long run. used loaders are fine. happy hunting."

While doing this drastically cut back on sugar, processed foods and alcohol.  Drink 6-8 glasses of water per day.

I bitch and moan about the core classes, but after this semester my classes are going to rock!

Advice I would give to a college senior who did not have direction: buy yourself some time by seeing what the job market holds for you.  Maybe you'll find something you love that doesn't require graduate school.

In the meantime, prepare yourself for graduate school just in case you aren't qualified for jobs you want.  Before you graduate, talk to your profs about getting letters of recommendation from them in the future.  Study for the GREs.  Research careers you want, and then see what kind of education/training you would need and proceed accordingly."

silly87,AskFeminists,1390618346.0,"&gt;affirmative action

Actually, there are cases where affirmative action has worked for men.  For instance, one of the colleges I looked at when applying to undergrad was about 55% female and used affirmative action to let more men in.  Honestly, I have my own issues with AA.  I think it was *very* important at one point, but I'm not sure how I feel about it now.  But you have to understand that it was started because women and minorities weren't accepted into schools or the workplace.  

&gt;DV services only for women

This is definitely something that men need as well.  But again, you have to look at the history.  Women were being beaten and even killed.  Women who reported DV were often blown off by the police over and over, until eventually they were killed by their abusive husbands.  It's only recently become even very well known that there are women who beat their male partners.  It took a long time, like thousands of years, for women to get much help for DV.  Men certainly need help too, but please don't act like these were equal issues that began at the same time and were talked about the same amount and people just chose women over men.

&gt;anti circumcision activism only for women

Actually, there's definitely anti-circumcision activism for men.   At this point, about 55% of American boys are circumcised.  It's progress.  Again, you have to look at the context.  Circumcision for women is generally used to stop them from having any sexual pleasure at all, whereas circumcised men still get a lot of pleasure.  I'm NOT saying that makes male circumcision okay--on the contrary, I don't thin it is, but you must look at the context before screaming ""SEE!! WOMEN ARE TREATED SO MUCH BETTER!"" 

&gt;dropping physical requirements only for women

I'm not sure where this happens.

&gt;reporting rape and DV stats with the omission or minimization of female perpetration

Men definitely need more advocacy when it comes to female on male rape.  That is 100% true.  But again, you have to look at the context.  Rape has long been defined as penetration.  Most female rapists do not penetrate men.  I do NOT believe that means it's not rape--I believe forcing a man to penetrate a woman IS rape of the man.  But rape laws have never been very good and have been ever-evolving.  I mean, until not that long ago, there was no such thing as marital rape.  And rape is perpetrated much more often by males (whether the victims are female or male), and it always has been, and that's why people are just starting to realize that men can be victims of female rapists too.  Again, please don't take this the wrong way, because I can *feel* your MRA mind turning and thinking that I'm saying male-on-female rape is more important than female-on-male rape, and I am NOT saying that.  I'm just asking you to look at the context.  Hopefully we will SOON be able to work change into the law and provide more resources for male rape victims.

&gt;treating women as equals being misperceived as misogny

In fact, each of them had racked up quite an impressive number of notches on their bedposts without a single serious relationship between them.

So even a professed (and sincere) lack of interest in settling down doesn't mean that meeting the right person won't change that.  Hell, I was like that, too (minus the notches), until my current relationship, so it's not exclusive to guys.  If I hadn't met my boyfriend, there is no doubt in my mind I would still profess to have no interest in settling down.

For me, it was like:
Why settle down?  I'm young!  I'm free!  I can do whatever I damn well please!  I could live in Peru just because I feel like it!  Why sacrifice that liberty for some ball and chain?  Long-term relationships?  Been there, done that.  Too serious for me.  I don't get it.

Of course school sucks. Of course it's run by imperfect human beings with mutually conflicting goals and pedagogical approaches. Of course it stresses everybody out and stifles creativity. But what else do we have? We need to teach our children how to read and write and communicate with others. We need to teach them history so that they're not doomed to repeat it, and math and science so that they can build a better world for themselves. The fact that there are better ways to do all that doesn't change the fact that schools as we know them are really the only available tool we have today.

I hated high school, which is what I assume you're in. I encourage you to think as little as possible about your grades and as much as possible about learning what interests you. Make it work for you and don't let the system drag you down while you try. A lot of my angst around school was that I felt it was imposed on me and there wasn't anything I could do to change my situation. Looking back, that belief was essentially false."

It happened in December 2010 (I was 26 at the time). My husband had several heart attacks and I called the ambulance. Few days later, he had triple bypass surgery.      
My best memory is when, after waiting in the surgery waiting room 7 and a half hours (bypasses takes about 5) without news from the operating room, the doctors and nurses finally came out and told me he was okay and he was going to be okay.

I burst out crying from relief, and I'll never forget that.

Edit: I'd be lying if I didn't mention the best days my husband and I got married (going to be 11 years on Valentine's day!), and also the day when we first said I Love You to each other :)

Second semester we have a class together, sitting next to eachother. Probably the second time I ever talked to her. She had just broken up with her boyfriend and was giving me some heavy signals of interest, almost going to the point of asking herself out for me: ""Man I really want to see X movie but they're so expensive, maybe a boy will take me.... (flirty look)"" 

I never made a move, I was a confident guy but I couldn't believe I was getting that lucky, also I had the rationale that we would go to college and it would hurt to lose touch, or that she would go back with her boyfriend, or that I would have to be compared to her boyfriend who was much bigger/stronger than me (but ugly).

Raspberries make a beautiful mead and you can get decent ones (relative to other out of season fruit) at the supermarket this time of year. The Driscoll's organic label in particular seems to hold up well. If you have access to $$$ and a Wegmans, Whole Foods, or similar, you can probably find other acceptable fruit, but it's both cheaper and tastier in-season, especially if you can pick it yourself and be really choosy about the fruit you use.

Another option is to use frozen whole fruit or frozen fruit concentrate. Again, that's something of a plan B, but you have to work with what you've got.

You can always look through [my notes](https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B8EtZLPjiym_X0I0dmhXdmNKaVk) for recipe ideas. Keep in mind that some of those meads were made before I knew much about what I was doing..."

Locker's health is still a fairly big question mark, but lacking a 3rd-round pick and having more pressing holes to fill at LB and RT, I'm not sure we'll be taking a QB early in this draft. I think Locker probably gets one last shot to prove to the organization that he can be the future of the franchise, but as with any coaching change, it's a very real possibility that Whisenhunt could decide to bring in his own QB.

If we roll with Jake, though, and he Jake goes down yet again, we'll still have Fitzpatrick around. As bad as he was last season at times, he's still among one of the league's better veteran backups. While it'd be nice to grab a younger QB with some potential to be groomed into a starter in case Locker does not work out, I'm just not sure we can spare the early pick this year. "

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390619072.0,"What you should ask her depends on what you think she wants out of the conversation, and that depends on the situation and her personality. Sometimes a person just wants to vent and get affirmation for their feelings. Sometimes we talk to better understand how we feel about something. The act of talking seems to give us clarity. If either of those is the case, then it's not really useful to direct the conversation towards a solution, tactfully or not. Those types of conversations are about reflection and not problem solving. However, you think she's at a stage where she cares about next steps, then asking her what she thinks a solution would be a good place to start. 

There's an important difference between dwelling on the past and reflecting on it. The more fully you allow her to work through her feelings, the less she will dwell on them later. If you stop her short of fully venting now, then eventually she'll keep bringing it up later because her mind will not be cleared. Things will fester. So one way or another, the process of unpacking how she feels is necessary before you can move on to discussing solutions.

I do think we need our friends and partners to tell us when we are dwelling on something unproductively...I don't want people to think I'm saying that people should be allowed to whine and moan all the time.  But I also think we need to be patient. We've all had breakups, for instance, where the people around us keep having to hear us whine about what happened. Sometimes the reflection period does become a bona fide dwelling period. But I think we look back and though we know we were being a pain in the ass, we also know it was helpful to sit and talk with someone who we felt was really listening. Sometimes there is no solution other than to wait till we feel better.  Reasoning can push us to focus on other things; we can will ourselves to focus on solutions...but no amount of reasoning can heal emotions that only heal with time.  

Our emotions aren't logical. You should expect your friends or SO to be reasonable about how they react to things, who they blame, how they reflect on things. Eventually in conversation, it's appropriate to help them be objective and you shouldn't put up with someone who can't see things objectively. This is what a mature adult does. However, sometimes being able to look at things objectively doesn't change how we feel. Reason may dictate that we shouldn't feel that way, but that doesn't diminish the reality of those emotions. Recognizing that is just part of being self-aware. A mature adult takes ownership of both her feelings and her actions. And talking about things helps us take ownership.

r0dlilje,loseit,1390619222.0,"There are a couple of possible negative drawbacks, including the possibility of skin discolouration and, perhaps more uncomfortably, the excess fiber could lead to GI discomfort such as gas and cramps.  It's all about balance - if the nutrients coming from the carrots are balanced with the rest of your diet, you probably won't have many issues.  Another possible concern is that Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin, which can be stored in places like your liver.  [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervitaminosis_A) is an article on Hypervitaminosis A - while Vitamin A from betacarotine sources (like carrots) doesn't cause toxicity, if you are supplementing or taking in other sources it's worth looking into your nutrient balance.

Benefits?  Your daily amount of Vitamin A is covered with basically 1/2 serving.  They're a healthy fiber that will definitely help you keep full, and have a decent water content.  Key minerals like potassium and magnesium, which a lot of people don't get enough of each day, are also found in carrots."

ahazelgun,AskMen,1390619225.0,"Story time!  Second-hand from a good friend, but it's relevant to your situation (although just a tiny bit more serious, since these people were in college at the time).

Couple was dating for a long time, a friend of the girl's was exhibiting just the kind of behavior you're talking about.  (Actually, he was much more subtle, but the boyfriend knew what was up.  I mean seriously, nude snapchats?  So glad that did not exist when I was in high school.)  Like you, the boyfriend could not stand this guy, but the girl insisted that they were just friends, and even if he was right, she wasn't interested in the friend anyway.  The boyfriend's constant suspicion and outbursts at the friend wore on her nerves over time, and she eventually broke up with him, because no one likes that.  Fast forward years later, the girlfriend is now married to the other man.

Let me be clear:  She 100% genuinely was not interested in him at the time, but her ex-boyfriend's rage ended their relationship, and the other guy was persistent throughout the years until she finally began to see him in a different light.

Moral of the story:  Not that you're worried about marriage right now or anything, but tread carefully, counselor.  Just brush off his behavior as, quite frankly, stupid (seriously, naked snapchats?), and of course you can ask him to stop  when you talk to him (again... naked snapchats?), but if you do too much more than that, you risk coming off as the petty, jealous boyfriend, even if you are right on the money.  Just trust her to be grossed out by any advances he might actually try to make."

It's when a bit of fat is pushed though the low back fascia and makes a lump. They can be pain free or painful. Sometimes the pain is because of inflammation and sometimes because the fat dragged some nerves with it (radiating pain, it's not a trigger point). They can mimic the sensations of a herniated disk. Massage dose not work on back mice. Generally the body fixes it it's self or the client needs surgery to remove the fat and repair the tear.

My grandpa (dad's side) had fallen down the stairs on the front porch and along with some other health issues, he was bedridden.  The worst part, he couldn't speak anymore, but we all knew that he listened and could hear all the words we'd said throughout the years.  And then a couple years after that, we found out he had cancer.

Okay, fast forward to about 2 years ago, his health is declining really fast, and I'm sitting on my couch playing SSBBrawl, and my mother comes in and asks me if I want to head over to the Hospital and see him in his last days...I said no.

I'll never forget about Jack, he was a good friend to us all.

Another one;
One month ago, my grandmother (on my mom's side) had osteoporosis and couldn't produce red blood cells anymore.  My mother and her family were heading over to her house to see her again, and she asked me if I wanted to see her.
Yet again, no was my answer.
She died December 26th, 2013.  She was the biggest trooper, and she would always listen to what you had to say, and she was very independent.
My mom is still going through the stress and stuff of sorting out her belongings because she didn't write her will, and the only reason one of my uncle's ""helping"" is so that he can take as much as he can before anyone can notice, so he sent over his wife to ""scout out"" the area and report back.  What a cheapskate.

Step 6: Verify that the phone is compatible with the virtual network (If not, select another virtual network).

Step 7: Order a SIM card and sign up for service.

It is better now that he has to shave for his job, but before that I would try to wash and moisturize my face after any heavy kissing. I don't have very sensitive or dry skin at all so extra washing might not be the answer for everyone but it helps keep my skin from staying all red and itchy for a long time. Probably gets rid of any bacteria or dirt that might have rubbed off too. It probably wouldn't hurt for your SO to wash and moisturize his face before making out, but I know that wouldn't go over too well with mine so I try to mitigate the effects on my end as much as possible."

injoy,Reformed,1390619904.0,"Whether one is a cessationist or a continuationist, prophetic gifts and dreams *have* to line up entirely, absolutely, unfailingly with Scripture and what Scripture tells us about God's character.  Paul also gives us the *purpose* to which prophecies must conform, that it ""speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation"" (1 Corinthians 14:3), specifically, for the building up of the church.

If I had those dreams, the bit about ""seeing"" God would really give me pause in light of verses like John 6:46, 1 John 4:12, Exodus 33:20... even as a metaphor I'm not sure how it would jive with Scripture since your dream is obviously about physical appearance, but we are made in the image of an *invisible* God (Col 1:15), the ""image of God"" cannot refer to physical appearance since God is spirit (John 4:24) and the Genesis account says ""Our image"" referring to all three of the Trinity and not merely Christ.

I guess what I'm saying is, just because God can use our dreams to impress us with true things about Him, that doesn't automatically mean that they are prophetic or signs.  And we must also remember that God still speaks in a wondrous, powerful, and sharp way... in Scripture.  Scripture is exciting!  The Word assures us we are made in the image of God.  You can be excited about knowing that from faith in the Word and the assurance of the Spirit!  There is not anything wrong about having dreams about God; I have dreams about God, but that doesn't mean they are prophetic.  I've noticed my dreams take on a very different intensity when I'm pregnant, for instance, and it would be easy to read into them except that I know it's just the hormones bouncing around in my brain. :)"

Just as /r/dota2 has come to symbolise ""Dota 2 e-sports on Reddit"" for many in the subreddit (me included). So a /r/dota2esports wouldn't be able to establish itself as well - because /r/dota2 already has that niche in many peoples' minds.

I'm not saying that /r/nhl is a doomed subreddit - it has 25 000 subscribers (compared with /r/hockey's 120 000 subscribers) . But you shouldn't expect a mass exodus from /r/dota2 if your idea was to go through."

RichardBehiel,WTF,1390620148.0,"I get the reference, but in case anyone is wondering: a magnetic field is created when a charged particle moves.  Think of it as sort of a wake behind a boat (but way faster).  Whatever, doesn't matter how you think of it, moving charge creates a magnetic field around it.

Think of an atom.  Its electrons (which have charge) are *moving* around, creating little tiny magnetic fields.  So in a way, each atom has magnetic north and south poles.  In most materials this doesn't matter since atoms are small as fuck.

In some materials, though, atoms can line up.  Nothing magical is going on, it's just that the north pole of one atom is able to attract the south pole of another atom, and so on times a billion or whatever.  So now each atom's little magnetic field is lined up with the other atom's fields, and as you might expect they all add up to produce a huge magnetic field that can actually be used for shit.  

Keep in mind that electromagnetism explains *how* electricity and magnetism work (check out Maxwell's equations), but it doesn't explain *why*.  Nobody knows why particles have charge or why moving that charge induces a magnetic field and so on.  You might as well ask why the universe is here in the first place.  "

It was from the film asking so many questions, and (masterfully) not providing the answers or pointing the audience into the direction you thought the answer should be. It made me want to fill this void in my chest with all the knowledge the answers would provide. It made me want to run out of the theater and connect with everyone, see everything, experience all that I can experience - the love and the heartbreaks of life. It made me want to date an OS and help her struggle through finding her identity, and have her help me in unsuspecting ways.

These are the right answers sometimes.  Here, though, perhaps a good, non-accusatory conversation would probably help you more than leaving or tracker her.  She was wife material before, and this is sudden, yes?  As I read your post, I thought she sounded insecure and frightened of losing you.  Many people are quick to go on the offensive as a means of defense, whether it's right or wrong.  If you have to give up your 'secret' of planning for marriage, I would say do it.  It might go a long way to proving your case and mitigating her fears.

Also, the part about men refusing sex: double standard.  It's easy to fall back on stereotypes and oversimplifications when you're frightened or insecure because you're not thinking rationally.  The cheating isn't entirely an ungrounded assumption is it?  You're not, but turn the situation around and look at it from her end.  Communication is lacking, you're pulling away.  What about her is not drawing you in anymore?  Are you not invested anymore?  Does that mean you're invested elsewhere?  Accept her fears and don't brush them aside.  Instead, offer her the reassurance she needs."

7oby,applehelp,1390620566.0,"&gt;Wow. It is like a blast fom the past. ""Reinstall Windows.""

This feels like you're saying this in a negative way. Most people recommend a complete reinstall for anything like this because it's hard to know if you got it all unless you have something like tripwire set up to detect any file changes. It's like finding one lice in a child's comb: time to attack the entire head. Shave, treat, whatever. It's an indication that there may be a bigger problem.

Example: I had something that was installing Offer Mosquito into my mom's firefox browser. I removed it, and tried stuff online that had instructions on fully removing it, but it would come back after a day or two. Something I didn't know was there was putting it back. And the best solution is to just reinstall windows, in that case.

This is why you keep backups.  It's unfortunate."

wolfram184,woahdude,1390620884.0,"I understand where he is coming from.  Against the ""mainstream"" there are a number of strong counter-currents about rejecting *everything* in the mainstream, good and bad.  One that seems to show up in the artistic world is the battle between ""pure"" artists and ""sell-outs"".

The Zen Pencils comic above (and many zen pencils comics it seems) have a bad habit of portraying any conformity to the mainstream as being a robot, corporate hack, mindless drone, etc.  The message of following your dreams is important, but it always seems to come in a package deal with another message that says compromise makes you worthless.  

The Shortpacked! comic is a rebellion against that counter-current.  The author is making the statement that being in the mainstream, working for a company, etc, can have all of the value of striking off on your own path.  I don't think that the author is defending doing something solely for the money.  He is defending making a compromise for a greater end than might be possible by being an absolutist with regards to artistic purity.  In this case, doing a job he enjoys that also gives his family financial security."

But it will help keep the body warm, so it can dedicate energy to fight off illness instead of having to use it all to stay warm. Not only that, but the circulation of white blood cells can be reduced by cold because the body will restrict blood-flow to extremities in order to keep the core warm.

Malgayne,Games,1390620990.0,"This concern is based on a misunderstanding of trademark law. What King is doing sucks for Stoic, but it's the only thing they CAN do.

Here's how the breakdown works:

* All of King's games are called ""something something Saga.""
* They applied for the trademark on ""Saga"" to protect themselves from other people releasing games that look similar to theirs, and calling them ""something something Saga."" That would cause confusion in the marketplace, and would allow other companies to take advantage of the effort that King did to build their portfolio.
* Bear in mind that copyright law doesn't protect the style, look and feel of a game, so there's no way to stop you from making a game that looks like it could be a King game. The ONLY thing they can stop you from doing is using a NAME that they've trademarked—like ""something something Saga.""

And here's the kicker:

* If you own a trademark, you HAVE to protect it. If someone else tries to call their soft drink ""Coke,"" you can't let them off the hook because they're just a scrappy startup and you feel bad, you HAVE to force them to change their name. If you don't, then you create a situation where there are multiple ""Coke""s on the market, and if that's the case then YOU don't own the trademark anyone. The name ""Coke"" no longer means YOUR particular brand, it's just a generic name for a soft drink now. If this happens, the law will REVOKE your trademark.

Does King thing that there is ANY risk of people confusing The Banner Saga with Candy Crush Saga? No. But if they DON'T force The Banner Saga to change their name, they lose their trademark. If they lose their trademark, I can go whip up an iOS game in a weekend that features cute animals and match-3 gameplay, call it ""Fluffy Bunny Saga"" and charge $2 for it—and a significant number of people will buy it because they think it's another King game.

Should King be able to force Fluffy Bunny Saga to change its name? Yes. Should they be able to force The Banner Saga to change their name? No. But the law as written doesn't cover both possibilities. It's a fucked up situation, but is it King's fault? No, I don't think so. They're just doing what any big company would do.

*EDIT:* The following comes from a more detailed response to this controversy written on my Facebook by a friend of mine, who is a contractual lawyer in New York.

Iit's precisely because companies can't just buy up words and control how you use them that this situation exists.  If King could just buy ""____ ____ Saga"" and prevent other people from using it, I'm sure they would, but they aren't allowed to do that.  They aren't even allowed to buy the words ""Candy Crush Saga"" in that exact order, despite the fact that they actually HAVE a game called Candy Crush Saga.

Instead, all they are allowed to do is say, ""If somebody sees a (i) videogame that has the name form (ii) ""____ ____ Saga,"" they will (iii) not be sure whether or not it's one of our games.""  And that is all they have said.

As rules go, I think this is a perfectly sensible one.  Individuals and companies work hard at making their brands real in people's minds, and other people should not be allowed to piggy-back off that brand consciousness.  Nike doesn't own the WORDS, ""Just Do It,"" but that doesn't mean I should be allowed to market my athletic sneakers using those words.  That would be true even if I personally had never heard of Nike or their slogan, if I were marketing my shoes in a market that had.

If my (i) (ii) (iii) statement were true, then I think everybody would agree that Stoic would have to choose a different name.  The outrage, I think, boils down to two categories.  There are people who simply think, for whatever reason, that trademark (!= copyright) law is bad, and presumably would agree that I *can* market my athletic sneakers with the slogan, ""Just Do It.""  Then there are people who are okay with the rule, and simply disagree that ""____ ____ Saga"" is associated with King's games in the real world.  These people would say, ""Obviously Stoic shouldn't be able to use a name that would cause reasonable people to wonder if it's one of King's games - but they aren't DOING that.""

I think that's a perfectly reasonable answer.  On the other hand, to those people, I think we can say two things:

1. Nobody has prevented Stoic from using the name, ""The Banner Saga.""  King objected to their use.  The Patent and Trademark Office said, ""Objection noted.  We're marking that name down as referring to Stoic"" (see http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4802:m3262q.2.1).  There is currently an actual videogame, made by Stoic, using the exact name, ""The Banner Saga.""

2. King accepted this outcome (see http://www.joystiq.com/2014/01/22/the-banner-saga-still-coming-to-tablets-candy-crush-saga-dev-wo/).  If they actually had it in for Stoic, they could have sued and let a court (or a jury) determine whether, in fact, reasonable people would look at The Banner Saga and say, ""I don't know ... was that made by the Candy Crush Saga and Farm Heroes Saga guys?""  They didn't do that.

So why would King object in the first place?  Is this a case of them trying to bully a plucky start-up studio and then withdrawing after the righteous wrath of the internet was focused upon their villainy?  I don't think so.  There is a perfectly mundane explanation for King to object, lose, and then say, ""Okay.""

Remember that the entire point of trademark law is that you CAN'T own words, but you CAN own your brand identity.  Since this is the underlying justification, it is the rule (and a sensible one, I think) that if a company repeatedly decides not even to say, ""Um, your product's name might make people think it's one of our products,"" they are inferred not to CARE whether other people's products might make people think it's one of their products.  This is really perfectly sensible.  You can't just say nothing as Companies A, B, and C piggy-back off of your brand identity and then sue the crap out of Company D when it does the exact same thing.  That simply isn't fair.

Now, of course, King probably doesn't actually CARE about suing Company A (Stoic).  What they DO care about is being able to sue Company D when they come along with a game called Candy Heroes Saga.  And when that day comes, they don't want Company D to be able to say, ""But Your Honor, they let The Banner Saga go without raising a single objection!""

Or they could be villains wilting in the light of the righteous rage of the internet.  But I don't believe in ascribing to villainy (especially conveniently weak-willed villainy) what can be ascribed to rational self-interest."

The problem with reintroduction, while it is possible with some animals (wolves are a decent success story!), is that some animals just don't have easily-met needs. Polar bears have very specific requirements -  massive home ranges, good winter snow for den digging, high seal population, good ice formation - and if there is a place where all those things are present, it's likely that polar bears have already found it!  Polar bears are decreasing because of decreased ice in arctic areas (difficulty hunting) and less snow along the coastline for dens (not as good for cub care). These two things are pretty much caused by humans.

thesecondkira,movies,1390621345.0,"&gt; Ahhhh, every time I saw Romney pick up trash I overdosed on fascination. I would watch 24 minutes of Romney just picking up trash.

Yep. 

And good insight about the absence of the campaign staff. Really though, I don't care! If they were being political about it, good they were gone. Fascinating watching the family pray too. I'm not overly religious, but I come from a religious family (not Mormon) so I can see a lot of love in that. Family bonding; that sort of thing.

But it doesn't matter because it's a general price increase, which is affected by the money supply. In the long run, unless there is an imminent shortage, all prices rise at the same nominal rate. The exception would be running out of a resource or long-term government intervention. Since land is fixed, all goods tied to it are as well. If rent rises at a higher rate than other goods and services, it eventually crashes to equilibrium. "
DpThought0,MapPorn,1390621361.0,"Wikipedia has a little blurb on it - in 2006 they rediscovered a room that had been buried and forgotten about.  ""Casemate 11"". Ghost Hunters [did an episode](http://www.syfy.com/ghosthunters/episodes/season/s04/episode/e401/fort_mifflin) there a few years back that was pretty creepy, and loads of local ghost hunter groups investigate there pretty frequently.  Google ""Fort Mifflin Casemate"" and you'll run into a bunch of web sites and YouTube videos.

I was there for a Cub Scout thing with my son back in early November.  It's a pretty neat place to visit, regardless of whether or not you're into paranormal stuff.  We did notice in casemate 11 that there is a little air vent that comes out above it about 30 feet from the entrance, so you would faintly hear voices from people outside when you were wandering around down there.  It's also right next to the Philadelphia Airport, so airplanes are flying by a few hundred feet overhead every few minutes, which adds to the ambient noise.

It was very crowded when we were there, so I can't say the casemate was particularly creepy or anything as I kept having to squeeze by other people.  It was still was pretty neat for the historical aspect, and I'm sure there are ghost tours or something during the Halloween season."

On the other hand, some women react poorly to being put on the spot and just like to think things through. And sometimes women genuinely change their mind about a guy. You're right, rejection is not definite. 

But the question is, what difference does it make to you?  If she's going to change her mind she's going to change it regardless of what you do. So it's not worth trying to wait around or fret or jump through hoops for that possibility. In fact, if she rejects you and you seem like you moved on, she will probably be more attracted to you. The only time it's worth going out with a girl who said maybe is if she goes from unsure to sure. It's never worth going out with a girl who seems to just give in to the idea.

ahazelgun,AskWomen,1390621975.0,"I live in New York, so I don't make eye contact with anyone I don't know (unless they're a cashier or something, as you've noted).  It's just the custom here.

That being said, the reason it's the custom here (and in cities generally) is because the proportion of people that you pass who are asking you for things is very high, whether it's spare change or your signature on a petition or a low, low monthly donation of only $3 to help save the Truffula Trees.  In other words, the only reason a stranger would make eye contact with me is because they want something from me that I don't want to give them.

Applying that to women all over the world, we often get unwanted attention.  Some men just want to make eye contact because we are humans, and that's great, but unfortunately, a LOT of men stare.  Lecherously.  I don't want to see that.  They want something from me that I don't want to give them, and I don't even want to see them wanting it, because it makes me feel gross when they look at me like I'm just a live sex toy.

So the easy solution is just to avoid eye contact until some actual social interaction is initiated."

Family courts can use things which don't actually constitute lawbreaking to sway decisions, but in many places it's only *kinda* illegal to be a prostitute (if at all), while it's a pretty serious charge for soliciting prostitution, or earning money from the proceeds of prostitution (i.e. pimpin'). So, simply put- even in a countries like New Zealand or Australia, where there prostitution is legal, it can certainly be used as leverage in family court battles, and people still often hide the nature of their work from pretty much everyone they know."

Of course you can't have ridiculous traffic 24/7 (i'm looking at you new york) so they try to minimize that with turn lanes and things like that, but it's almost impossible to completely eliminate traffic, and using weird building patterns end up wasting a lot of space.

Second, losing all credibility was a bit excessive, so also my bad. But I don't agree that you should listen to everyone's viewpoint indefinitely.

But once you *have* listened to a person, you're free to dismiss them if they seem to you consistently full of shit.

You can't deny their power is massive, but of course I'm not a stupid, I don't think it's legitimate."" I'm sorry, no, you are stupid.  You'll let it have power over you in exchange for the right to brag that you know its not legitimate"") and, of course believes in the traditional neocon line that THIS GENERATION SUCKS SO MUCH MORALITY IS DEGENERATING, and blames lazy alternative kids (I'm not gonna use the term hipster because at this point that's just an empty slur with very little concrete meaning) for the economy (the whole fucking ""Hipsters on Food Stamps"" series was what got me to absolutely loathe that blog).

Thjoth,Survival,1390622230.0,"*  Would you recommend that everyone who takes part in recreation or works in the middle of nowhere gets a wilderness first responder certification?  I've been thinking about taking the course, but it's about $1500 at the nearby university and I've never encountered an injury or allergy in the woods that I couldn't treat with a really basic first aid kit with just bandages and over the counter antihistamines (but then, I've not encountered a severe injury in the woods, either).  

*  If someone has a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction while in the wilderness, what are the steps that can be taken to save their life?  It's my understanding that even if they have an epipen or two, those only alleviate the issue for about 20-30 minutes per pen.  Are there any steps that can be taken on site to stabilize the person enough to get them back to medical personnel?

slackerexpress,dating_advice,1390622242.0,"Guy here. My suggestion is to approach this as if you were going out with one of your friends and not as if this is an interview. Slow down and be present in the moment. If you worry too much about the future you won't enjoy yourself. 

I'm well past expecting a woman (in my case) to be perfect. I'm not, so why should I expect you to be? If I found you attractive (again, not perfect!) and had some fun on a date, even if it's a little awkward, I'd want to see you again. It takes time to make a connection and there's no need to rush. I've even suggested on a date that we don't say anything for a minute just to get past our first awkward silence. It eventually happens so why not have fun with it?

As for the other issues you mention, they would not in any way be deal breakers for me. I can't tell you not to worry about it, but I would suggest that you not let it consume you and cause you not to enjoy the date. Again, it's all about being present. In the moment.

Good luck! I hope you have a wonderful time with your dates!"

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1390622565.0,"OP, I kind of like you. This topic is also of personal interest to me.

But since I posted my own thread on Shedding Light on the Dark Enlightenment, I've seen you post 3 threads on this issue.

People here might start to think you're my sock puppet.

As for your question, I don't think it's a huge worry, it's just representative of the growth of a new conservative base. No more or less batshit than the one dying out. 

That being said, I need to shift to a more pessimistic tone to address Horrorbuff2's comment. 

First off, it's this sub that often addresses the ""intersectionality of bigotry"" both directly and indirectly over numerous threads. So would it be that surprising if a lot of those ""scarier Stormfront"" guys also identified with this new neo-reactionary movement?

If you want to check for yourself, go mud dive into Stormfront and check some of their heroes, like Ramzpaul. I've watched his views over the years slowly go from average ""race realist"", to adopting anti-democratic views, to outright talking about The Dark Enlightenment in his latest youtube video.

Here's a relatively recent story/anecdote. I was eating at a restaurant, making small talk with the restaurant owner. She likes me as a regular customer, so she talks about her life problems a lot. Talked about being robbed only a couple weeks ago before our conversation. She showed me on her iphone the video of the robbery. Some white young adult had come in earlier, scoping the place out and spooking the other customers. Later he comes back in and quietly holds the owner at gunpoint and asks for the money, then takes off. She had showed this to the police. 

She complains that despite her very clear and unambiguous description of the suspect (and that includes the video she gave them), they recorded it as a young black man had robbed the store. Not white anymore. I asked her again if there was miscommunication. *""Of course not, I want them to catch the real criminal!""*

Next day, I tell this to a friend, and he looks it up online in the local news and sure enough the local news is saying it was a black guy.  (Won't give link as I don't want to reveal too much details about my own location.)

I live in a pretty wealthy area. There are maybe 1 or 2 black kids that I've ever seen around. This is very unfair to them, but more to the point, bigotry isn't always found in marginal groups. People with influence have these views and actually act on them subtly and blatantly. Even top level politicians let it slip once in a while. 

It's easy to find milder expressions of neo-reactionaries as well. While talking to a coworker about random shit about advertising, the topic comes up about certain bias towards female tastes/preferences. I ""guess"" that it probably has to do with spending habits. As soon as I matter-of-factly recite approximate numbers and fill in the details, I see his eyes light up (""oh this guy is like me!""). Discussion turns towards the vote and partisanship. Gradually, eventually, and predictably the discussion lands at ""Idiocracy"" (I swear it's not just redditors who worship that movie).

Then the neoreactionary views start flooding out, and I'm forced to start talking about the flynn effect, historical cycles, and why I don't worry about Idiocracy. 

I hear these things from some very successful, pleasant, friendly people, despite our ideological differences. They're not ""virgin neckbeards that never leave their rooms/basements"". They're normal people all around us that normally hide their views unless someone gives them a chance to express them without sounding too judgmental. 

People in this sub don't seem like the type that would get these people to open up.

Maybe some members here have spent so long in this bluepill bubble that they forget that average people (and even above average) can have seemingly wild views/philosophies. It's an ironic display of dehumanization."

**That being said.** He still has no right to read anything you write, and you don't have to show him. The thing is, if you explain to him how you don't like this behavior, that'll just make him want to even more as he'll think you're hiding something from him, even when you're not. 

If you're really close to him and have nothing to hide, then why not let him read the messages? Otherwise I'd say don't text people around him so much. This behavior won't change unless he personally decides  to be better, and that won't happen if he doesn't see a problem with it."

Let us assume since our immediate neighborhood is relatively empty, that intelligent life is rare (This *may not* be true, but from our best observations seems to be the most likely of the two situations).

So life is rare. Pick any random point in the universe, and there will probably not be intelligent life present in the vicinity.

Life develops at point X. It exists from time Y to time Y+1,000,000 (or however long it takes for it to go extinct). Elsewhere in the universe, life may exist.

Or in the far more likely scenario, have they missed the opportunity to meet their stellar cousins on the other side of the universe, the cousins having long since succumbed to natural disaster, disease, or war?

Before I read this article, I had never really thought about TIME as a variable in life. What if we're the *first* intelligent life to develop? What if we're somewhere in the middle, with perhaps one or two more species running around our galaxy. But maybe we've missed them... or maybe not. And what if, terrifyingly, we're the *last*? There's no way at this point in our development to have these answers, but it's a strong argument against the idea of being visited from across the stars.

Barring academic arguments, though, I still like how now that everyone and their uncle has a camera/phone in their pocket, we stopped having sightings."

&gt;&gt;É tal como se um grupo de amigos que frequenta um bar decidisse criar um fight club. Qual a responsabilidade do bar?

&gt;1) Os fight clubs clandestinos são ilegais. Concordo plenamente que se deva ver a praxe da mesma forma.  
  
Da ultima vez que eu confirmei andar a porrada só porque sim não é ilegal. Pode ser considerado agressão se alguém apresentar queixa. Queres chamar-lhe um clube de dominó?   É igualmente ilustrativo.
  
&gt; 2) O bar é responsável por deixar que os clientes organizem um fight club lá dentro, se é disso que estás a falar.  
  
De forma alguma o bar é responsável se a cena ocorresse no exterior, tal como grande parte das praxes ocorrem no exterior das faculdades. Dai as faculdades não terem relação com a praxe.
  
&gt;&gt;Só vai quem quer. Há inclusivé esclarecimentos sobre o que se vai fazer sem estragar a surpresa. A qualquer momento podem desistir sem qualquer implicação.

&gt;Há um elemento de chantagem, sobretudo ao nível da praxe que ocorreu no Meco, que não pode ser ignorado. As vítimas aderiram à praxe porque pensavam que iam ganhar algo em troca, nomeadamente, passarem a um estatuto mais elevado de praxista da Lusófona se passassem por aquele ritual. As vítimas aceitaram ser paus mandados do dux a troco desse estatuto. O dux, devido ao poder das suas ordens, é em parte responsável pelo que aconteceu no Meco.
  
Chantagem? Do quê? Queres dizer coação?  
  
O dux é responsável pelo que aconteceu, sem dúvida. Mas os miúdos também deviam saber não saltar para o poço metafórico só porque lhes disseram.    
  
Vamos supor que um grupo de escuteiros vai acampar, a coisa corre mal e um urso apanha alguns. A culpa é dos escuteiros (miúdos) porque participaram na activado, do dirigente por não ter acautelado a segurança ou do movimento escutista porque é uma activado neste âmbito?
  
&gt; Quanto ao teu ponto 3) e 4), não tem nada a ver com o assunto.  
  
O ponto 3 e 4 são o que para mim representa a praxe na sua forma verdadeira. É esta a minha experiência e é isso que defendo. Não andar a saltar ondas durante uma tempestade."

I don't think the answer to this stuff comes from mens' rights: if anything the problem with mens' rights is that it's hopelessly trapped in the same conceptual problems as liberal feminism. And it needs liberal feminism as an unkillable enemy because it's secretly dependent on it.

RAND0M-HER0,dogs,1390623177.0,"I used to work in a clinic. This is not shady nor unheard of. When a dog goes in for a cleaning, they are put under, their teeth are cleaned and x-rayed. 


During the cleaning, vets will notice fractured (from radiographs), loose teeth, decay or disease and a tooth should come out. We can't keep dogs under an aesthetic forever. It's expensive, and a waste of our time, and this is also dangerous for the dog as well, ESPECIALLY older animals. Chances are the vet has several surgeries lined up and can't wait around hand and foot for you to call back, doesn't have time to create a quote for you (that's what reception and technicians help with), and you probably signed a release stating the vet can do what is medically necessary for your dog. 


$800 is pretty average for teeth cleaning and extractions. I would suggest in future brush your dogs teeth at home every day (or at least 4+ times a week) as it will save your dog from dental disease, plaque, tartar etcetera. Nothing you can do about fractures though. 


**EDIT** 

The cost of extraction can (depending on country, province, state and clinic) depend on what teeth have to be removed. Some teeth are harder than others to remove, wether it's root size or how frail the tooth it. "

I'm not doubting your experience in any way but—and I'm certainly not trying to suggest you are inexperienced—I somehow doubt you've slept with *quite* that many guys.

She will be independent at this point. When she has a child with the foreign duke, that child will inherit Spain and the duchy eventually. If he inherits the duchy first he will become the foreign king's vassal, but as soon as he inherits spain he will become independent. He will become independent because the grandchild will be a king or an emperor now.

That is one of the rules of this game that can never be violated, you can never have a vassal the same rank as you or higher than you.

By the way, this could be disastrously bad for you if your daughter is betrothed with a regular marriage because children will be born of the father's dynasty, meaning your game will end when your daughter dies if you cannot fix this."

thro_way,changemyview,1390623449.0,"&gt;A good analogy to the objectification that many women face would be the Bubble Boy, or George Zimmerman.

That's an awful analogy.  ""Sexy"" is an object that people desire and value, not one that people loathe and despise like ""sickly weirdo"" or ""racist murderer"".  

A much better comparison to being a sex object is someone like Jayden Smith, aka a ""born rich and famous"" object.  Just like attractiveness, fame and money are things that people value.

Sure, he didn't choose to be a celebrity or rich, but he still gets all the benefits of being someone that others values because of his status as a ""rich and famous"" object.  People compete for his attention, pay for his things, he doesn't have to work a day in his life unless he wants to, etc.

He's more likely to be randomly harassed or taken advantage of because of his celebrity status, but that hardly changes the fact that his status as an object of value is a *tremendous* privilege.

Being a ""sexy woman"" object works the same way."

spiders_from_mars,AskWomen,1390623611.0,"I really appreciate this comment, thank you so much for your input.

I'm a student at McGill, and without wishing to boast, I think I have a good amount going for me (do very well in school, involved in extracurriculars, am an undergraduate TA, editor at a student paper, have a research project, hockey, etc.), but I REALLY don't want people to think that I'm full of myself, or that I believe that I'm in anyway better than anyone else.

I think when I'm getting to know someone and they start learning about that stuff, my immediate reaction is that I'm bragging and coming off as pretentious and narcissistic, so I over-compensate by belittling everything I do whenever I can. However, as has been pointed out in this thread of comments (thank you again to everyone for your input), I think I may be overdoing it. 

Do you have any advice for striking a balance? I've come to realize that I don't exactly come off as a confident guy. I am a long term relationship type of fellow, and would like to be able to get to know people, and for them to get to know me, without constantly worrying about sounding like a d-bag or a sad-sack."

NewBalance probably figured out that they had the wrong address.  Maybe the customer called them, or something.  Then they sent the apology for spamming you.

It could also be a fucked up marketing move, or a phishing-type scam.  I haven't seen something like that, though.  I have gotten a few email receipts for textbooks I didn't rent, though.

LondonZombie,Planetside,1390623776.0,"[As with the NC](http://hebime.deviantart.com/art/NC-Heavy-Assault-armor-345950488), referring back to the early concept sketches/renders would be useful for positively revamping the TR aesthetic.

Consider the appeal of the NC on the loading splash screen - that guy was the reason I started NC.  [Note the patches of bare, brushed metal that accent the blue and yellow.](http://www.planetside-universe.com/media/album/mp52rz6sp6/20120328_4f73aa1214168.jpg)  Note the grey-brown of the (presumably) canvas workwear.  That guy makes me want to play NC, because he looks snappy, and isn't covered in primary blue traction paint and shoe boxes.  His faction colours are accents, and he looks professional - and *threatening.*

What does this have to do with TR?  [Look at these guys.](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2011/10/Planetside-2-preview-2.jpg) These guys look badass.  [So does he.](http://th07.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2012/358/8/4/terran_republic_max_by_hebime-d5p0n8h.jpg) Brushed metal - it works, even on the bronze/nickel-finished alpha screens.  That MAX (headgear aside) looks even more formidable than the one in-game, and not just because its lines are cleaner and its contours less clunky and tacked-on; it's the texture, the colour palette that makes the difference.

Sand the paint off everything, and throw some neatly-airbrushed splashes of red on the shoulders, thighs, and helmets, with black for the underside of bits and pieces.  Slight gloss over burnished, finished metal, standing in stark contrast to the semi-gloss powder coat that the NC seems to be drifting toward (if Player Studio textures are an accurate representation of where TRay is nudging the faction).   Crisp, fresh, friction-free space corduroy.

I'm not saying the design should be grey-and-brown-and-dull-and-dark, I'm suggesting that it look sharp, understated, and stylish.  These are, after all, the iron fist and the face-stomping jackboot of a government invested in forcibly subjugating separatists, terrorists, and xeno-cultists; an aura of oppressive, totalitarian menace should issue forth from the lustrous, well-tended armour of its disciplined rank and file.  Grim.  Stern.  Ruthless.  Relentless.

TL;DR - Less full-body red, more gleaming metal and bold slashes of red.  Composite armour that doesn't look tacked on."

They talk about [sensate focusing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensate_focusing), which is basically when  each participant is encouraged to focus on their own varied sense experience.

&gt; In the first stage, the couple may touch each other's bodies excluding breasts and genitals. They are encouraged to enjoy and become increasingly aware of the texture and other qualities of their partner's skin. Intercourse is disallowed. Any focus on the genitals is not allowed. Participants concentrate on what they themselves find interesting in the skin of the other, not on what they think the other may enjoy.

In other words...tackle your embarrassment first, then your selfishness. (selfishness isn't always a bad thing, either! but...comfort first.)


I think i actually did this each time i've become romantically involved with someone. I do things like look in their belly button and see which toe is longest and peep between their thighs. I am a little bit autistic, so I don't understand a lot of social cues and I never felt embarrassed doing this, but I am led to understand that many people find this sort of examination unusual. Reading around or seeing a couples therapist who is familiar with sensate focusing will probably be very helpful.

It seems like you're approaching this with a desire to change, and that's wonderful. It will take some work on your part, and some restraint on his part, but if you commit to working on this together you'll make it!"

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1390624002.0,"Yes. 

It's not like I would question whether stealing was wrong if it turns out Buddhism is a lie. What I mean is more about sila being the foundation of practice. Since you actually have to enter the practice to judge it, without sila, practice isn't complete, therefore no well-informed judgment of its authenticity can even be formed.

But would I still say stealing is wrong without being a Buddhist, yes. But that's not the bullshit I'm referring to. Honestly, my bullshit has more to do with being inclined to self-centeredness and a ridiculously tight attachment to short-term comfort. The religion was basically designed to get me out of this (and there I go with the self-centeredness!).

I'm not quite sure if that's the direction you were going in with your question though."

The_Age_of_Unreason,SkincareAddiction,1390624092.0,"I have a few questions because I am just having trouble retaining the knowledge available here. 

Here's the low down. Dehydrated skin. Mild acne since literally puberty. I'm 24. Female. 

I started the OCM with baby oil a month ago and am very happy with it! 
I added Stridex wipes in the red tube. I known it is a BHA but does that purging? I used to have deep hard white heads. Now I have soft shallow ones. I'm hoping in a week or two this phase will be played out. Am I off track? 

Also, this is the biggest question. My soft white heads open up quite easily and they take so long to heal. Maybe it just seems that way because my skin is now properly moisturized. I am not aggressive when I clean my face. Is there something I can do to help the healing process or prevent these pimples from busting as they are? 

Granted, it's not a huge problem because I'm excellent with makeup and I have hope in this phase ending. But I hate it. I wash my face, deal with open pimples, get it under control and put on my makeup, wash my face at night and they open again.

Sorry for the lengthy post. I am so new and am not great at condensing my information yet. "

Do kids in other countries get to stay out after dark?  I really can't imagine that.  Laws that restrict how many minors can be in a car at once are also pretty popular now-a-days too.

Figured the brownie points couldn't hurt my chances at passing the class. I helped her out and tried to instill some confidence in her throughout the semester. She became increasingly friendly, following me outside of the classroom, trying to get me to watch crappy youtube videos on her ipad and just generally not leaving me the fuck alone. Things got incredibly awkward when she would stand and talk to me while I was sitting down waiting for my ride trying to look in any direction but at her. She was so dense, she couldn't put it together I wasn't interested like that.

I really fucked myself cause I wanted the boost to my grade, but her advances were becoming too much to deal with without grimacing. I'm not gonna mince words, she was repulsive, and was taking my friendliness in a completely different direction than I was intending. It was obvious this girl had never had a boyfriend in her life and it was making me sad. I made it through the class with an A though, so that's what matters."

JackPAnderson,bdsm,1390624868.0,"An important part of relationships is mutual respect. It sounds like you don't respect him or his choices. He deserves better. 

Another important part of relationships is communication. If he feels judged when he talks to you, he's not going to keep talking to you. And that's what causes kinky people to feel trapped in their vanilla relationships. Make sure that you're the type of person who can handle the truth from him about his authentic self. When he opens up to you, ask him questions and be interested. 

Lastly, he sounds very impulsive. I'm not a fan of that level of impulsiveness, but that's just me. Maybe that's part of why you find him attractive? 

I say go for it when you get back to the States. Either it'll work or it won't. Something tells me that you'll have your answer relatively quickly once you are together in person on a regular basis.

notskunkworks,iOSProgramming,1390625331.0,"So you have a InvitationCell that has a button, and when that button is pressed, you want it to do something. That's totally standard.

Here's a bit of a problem though: your InvitationCell is a UI element, and you don't want your UI elements doing really important stuff like modifying your database. Why? Because it's a button. A button's job is to display some text, be pressed, and send a message that says, ""Hey, I got pressed!"" Long story short, this is not good MVC design.

[Check out the accepted answer in this Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/869421/using-a-custom-image-for-a-uitableviewcells-accessoryview-and-having-it-respond?lq=1).

Ideally, you want your InvitationCell to send a message to the view controller that contains the table view that contains the cell. That table view can then go do something that causes the database update to occur.^*

Unfortunately, you can't ctrl-drag from the button in a cell to the view controller. That's why the Stack Overflow post has to programmatically wire up the button to fire an action.

I just altered an old practice project to use this technique to show you how it works.

* [Here's the view controller that controls the table view](https://github.com/skunkworks/ios-big-nerd-ranch/blob/master/ch15-subclassing-tableviewcells/Homepwner/Homepwner/ItemsViewController.m)
* [Here's the custom table view cell](https://github.com/skunkworks/ios-big-nerd-ranch/blob/master/ch15-subclassing-tableviewcells/Homepwner/Homepwner/HomepwnerItemCell.h)

Basically, rather than wiring up the cell with an IBAction, you expose the button as an outlet instead. In cellForRow, you manually set up that button to fire a method of your choice.

Let me know if you have any questions!

^* Again, just for learning's sake, proper MVC design would have the view controller make a call to another object that's responsible for interacting with the database, but if you're a beginner and feeling a bit overwhelmed, it's okay to just jam everything into the view controller. We all did that starting out. Just know that at some point when you get more comfortable with programming, you should circle back and try to figure out how to not make your view controller some gigantic god class that does everything. In an ideal world it really should be nothing but a coordinator between models and views."

SharkMolester,TrueReddit,1390625372.0,"Agreed.  When my parents went to high school, it wasn't automatically assumed that you would immediately go to college right after.  

And now- high schools in a lot of states require high schoolers to do community service projects to help them look better for colleges.  Add to that that the only colleges worth going to require quite extensive amounts of extra-curricular activities.  If you want to go to one of the top ten colleges in your state, you HAVE to have a 3.5 GPA, take foreign language classes, AP classes, ACT, SAT, have at least one school-sponsored extra-curricular.  You add up the requirements to get these on your list of things you've done and you have a couple of hours of free time per week.  Especially if you have a job. 

And if you don't do all this shit, you'll have trouble getting into a college and you'll have real trouble getting any scholarships.  

So really, the options of today's American teenagers are- have no life as a teenager and go to a good university with scholarships, or... don't, and we all know what happens when you go down that road.

duckface08,nursing,1390625498.0,"Sometimes, yes. If it's a patient I worked with a lot and enjoyed spending time with, then yes, it's tough. There are a few patients I've had die but I was only with them for a short time and didn't get to know them, and in these cases, I'm not emotionally attached to the case. It can still be pretty sad, though, depending on the circumstances.

Everyone copes differently, and the important thing is to always take care of yourself and finding positive coping mechanisms that work for you. If you find you're getting burned out or you find negative thoughts start intruding into your every day life, then you need to seek help before it takes over everything.

What helped me cope was being told that *it is ok to be sad*. I think nurses and nursing students get told a lot that we cannot cry, we have to be professional, etc., and yes, I agree it would be inappropriate to go into hysterics in a patient's room. However, simply feeling sad is normal. It's ok to grieve. We are human and we have feelings, but even the bad feelings will pass.

That being said, seeing the sad stories make all the happier stories seem even better. I can think of a few patients I've had who I thought for sure would die because they all got *so* sick that eventually pulled through and got to home back to their families. But, even when it comes to those cases where treatment is futile, I gain some comfort knowing I am going to work my hardest to ensure they do not suffer."

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1390625541.0,"I have an easier time thinking the way they do because I come from a populist background and know people who fled or got ""sent away"" by populist gov'ts. 

It's not a traditionally American style of thinking, but if we talk to say, a Russian immigrant, one who is extra bitter about his home country's gov't, the corruption, and the ineffectiveness of democracy there, and listen to his views, we can get an idea analogous to how these guys feel. I've found quite a lot of people outside the West who have pessimistic feelings towards it, so it's not hard to understand why some Americans (or Westerners) themselves are losing faith over it (or at least their gov't). 

Not the exact same thing, but again, just going for general feel for things.

We can *kind of* see it even in mainstream reddit. Similar sentiments being expressed in that top post about how discussions over the NSA were cut off by some breaking news about Beiber's arrest. Thematically, the same hopeless, anti-populist sentiments were expressed throughout that thread. It doesn't go full blown anti-democracy, of course, but we can kind of see where some of these uncertainties start.

&gt; You can't expect people to take injustice towards you seriously if they feel like you don't take injustice towards them seriously.

I'll be fair. A lot of it probably is just greed and jealousy. Not just differing morals and feelings of justice/injustice. 

Some people I know radically changed after striking it rich. Some people I knew from when I was low class radically changed their attitudes towards me when I became successful myself as well. Both of these pressures amplify each other. I've felt cynicism from both sides."

I understand that feeling of wishing you were desired enough that he was hard. I don't know your financial situation, but I always suggest therapy if you have time for it!

 One thing that worked for me was sucking him from soft to hard. It takes a while, but I just try to take my time exploring his body with my hands while i let my tongue do some playful teasing. 

Another idea is to try this thing called the optometrist's blowjob (i may have made that name up) where I just explore his body and every single sensitive spot and i ask questions.
&gt; how does this feel?

&gt; Do you like being touched there?

&gt; Does this tickle?

&gt; Is this area more sensitive than that area?

It's actually a really sensual exercise, and you might get to know eachother better.

Actually today I read [this series](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1w1g2b/indepth_diary_of_uk_sex_therapy_update_5/) that talked about one couple's progress in therapy (spoiler, they're doing well!) and they used [Sensate focusing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensate_focusing), which is fairly similar to what i just described, but with an entirely different focus. For one, you start nonsexually.

&gt; In the first stage, the couple may touch each other's bodies excluding breasts and genitals. They are encouraged to enjoy and become increasingly aware of the texture and other qualities of their partner's skin. Intercourse is disallowed. Any focus on the genitals is not allowed. Participants concentrate on what they themselves find interesting in the skin of the other, not on what they think the other may enjoy.

I have tried this with my partner, and it's been interesting! I enjoy touching the furrows on his brow and stretching them smooth, playing with his mustache, feeling the smoothness of his scar, feeling the hair on his chest (love that texture!),  his belly button, all the way down to his toes. just kind of looking at every bit of him and seeing how our bodies differ. This definitely fostered a feeling of intimacy and we snuggled after for a while.

I hope this gives you a few ideas of things to try! Best of luck!"

It's because often they feel they have the best intentions, so they will fight you tooth and nail to maintain their cruel opinion.

I'm really sorry for the break up. I don't think you're a bad person or had any intentions, but maybe not just the most naturally supportive person ever. It's not something a lot of people are good at, and if you've never had to be in that role it's understandable as to why you wouldn't know how to help her out. 

Most likely their relationship won't last a huge amount of time since it's really just formed on the foundation of grief. If it does last though then congratulations to them. Move on, learn how to be supportive during hard times, and find another girl. If your relationship with her was meant to be it wouldn't have ended during a rough patch like that (as hard as that is to see now). Be pissed and sad for awhile, then pick yourself up and learn from this experience.

People are more likely to make threads or comments when they don't think their opinions are being expressed by rest of their community. It's like on reddit. If I agree with a comment or a thread, I upvote it. If I disagree and don't see anyone expressing a view that I think should be touched on, I post it myself. In general, I see them agreeing with his views, which is what sparked my own curiousity to watch some of those videos over the years myself.

&gt; . They are typically very stupid people as well, and the pseudo-science rhetoric that guys in the Dark Enlightenment speak would frustrate most fascists.

You're kidding me? Maybe most of them do, but there's plenty who love using ""pseudo-science rhetoric"" and talk incessantly about topics like ""hybrid vigor"" and both its positive and negative effects like facial symmetry, IQ, etc.

&gt; The greatest thing about Fundamental Right-Wingers is that they hate each other so much.

I can tell you haven't spent much time looking through and trying to understand these groups. You only just googled stormfront to get some relevant topics. You underestimate the ""intersectionality of bigotry"" that your own group members talk about.

prarastas,WritingPrompts,1390626200.0,"The crying had started around 1:25 p.m.

Tom had woken up late that Sunday morning, well, afternoon. Rubbing his eyes, he made a mental note to never order a drink with an epidemiological namesake as he shuffled his squirrel slippered feet across his apartment.

Tom opened his mouth to expel a groan as he noted the time displayed on the stove: 12:50 p.m. His voice gave out halfway through the already guttural sound, alerting the bleary-eyed man to how dry his throat really was. He slowly reached his hand up to the handle of the refrigerator, gently pulling it open. Squinting into the white light that coasted over the meager remainders of his last grocery trip, Tom reached bravely into the cavern of cool emptiness and withdrew it with a Brita filter pitcher in his hand. He made a slow 180-degree turn to place the pitcher onto the pristine countertop. 

With extreme carefulness, he retrieved a short glass from the cupboard above the counter and placed it down beside the Brita. He lifted the pitcher and poured water until the glass was only half empty, noting the shaky weakness of his arms. After taking a sip of water, Tom cleared his throat a couple times, relishing in the sweet moisture lubricating his esophagus and tested his voice again, speaking to no one in particular:

""So, what's for brunch?""

Getting no response, as was expected in his one-person flat, Tom turned back around to face the still-open fridge, squinting again into the blaring white light. He browsed the barren shelves, settling on a container of pineapple chunks left over from Thursday. Everything else was either a condiment or obviously in need of tossing out.

Not wanting to stand in the icy aura of the fridge any longer, he snatched the container from the middle shelf and closed the door to the fridge with a surprisingly swift snap of his wrist, given the current slowness of his mind. Fetching a fork from the drawer adjacent to the icebox, Tom then popped the top off of the plastic tupperware container and set the lid on the counter. He leaned against the counter, indulging in the sweet burst of flavor on his tongue. It was quite possibly the most refreshing thing he'd ever eaten.

""Or perhaps this is good only because I'm hungover and starving,"" he joked aloud, aiming his gaze at the sponge laying next to the kitchen sink. *Might as well look at something like you're talking to it*, he thought to himself idly.

About twenty minutes later, Tom swore he heard crying noises. At first, he dismissed it as the television in the apartment beside his own. Then he remembered that his neighbor worked on Sundays. It was the moment he came to this realization that the crying noises exploded into full-blown sobbing. It was coming from the kitchen.

Tom made a quick scan of his living room area for anything that could serve as a last-minute defense mechanism. He settled on a metal-studded soccer cleat, and picked it up, before sneaking his way into his own kitchen.

*This is ridiculous*, he spoke within his head, not wanting to disturb whatever unwelcome guest was using his kitchen as their emotional sanctuary. As he approached, Tom noticed that the kitchen was empty, or rather, there was nobody in it. He straightened his posture and dropped the cleat-wielding hand to his side, strolling into the room with a new-found curiosity.

""What the hell is making that racket the--"" Tom was cut off by a loud yell not his own:

""YOU!""

Tom whirled around, wildly searching for the source of the noise. He found himself facing the sink. The sink was still yelling at him, something about being homeless.

No. Not the sink. The *sponge*. The sponge propped itself up, sitting on it's width so that it was taller. The yelling continued, and Tom snapped out of his shock over the yelling cleaning instrument that he caught the tail end of it.

""YOU ATE MY HOME! YOU ATE MY HOME!"" The sponge was bouncing up and down as it repeated the sentence several more times, emphasizing the point with each bounce.

Tom sputtered, ""Wh-what?! How did I eat your home? You've been on the sink forever!"" In his head, there was a snide piece of internal dialogue about how he sure was talking casually to a sponge like it was a normal occurrence, but he shook it off.

The sponge jumped around the sink, advancing toward the edge of the counter. Its voice was dangerously curt, ""How. Could you. EAT. **OUR** HOME?!""

The starfish decal he had stuck to the window behind the sink peeled off slightly, joining into the conversation, ""Yeah!""

It's voice was low and sounded rather dopey, but despite this and it's slow rhythm of speech, it helped berate Tom: ""How could you do that to the both of you? You act like you live under a rock.""

Suddenly Tom's left slipper shook itself off of his foot and squeaked it's agreement, ""Yeah, Tom! Yer about as smart as my cousins in South Texas!"" The voice was distinctly feminine and annoying, with a residual Texan accent.

Tom sank to his knees, and the slipper, sponge, and decal sticker converged on him, circling him with their taunting, yelling, and abuse. They only stopped when he began to sob, apologizing even though he wasn't exactly sure what the hell was going on. He was overcome by stress and guilt and, as he began sobbing, the sponge began to cry, and leaped into Tom's arms. Soon the decal and the slipper followed suit.

When Rodger Bumpass and Bill Fagerbakke showed up three hours later for their weekly football-and-poker night, they found Tom Kenny curled into a ball in the corner of his kitchen crying hysterically, clutching a kitchen sponge, a sticker, and a slipper, still dressed in his Spongebob Squarepants pyjamas."

privatedonut,movies,1390626447.0,"&gt; Why can't they get funding from a studio for a sequel to a cult classic?

&gt; A kickstarter should be used for a movie like a sequel to Dredd.

Dude, Dredd is cult status now, you're really comparing the same type of movies.

Also, funding a cult classic sequel wouldn't return as much investment as a more financially successful sequel usually, hence why we have three hangover movies.  Even if they aren't regarded critically as funny as the cult classic movie, people will fund what they believe will get them money in return, it's a business.

Kickstarter is more for people who have little means to get their funding, like they need to make a reputation for themselves to help them get their foot in the door.  It shouldn't be for big names, or even little names to use to get their project going, because they have a name to rely on for help.  They should already know the professional way to do it, and a kickstarter is more or less unnecessary for it."

hermithome,AskFeminists,1390626462.0,"&gt;He wouldn't even have a conversation with that woman; how could he want to have sex with her?

Insanely, insanely raicst and classist. It's also just kinda crazy in general.

Here are the problems with that statement.  

 *  It is possible for someone who is upper class with an excellent education to converse with someone lower class who has very little education.  Both parties can get something out of this. And in fact, I highly encourage you to start trying this.

 * You're making huge assumptions of class and education based on looks. For all you know, he's more intelligent and more educated than she is. Maybe the woman in question isn't very smart, never got a good education and simply comes from or married to money. Maybe the man comes from money, has an excellent education and was simply chilling with a friend, relaxing.

 * Neither education, nor class ensure 'appropriate' behaviour.

 * People have sex with people they have no interest in conversing with all the damn time.

 * People rape people they have no interest in conversing with all the damn time.

 * Conversation, education, and class have little to do with rape. They have something to do with how some people choose sexual partners, but only something and only some of the time.

 * You cannot tell, based on looking at a woman cross the street, how educated, intelligent or anything else she is. When a man ogles a woman he does not know, he isn't evaluating her brain or deciding he'd like to converse with her. He's objectifying her body. Whether you consider objectification or looks-based attraction 'genuine' and 'sincere' is up to you. But the man being upper-class or well educated doesn't make his attraction to her physical form any more genuince or sincere. That's just crazy.

 * The dynamic of a man ogling a woman he doesn't know, in public, is the issue at hand here. The relative class, education, wealth, race, etc of the ogler and the oglee are totally and completely irrelevant to the power dynamic of man objectifying woman.

**Or, to put it another way...you've got the situation completely backwards. You're identifying all the wrong threats:**  
A young black man ogling a woman on the street is not much different from an older white man ogling a woman on the street.  You can guess at differences in class and wealth by looking at them, but you might be wrong. You can guess at differences in education by looking at them, but you might be wrong. Whatever differences in class and education do exist doesn't change anything. It doesn't make one better behaved. It doesn't make one parties attraction genuine or sincere. They're both objectifying her equally. The only real difference is that that young black man is way, way, less likely to be a threat. Most gender based violence is not inter-racial (except for Native Americans). That young black man is way less likely to be a threat, even if he is lower-class and less well educated. And if the woman is further harassed, or attacked she is far better off if it's the black man harassing or attacking her (especially if he was lower-class) then she would be with a white man. Bystanders are more likely to notice. They're more likely to consider the situation odd and inappropriate. They're more likely to intervene. If there is no one there, and she has to report to the police, she has better chances of encountering success there. She's more likely to be believed by the courts. He's more likely to be punished, and he's more likely to get a harsh punishment. At just about every single step, that young, low-class, poorly-educated black man is less of a threat to an upper-class, older, white woman, than a white man who's in her age range and class range. You've got the situation completely and totally backwards.  
 
You're not only terribly racist and classist, but you're being sexist here as well. *This* woman didn't deserve to be ogled by *this* man. Would you have noticed anything amiss if it was an older, well-educated, well-dressed, white man eyeing her? Or, if the woman were low-class, wearing cheap makeup and 'slutty' clothing, would you have noticed a problem?  

Oh, and your later comment:
&gt;Oh, I think if you did remove economic class structures then there would be much less sexism. We remove sexism through education, and the people who receive the best education are the people in the highest classes. If everyone received the benefit of the highest class's education then there would be much less sexism.

Dream on! Sorry, but education and wealth do *nothing* to mitigate sexism. Sexism isn't a remnant of soceity found only in places where people have less education and power. Sexism is in fact, highly tied to power and privilege and some of the worst behaviour comes from very well educated upper-class men.

So yes, you're being incredibly racist and classist. But you're also totally getting sexism and male privilege wrong too.

RichardBehiel,WTF,1390626705.0,"Yeah, It's magnets all the way down!

Don't believe me?  Try this simple experiment: cut a magnet in half.  Now you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole!  You can theoretically repeat the process down to the atomic level, at which point you'll just end up with atoms, but remember, they're like little magnets!  (In technical terms, an atom has a *magnetic moment*.)

An atom can act as a magnet, just like a fish can swim.  But one fish isn't very powerful.  Even a thousand fish in a net aren't really that powerful, since they're swimming in random directions and the net result (pun intended) is roughly zero.  Although, as Disney fans know, a thousand aligned fish can do some pretty powerful things!  I think that's a pretty good way to think of how atoms behave in magnetic materials.  

One interesting thing about breaking magnets apart is that it always gives you magnetic *dipoles*, that is, magnets with north and south poles.  [Like this.](http://www.meritnation.com/img/shared/discuss_editlive/2241653/2012_02_09_08_50_31/image3436936332733800428_3597989230437199620.jpg) Turns out no magnetic *monopole*, as in a magnet with just a north pole or just a south pole, has ever been discovered.  

This is tantalizing because nobody has ever come up with a reason that magnetic monopoles *couldn't* exist, and the existence of just one magnetic monopole in the entire universe would explain some cool things, like why electric charge is always a multiple of a fixed value.

Furthermore, you have electric monopoles all over the place (electrons, protons, etc.), and a piece of mass acts as a gravitational monopole, so why have magnets only been found in dipoles?  Who knows...  for now though, until a magnetic monopole is discovered, we just use Gauss's law of magnetism (one of Maxwell's equations) to say that none exist.  

Sorry for the rant, I just really like magnets.  "

Furious_Nutrient,AskReddit,1390626804.0,"Actually the only monkey to have sex for fun are Bonobos, great apes and other animals do it to assert dominance.

Birth Control and Abortion can also stop teen pregnancies. You can have a bit of wincest if you like but every single day, teenagers don't wear condoms, or take the morning after pill, and don't get abortions, because abortions are emotionally difficult to handle, so they just have their 16 year old pregnancy to full term.

Yes killing and eating an animal is completely ok, because when animals are killed for consumption there is no stress or pain to the animal, as they are killed as quickly as possible, allowing the animal to be afraid floods meat with adrenaline and other hormones, which in turn ruins the taste.
It is the same in the case of criminals who face execution, it is somehow ok to kill them for their crimes, but submitting a criminal to hours of physical and emotional torture is not ok.

You speak about the animals as if they too have a desire to have sex with a human, in reality there has been no form of consent between the two parties, and depending on the animal, the intercourse may actually harm one of the members involved.

Necrophilia on the other hand, no one gets hurt."

As a psychologist I've known about it for years, and it's my belief that as the group of academics responsible for teaching that bias, we're also in the prime position to work against it. (Almost have a duty to, I guess.) For the past 5 years, I've made the conscious decision that when shit goes down, I jump in - no hesitation. Once I came across a fight in the middle of a busy public road, pulled over and broke it up. Another time a janitor at my university fell and broke his arm and I picked him up. And one time I even wrestled a drunk guy wielding a knife to the ground in a quite pub when the only staff on were women. (I got a free pint for that one from the landlord/police when they reviewed the footage.) Don't get me wrong, I'm not posting this to show off. In fact, I've never disclosed this to anyone before.

2. Oblivion Stone is INSANE.  You don't often play anything but land that you need in play until you go for some win condition and O-Stone wipes everything else up for you until you have Karn or Wurmcoil or Emrakul in hand.  You will have Tron on turn 3 and 4 more often without anything to play with it than you will not have Tron with some threat to cast.
3. I agree with you, personally.  I'm not a fan of the Mindslaver in the RG build.  That said, it's certainly a powerful play, it's just not a win condition.  It does give you more control over the game, so maybe test it and see how you like it?
4. All is Dust is good, but so is O-Stone and so is Pyroclasm.  At the end of the day, it's uncastable if you don't have all the mana right away whereas the other two can be pulled off over two turns (O-Stone) or with one of your many mana transformers (Pyroclasm).

Exis007,relationships,1390627375.0,"I can't tell you what you're doing wrong because you can't tell me what you're doing wrong. Chances are, based on the issues you're facing, there are social cues you're not grasping or a dynamic you're missing out on. 

Do you have *any* women in your life? Sometimes when you're stumped as to why no one will date you, why you can't make friends, why [x] social problem is happening, there are people in your life who know but won't say anything for fear of hurting your feelings. For instance, I have a friend who I know wants a SO but is so down on them self as to be frightening to date. You can share those kind of bleak, cool thoughts when you know someone well but that's really material for date five or eight, not date one. I am not going to tell that person what I know. I am not ignorant that they would be better off with that info, I've just never been invited to share. 

So my first recommendation is to ask....someone. Maybe even someone who has, in the past, rejected you. Clear space for them emotionally. Tell them they can be brutally honest, either in person or in writing if that makes them more comfortable, but that you're unhappy currently and you NEED to know what you're doing wrong so that you can fix it. Make it clear that you're not going to use that information to specifically try to bond with the person you're asking; you don't want to make it sound like you're trying to force a friendship with that person. I asked whether you have women in your life because a woman is going to have, in general, a better grasp on what you're not doing correctly in terms of making friends with other girls. Guys often miss some of the nuances of female friendship. 

You're not in solution-mode right now, you need a good diagnostic. Without that, I can't tell you how to fix this because I don't know what problems need to be overcome. It could be such a wide range of things that there's no point in guessing. Aspergers comes in so many flavors that I'd hesitate to guess as to what the issue is. 

.....But if I HAD to guess (and this is a total shot in the dark) is might be emotion-based communication. Women talk about feelings a lot. Women talk about their feelings, the feelings of other people, anticipated feelings, etc. We also talk about video games and sex and the cool show we saw last week, but feelings are a major thing. If you struggle with that kind of conversation, you might not be off-putting but you might also not be bonding. So what might be happening is that you're ""nice enough"" but there's no forged closeness. So they don't hate you, they don't mind having you around, but they don't rely on you emotionally so you're not getting called to go shopping or go to the concert/bar. That closeness is often formed by sharing deeper, darker shades of self that are often heavily entrenched in feeling. With that in mind, maybe you have a demographic problem. Maybe you're not going to make girlfriends in the traditional way of confessing all your secrets and hearing theirs tearfully. Maybe you need to shop for friends in places that cater to more grounded, specific interests. I don't know how nerdy you are, but joining a game night or a trivia team might work wonders. You might need to bond with people on the intellectual/shared interest level. 

That's all I've got. Get an objective opinion and go from there.  "

Sex trafficking happens no just in India but around the world, including the US. There are an estimated [20-30 million slaves](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/12/slaverys-global-comeback/266354/) worldwide, which means there are more slaves now than ever before in history. 

There are basically five ways to approach any such complex issue: awareness, advocacy, policy, markets, and charity. All are important but it's a matter of what you can contribute to most effectively. One thing is for sure: you can't help with anything unless you thoroughly educate yourself on the issue and what's being done about it.

http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/index.html?ref=menuside

Probably the most concrete thing you can do is to organize a fundraiser to donate to charity. It allows you to raise awareness at the same time. There are dozens of organizations combatting child sex trafficking in India. If you search for them you will find them. 

I am not sure what you mean exactly by ""special forces"" or ""special interests"". Are you trying to suggest military intervention? There are about a thousand reasons why that wouldn't work. Diplomatic intervention? Western politicians can try to push Indian policy makers to do more on the issue, but ultimately the change has to come from within the country. 

An important question is how bodies like the UN can combat the issue. This wikipedia [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafficking_of_children) provides links to some of the international agreements in place to try to force countries not to allow child slavery.

But ultimately, you have to understand the context for the problem, and without changing the environment that makes child trafficking not only possible but also lucrative, you can't eradicate the problem. The sexual slavery of children is only part of a puzzle that includes a bunch of other types of slavery that go on in India, not to mention that non-enslaved workers don't have many labor rights or protections either. 

Laws only help if they can be enforced, and they rely on the logic that punishment deters crime--which it does somewhat, but punishment doesn't solve the problem in the same way that punishing drug dealers doesn't stop the drug trade. As a comparison, the War on Drugs has been going on in the US for over 40 years and is largely deemed a failure--and this is in a country where we have tons of police and the resources to incarcerate more people than any other country. It has been a top priority for law enforcement for years and it's still a systemic problem because there are plenty of people who are willing to sell drugs even at risk of being caught. So in India, a country with much less infrastructure for law enforcement and many more issues competing for the government's attention, you can't really expect great results. The financial reward for selling children is immediate and sometimes necessary whereas the chance and cost of getting caught are relatively low. Parents sell their kids out of desperation. Traffickers sell kids to support their families. Unless you change the cost-benefit ratio by sucking profitability out of the industry, the best hope is to contain the problem, not fix it.

I dont know where on the page youre referring to. If on the quantitative calculation, the 0.1M is from the Ag^+ originally. If in the H-H calculation, the 0.1M on the denominator is the H*_2_*S0*_3_* (HA) and the numerator is the HS0*_3_* (A^- )

&gt; Shouldn't that denominator be the sulfite conc already calculated?

I dont think so.. [Im using this](http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/ph/graphics/HHc.gif), where HA im using is the H*_2_*S0*_3_* and the A- is the HS0*_3_* as mentioned before.

ahazelgun,AskWomen,1390627446.0,"Based on what you've described here, I might shy away from this tactic entirely, but that's based on the following assumptions:

1. Most of the people you're meeting and using this tactic with are also McGill students, i.e. they are in the same ball park in terms of aptitude.
2. Since these are people you don't know very well, they may also be excellent students and very involved with campus activities/athletics, etc.
3. You are a very good student, academically and otherwise, but have not achieved *especially* high recognition in any of these things (e.g., being recruited for a professional hockey career or receiving national recognition for your student paper or something along those lines).

If those things are true, I wouldn't bother consciously downplaying what you do, especially if you are accurate that you don't exactly come off as confident.  It may very well be because of your humor.  While what you've described is a very active student leader, this description isn't of someone who is so overwhelmingly successful as to warrant ""compensating"" for with self-deprecation in your particular audience.  A fellow McGill student is much more likely to think, ""Wow, that's pretty impressive,"" than, ""Damn, that guy must be full of himself.""  (Nothing on your list immediately suggests this to me.)  On the other hand, if I can tell you're consciously downplaying what you do, it may backfire in one of two ways:  I will think you actually have low self-esteem, or I think you are actually full of yourself because you think you need to downplay something that's not even worth downplaying.

That being said, if the humor comes organically and it's a funny joke, go for it, but don't *purposely* come up with jokes to cultivate a particular image.  What makes people unlikeable on the other end of the spectrum is not that they are good at what they do, but needless mentioning of their accomplishments, seemingly just for the sake of reminding people of them.

So if you're just meeting someone, I'd probably just say something like, ""I'm pretty active in a lot of stuff, but I especially like/I'm most involved in X and Y.""  From there, they can ask about what else you do, or what you like about those two things, and you can answer honestly.  If they say something like, ""Wow, that's a lot,"" or ""You must be really [insert compliment here],"" then you can be humble in response, but I wouldn't just offer up the self-deprecation right off the bat (e.g., ""I'm involved in a lot of stuff, but it's not really a big deal.  I don't do really important stuff or anything."").  That way, you let them draw their conclusions first (he's smart) and *then* be humble, instead of just providing conclusions to them (he does a lot of stuff, but I guess he's not very good at any of those things).

If my assumptions are wrong, and the problem is that McGill students have a reputation for being a little stuck up (which, as an American, I have no awareness of), and someone asks you where you go, I would just say, ""McGill,"" with no apologetic or mitigating follow-up.  The worst thing is when you ask someone in the States, ""Where do you go?"" and they say, ""A school in/outside Boston.""  Literally only people from Harvard say that, and it comes off as, ""Oh, well I don't want to tell you outright, because I don't want to make you feel bad about being so inadequate, so let's just use this neat little code so no one's feelings get hurt.""  And you're just standing there like, ""... You can just say Harvard, you know.  It is literally just a fact about where you go to school.  It is not even worth skirting around.""  (See backfire #2 above.)

TL;DR:  You're a great student, but (based on what you've provided) you're not such hot shit that self-deprecation is at all necessary right off the bat.  You can respond to compliments with humility/humor, but don't actively prevent people from concluding that you're confident/competent."

Being in such a huge science loving church just made the bible literalists seem like such a bizarre, tiny fringe group that I don't think they seemed worth mentioning or defending against. In my mind it was kind of like ""Duh, those guys are crazy wackos, unlike us *true* enlightened reasonable mainstream Christians. Everyone can see that plain as day!""

Honestly it was the realization that the literal bible people were actually a sizable part of the population that really began my process of distancing myself from religion altogether. I just didn't want to be associated with that kind of Christianity whatsoever and as time went on I questioned more and more of my beliefs and found more of the religion to be undesirable."

Look at more alternative forms of income. Can you keep your job and hustle at night and start an your own business? A year ago I didn't know anything about finance at all but I read a shitload of books and now I do. Now I believe in myself enough to create more than one income stream. Google and find good books about creating wealth by managing your finances, and also how someone without an applicable degree can create an income.  
  
**Here are some actionable steps to what I just said:**  
**LEARN:**  
-Read blogs(mr money mustache, james altucher, bogglehead etc plenty of great ones)   
 
-Read books about managing money (millionaire next door, search this subreddit for plenty of posts with great recommendations.) I'd also recommend reading some self help books for a kick in the ass. Such as Quitter and START from Jon Acoff. All about creating an income WHILE keeping your day job.   
  
-Self educate from world class universities (coursera, edx, codecademy)  
  
**PREPARE:**  

If one area of your life suffers, all areas of your life suffer  
-Get your finances in order in regards to having a detailed budget  
-Spend less than you make even if it means cooking all your meals to make this paycheck just $5 less than you NEED to spend  
-Get enough sleep  
-Exercise and treat your body well  
-Brainstorm things that you already know about, are interested in, that you can monetize. Then LEARN some more so that you can think up even better ideas.  
  
**DO:**  
  
Creativity is learned. Time breads greater creativity and greater success. Get out there and DO. By that I mean keep working your job, your second job, fix your budget, then put it all together and create your own wealth! If you start a business or try and try and try and start 20 businesses, you will do nothing but gain. You will come away wealthier or with a whole lot more resources to create your own wealth.  
  
Entrepreneurs don't need certificates that say they are smart. They know they are smart and they make their own success. Good luck

DERangEdKiller,AskReddit,1390628258.0,"Real simple kid.

Understand that the things you do now aren't meaningless.  Many of these decisions will affect you in ways you can not even imagine now, nor will you until years down the road.  With that in mind, here's some tips that might make things a little easier.

1.  Focus in class in two ways.

- What you are learning.  It might be repetitive, it might be boring, but what it also is, is the stepping stones to vast amounts of knowledge.

- Everything you learn now from simple math to proper sentence and essay structure will be built upon in lots of ways.  If you don't pick these things up now, you'll have to do it later when you'll have to read a novel and write 2 8 page essays on other novels at the same time (I'm an English Major, so that's the clearest example I can think of).

2.Only give up on things you absolutely have to.  If you signed up for football, and you regret it a few months later when your throwing up from doing wind sprints and ""gut checks""  Suck it up. It sucks, and it hurts, and you might not even be very good, but learning how to hang in there till it hurts, and then dealing with more can prepare you for long term challanges that come your way.  I'm lazy, so the first time I quit because I got scared, I thought I dodged a bullet.  Then somewhere down the line, I realized when something scared me or got too difficult, I bailed, and it was easy.  Sticking with something you hate might not be immediately rewarding, but if it becomes habit, you can survive almost anything with enough perseverance, and I wish I could've said nothing ever really kept me down, or kept me from going for the things I wanted out of life.

3.Accept the fact that all you can really do is plan for the future, and appreciate it while it lasts, because things have a way of deviating from said plan.

Another part of this, is that no one has it all figured out.  Every single one of us was, and finds ourselves again in a position where we are scared and don't know what to do.  Always remember you are well equipped intellectually to figure a problem out.  All you, and any of us can do is decide.  I personally decide with my heart, and my gut.  If I decide based on what I feel can do the most right, or at the least, the least harm, then I know I'll be able to sleep tonight.  At the end of the day you have to live with your decisions, but other people might have to live with your decisions too.  Do what you feel is right (there may be exceptions to this rule, but only you will know in your heart which ones are the exceptions.

Understand that many of the people around you might not be there in the future.  Due to various reasons, out of my graduating class, almost 5 percent were dead by our 10th reunion.  You've probably heard the term life is short, but I got two others you might not know.
 - Life is fragile.  As a kid, we'd jump off of roofs into mounds of ice plant, play with low grade explosives, drink and do things you shouldn't while drinking, and when we were your age, we thought nothing can tough us, but I'm telling that is not true.  Don't fear death, but understand that it comes for us on it's time, and it will always be too soon.  If you like to live wreckless, then I beg you to think of the people you love, or the people in the future who you don't know yet who are waiting for your love, and realize if you aren't going to be smarter, and more careful for your own well being, then do it because everyone dies alone, why would you want the people you love to spend anymore time without than they need to.

Lastly young squire, learn to laugh.  There's so much that happens in life that makes you want to rip your face off, and throw it at people, that you need to learn to bend a little.  Think of it this way.  When things go wrong, laugh or at least scoff at it.  Stress really can fuck up your health, and if someone's antagonizing you, remember that it'll fuck with them more if you play it like it doesn't really bother you, and is even stupid and funny.

Go forth squire.  Throw yourself into life and love, and take on every challenge as a learning experience.  If learn nothing academically, you'll find a moral or a life truth, and those often come with a story that is either shocking, funny, or scary, and who doesn't love sharing a great story?

This is disingenuous. There are a lot of reasons cattle are put in feedlots—such as to promote rapid weight gain (thereby reducing the time it takes to produce beef, and providing versatility in terms of time of year steers are ready for slaughter), to output more uniform beef (since diet can be more tightly controlled in a feedlot), to reduce stock on pastures (such as in the event of a drought), and to make room for more breeding stock (since breeders are typically raised on pasture)."

Edit: There are a lot of options. Of course you are well aware there is much opposition to these views. If you are looking for more sources or something more specific I might be able to offer a few book suggestions. Also the link by brojangles below has some good content. Personally my focus has been on Christian-Muslim relations. One related issue surrounding it is the source for the material concerning Jesus in the Quran. Literalists will often claim there is no source material as it came directly from God, but we have good textual evidence that at least some of the stories were from Christian apocrypha. The first that comes to mind is Jesus breathing life into clay pigeons is actually found in the [infancy gospel of Thomas.](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/infancythomas.html) Anyways onto more broad issues of historicity and narative. These were all taken from Reformation of Islamic thought : a critical historical analysis by Nasr Abu Zayd

&gt; The literary approach is generally supposed to offer a solution. It frees the Muslim mentality from a position of stagnation. “The Quran is neither a book of science, nor of history, nor of political theory”, is what the discourse of tajdid seeks to establish. The Quran is a spiritual and ethical book of guidance, in which the stories are used to fulfill this purpose. In other words, the Quranic stories are literary narratives employed to serve ethical, spiritual and religious purposes. It is, therefore, a fatal methodological error to deal with the narrative of the Quran as purely historical facts (al-Khuli 1957).

&gt; Taha Husayn emphasized the peculiar and unique aesthetic dimension of the Quranic style, namely its ijaz (inimitability), by pointing to the literary nature that makes the Quran an independent literary genre in itself (Husayn 1995:20-6). Being an historian and critic of literature par excellence, he claimed that the Quran is neither poetry nor prose; it is, quite simply, the Quran. Secondly, Husayn considered the Quranic story of the arrival in Mecca of Abraham, his wife Hagar, and his son Ishmael, to be an oral narrative dating from long before the revelation of the Quran. This story, he said, was designed to ease tension between the pagan Arabs, the original inhabitants of Yathrib, and the Arab Jewish tribes who had settled in the city. Not only did the Quran use this story to locate Islam in the context of the Judeo-Christian tradition, but also to establish its priority as monotheistic religion. Husayn’s point was to emphasize that this story should not be taken to convey any historical reality which dictated that assumptions on the linguistic situation in the Arabian Peninsula (Husayn 1995: 33-5)

&gt; Ali Abd al-Raziq’s book addressed the political theory of Islam and concluded that in the absence of such a theory, Muslims have the possibility of choice.

&gt; The idea emphasized in Abduh’s exegesis was that the Quran basically reflects the mentality of the pagan, 7th century Arabs. This notion was subsequently developed by Taha Husayn, Amin al-Khuli and Ahmad Khalafalla (all of whom were affiliated with the National University), until it reached a fundamental break with the traditional and long established concept of the nature of the Quran as the word of God, on one hand, and as a text on the other. It may be significant here to mention the hesitation by Abduh in his theological treatise Risalat al-Tawhidin adopting the rational Mutazili concept of the Quran as created. Abduh’s choice was unclear; the first edition of his book (1897) adopted the Mutazi’s doctrine, but in the second edition, published in al-Manar, he had switched to the Asharit’s distinction between the ‘Eternal’ aspect of God’s word and its created manifestation in our human act of ‘recitation’. It is unclear whether this alteration reveals that Abduh changed his mind or whether the changes were made by Rashid Rida (Abduh 1977: 13 and 52).

(If you google my legal first &amp; last name, you'll probably get half the white irish americans in existence) so I use that name at school or wherever people see me on paper before they meet me in person, and I go by my middle name with friends. 

I chose two middle names - the first is Arthur and it was my grandfather's middle name, and that's what my friends call me. I didn't have any particular attachment to it but it's grown on me and at some point it felt like my name. my second middle name is yanked from a character from a cartoon i really liked as a kid. my thoughts when getting my name legally changed were ""fuck it, probably only going to do this once, might as well pick something fun and stick it in there.""

Nadieestaaqui,Homebrewing,1390629704.0,"The OP is amazing, follow all his advice. 

Here are a few things that I wish someone had told me when I was starting out:

* Don't worrying about screwing up. Be adventurous. People were making beer in clay pots when fermentation was considered magic. Everything will be fine, and the only thing better than your first batch of home made beer is your second batch. 

* There are a million styles with a million variables, but the only equation that's really important is water + grain + hops + yeast = beer. How far you get into the rest of it is up to you. The only thing you have to worry about on day one is enjoying yourself. 

* Sanitization is easy. I use a 10 qt mop bucket from Walmart. Fill it up most of the way with tap water, and add a half ounce of Star San. Anything that's going to touch the cooled wort goes in the bucket for 30 seconds, no need to rinse afterward. Star San cost me $14.95 for the big bottle at my local home brew store, and my current bottle is still over half full more than a year later. Saves a ton of time vs boiling all the equipment. 

* Blow-off is easy to deal with. Run a tube from your bung into a glass of water. Check the glass regularly, it might fill up. 

* If you're really concerned about kreusen (blow off), just use a bigger carboy. I do 2 gallon batches these days, because I like brewing the beer almost more than I like drinking it, and I use a 3 gallon carboy. If you're doing 5 gallon batches, get a 6.5 gallon bucket fermenter. 

* 2 weeks in the fermenter, 2 weeks in the bottles. It can be done more quickly, but I find this way is easier to keep track of when life gets busy. 

* Resealable bottles are worth their weight in printer ink. If you can find Grolsch, you get the bottles and the beer, but it's getting tough to find in those bottles (where I live, anyway). EZCap bottles are on the pricey side, but if you find down the line that you enjoy this hobby, they're worth it. 

* Small batches (1 or 2 gallon) are a great way to start. The equipment and ingredients are dirt cheap, the process is very quick, the clean up is minimal, and you can concentrate on having fun and refining your own approach. As a bonus, if you eventually scale up to larger batches, you'll have everything you need when you want to make a small batch of cider, mead, wine, etc. later. 

* Keep a journal, and write down **everything** you do on brew day. Spilled half your grain on the floor and made up for it with extract? Write it down. Brew store was out of the yeast you wanted, and you just picked something else off the shelf? Write it down. Accidentally doubled the hops at one stage? Write it down. Those mistakes can result in amazing beer, and you'll kick yourself if you can't ever make it again. "

I was 16 at the time working 40-60 (or sometimes more) hours a week and going to high school on top of it. I remember one time I was so exhausted I got sent to an empty room to take a *nap* for god sakes.

What happened was, it was a professional kitchen and at 9 o'clock, the head chef would peel out of the lot. Now, everyone else (the sous chef, meat chef etc.) were to clean their stations and leave between 9:30 and 10. Yeah, never happened. At 9:15 the kitchen was a ghost town and a mess that I had to take care of. 

I had two coworkers who worked with me in the dish pit and both were fucking useless. One guy would leave with everyone else, or he would go to the employee parking (which was somewhat hidden) and boff his girlfriend. I complained thinking he'd get reprimanded. No he got canned. Second guy ended up getting caught with pot and was canned. The head chef tried to hire to people and ultimately failed. First guy he hired to help me out was pulled over, and arrested for drug possession *on his way to his first day of work*. He made the front page of the local paper. Second guy he hired fled the state a week before he was to begin - something to do with child support. Again, I learned this from the paper. 

I actually walked up to my boss and said ""You pick out all the fucking winners don't you?"" He didn't try to hire anyone else.
 
I was by myself for the longest time and my hours became insane. I was only averaging about 2 hours of sleep a night at this point and the hotel didn't care. MY pleas for help fell on deaf ears and I was forced to clean and shut down the kitchen and finish the dishes all by myself, sometimes not getting out until 2-4 in the morning. 

Now, some are wondering, ""Why didn't you quit?"" Well, I was taught you always needed a 2 week notice. And did give one. Multiple times. One time the the general manager got pissed, sought me out and bitched me out for wanting to quit and threw out my request in front of me. And like the bitch I was, I took it. 

Final straw was when I dropped a knife on my finger and I severed the tip. I begged to go to the hospital and the host of the restaurant told me ""Wrap it in gauze and duct tape and get back to work."" And I did. And when I finally got home that night (After I think 6 hours) my finger was pale and bloody and the tip was hanging on by a thread. My mother rushed me to the ER and it took 8 stitches to sew the tip of my finger back on. They ultimately tried denying me workers comp - but my mother who has 30+ years in human resources and managing hotel experience threatened them the next day and they gave it to me. 

Well, that was the finally straw for me. Plus the fact the ""help"" they hired for me was a mentally handicapped man in his 40's that spent all his time counting the tongs on the forks. I'm not lying. **I HAD HAD ENOUGH** 

So I stormed into the head chefs office and said to him, ""I FUCKING QUIT!"" He smiles and laughs, thinking they have me wrapped around their finger. Little did he know I was serious... and fucking pissed. 

My father had JUST been laid off some weeks prior (this was another reason I didn't quit was because I wanted to be helpful and support the family, much to my parents chagrin. Plus me being a typical lead headed teenager, ignored their pleas for me walk out on the job) and I had a light bulb moment and said 'AHA!!' So I looked to the head chef and said to him, ""Either you let me quit, or you can deal with OSHA and the labor board. I'm sure they would love to hear how you're making me work with broken, filthy, MOLDY equipment and how you're making a 16 year old work 60-80 hours a week and denied him medical treatment which resulted in *EIGHT FUCKING STITCHES!!*"" He turned the palest I had ever seen a person and sat their in stunned silence. I turned to walk out and he cried out after me, ""I'll put in a two week notice I PROMISE!"" I smiled at him and replied with, ""Oh, and you know what, my father needs a job. He has the same contact information as me. You give him an interview and give him the job and I'll keep quiet. Got it!?"" He nodded and in two weeks I was gone and my dad started. Ultimately he become head maintenance. 

**TL;DR - Hotel forced me to work as much as 80 hours in a week. Refused me medical treatment when I needed it and couldn't hire anybody that would actually help me out. I had to threaten them with OSHA and the labor board to quit.**"

I'm basing what I said on an anthropology course I took a few years ago. Those findings surprised me so I looked into it a bit.

Also, car mechanics sometimes feel like their consciousness is in their hands while they work.

Fleming could probably handle it - he played outside in college - but given that we swapped him inside at the same time we swapped Skuta outside, I assume the coaches think this is a better match for their respective skills.

Basically, the idea behind moving Skuta inside or dropping Brooks into coverage in nickel sets is that our OLB depth is better - or at least more proven - than our ILB depth, so we may prefer to adjust our scheme to make more use of them.  But if we're going to use both our ILB depth and our OLB depth anyway, we're probably better off playing them all at their natural positions."

It is a keen sense of accomplishment that stems from superiority, not arrogance. It is enlightement by quality of brain matter, not density of skull matter.

To be euphoric is the ultimate declaration of our non-faith. It is the culmination of the beatitudes of an atheist lifestyle. It is the ""#YOLO"" on our Twitter feed.

RichardBehiel,WTF,1390630028.0,"Anytime!  And yeah, ""dipoles"" is the correct word, ""di"" meaning two and ""pole"" meaning... well, pole, as in two opposite ends of a sphere.

In fact, the whole Earth acts as a magnetic dipole, and its north and south poles are literally the North and South Poles!  This is because the rotation of the Earth and the fact that the mantle is liquid allow for some alignment in the magma (to be technical, the Coriolis affect organizes the conducting fluid into aligned rolls).

So the Earth is giving off a magnetic field all around you right now.  It's too weak to make metal things fly off tables and whatnot, but it can move a small piece of iron provided there's not a whole lot of friction keeping it in place.  That's what compasses are.

The Earth's magnetic field extends into space too, and repels the solar wind (a stream of charged particles).  This interaction, commonly called an aurora, is pretty to look at.  If it weren't for the Earth's magnetic field, we'd be exposed to much more radiation down here on the surface, which would make life considerably more difficult.

Mars is (arguably) geologically dead.  Its mantle has cooled down and as a result its magnetic field isn't nearly as strong as it once was.  This has let all kinds of charged particles come into its atmosphere, hit molecules of gas, and send them flying out into space with enough speed to leave the planet forever.  

As a result, Mars's atmosphere is now super thin (~0.7% the pressure at sea level on Earth) and it's really hard to land spacecraft there.  Parachutes don't work as efficiently in a thin atmosphere, so in addition to using parachutes you also have to bring extra fuel with you to do a retrograde burn near the surface to slow down.  Or, in the case of the Curiosity rover, they actually lowered it with a crazy thing called a [sky crane](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/593481main_pia14839-43_946-710.jpg). Check out this video of [Curiosity landing on Mars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Esj5juUzhpU).  This video comes from real pictures taken by Curiosity during EDL (entry, descent, and landing), extrapolated from 4fps to 30fps, with sound added over it.

Something to keep in mind about that video: Curiosity was so far away (farther than the Sun) when this happened, that it took light something like 14 minutes to get there, so the rover had to land itself completely on its own without any communication from Earth.

&gt;I set my heat to about 100amps, just guessing and for starters.

Sounds like it should be okay, but it depends on the size of your tungsten.

&gt;I set my Argon pressure to about 15 PSI, 

Are you using a regulator or a flow metre?

&gt;and was using a DC negative and positive current. 

You want the polarity DCEN, DCEP will burn your tungsten up in a hurry.

&gt;I should mention that my Tungsten had a red band at the other end, I'm not sure what it means though.

2% thorium, and old at that. (it is radioactive, but mildly.)

&gt;When I finally got to welding, I pressed slightly on the pedal, and what came out looked like a small bolt of lightning. I pressed further and eventually had to floor it to get anything to melt. I don't think you have to do that... and then the tungsten started to burn and then of course the cup.

That sounds like you had it on DCEP."

SirNuke,MINI,1390630429.0,"I have a H/K system, though I bought my R56 used.  I can't personally compare it to non H/K MINIs, though compared to other cars I would consider it normal for OEM offered sound system upgrades.  It's very good, but won't touch what you can do aftermarket.  At a relatively modest $750, it seems to be a pretty good value.

For me, however, my car isn't for listening to music.  I have a setup in my apartment for that.  My MINI is for driving a bit too fast through curvy roads with the windows down.  The speakers are mostly for killing time on long, boring highway trips.  I'd probably have been fine with the base system, and the H/K system is more than sufficient for my desires.

So I guess it depends on what you ultimately want.  I would, however, bring an audio cable and try out both H/K and base systems at your local dealer.

On an unrelated note, can I ask why you are going with a Paceman?  The MINI lineup is kinda murky, but the Paceman makes the least amount of sense to me.  It's a Countryman, expect two doors while costing more.  I suppose it looks a bit sharper than the Countryman from the outside?  I see plenty of Countryman frequently, but I've never seen Paceman in the wild."

pizzaandburritos,AskReddit,1390630465.0,"There are several problems with your suggestion.

1. It is completely illegal. If you use drones or such to kill suspects, it denies them their rights to a fair trial.  The only way to to make it remotely legal would be for the US to declare war on ""child sex traffickers in India"". The backlash from other countries would be enormous. International law dictates that you cannot just wage unprovoked war. The US would lose all credibility diplomatically. 

2. There would be inevitable collateral damage. It would kill lots of innocent people. 

3. Precedent shows it doesn't work well. We've approached the War in Afghanistan similarly--how well has that worked? The situation in Afghanistan is not in control at all.

4. It comes at high costs to the US and the public would not support it. We've had high casualties in Afghanistan for a war we will not win. At least that was to combat terrorism, though. Sex trafficking in India plays no threat to our national security. The monetary cost would be extraordinarily high as well. You would be asking taxpayers to fund a multi-billion dollar mission at a time when we are still embroiled in another multi-trillion dollar mission in Afghanistan (and we will continue to have to fund law enforcement there long after we pull out the troops). Not to mention that there are so many economic problems we face domestically.

5. It creates a dangerous slippery slope. What you are saying is that there is no need to govern democratically as long as you are right; it's OK to infringe on rights if you only do it to the bad guys. And you are saying that the good guys don't need rights to protect them from the government because they should have nothing to run from. Basically, you are advocating totalitarianism. It doesn't matter that it would be for well-intentioned reasons. If you study how different totalitarian regimes came about, it's often that they promised to ""protect people"" from evils by taking away their rights. 

6. It creates a problematic precedent. There is no rhyme or reason to why we would intervene in India over this issue. Why not invade Thailand, Mauritania, or any other country with similar problems? When do we deem that a problem is big enough for us to intervene with? Can other countries invade the US for its human rights violations? Despite how frequently it seems the US intervenes in conflicts abroad, there are rules and precedents in place for when that is appropriate. The method of intervention you are suggesting is completely unprecedented. 

7. It is a band-aid solution. Even if everything goes well and we magically solve the problem and India and the whole world loves us, what then? How long do we have to stay in India to help combat the problem? Without the proper infrastructure to fight trafficking, it will return once we leave.  It takes decades to build that kind of infrastructure, and the US doesn't have a good track record for helping countries do that. It would mean we stay indefinitely, with indefinite costs, or we pull out and lose everything we invested in it.

I've honestly never heard of people getting a clutch assembly replaced specifically for the damn throwout bearing. I think it's just car guy FUD. It's also probably because nobody sits there with the clutch floored all day without just putting it in neutral because it's so annoying and tiring otherwise. 

You're *supposed* to put the clutch in under braking, but it's not required until the engine starts lugging (very low revs) or is ready to stall. Most people will put it in neutral if they anticipate a complete stop instead of sitting there with the clutch in. Try incorporating that into your style.

English Bulldogs' [jaws are so far pushed into their scull](http://www.andersonbulldogges.com/0history1.png), and for what, to be cute? I do admit they are adorable, but at what cost? Can you name one health benefit that comes with a smushed in scull?

Yes, there are English Bulldogs that are healthy and have no issues, but why even risk that? Why support something that's causing dogs (whether or not it's your dog) to suffer? 

Luckily there are people who still breed Olde English Bulldogs, the way their conformation was before people became so obsessed with Breed Standard and making them look a certain way. It really is a shame what they have become.

Once again, no one is saying they're terrible dogs. English Bulldogs are some of the sweetest and funniest dogs I've ever met. But it's not their personality people are concerned about. It's their sculls."

And he replied with, ""Yeah, there's a good reason for that, I don't fucking like you after what you did to [ex].""

The crush is assumed and the only reason I can think of why he decided to hate me, we weren't the best of room mates, but we certainly weren't the worst and when I broke up with the girl it was a simple ""Lets just not see each other anymore.""  

Oh, and my brother-in-law because I married his sister and I'm not up to his standards."

Oh, 432hz makes better watter resonance patterns than 440hz (it doesn't, by the way, the photos are cherry-picked)? What does that mean, water's just one of infinite combinations of elements.

Oh, water's important? Why? Oh, it's the basis for life on Earth. Life, which has existed for a mere fraction of the universe's existence, which has only exited in a complex form for an even smaller fraction, which has only been multicellular for an infinitesimally small time and ""sapient"" (however you define *that*) for an amount of time that staggers expression it's so small. 

It's the basis for life, which we've only found to exist 7 light-minutes from a sun that orbits a spiral galaxy 12,000 light-years in diameter that exists in a local cluster 10 million light-years in diameter that exists in a supercluster 110 million light-years in diameter that exists in a universe **100 billion** light-years in diameter.

And because dihydrogen *mon*oxide is the chemical on which the life on the surface of a rock orbiting a ball of fusion in a tiny galaxy in an infinite universe... the fact that it makes arbitrarily-defined ""beautiful"" patterns at a specific kinetic resonance means that it's the key to everything.

Hey, guess what? On the sixth planet from our sun, there's a friggin' *hexagon* around the north pole made out of gasses moving at 100s of kilometers per hour. There's a planet 42 light-years away that's covered in water, but the atmospheric pressure is so high that, at different depths, it exists simultaneously as a gas, liquid, and solid; there are types of ice on that planet that, previously, were only thought to exist *theoretically* because we couldn't recreate the conditions to make them in a lab.

What's so special about Earth life? Well, there's humans, but given that humans are the judge of what's ""special"" I'm prone to think that's a pretty biased opinion.

Humans. How self-centered can you get?

Gluestick05,weddingplanning,1390632215.0,"So our general planning strategy is that I assemble a list of options, my fiance and I discuss them, do research, and make a choice, and then we present our favorite and maybe a backup or two to our parents.

This should be a fine process, except I feel like *I'm* the one being evaluated every time a new person considers the things I've put together, and I feel like a huge failure every time someone doesn't like one of my options.  For example, I used a pretty modern/stylized calligraphy on my invite design, and my mother haaaated it.  Shouldn't have been a big deal, didn't expect her to like it, but suddenly I was wondering if I have terrible taste in fonts and everyone is going to get my invitations and wonder why I didn't spend the money on a designer since I clearly suck at this.  I'm usually an extremely self-assured person, and I have no idea where this is coming from.

On a much more serious note, I've started to realize that I have a bit of a complex about getting married young and planning a wedding.  I feel a pretty strong need to prove that I'm serious/smart/career-focused to make up for the fact that I'm planning a big princess party as a part of my decision to get married at 24.

And finally, I totally forgot that I created a website on theknot until someone mentioned that they had found it today.  I'm in the process of applying to PhD programs in a very male-dominated area of research, and I have been extremely careful to not have anything wedding-related in my name because I absolutely do have a two-body problem that will limit my ability to accept offers, and because academia is far from welcoming to people with family responsibilities.  Turns out I've had a fully searchable wedding website up the whole time.  My name is common and I'm sure I'm worrying needlessly, but it's just one more thing that I'm feeling bad about."

steps to install: download the file above (if you're using chrome, make sure you save it as winapp2.ini and not winapp2.ini.txt - this only seems to affect Chrome users though) 

Copy/cut/move it to C:\Program Files\CCleaner (or wherever you've installed CCleaner, that's the default directory)

Open CCleaner and click Applications, all new entries that are added by winapp2.ini are marked with an asterisk (*) and are disabled by default.

If you scroll to the very bottom of the list, you'll find the Games section. League of Legends, Bugsplat, and Pando are all listed under that section.

In the meantime, Linux came around and filled a niche, and an itch for a lot of people - and yeah, I'm sure a lot of the popularity was anti-corporate a bit, but BSD is more about getting good out there to be used, where GPL is about making it available to everyone (slightly different goals)."

If you only have the points, then searching would be required, possibly with a Quadtree or a cone for bounding.

JonWood007,CallOfDuty,1390632403.0,"All of them are generally decent, although the treyarch ones are generally better as far as campaign goes.

If I had to include my top ones:

1) COD2

2) COD World at War

3) COD Black Ops

General thoughts of all I've played.

COD1: Too archaic. Health packs too rare, and make the game too hard. Kind of lacks polish since it's a 10 year old game nowadays. Grade: F.

COD2: Classic. The game that got me into COD. I think the campaign has aged a bit, but it was amazing at the time. Grade: A.

COD3: Pretty mediocre. Worth playing, but one of the low points of the series. Grade: D

COD4: Interesting change of pace, decent campaign overall. Probably the best of the MW campaigns. Grade: A-

WaW: Amazing. Very epic in my opinion. Probably one of the best. Grade: A

MW2: Pretty fun. I don't think it's one of the best, but nor is it one of the worst. Grade: B

BO1: Great, very epic. Story is a total mind****. Grade: A

MW3: Another low point. It's fun, sure, but the story is just rather boring and uninspired, and much of the campaign just isn't that memorable to me. Grade: C

BO2: Pretty fun. Interesting story, and I like how it can branch off to a degree. Grade: B

Ghosts: Another low point. Not that fun relative to other COD games. I kind of think that the series is becoming intellectually bankrupt at this point. I mean, it's not bad, but quite frankly, it isn't memorable at all to me. Grade: C"

Also, verify that your Uncore is properly set at a non-turbo multiplier.
&gt;**I haven't touched Vccin**, the cache multiplier or voltage, and my RAM is currently clocked at 1333mhz

If you have an unstable VRIN *and continue raising vcore*, you will **never** get stable, while needlessly escalating your vcore. At my vcore for example, I needed about 1.9-1.95VRIN to eliminate 101 BSODs.  To give you some examples of other VRINs that worked for me:

* 1.175 | 1.75
* 1.215 | 1.80
* 1.265 | 1.95 (*Note - I may be able to get away with 1.90, but haven't retested. 1.85 was giving me 101s though)

There is no hard or fast rule (you may need more, you may need less), but if you want to be conservative, you can keep VRIN at 1.5x of vcore. And obviously raise it by 0.05 or 0.1 if you spot a trend of 101s. Likewise, if you have a good chip, your chip will demand less vcore (*and hence less VRIN*). So the point is - you want to be conservative with your VRIN (bump it up) while slowly incrementing your vcore. Old school overclockers (like me) follow the 0.0125/0.025 rule. Obviously there are much finer adjustments available now, but for the initial tweaking stage, this is what I follow.

* 1) Be sure to keep a good log of how you are crashing. It's important to note how it crashed - e.g. hard-lock, black screen (won't wake), BSOD124, 101, or 9c. This makes it easy to spot patterns.

* 2) Be careful in raising Vcore too quickly without bumping VRIN. It should be easy to diagnose if you've been tracking your BSODs though - as the trend will make this obvious :p

* 3) I wouldn't be lazy about reapplying TIM - just get it done and over with haha."

If your goal is to be able to run three copies of any card, that may be the way to go.  A second core, on the other hand, is good if you want to build multiple decks without switching key cards back and forth (in which case you may still wind up wanting extra copies of certain cards).

I spent about $60 total to get two copies of each 1x card, and one copy of each 2x card.  A bit more than a second core, but I got exactly what I wanted without a bunch of excess cards I wouldn't use.  Cheaper than getting three core sets if you want to have three of everything.

Of course, there are only a handful of 1x cards, so two cores are probably sufficient. And two cores plus one ebay set of the 1x cards wouldn't be that much more than what I paid, and that way you'd have three of everything plus extras of everything but the 1x cards for multiple-deck building.

iagox86,netsec,1390633276.0,"Out of curiosity, what's '!' actually do? I saw a bunch of floating point stuff and backed away slowly. I know it did a test and checked for parity, but that's about as far as I got.

It seems like it'd be *possible* to do it with just '+' operations, you'd just have to arrange for the index to become a negative value that pointed nicely to the global offset table. Something else that would have made it challenging would be DEP - using the calculator to build a proper stack frame, then overwriting the return address with a return to an xchg or something that would move rsp to the proper place.

But for a 100-level challenge, I think this was the right difficulty. :)

The reason I used C is because of floating point. My other exploits are ruby, but I didn't know how to get the proper 64-bit double value in ruby, whereas in C I could just use memcpy. I'm sure it's possible, especially if I took the time to re-learn how floating point encoding works, but I didn't want to do that if I didn't have to. Looking at your exploit, I didn't even consider that pack() could do it, but in hindsight that's so obvious. Derp. :)

I look forward to hearing your comments on gitsmsg/fuzzy! gitsmsg was super cool, basically bypassing aslr/dep/relro/etc. Took me wayyyy too much time. For fuzzy, I definitely didn't fuzz. I decrypted it, and changed the 'run function' function to basically a mov/call so I could run and debug the decrypted code. After seeing the exploit, I realized that that was unnecessary.

Fuzzy took me way too long, because I was busy trying to cram shellcode into the histogram without crashing the application, and writing shellcode that's mostly &gt;'\x80' was tough.

My biggest complaint about fuzzy was that the key's filename changed to 'key.txt', so my open/read/write shellcode didn't work and I had to change to a loader/reverse shell. But I did it the hard way.

Anyway, you'll see full details soon! I hope to post them on Monday and Tuesday. gitsmsg is ready to go, and fuzzy is half-way written.

Great challenge! I'm glad I didn't make it to Shmoocon ;)"

EDIT:  Once you buy this complete you will only need to replace parts as needed (Deck, Bearings, Wheels, etc.).  You don't have to buy a complete every time you want a new board, just for your first.  If you buy quality brands you won't have to worry so much about replacing stuff.  "

tylerpoppe,CFB,1390633511.0,You sir are a good man (or woman) (or both).
michaelnoir,AskReddit,1390633514.0,"Well. We know what the Nazis wanted, in their own words. ""A Thousand Year Reich"". This was supposed to be the continuation of the 1st Reich, the Holy Roman Empire, and the 2nd Reich, the German empire under Bismarck. They wanted a ""new European order"". Now, there have been many realignments and restructuring of states in European history. It's hard to say how much they envisaged this realignment as a ""Utopia"", and not just a new phase in German history, a renewal of the German past with new features. I must say that the Nazi propaganda that I have seen (Hitler's speeches, propaganda films) do not seem all that ""Utopian"" in intent. Instead, their chief quality seems to be fanatical nationalism. 

The Nazis were not naive enough to want ""the elimination of all other peoples"". Instead, the Germans were supposed to dominate Europe, reconquer and occupy their former territories, and form alliances with the other fascist or fascist-friendly regimes which prevailed in Italy, Spain, and a few other countries. The other ethnic groups of Europe, such as the Slavs, were supposed to be a sort of subject race to provide labour for the Reich. These policies were more pragmatic in intent, and don't really strike me as Utopian dreams. 

I do think it confuses the issue somewhat to rely too heavily on works of fiction for an understanding of totalitarianism. 

As for the claim that eugenics is uniquely a ""progressive"" idea, or uniquely a feature of progressive movements, I think that's clearly not true. It's true that some progressives were advocates of eugenics, but can the social darwinist theorists of early 20th century America really be called ""progressives""? Most of them were believers in capitalistic business, and that economic life echoed the animal kingdom, so if a business went bankrupt and put workers out of work, this was a good and ""natural"" thing, because a weak entity had perished in the struggle for survival, and a fitter business had become successful. This usually went hand in hand with racism in the world scene, the idea that Anglo-Saxon Protestants must dominate the world. Can capitalist industrialists like Ford and Rockefeller really be called ""progressives""? 

I don't know if I agree with you that ""eugenics was the centre of Nazi ideology"". I think the centre of Nazi ideology was nationalism. Eugenics and social darwinism were tools they used, to ""purify the race"", to rid the Volk of impure elements. This is a radical nationalist belief, a reactionary one, not a progressive one. 

They may have used some methods, associated at some time or another with some who were progressives, but this does not make them progressives. I believe that that's a myth that has been put about by the current American right, embarrassed by their family resemblance to the Nazis. 

Also, I think that Adorno and Horkheimer are full of shit. One can argue against their thesis in multiple ways. 

One is to point out that the major Enlightenment philosophers were not narrow nationalistic xenophobes, but came close to being internationalists in outlook. Roussea, Hume, Voltaire, were not racists and fanatical nationalists but what would today be called internationalists and humanists. There is no way to get Nazism from the Enlightenment unless you totally reverse its values, which is I think what Adorno is suggesting, that by a ""negative dialectic"" they took the scientific instrumentalism of the Enlightenment and combined it with pesudo-scientific racism, and thereby unleashed destruction. 

It's not a theory that holds much water. For one thing, nationalism is not a thing of the 18th century and the Enlightenment, but a phenomenon of the 19th century and the Romantic movement. The favourite Nazi philosopher, however much they misunderstood him, was Nietzsche, a man of the nineteenth century and not an Enlightenment figure. One was supposed to ""think with the blood"", to sacrifice everything for the Volk, to be subsumed within it. These are not Enlightenment values at all. 

There are unfortunately not many good defences of the Enlightenment out there, but I would mention Francis Wheen's ""How Mumbo-Jumbo Took Over the World"" for one, and Chomsky's ""Government in the Future"" for another. These both contain good refutations of the Adorno thing.

Also, if one posits as a theory that the forces unleashed by the Enlightenment and the French Revolution led ultimately to the gas chambers of Auschwitz, then one is putting oneself in the strange position of being, by implication, in favour of the ancien regimes of Europe, and the stifling superstition and ignorance and oppression that prevailed in the old monarchies of Europe before 1789. That is quite enough reason, for me, to defend the Enlightenment and Enlightenment ideals, which, by the way, also contributed to the establishment of the American republic. (I presume you're of that persuasion). 

I do think you're right about the ancient Greeks though, and about Plato. That is one source of fascism. But that only underlines my point that the Nazis were reactionary and not progressive, that they were harking back to a mythical past, not trying to progress. Lycurgus of Sparta is actually more germane to the discussion than Plato, and again, this has little to do with Utopianism and more to do with racial nationalism, which is not the same thing.

Let's face it, COD is often neglected to us PC gamers. We have to deal with crap like bad optimization for no apparent reason and crappy p2p matchmaking a lot of the time. BF games are demanding, but generally have the graphics to back up the need for the horse power. They're also a bit better executed and have dedicated servers.

If, say, a theoretical COD4 style game were released compared to a battlefield game, I'd say both are about as good, just different. COD really does have good game play when it's actually not botched in one way or another. Compared to BF it's pretty much apples and oranges, preference, yada yada. Most of my comparisons are based on the fact that COD ports are often pretty disappointing. Even my COD loving friend who got the games on PC recently was disappointed. "

This is the image: http://i.imgur.com/dJF1kDe.jpg

It brings up a point that I've thought for a while. Embittered guys end up this way because of an expectation of justice or fairness.

""If I do X, Y, and Z for this girl, then she *has* to like me. It's only fair.""

Thankfully, I haven't gotten myself stuck in that specific situation, but I remember many instances where my own misguided expectations of ""justice"" and ""fairness"" made me bitter as hell.

I was bitter at MIT for rejecting me when I applied back in high school. I did everything I thought I could. Minimized grade dilution by non-AP 4.0s. Retook SATs 3-4 times. Volunteered. Joined clubs/teams and helped win local competitions. I don't think I had the time nor energy to have done an ounce more.

All of that meant nothing when I sat in front of the interviewer. I had no idea how to sell myself.

When I got the rejection letter, it felt like all that work went down the drain. It didn't feel ""fair"". I thought I had checked all the boxes, all of the requisites to get what I ""rightfully deserved"" from MIT.

Nope. 

I ended up getting bitter towards a lot of people. ""Maybe if I was a different race.""

""Maybe if I was a girl.""

""If I just had a disability.""

""Why did HE get to go in? His SAT score was only 95% percentile! What the fuck?""

""Fuck those entitled sons of bitches.""

It would have helped to know at the time that *there is no justice in the world*. No one owed me anything. It's all very transactional. MIT is not a charity. Gotta think of how I enrich the school, and what I bring to them. Not what they owe to me if I successfully finish a checklist of tasks. Just like that checklist in the picture. It's worthless.

Having sat at the other side of the table, in the role of an interviewer, I know now that I failed because of that misguided ""justice mentality"". I had no real plans or intentions beyond getting into that school. MIT has no use for people that don't contribute to a future that lifts their own name/reputation."

There are three Ls in the code.

Could it be Left 4 Dead 3?  No, there are no Ds in the code.

DotA 3?  Again, no Ds in the code.

Portal 3?  No Ps in the code.

Team Fortress 3?  No Fs in the code.

Half-Life 3 is the only game that it could be.  The code has both an H and an L.

SublethalDose,math,1390634161.0,"Complex analysis is freaky and beautiful.  I also loved topology and set theory.  

One field that I underestimated during college and only appreciated much later was applied mathematics.  The introductory linear algebra and differential equations classes at my university were taught for the benefit of non-math majors.  The beautiful math was buried under tedious computations, I was bored off my ass, and as a result I never took any applied math beyond those initial courses.  If I were to go back in time, I would try to find applied math classes that were taught rigorously *as math* and not just to prepare engineering majors for the computations they had to do in their upper-level classes.  You should talk to math professors and older math majors to find out what your options are.

Also, find out who the smartest students' favorite teachers are.  A good teacher can make any subject interesting, so taking a course with a good teacher can make a big difference in how interested you are, how hard you work, and how much you ultimately get out of the course.  Especially if you are planning on continuing your education in math:  if you have a choice between class A taught by a great professor and class B by a mediocre professor, then take class A now.  Who knows, class B might be taught by someone new next year.

The only stereotypical Jewish thing my mother (unknowingly) did was she for the longest time was pushing me to pursue a career as a nurse. Something I really didn't want to do and finally she shut up about it. 

Another thing she has down-pat is the Jewish guilt. Trust me, Catholics have NOTHING on guilt when it comes to Jews:

I had some very similar experiences (which are scattered throughout my post history; I really don't feel up to getting into the details right now). I don't think it was all my parents, though. I go back and forth playing the blame game and have for years -- how much of it was my parents? How much of it was the crazy-ass shrinks? How much of it was legitimately me? Because to be fair, I did have some anger issues as a kid that cropped up before I was ever put on any psych meds or abused  -- as far as I can remember, anyway. Key phrase there. But then I don't remember much from before then, period. I think it was a little of all three but I can never settle on how much each party was to blame.

Anyway, what is *totally and utterly infuriating* to me is the fact that this is **never** discussed in any of my classes. My peers and I are the up-and-coming mental health professionals who are being trained with **nothing** being taught about how to look out for Munchausen's by proxy and just plain flat-out lying parents. If we even acknowledge that abuses in the system exist, it's in terms of large hospitals in the era before deinstitutionalization (tl;dr definition: less state hospitals and such today, replaced by fractured community mental health centers; people who fall through the cracks are commonly homeless and/or in and out of jails), abuses -- mainly neglect -- in the jails today (because they're really not meant to be mental institutions), and it's all talked about in this incredibly dispassionate academic way which I find to just be adding insult to injury.

And don't get me wrong, it's good that abuses are being acknowledged *at all*, but it really gets to me how little it's talked about. How can people combat it if they don't know it exists?

And don't even get me started on the fucking glorification of the Baker Act (Florida's law re: involuntary commitment) like it's this fucking awesome thing that saves people's lives by taking away their liberty and sticking them in a fucking cage for days. I was locked up in the loony bin when I was a teen and it made me *so much worse* than I was before. And again, it's treated with this academic coldness that I just find so completely insulting. And look up the Rosenhan studies (*On Being Sane in Insane Places* and there's follow-ups after that one IIRC) if you have time. Doctors don't even fucking *know* you're not crazy, and once you or someone else tells them you have symptoms of a mentally ill person, their confirmation bias frequently keeps them from realizing you don't. It's completely horrifying and I'm appalled that, years and years after I got locked up, people are still just as clueless about the large damaging potential of psychiatric abuse.

**tl;dr: No one in my program talks about child psychiatric abuse, and only barely about adult psychiatric abuse, and I rant with increasing rage and incoherence about how it pisses me off. Probable TW.**

DuneBug,java,1390634234.0,"I'd consider myself a mid level Dev and I don't find your test intimidating. I also apologize at some of the downvotes you've been getting since they simply seem to indicate dislike.

Your test is kind of shitty to read. I don't like coming across that kind of stuff during an interview. Yes a Dev will need to read shitty code, but doing it under pressure isn't much fun. Some extra comments might help.

I expect people at the midlevel to know what a linked list is, and what a hashmap is. Deriving what a linked hash map is shouldn't be too hard from that, even if you've never used it. Especially with languages like Perl and php or JavaScript that use associative arrays extensively... The value of that data structure should be clear.

As long as you're lenient how they come to the conclusion to the problem... I think the test is reasonable. If they just give up... That says a lot doesn't it?

As for the eclipse check... I think every java dev puts that on their résumé.... Maybe they're fibbing but they probably figure they know the basics of the ide and its not hard to learn on the job... But MORE importantly... Not everyone uses hotkeys. Oh I use them... Ctrl,shift,r/t is my workhorse... But I also play competitive StarCraft and other games. I navigate windows without the mouse when I can. Ive had lots of experiences with other people showing them the type finder and other shortcuts and it just doesn't click for them. 

I doubt thats a big deal for you...just sayin.

The interesting thing about a test is... Its probably a good test to find other people like you. If you're open to more diversity then you might need a different test.

Also, my company has been recruiting heavily and I've been very surprised by some otherwise smart candidates who have missed some questions I thought to be very obvious and basic... I guess what I've learned from that is I'm shitty at judging whether or not people can code.

(Some questions I've asked, which are terrible I've learned)
Is java pass by reference or pass by value? / can you write a swap function in java?

How does garbage collection work? When will an object be collected assuming there are no references to it anymore?

Write a method to reverse a link list.

...
One more thing... There are a lot of bad devs out there... Or at least it seems that way because they can't answer pretty standard interview questions like what package you'd find ArrayList or name two collection data structures in java.

4. MS could pull a Red Hat or Oracle and give their product away for free, but for a company as huge as Microsoft it would take many years to make that shift. You can't just release all your code and then say ""we're doing only consulting and training now"". That sort of thing would take a decade, maybe more."

It's called getting older. You get more power to fix things but you feel more helpless because the problems seem bigger every day. At the same time, you learn that life goes on and there is still good in the world. 

“When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping."" - Mr Rogers

It's a matter of perspective.


&gt;Are you saying that using task forces to intervene and rescue children is impossible?

Impossible? No. Difficult? Yes. 

The costs are certain to be high whereas the benefits are iffy. Thus, I don't see it as a viable solution, only a mitigator.

History has shown that intervention fails more often than it succeeds; yet, we also cannot say how often we have failed by not trying. From a moral standpoint, many would argue that it's important to try to help, even if it's not statistically rational, because the lives you save when you succeed make it worth it. It's one of the big questions of our times and there has been a lot of scholarship on the subject, which I'm sure you can find if you're interested. For me personally, I don't find the question of what we *should* do to be as relevant as what we *can* do. I have a Realist view of international affairs. Governments have not shown themselves to be particularly effective at being morally consistent with their policies, so I don't see it as a useful objective. 


&gt;Charitys don't seem to be doing shit to help. We need direct intervention.

Note that I said charity is the most *concrete* way you can help. I agree that it is not particularly effective. But it is what you, as an individual, can do. "

1) Not everything that resembles Christianity is bad. I'm through with rebelling against the religion of my land, so I don't have a knee-jerk reaction against any similarities with it.

2) I never said sila wasn't affirming and compassionate. In fact, I expressed the opposite when I said I do not feel shame, guilt, or loss of self-worth when I acknowledge I fall short. I just accept responsibility and move on. That's what is so beneficial about the teaching of karma--you don't have to wallow in despair because you can always change it. It's impermanent. I don't know what is preachy about that.

3) Most importantly, you assume we are always aware of when we are making excuses. Oh how wrong this is. Therapy has shown me that we are *very* good at tricking ourselves to the point where we don't conciously pick up on it. Some things are intuitive. Some things are better understood as we mature. But to say we are aware of all the things is wrong. This is why we have elders, teachers, etc: because there will come a time when an outiside, more knowledgable perspective can accurately show us how wrong we are.

Also, saying Shakyamuni was basically just a smart guy for his time is a misunderstanding of what he accomplished. In fact, I really only talk about him in the past tense in this subreddit because I just know that someone will have this buddhist-y quote about how the Buddha said he was not a god ready and waiting for me.

Does that mean I make myself feel sick when I think about it that way? Sure, a bit. Unfortunately without going into it too much there's not much that can be done about it. Anything that can be done will be minimally effective. 

The only things we can do are merely to make ourselves feel morally happy about the situation but are fairly futile in the grand schemes - and that's to try to buy from ethical companies or buy ethical products. Example: Tuna, it's being overfished. I do enjoy it and no, I don't swear off it completely but I've started to stop buying it canned [from the supermarket](well, that's if I ever wanted it anyway), and try to only have it when I have sushi which is only occasionally. And Apple? They're unethical in so many ways I think and yet if they were capable of producing a half decent product that wasn't overpriced I might, as a tech geek, buy something from them, yet that in itself is part of what I find unethical about apple."

kellykebab,funny,1390635340.0,"I'm writing to respond to your point about male &amp; female friendships.

For men with more typically male-oriented, technical interests, the likelihood of carrying on the kind of jargon-heavy, and possibly aggressive or debate-oriented conversation with a woman that they're used to with guy friends is pretty slim. Not impossible, just unlikely.

Not saying women aren't highly intelligent. Of course they are, but for the most part, they speak in feels not thinks.

And though they might appreciate witnessing dark/crude humor, few women can match men in actually riffing on a vulgar topic. The professional lady comedians I've seen who 'work dirty' virtually always come across as forced and awkward. Again, there are exceptions, but this has been my overall experience.

I like women. I like talking to them and simply hanging out. But there is *always* a part of my brain that's thinking, ""one day I might get to see her naked and this will all have been worth it."" Sounds awful, but that's my thought process. To take a real-life example, I'm already losing interest in a new female friend I've known for a couple months only because we hooked up once and it was just so-so. If I'm still talking to her in 6 months, I'll be surprised.

In general, I won't refuse to chat with women who aren't totally beautiful, but there has to be at least a shred of genuinely sexual attraction for me to really engage with the person. 

Besides making a girl laugh with the possibility that it will create attraction and *maybe* sharing interests (although again, I find that women do not approach their interests the way I and other men do), my reasons for conversing with female friends or potential friends is fairly limited.   

I don't think my perspective is all that unusual either."
