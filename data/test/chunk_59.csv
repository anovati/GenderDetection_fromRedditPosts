candydaze,EngineeringStudents,1390205570.0,"In answer to your big question - I think a lot of women aren't given the chance to decide if they want to be engineers. Speaking from experience, the moment a young woman starts thinking about engineering, she gets dissuaded from it, even if the people doing the dissuading don't mean it. For example, ""it's very maths heavy"", or ""but there are so many boys in engineering!"". Many people don't perceive engineering as a female thing, and in doing so, they make it seem like engineering is going to be more trouble than it's worth, even before you take into account the crazy amount of coursework.

steve496,49ers,1390205735.0,"Boldin will be a little cheaper - he's not getting any younger.  I'd guess we could get him for something like 2 years and $9 or 10 million (as opposed to the $6 million he got this year).  This is not to say that we can afford that, either, but it'd save a bit of money.

Whitner I'd say is second only to Boldin in terms of priority to retain, and he's probably in that $4-5 million AAV range as well.  We might have room for him depending on what other moves we make

Dawson, I expect would be happy to return on a similar salary - $2.5 million or so.  The problem is: how much longer do we want to keep paying that much when
a) We have a bunch of big extensions coming,
b) A rookie kicker would make less than that over the 4 year duration of his contract, and
c) We have a billion draft picks next year?

Not saying this is the year - Harbaalke seem to like their veteran kickers - but sooner or later I'd expect us to try to get younger and cheaper at kicker - just like we did at long snapper last year."

HorrendousRex,aww,1390206235.0,"I have a friend who studies great whites, and used to be one of the on-call scientists that fisheries would call when they accidentally caught a great white in a net. She told me that a lot of the juvenile specimens that they got came from pregnant sharks that were caught in the net, because the sharks would abruptly and traumatically abort their calves in order to free up more energy for an escape.

Sometimes the grown-up shark would be released, but more often they would die in the net (or perhaps be killed directly by the fishermen - something that is highly illegal but the scientists needs the fisheries cooperation so they don't call them out on it except in egregious situations). But the group always had a bunch of calves to study due to the escape-abortions. Kinda weird.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1390206436.0,"&gt; Christ, women want to find a guy who will take charge and lead her through life.

I'm not advocating of changing our language at all. Not even slightly. But I just want to point out how language can be a huge barrier. What I have quoted is a cherry picked quote. As an outsider reading what you just typed seems misogynistic. In fact, it really does sound misogynistic for what it's worth. It's understandable why people would look at that quote and think ""TRP people hate women!!!!!!"" It's a completely logical response. 

But, we, as analytic men, see it slightly differently. So let me rephrase what you said in a more PC manner: 

&gt; Women don't want an abuser. She wants a man to be in charge, but not because of the threat of violence. She wants a real man. A man that gets things done and is in charge because they are a leader. A woman wants a guy with things happening in his life in which she can come along for the ride. She doesn't want direct forced submission, but she wants to be a follower of a good captain by her personal will. No woman wants to follow a loser, because every woman wants to ride by the side of a winner. 

I don't see anything sexist about this mentality at all. What's wrong with trying to become a great man who leads the relationship? What's wrong with being a leader? Sure, many women can be leaders - and that's fucking great and normal. But at the end of the day, most women want their man to be their rock, their leader, and their protector. Does that make us misogynist? According to feminists, yes.

kn33,explainlikeimfive,1390206553.0,"Thought I'd clean up the answers.  

Step 1: Prevention  
Someone mentioned that hospitals are connected to more than one substation, so if one fails, the other will provide.  

Step 2: Continuous  
If both power stations go out, then they have a UPS, or Uninterruptible Power Supply. These are batteries that the power goes through instead of straight to the device. They work to both smooth spikes and fill in when the power goes out, so there is never a stop. Depending on the budget of the hospital, these will either be installed for just critical devices, or for the whole building and critical devices.  

Step 3: Long term  
The UPS are just a battery, and will probably only last about a half hour, and they don't want to get anywhere near that limit, so as soon it is detected that power is out, they cut off the main line, and start the generators. This process takes about 15 seconds, and happens as soon as power goes out. The UPS is fed power as if it is coming from the main line. This will last as long as the place still has fuel for the generators. If this is standard gasoline, then they probably have large reserves and, as long as it isn't the apocalypse, they can go get more. More likely, however, is that it is propane. Then they will have to have a lot of tanks, and as soon as it is out, they are back on the UPS. Nobody wants that, which is why they have...  

Step 4: Priority in Restoration  
Hospitals are given priority when work begins on the power. They are the first to get power back in any outage. This should be quick enough that the hospital doesn't use it's entire reserve of fuel, but if it does, they have...  

Evacuation  
This is only in case a part needs to be ordered for the power or it just can't be done in the amount of time the generators afford. This is why all life-critical devices have batteries. Patients are moved to a working hospital using a pre-arranged evacuation plan, with the ones that require power the most and have the least amount of battery left first. This is a last resort, as it causes overcrowding in other hospitals and if there is an emergency causing this, then they will be crowded as it is and a hospital may have to search to find one that has space."

From there, assuming a third movie of similar length (Probably 3 hours for the extended version. That's what number 1 is, and while two hasn't been released on DVD to *have* an extended cut, the theatrical version is very close to the same length as the first), and using OPs copy of the book (266 pages) you'd easily be able to read it in the length of the trilogy.

You mentioned reasons why you think Haslett didn't get a fair shake. Since you never offered evidence in the *one* conversation we had before, I was hoping you would this time. With evidence, it would explain why he wasn't given a fair shake... thus, being something positive. Why is it so out of line to ask for evidence of your claim?

&gt; I did give you everything you need in all our previous discussions. 

Where? All I've seen in any of your interaction with me has been either:

* Insulting me
* Complaining that it is off-topic
* Repeating a claim, but without evidence
* Complaining that it is ""not it"" when I investigate and offer data on whatever you could possibly mean by defense taking the vast majority of ""the hit""

Some of them are alright, but the Mike/Rachel love arc is pretty pitiful, as much as I enjoy them as characters and want them to be together, the pacing of their relationship arc is just average. And don't even get me started on the fucking cat lawsuit part. It was an interesting concept, but they didn't do it well enough, and it felt so pathetic alongside the serious main arc.

Authiel,AskReddit,1390206959.0,"I don't quite *despise* it, since ""despise"" is a strong word, but. . . **The Desolation of Smaug**.

Critics are giving it a much more favorable rating than the first Hobbit film, which isn't surprising, since it's essentially all action; it's entertaining to watch. That works well for some stories, like Marvel, since action is what Marvel does -- but not Tolkien's work, with tons of characters who could be expanded on and a lot of material to work with.

My issue isn't the padding or the lack of fidelity. It's the fact that it felt like they didn't know what to do for most of the movie, so they wasted our time with constant orc attacks and a hamfisted romance arc that took away from the story and, when you think about it, characterization done in The Lord of the Rings. They could have used that time for something else, like -- oh, I don't know -- Beorn? Thranduil? You know, characters in the book that were kind of thrown aside and given minimal screen time? I was hoping they'd give Legolas some pretty legit characterization and I was seriously disappointed. (I think his script was just a picture of Grumpy Cat with the added note, ""Just do this the whole time and then get mad when someone makes you bleed your own blood."") And, speaking of Legolas, I need to ask a question a lot of us in the Tolkien fandom have been wondering for a long time: *""Where the hell is his mom?""* Considering they seemed to be griping for female characters, you would've thought that the Queen of Mirkwood would have been added in, since she would have logically been there -- or, at least, it could have been at least mentioned why she wasn't. (Tolkien says nothing about her, so she's just as much as a blank slate as Tauriel.) Oh, right! Phillippa Boyens doesn't want to write ""someone's wife"" because wives can't be their own characters! Fantastic. What a progressive feminist move. Right up there with saddling your ""strong female character"" with the archetypal romantic arc, nonsensical writing, and cheesy dialogue. Good goin'.

Oh, and we got rehashed stuff from Lord of the Rings. Aethlas, complete with the copied-and-pasted dialogue of, ""Aye, it's a weed,"" and using it to save someone from a ""morgul weapon."" (Frodo got stabbed in LotR, and Kili literally took an arrow to the knee.) Oh, and there's the whole concept of ~~the Arkenstone~~ ~~Anduril~~ some magical kingly object that will make ~~Dwarven~~ ~~dead~~ armies fight for you. (Side note: Oh, only kings can use aethlas? And it took Elrond AND Arwen to heal Frodo from the morgul blade? But how will we ever have our ever-so-touching Arwen-esque healing scene that way!?)

The healing scene and the last 30 minutes made me cringe.

Nope. . . I don't *despise* that film. Because the acting saved it. Particularly Cumberbatch; Smaug was the biggest saving grace of that film."

Crackerjacksurgeon,TheRedPill,1390207384.0,"&gt;Would this be acceptable to you?

Yes. Strict monogamy enforced by social pressure is what civilization is built on. 

Casual sex is not worth it in that universe, or even relevant. (IMO). 

I can get progeny (guaranteed to be mine, since women don't sleep around  in this hypothetical) and sex (because I have a loyal wife that knows if I leave her for not putting out, she's SOL, because no man will want a divorced woman). What else do I need from a LTR, given that casual sex doesn't happen? 

Variety be damned - an orgasm's an orgasm, and 'loyal mother of my children that I fucked when she was young pussy' trumps 'new young pussy' in my book. 

&gt;Would it be acceptable to redpillers in general?

I don't speak for anyone but me.

Daveezie,OutOfTheLoop,1390207964.0,"Replied to the wrong comment:

My money is part of my private affairs. If I fail, it is not on my fellow man to make me success. No one is accountable for what I do, except me. If I don't make enough money to eat, I starve, if I can't afford my rent, I live under a bridge. The other citizens of the US should be under no obligation to make sure I am housed, because what would be the point?

The government should not tell me that I have a moral obligation to feed those whose choices made them unable to feed themselves. I don't feel beholden to someone because they couldn't make the most out of the hand life dealt them.

I have no one to blame for my station in life but myself. No one has anyone to blame for their station in life but themselves. The government should not be telling me that if I fail, it's all fine and dandy because someone else will pick up my slack.

I don't have a very good job, but is it the governments job to make up for the fact that I wasted my potential? No, I am a goddamned adult, and my decisions are mine, and mine alone.

If you have a degree and can't find a job, it's the economy, not because you just weren't good enough. The government shouldn't be responsible for that. You aren't suddenly going to become the best candidate for a job because the government said so.

I am conservative, which means that I want the government to handle a minimum of things and let the people handle the rest. I don't want to pay for someone who won't do for themselves, and I don't want someone paying for me because I didn't make it. You can't force charity, that is called stealing."

I had a reason why I didn't choose kung fu: karate was an extra lesson at our school, so I thought: let's sign up for this. Best discision ever. I started joining a kempokarate dojo, where training was way harder and more rewarding than what I did at school. I learned a lot about other styles too, because our teacher did a lot of different martial arts, like boxing, ninjitsu, taekwondo, pencack silat, judo and karate. I am much more confident and happier than before.

Tl;dr:  Got inspired by avatar and other tv-shows, joining a karate school was one of the best disisions in my life.

It is much more likely that if someone is lying to you they will not break eye contact because they subconsciously need to know if you believed their lie. This goes against the Western belief that a liar will break eye contact in guilt.

Your deal sounds pretty fair to me.  I have a ball spinner so to me the pads are nice but most people I know don't have the spinner so I would think that you could almost ditch giving them the pads, save a little on your cost and lower the cost of the whole package.  Maybe you can give em a free bottle of cleaner and maybe if they are a member they get 5% purchases or something.  

I mean if you are concerned about customer base, cut people you see all the time a break every now and again.  Maybe drop the, ""You don't owe me anything for the resurface this time, just let people know who I am."" line.

Webmasters cannot keep up with the volume of user-generated content, and expecting to enforce tagging standards in the user community equivalent to that of rule34 or g.e-hentai seems like a thankless task.

There's basically two ways the AirPort Express can work. It can either bridge the ethernet network to WiFi as if it wasn't even there (sorta).

Or it can behave like a client on the ethernet network and then share that connection out to your room-wide wifi network like your MacBook did last semester.

Either way might or might not work for various reasons. But you do know the latter method worked recently.

The way you choose this is in the AirPort Utility, then open your AirPort Express (having joined its wifi network) and click on the Wireless tab.

If Network Mode is ""Create a wireless network"" then the APX acts basically as a computer from the perspective of the ethernet network. (do you need to give it a DHCP client ID or register its MAC address? These are both archaic forms of access control that might be in use).

The other option to consider is ""Off"". That means the AirPort basically pumps along whatever comes in the ethernet port over wifi, and vice versa.

It might be worth playing with both options for a while.

Take notice of what IP address all the hardware is getting.

In bridging mode, the AirPort won't have an IP address at all, but your MacBook or other devices connected to it should have an IP address similar to what's provided to other devices on campus (definitely starts with the same number before the first dot, and maybe the second too).

If you set it up to ""Create a wireless network"" then the AirPort Express should be assigned an IP address like that, but everything connecting to it should have a link-local IP address like 192.168.x.x or some other options depending on what you set in the Network tab.

(I often use the 172.16.x.x block since it's so unusual and then I know it's definitely my router).

Keep an eye out for 169.x.x.x addresses. That's what a DHCP client will assign to itself, with a random sub block when it can't find any server to give out a lease. That means something's not talking to some other thing."

Those people want low bullet drop so they use the SRR.

Rate of fire is nice, but most of the time it is not the determining factor in winning a firefight with a sniper. If you're up close, you switch to your pistol instead of rechambering, and if you're far that time is eaten up by dodging and lining up your shot.

I was just pointing out the similarity of the trajectories with the 338 and SV98. I will always prefer the SV98 just because it has a bigger magazine.

It was the first week of class. Another kid lightly bopped me on the head with one of the bolts, then told me to do it to him. Guess who the teacher saw actually do it?

My punishment was to spend the rest of kindergarten having to sit at a desk while everyone else had recess. At the time, I was too young and riddled with what would probably get diagnosed as ADD these days to care, but a yearlong ban on recess seems excessive.

clairebones,AskWomen,1390210214.0,"This has come up in so many threads recently that I think I'm starting to bore my SO by talking about it so often :P So I'll go for some main points and expand in any further comments that ask for it.

* Little girls are encouraged to play with dolls, and kitchen sets, while little boys get chemistry sets and meccano and Lego and such. This has gotten worse recently with the release of pink lego (specially designed for girl-buildings) and pink kinder eggs and such.

* Girls in school are often encouraged to concentrate on English and History and Drama, whereas boys are encouraged in science, maths, etc.

* When a girl finds STEM subjects too hard people say 'Don't worry, it's not for you, it is harder for girls, just try this instead' whereas boys in the same situation get 'You can do it, it's not that hard, just a little extra work and you'll know it, etc'

* There are very few female role models in STEM areas and the few that exist often get their accomplishments minimised by others (e.g. the whole Ada Lovelace thing)

* When women try to go in to STEM many of them (thankfully not all) have [experiences like mine here](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1vbu4m/programmer_privilege_as_an_asian_male_computer/ceqxjts) which, for a lot of women, is often to put them off and make them change their degree."

AriMaeda,AskReddit,1390210256.0,"The leads dry up. These companies have you start with friends and family, who are a lot more receptive to the pitches because they want to help you.

But when you're calling friends-of-friends and friends of those friends, you become as familiar as a telemarketer, and your success rate will drop off significantly. Most people aren't willing to drop hundreds of dollars on knives. You're pushing a hard product to sell, and Vector Marketing is selling *you*.

bubbish,AskMen,1390210298.0,"I can't tell you how many times I've been where you are. I always seem to bounce back, only to lose my funk again a few months later. The trick is to find ways out of it, and for every time that happens to me I normalize myself faster.

I'll be the first one to assert this - having a life that looks great on paper is by no means a guarantee of contentment or happiness. You'll hear genuine jealousy and admiration from other people who see how well you're doing, while in turn you look at them and can't see how the hell they seem so happy when they're not doing as good?

I can't say I've found the reason this happens but I have a few good pointers for the cure;

* Allow yourself true solitude from time to time. Depression is a biological function with a clear purpose - and that purpose is being alone for a while to straighten out your thoughts. A constantly connected smartphone and checking reddit/facebook/insta every 2 hours is a good way to disturb this natural process.

* Read a lot. Reading might seem like any other escape from reality (games, drugs, netflix) but it'll in fact do you a ton of good. Coming back from a good book brings with it a newly awakened intellect with new questions and thoughts that, if nothing else, will distract you from your conundrum.

* Sleep ~~a lot~~ enough.

* Exercise with clear goals. Progressive and clear **short-term** goals which can help you feel the energizing caress of achievement.

* Probably most important of all, speak of your feelings and thoughts to someone you trust and love. Someone who genuinely takes time to listen to you and doesn't try to fix your problems - only listens.

EDIT: I can see how my statement about depression can be misconstrued as a dismissal of a real issue. Let me assure you that it is not, I realize of course that heavy depression requires external help and probably will worsen if you allow yourself too much solitude. Now that I have this little disclaimer though, I'd like to point out that for lighter bouts of depression like OP seems to have, I really believe that letting yourself sometimes be alone and removed from external pressures and values, can do a lot of good for your outlook on life."

Life-in-Death,vegan,1390210700.0,"&gt;Research the new dosage protocols

Yeah, I'm a troll telling people to research new protocols.  HOW SUBVERSIVE OF ME.  

How about laying off of the name calling and insults when you have no idea what you are talking about.  I said *I* take 10,000IU.  Who I responded to takes 4,000, which I said is great.  

&gt; Collectively, the absence of toxicity in trials conducted in healthy adults that used vitamin D dose ≥250 μg/d **(10 000 IU vitamin D3) supports the confident selection of this value as the UL.**

**Yes, 10,000 is the new Upper Limit**

http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/1/6.full


&gt;However, vitamin D toxicity is more likely to develop if you take 40,000 IU/day everyday for 3 months or more.

http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-d/am-i-getting-too-much-vitamin-d/

&gt;John Jacob Cannell, MD, executive director of The Vitamin D Council, notes that the skin makes 10,000 IU of vitamin D after 30 minutes of full-body sun exposure.

&gt;In fact, recent evidence suggests that doses up to 10,000 IU a day do not cause toxicity

http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-d-and-chronic-disease/

&gt;In a small Canadian MS and vitamin D study presented to the American Academy of Neurology meeting in 2009, patients were given increasing doses of vitamin D to determine its safety at high dose. **Apart from finding that high doses were safe (the higher dose group averaged 14,000IU per day** through the study versus 1,000IU for the group treated with standard doses by their doctors), the researchers found that the higher dose group had 2/3 fewer relapses through the course of the study. 

&gt;Vieth and others have shown that in sunny countries the vitamin D levels are at least 100-140nmol/L, and more like 135-225nmol/L, and that a level of 200nmol/L may actually be optimal.25 Others have suggested a level as high as 250nmol/L may be optimal.26 To achieve a level of 100nmol/L requires daily intake of about 4 000IU of vitamin D for people who are not getting any sun. **To get to 140nmol/L needs about 10 000IU a day** in the absence of sunlight.

&gt;It is not possible to get toxicity from vitamin D if it all comes from the sun. Only supplements can potentially produce toxic levels. **The only published toxicity however is from supplements of 40 000IU a day**.23

http://www.overcomingmultiplesclerosis.org/Recovery-Program/Sunlight-and-Vitamin-D/

(You:)
&gt;Either way 10,000 IU is NOT reccomended by ANYONE.  

Okay, tell me more about my life in danger, stupidity and lack of knowledge, please.

Sonnk,HannibalTV,1390210789.0,"It's the sophistication that he portrays, how calm and relaxed he is. This shows just how powerful an actor Mikkelsen is. There were times while watching through Hannibal for the first time, when I noticed little facial twitches, small bits of body language that just screamed at me, it showed that no matter how well you conceal your emotions and how you truly feel, you will always give a little something away.

Of course, as the viewer it's rather easy to pick up on these things, but as someone interacting with Hannibal, in the show, it's almost impossible.

Mikkelsen plays the role of Hannibal perfectly. 

EDIT: Just to elaborate a little further. Mikkelsen plays a different Hannibal than Anthony Hopkins.

You have to remember this is before Hannibal was caught doing anything.. devious. Mikkelsen is allowed to play a character that acts like a normal person, he doesn't act like a psychopath, because around others he isn't.

Whereas with Anthony Hopkins, he was playing a Hannibal that had been caught, he was allowed to show how much of an intelligent psychopath Hannibal was, without any thought of acting 'normal'."

I think it is pretty accurate. "
bleeker_street,Advice,1390210839.0,"Two things: One is medical, the other relationship stuff. 

Medical: so many gynos aren't up to date on the latest research and there is so much misinformation about women's health, some of which is even believed by doctors.  Make sure she's going to a good gyno.  One that isn't just doing a ultrasound or MRI, but is also doing physical exams, pap smears, testing the bacteria and yeast levels.  One who knows about the effects of blocked ducts, or can recommend a good vaginal surgeon if necessary.  Two underdiagnosised/misdiagnosed conditions include yeast build up and mini little cysts in the ducts of the Bartholin's glands, and a smaller/tighter than average fourchette or hymen.  These conditions are treatable, but sadly, of often misdiagnosed as some of emotional or mental issue. Exercises can be useful, but ones that focus on vaginal muscle control and release, and carefully stretching out the vaginal walls and hymen to get them more use to insertion. I would talk to her about her gyno, and make sure there isn't anything that they're missing. 

Relationships wise, I feel for you.  You have to walk this line of making sure she knows you're attracted to her, and love her, and find her sexy as hell, but also not pushing her because that's only going to make her feel guilty or depressed about the impact that this condition (but in her mind she) is having on your sex life. 

Talk to her about intimacy. Do it bluntly, don't hint.   Tell her you don't want to pressure her.  Tell her you don't blame her.  Tell her you want to support her in anyway.  Then talk about how you to can do all kind of other fulfilling sexual activities together like: cuddling, kissing, oral sex, boob jobs, outer-course, humping, hand jobs, using toys, fingering, anal sex, mutual masturbation, frottage, and erotic massage among others I'm sure.  Share fantasies, dress up, use body paints, food, oils, games...laugh.  Make sex fun again.  

By setting a time period, lets say three months, that you both choose to let go of vaginal penetrative sex and only and exclusively and enthusiastically concentrate on all the awesome sexual experiences you can have together you'll help re-establish the sexytimes with positive experiences, and not pain or the pressure she has undoubtedly put herself under. 

If she doesn't masturbate she should start.  You probably should let her figure it out on her own, and then include you when she's ready. This is going to help her develop more of an intimate understanding of her body, and her likes and dislikes.  

In terms of being and staying sexually aroused you'll want to think about if there are medications or other things that are in the way.  If not, you two need to have a discussion about that.  What can you do to please her?  What can she do to please herself, and then you? Again, by talking this out hopefully you two and figure out some of her turn ons and focus on them.  Again if she knows that you aren't even thinking about having vaginal sex, maybe since she knows she can't ""fail"" then she'll get more into the spirit of things. 

It's going to be important from a medical perspective for her to explore her body too, so she can look for patterns.  Does any kind of penetration hurt?  Does girth matter?  Could she in theory be okay with a pencil (don't try that) but not a tampon?  Is the pain only in the back?  Front? lower portion of the vagina, or entire way up? Is the pain sharp? Dull?  Does it hurt more closer to her period or no difference?  All of this is important information toward discovering the cause(s). If her doc isn't taking this into account or isn't asking detailed questions fire them.

 I realize I might sound like a conspiracy theory nut, but honestly vaginal health is something that is underresearched, and the medical community has a long and documented history of telling women it's in their heads if they don't know the answer to a women's health problem. I would strongly consider the possibility that there is something minor, but medical that is at least contributing to the problem.  Please do not leave any rock unturned.  I personally know of cases where a misdiagnosis of vaginismus prevented a woman from having the kind of sex she wanted for over 30 years.  When she finally saw the doctor who was teaching my class all she needed was a simple in clinic procedure and some cream to solve the problem.  She was trying all the relaxing exercises and they didn't do anything, but of course they didn't because that wasn't her primary issue.  

Finally, I know this must have a toll on you.  It would be totally normal and natural for you to need to vent to someone about all of this.  You might feel that it relects somehow on your, or you might get frusterated to the point of anger because you just want to fucking fuck your wife.  That's okay.  Those emotions and thoughts are valid and not wrong.  Sharing them with your wife however, might not be helpful.  In order to support her, you're going to have to find someone, a good friend, professional, whoever, with whom you can work out all of your thoughts and feels that would only make your wife feel under more pressure if you shared them with her.  

I wish you the best.  You can do this together, through other kinds of sex, good medical care, and frank conversations.

I asked my collegues today and they spend about 2h every day doing class related stuff outside of lessons. In school or at home. Once or twice a month they have planning or follow up meetings with subject collegues. In addition to this comes courses, workshops, disciplinary stuff and all the other odds and ends that comes with the job.

I'm not familiar with how a US teacher works, but in Sweden teachers have ""regular hours"", ie they are expected to show up 9-5 regardless of how many lessons they have. In Finland they are expected to show up for lessons and other stuff that requires attendance, otherwise they are free to come and go as they please. "

That is the opposite of the truth.  All vitamin D recommendations are PER DAY.  Winter is when you need the most supplementation or appropriate UV lighting.  

&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as a pandemic. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency is the lack of appreciation that sun exposure in moderation is the major source of vitamin D for most humans. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, and foods that are fortified with vitamin D are often inadequate to satisfy either a child's or an adult's vitamin D requirement

&gt;Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risk of common cancers, autoimmune diseases, hypertension, and infectious diseases

&gt;In the absence of adequate sun exposure, at least 800–1000 IU vitamin D3/**d** may be needed to achieve this in children and adults. Vitamin D2 may be equally effective for maintaining circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D when given in physiologic concentrations.

schudder,belgium,1390212108.0,"As far as I know, doing the test with a translator is indeed the only option you have if you don't speak any of the official languages. You're also responsible for paying this interpreter, I think the total cost amounts to about €50, but don't quote me on that. The practical side of it is that you have to book your theoretical exam in advance, rather than just showing up at random.

I'm not sure how the translator thing would work for the practical exam. You might want to contact a local driving school or the exam center for this information.

A and B are separate licenses with separate rules, focusing on very different things (the B course material barely even mentions motor cycles), so you will have to take 2 separate exams.

Also, I find it amusing that you say ""turning 17 [...] FINALLY getting a drivers license"". You do realize you have to be 18 to get any kind of permanent license in Belgium, right? At 17, you can get your theoretical, as well as a provisional license (only the kind where you have to be accompanied at all times), but you have to be 18 to take the final exam."

mundabit,Endo,1390212397.0,"Urgh, it disgusts me that they are pumping you with antibiotics without even testing for an infection. its not hard, you just have to poop in a jar for them!

I had 2 colonoscopies and 3 stomach endoscopies, 3 camera's in my bladder and about a billion ultrasounds, I think I have given over 15L of blood and a good swimming pool's worth of urine for STI test after STI test despite being a virgin for the first 7 years of my asking for help. then my countless GYN's decided that my pain was, Not endo, because *nooo* that would be too logical. It must be IBS because of all those bowel symptoms I wasn't having.

I had a hystercope (camera in the uterus via the cervix) which was normal, so they wrongly ruled out endo.

I spent years (11 of them) looking for a doctor to at least check, they had so many camera's in every orifice what was the harm in making a new hole?

I finally got someone to listen just last week, It turned out what I needed to do was not bring in my binder full of my last 11 years of period-diaries and symptom logs, But to just print off a list directly from webMD about endo, and highlight all the symptoms that applied to me. One quick look and any doctor could see why endo was a personal concern. and they would be forced to at least explain *why* they thought it wasn't endo, rather than just saying ""nope, IBS, Next please!""

When I did that my new GYN was left gobsmacked. ""You have everything on the list, and a full family history, why has no one tested you yet?"" he asked as he started filling in the surgery consent form ""Well, it might be because a few years ago I complained of constipation due to the pain when pooping"" and he rolled his eyes. ""of course, you mention one issue with your digestive track and suddenly no one can be bothered doing any real work so its IBS.""

Sometimes tests other than laproscopy can reveal endo, but you need someone who is an expert and the circumstances that lead to it are rare. For example, My latest colonoscopy and vaginal examination revealed discolouration, which the GYN said could be a sign of fusing, ""could"" being the imporant word. I'm stuck on a waiting list for the surgery and he's doing all he can to bump my 'urgency rating up'. he organised a 'functional MRI' that showed little freedom of movement of my uterus and left ovary, Which he says is strongly suggestive that they have fused to my bowel or abdominal wall. again 'suggestive'

 He has also organised for me to get a camera in my sinus cavity and lungs because he is concerned that doctors have been blaming my recurrent pneumonia for all the blood I cough and sneeze up while on my period. He's also keen to look into why I get seizures while on my period. My nurologist just said it was a symptom of menstrual migraine syndrome, but my GYN said he has heard in rare cases endo can be to blame.

Long story short, You need a doctor who wants to learn, a doctor who is curious and compassionate but also a bit of a maverick.

lap tests are not necessary for a diagnoses, but they are necessary if you want to know for sure, which you do. The amount of energy and money you are expending on medication you don't need and sonograms that wont show anything, they may as well of just done a broad diagnostic surgery to look at everything from your kidneys to your liver and of course, signs of endo.

carpetano,soccer,1390212575.0,"Right now, Real Madrid and Barcelona have a budget 5x bigger than Atlético,. The money differences come from long ago, but the current state of la Liga don't help to reduce them (TV rights, etc). 

The current owner (Miguel Ángel Gil Marín) is **Jesús Gil**'s son, who took advantage of the rule that forced every Spanish football club to became a private company (except Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Club and Osasuna). He did it this way:

* He was already Atlético de Madrid president because he won the 1987 elections (he signed Paulo Futre **before** the elections)
* As he was president, he began to choose companies that were his (with other names, etc) to make every kind of works for Atlético, from stadium maintenance to players transfers intermediary. The debts were inflated and he was earning money from Atlético accounts
* He enter in local politics in 1991 when he became mayor of Marbella, a city in southern Spain that he transformed in a corruption paradise. Now he had two sources to make the accounting even more confusing and he kept becoming more and more rich.
* He should have called for election at Atlético in 1991, but the government was studying the law that forced the clubs to became companies and he delayed the elections.
* 1992, the law is enforced. The clubs that must became companies are those with certain % of debt. Every club that must became SAD (sports corporation) will sell a number of shares that will cover the debt, and the received amount was going to be the initial capital stock for each SAD
* Giil had inflated Atlético debts to a total of 2000 million pesetas (~12 M€), so the shares are put for sell. Several Atlético fans buy shares (~60 € each one) but people are very cautious because Gil is saying everywhere that Atlético is going to bankruptcy and can actually disappear. People think that Gil will eventually buy the shares, but time passes and he doesn't
* The last day to buy the shares he buys them at almost midnight, he has *saved* Atlético de Madrid and he is now the owner. What he did was to send to the bank a payment guarantee for the pending amount, and he retired it the next day because most of the debt was owed to companies owned by Jesús Gil. He payed himself a debt that he had created, and he got most of Atlético shares doing it. Gil sold some shares to Enrique Cerezo (current president) but Cerezo payed just about 6 euros for each share.
* As a result, the initial Atleti's capital was only the money payed by the honest Atlético supporters who had payed about 60 euros (10000 pesetas) for each share, but the actual debts were much bigger than the capital, so Atlético was forced to sell players and such. The transformation to SAD rule was supposed to be a ""clean start"" for those clubs with problems, but it didn't solve Atlético's problem, and now they were competing against clubs with money in the bank.
* Once Gil became not just president, but owner, he began a corruption rampage, both on Atlético and Marbella. Everybody knew that there were something fishy but the government ignored him until several years later, when he became greedier and won the local elections on several other cities in southern Spain (fun fact: his party was called ""G.I.L""). He had became a threat from the politicians and they decided to intervene.
* The court intervened Atlético, and there were several raids. Everything was discovered, but the ""Caso Atlético"" ended with most of the felonies prescribed as they had been several years before. Gil went to jail because of the Marbella stuff.
* The usual result should have been the Government taking Atlético from Gil and his family hands, but they allowed him to keep being the owner, and *by chance* he left the politics. It was probably a deal: ""we let you have Atlético but you leave politics"".
* As a result of this storm, the players weren't focused at Atlético is relegated to segund división despite it was a pretty good team (Valerón, Capdevila, Gamarra, Hasselbaink, Baraja...)
* He died some time after this (there was a conspiration theory that said that he faked his death to avoid jail). His son (Miguel Ángel Gil Marín) became the owner, and Enrique Cerezo the ""president/puppet""
* They are clueless managers and they make the inherited debts even bigger. Atlético need about 10 years to recover the status that they had before the relegation at the same time that other teams had become stronger. 

Lately it seems that Gil Marín and Cerezo have learned how to spend the money, but the books are probably still awful and full of fishy stuff. Meanwhile the Atlético fans are afraid of having a good player because that means that he will be probably sold to pay for the Gil Family crap. There are estimations of the current debt that go from 300 to 700 millions € (remember that the debt when Jesús Gil *bought* Atleti was about 12 M€), but nobody can know for sure.

Tiseye,relationships,1390212648.0,"We have 3 cats. Up until the beginning of December, there were 4. I had to have one of my girls put down due to old age and declining health.

My husband of 25 years doesn't like cats. The cats are my job. I clean up their boxes, clean up their accidents, take them to the vet etc. Which is funny, because the cats adore him more than me, but eh.

Do you know what my not-cat-liking husband does when I am sick and unable to look after my cats? He cleans up after them. He cleans their litter boxes (even though he abhors that job with a passion). He makes sure that the creatures I love are cared for. Because he loves me and he knows these cats (my last, they're all old and there will be no more cats) are important to me.

Yes, he will grumble (bloody cats, why can't they do their business outside like normal cats instead of using litterboxes), but he will do it. Because that is what you do in a relationship. You give and take, you compromise and when push comes to shove, you do the things you really don't like doing because they matter to your partner.

Your boyfriend may be all tearful and remorseful right now, but he's still claiming he had her killed for you. Not because he didn't want to deal with messes, not because there was something wrong with the cat, not because he was inconvenienced, but for you. Knowing that you would never have done that, he is still claiming that he made the decision for you, for your good, to help you. Whilst the easiest, fastest and best help for you would have been for him to pick up after the cats while you were away.

His decision making skills are sorely lacking and so are his excuse finding skills. I think I might even have been ever so slightly more sympathetic to his tearful confession if he'd come out and give you the real reason to have the cat put down, but even now he's spinning it to try to come out as the good guy who only had your best interests at heart."

Buscat,Fitness,1390212812.0,"Machines are a tricky lot. There's a ""squat machine"" at my gym that I tried out for giggles once, I could set it to the max (450 pounds) when I can't even squat 2 plates to parallel. It was because the machine arms that go onto your shoulders had the weight like half away along them from the pin they rotate on, so you'd get like 2:1 mechanical advantage.

For leg press machines, there's a bunch of stuff going on. You don't have to lift your body weight, for one thing, so I get a free ~200 pounds to my leg press compared to my squat. You also get to brace yourself against a chair. And if it's on an incline, the angle it's at will make the leg press easier the further it gets from being vertical (I've never seen a vertical leg press machine, either.. ). 

So.. no. "

ladki_patani_hai,india,1390212920.0,"&gt; Friend, I assure you that I have had the fortune to experience the best and the worst of the state policemen across many places in India.

&gt;Nobody would disagree with you when you talk about how sick the police system is. I won't even go into why this is so etc.

Yup that's a separate discussion altogether.

&gt; Current situation: what will suspending four policemen achieve when you clearly know the system is rotten from within? Like you say, you already know - every single one of the policemen are hafta wasuli guys. Why not sack all of them overnight? Honesty and all, right?

No, ofcourse not. I am not advocating or support the suspension of those 4 police officers. I support the cause of Delhi police under Delhi government.

&gt;Current situation: there is an allegation that the law minister was involved in assaulting few women. Now, isn't it very very sensitive allegation? Don't you think the Delhi Govt should have made sure that the investigation is carried out swiftly and correctly here instead of making a mockery of it? This woman could have been your girlfriend, man.

In my personal opinion, he should publicly apologize if whatever that is coming in news is true and have himself run through the law proceedings in such a case (he can defend himself there). They behaved very naively there.

&gt; One can always say, everyone's corrupt so fuck of all them etc. I mean, why trust the investigators, right? When you face a crime in this country, you'll run day in and day out to the same rotten justice system and law enforcement to get whatever little justice you can.

&gt; The police reform can wait. The transfer of policing power to Delhi state can wait. But what we can not have is an allegation that a woman was detained by another civilian just because he thought she was a whore. Can't have that.

Correct again. The pretext of this protest is wrong. I would be much happier if they had said we are unable to co-ordinate activities with Delhi police and here the list of proper reasons etc.

The protest even if a part of it is right arose for the wrong reasons. Agree there."

mundabit,Endo,1390212981.0,"&gt; my GP insists that even with endo as bad as mine, you would only be in pain 'during your cycle.'

This was the main reason Doctors told me my pain wasn't endo. I've been having daily pain for the last year and a bit, and Doctors said ""well if its not in time with your cycle its not endo. Must be IBS""

Well I disagreed, I was on Implanon and I was spotting every single day, so why wouldn't there be pain if there was also blood?

My current GYN listened to me, so I will be getting a lap soon, he thinks based on other tests and my symptoms I have some growth on my bowel and ovaries at least. 

I'm glad to hear they are trying to schedule another lap, I'm not sure if this is something your GYN does, but mine asked permission to go from keyhole to open should he find growths as bad as yours, because he wants to get snip-happy on their painful butts.

I have considered applying for disability, between the endo and the fibromyalgia I haven't been able to leave my bed very much, sitting is hard, and standing is harder, walking is a rare occurrence. I try my best to keep up with at lets an hour of yoga a day and the hour-long physical therapy exercises I have been given, but that pretty much drains me off all the mental energy I have, Dealing with the pain, pushing through it just takes so much out of you.

I've spoken to welfare and there is nothing they can do, its just not considered a disability. I have a caseworker who is helping me find work, and she's pretty pissed that there is no help for me, Though she will be glad to hear I have a GYN who's taking my pain seriously.

Mandarin is certainly growing in popularity in 新西兰 and schools are recognising that. I visited 汉办 in 北京 in April last year with a number of high school principals who are looking at establishing Chinese language programmes. I believe Otago Girls High school are establishing a Confucius Institute as a result of that visit. 

I fortunately get to run a University Summer School field trip to China as part of a business course and as a result of that a large number of my former students have taken up Mandarin, even just to a basic level.

I certainly think schools in this country would do well to promote the language here.

I know that you have some contempt for women, but hear me out. I'm a woman, and I can say confidently that we aren't all terrible people. The women who treated you like crap are insecure bitches who hurt people to make themselves feel confident and powerful. The more you let their words effect you, the more they feel better. The moment you ignore them and only care about what you think of yourself is the moment that you win your life back. Women are some sort of weird enigma. There are women out there like the ones you described, and then there are ones like me who hate other women just as much as you do. I can't associate with them anymore. Maybe one day I will find a woman to call my friend, but today isn't that day. 90% of women are terrible yes. But there are women out there that exist that want to be around and they will love you for you regardless of weight or whatever. Hell, who wants an overly skinny guy. There's nothing to hug there. Too buff and it's like hugging a rock. 
You need to take time for yourself. Go out and explore the things you want to do. You don't have friends anymore? Who cares. This is your time to reinvent yourself. Don't change yourself, but rather take time to reflect on what you want. Take those reflections and focus on those. The more you focus on them and build up a passion for what you want, you'll soon find that there are people around you with the same passions. Those are the people that will stay with you for life. Those are the people who will always want you around.

eqwoody,AskReddit,1390214096.0,"I took this from a Chef forum because I didn't feel like explaining.

There are at least eight disadvantages to Cutco knives.

1)Inferior tempering. Cutco is stamped instead of forged. All best knives are forged (with the exception of Henckels Twinstar which is using a new technology called sintering) because forged knives make a better edge among other reasons. All the worst and cheapest knives are stamped because it is cheaper and easier. The forging process randomises the metal particles for a slightly tougher knife. It also permits the differing thicknesses of metal which is necessary for a heavy raised bolster between the knife handle and knife blade. Forged knives have more metal than stamped knives and thus are heavier. The forging process enables extra metal proportioning to give the knife perfect balance. Most prefer the weight of a forged knife. It feels heftier and more substantial. Forged knives generally are thicker, have more heft, hold an edge better, provide bolsters which brings better balance and safety, and obviously have been made with a lot more care and craftmanship. The forging process enhances the flexibility (making it less likely to snap to break), density, and hardness, and better solidifies the structure of a knife.

2)Steel. Cutco claims they use the highest quality steel money can buy. They call it high carbon surgical grade steel. While this is subjective Cutco uses 440A grade steel while most top of the line knives (which is where Cutco is priced at) uses 440C, which is higher in carbon. 440C is more expensive to make, buy, and manufacture with. 440C also makes a sharper edge, and holds it better. Because of it's grain structure 440C is also more stain resistant. And while 440C steel is generally only found in top of the line kitchen knives, 440A is often found in the cheaper, run of the mill type kitchen knives. Where they got the surgical grade label is beyond me, 440A steel doesn't have a regular grade and a surgical grade. When you think of surgical instruments you think sanitary, expensive, and high quality- it's just sales hype.

3)Lack of bolsters provides for inferior balance and less safety.

4)Double-D edge. Most cooking enthusiasts prefer a straight edge which the double-d is not and you cannot sharpen Cutco edges yourself whenever you please. Salespeople use the ol' rope a dope trick when giving a presentation because the serrated pattern cuts tougher objects better, but any chef or cooking enthusiast will tell you that kitchen knives are made to cut through food like meat, bread, and tomatoes- not rope or leather. For that a utility knife is best- and there's are plenty of utility knives that cut through rope and leather better than Cutco's.

Cutco's salespeople swear up and down double-d edges are neither straight, nor serrated but unique (don't all salespeople?). The Double-D edge is in fact another type of serrated edge. Cutco calls their serrated edge ""Double D"" just like Spyderco calls their serrated edges ""Spyderedge."" Except Spyderco isn't trying to fool anyone and markets their as a superior serration pattern while Cutco tries to claim theirs is different.

But anyone who knows anything about knives can tell you the ^^^^ pattern on the edge (take a look at the cutco.com website for an explanation and drawing, currently at: http://www.cutco.com/jsp/catalog/features.jsp ) makes it a serrated edge. The whole double-d thing is just hype like everything else about the knives. The Double-D edge is not patented and never was.

The problem with the serrated pattern is that it doesn't make a clean cut- little nicks and tears in the food is made. Serrated knives are generally only good for fibrous vegetables and bread- where it is needed. Cutco reps may claim that it makes a clean cut, but this is only true for cutting stuff you can press straight down on (like butter), but for things you need to slide the blade back and forth on (like meat) the teeth will tear it up. Serrated edges are also somewhat more difficult to clean.

As for sharpness, you may think they stay razor sharp but in reality only the crevices of the blade edge are. You see serrated edges like the Double-D's look like this: ^^^^^^ when contacting the food the points get worn down rather quickly but the crevices stay sharp, so it may seem like it is razor sharp but in reality only the crevices are. It can never be as sharp as a well maintained plain edge, the edge preferred by cooking enthusiasts and professionals. Maybe a serrated edge is better at cutting rope (the rope a dope trick), but the best kitchen knives are not made to cut through rope, they are made to make a good, clean cuts on food. Master chef Wylie Dufresne just recently told GQ magazine in their Sept '03 edition, ""I have plenty of friends whose parents have Cutco in a knife block. You pull them out and they're all as dull as can be.""

Other knives you can sharpen yourself whenever you want, but with Cutco knives you need Cutco to sharpen them for you. I will refer you once again to Cutco's own website: at cutco.com, currently here:
http://www.cutco.com/jsp/customer/guarantee.jsp
""For resharpening of Double-D® or straight-edged knives, send them along with a return shipping and handling fee of $5.00 (1-3 items) or $8.00 (4 or more items) to the CUTCO address below.""
You have to pay for them to be sent in and sent back all the while without your knives. I've heard of representatives of the company coming out and sharpening them for you, but this is by no means guranteed to happen so there is obviously good reason they don't state this on their website.

5)Handles. Of course this is subjective but the handles are different from any of the others and some people find them uncomfortable (especially those with extremely large or small hands since they were designed for the average hand), some others find them dorky looking and wouldn't want to set them out on the dinner table. Sure the handles were designed to be comforable- all handles are designed that way! And like all good salepeople, Cutco even has a good story to tell about it. That doesn't mean they actually ARE comfortable. Consumer Reports, the leading consumer magaine, also found the handles to be uncomfortable. The handles are made of what Cutco call ""Thermoresin"" and thermo=heated and resin=plastic, injection molded plastic is the absolute cheapest material cost and method possible. And the type of plastic the handles are made out of, celluloid plastic, is highly nitrated and self-oxidizing like the gun cotton in smokeless gun powder (to a lesser extent) thus highly flammable- not good for a kitchen knife. Although the rivots are made of what they call ""nickel-siver"", there is no silver in them. They call it nickel-silver because it has a silver color to it. The handles have no current patent on them, other companies could copy them but choose not to. Wear Ever cookware had handles designed by the same person in the 30's and 40s, they have since dumped this design.

6)Corrosion. Many people (including Consumer Reports magazine) believe that Cutco blades corrode a little easier than most. Consumer Reports seemed to hint that it may have to do with the type of metal used, polishing, or coating.

7)Restrictions when buying. Since you can only buy from a Vector rep, you are forced to select your rep with care because a flock of amateur sales reps can and will include a range from the best professionals through the worst rip off artists.

8)Price. Many will agree that Cutco is not best for commercial use but it is priced for commercial use. You can get a 7 piece block of top of the line hand-forged, bolstered, well balanced Wusthof-Trident Grand Prix for $249. A similar set of Cutco can easily run you $300-$400. Tramontina Professional is supposed to be the best value having the same features as the best knives but at about 1/3 the price. There may also be hidden costs added (such as shipping &amp; handling, C.O.D., sales tax, etc.) that make the actual price much higher that the displayed and originally discussed price.

Cutco is sold at prices very similar to knives that are top of the line yet are not as good as them in almost every way except they do have comparable rockwell hardness, are full tang, and have a good guarantee. I wouldn't spend my hard earned money on guarantees though and the other qualities you can find in much cheaper knives.

The average household has very cheap, low quality knives that generally only last 5-15 years. So when they hear there is a forever guarantee it becomes the main selling point. What they don't know is all knives in that price range are built to last a lifetime and with proper care they definately will. The only way they won't is if you abuse them, which Cutco's guarantee doesn't even fully cover. Also, in case it doesn't last a lifetime, many top of the line knives carry a lifetime guarantee.

Cutco's money back guarantee is for 15 days. Most large retail chains like Sears and Walmart carry a 30 day money back satisfaction guarantee. The forever guarantee is nice, but a couple nitpicks: ""Should you damage your CUTCO through misuse or abuse, we will replace the item for one half of the current retail price."" it needs to be sent in to Cutco ""with an explanatory note"" and Cutco is the sole determinor of what is misuse or abuse (such as chipping your knife), also the ""guarantee is intended solely for consumer/in-home use."" Don't believe me? Check out the Cutco website yourself:
http://www.cutco.com/jsp/customer/guarantee.jsp

I you are looking for the guarantee, Henckels Twinstar and Messermeister (among many others) both offer similar lifetime warrantees and are of better quality (in many people's opinions). If you must have the best kitchen knives available, Wusthof Trident Grand Prix is highly regarded as the best kitchen knives money can buy and the prices are similar to Cutco's. If you are looking for brand name, Henckels is considered the #1 selling brand in the world, been in business since 1731, and they will replace their twinstar knives that have a ""diamond edge"" with new ones if they get dull. For the best value, you can find high quality, forged, full tang knives with bolsters at a very reasonable price (about 1/3 that of Cutco's) you might want look into the Tramontina Professional Series which is regarded as the best value in the knife industry. If you don't want to spend very much money on knives, the Forschner Victoronox is made by the same people who make Swiss Army Knives and considered the best of the very cheap kitchen knives. If you don't want to sharpen your knives, you might want to look at the Regent Sheffield Infinity Edge or Henckels Twinstar depending on how much you want to spend. Most retail stores have a 30-day money back guarantee.

My opinion is that Cutco is not worth their price and I'm sure most professionals would agree. In fact you would have great difficulty finding one culinary arts school, master chef, or knife expert that recommends this brand. Norman Weinstein, a nationally recognized knife skills instructor who's taught since 1995 at the Institute of Culinary Education was quoted by the Baltimore Sun newspaper as saying ""Why, why, would you buy such a knife?""
http://www.thecomplaintstation.com/c...picID=00034515
Cutco is able to sell their knives at such a high price because they are being sold to people by their sons, nephews, and granddaughters (basically people who care for them and trust them, or their friends, and know very little about knives). Consumersearch.com looked over all the professional reviews available and while 11 professionals liked Wusthof Trident the best, only one liked Cutco and that one only liked Cutco compared to other stamped knives:
http://www.consumersearch.com/www/ki...fullstory.html

The bottom line is that no brand or set is best for everyone and you should check them all out and compare to decide which is best for your needs, wants, and preferences. The retail store is probably the best place to do this, unfortunately Cutco is not sold there."

My biggest fear for a while was that there would be a scandal that would destroy all of the alt-coins. Luckily I don't think that could happen anymore.

I think you are right that the future of these coins is like rolling dice, I just think wildly inflated expectations are harmful if people want them to be used as an actual currency.

I ate fish for a year, and but knew I was being a hypocrite so then gave it up.  (This was pre-internet and I had never even met another vegetarian before so I was figuring it out all by myself.  And my family was really worried about me.)

Well, I was a staunch vegetarian for years.  I think I kept the blinders on about meat and eggs.  I also still had never met a vegan or really read too much about it.  I lived on cheese pretty much.

I had a health scare and had to give up saturated fat.  But I didn't for a while.  I moved to NYC and started managing a vegan restaurant.  And it was just, oh!  There are vegans!  There is vegan food!  So, I can't even remember what the actually turning point was.  Was I trying to be vegan before the restaurant?  Was I still eating stuff after I worked there?

- AI: Subjects will now only accept buying non-core provinces if their OE is 0
- AI: Will no longer accept buying a non-accepted culture province or wrong religion group province unless it is a core, claim, or they have owned it at any point during the game
- AI: Subjects will now only buy provinces if they are a core, claim, or they have owned it at any point during the game
- When selling a core province to your subject they will now get a core on that province
- AI: Will consider core provinces of their overlord as their own core provinces for the purposes of evaluating if they want to buy it

&gt; This means that you will always be able to use sell province to restore 'lost' provinces to your vassals. The 'strategic interest' calculation is gone as it was simply too opaque for the player to try and figure out what provinces the AI wanted.

&gt; Aggressive Expansion is being tweaked by reducing the effect of range, meaning that your neighbours will react more to large land-grabs, though distant powers still won't really care. The effects of prestige on Better Relations Over Time is also being reduced, as this was a major factor in allowing players to very quickly lose accumulated AE.

Kimi ni Todoke is my choice for the absolute best romance anime. For one thing, it is a shoujo title rather than a shonen. Shonen titles rarely get a romance show right. Second, it doesn't have any strange events to water it down like in Clannad/AS or Kokoro Connect. Nor is it a romance-secondary show like you'll find with SAO or Haruhi.

Kuronuma Sawako is one of the sweetest girls you will ever meet in anime, and you'll wish that you had met her in real life. She has one of the [best smiles](http://i.imgur.com/m5PMjQv.jpg) ever drawn. And unlike every other romance heroine you can think of, she isn't a tsundere. Or a yuudere. Or a kuudere. Or even a yandere. She's just a typical teenage girl. Well, except for the resemblance to a certain character from *The Ring*, and a self-esteem so low that she has to be forcibly convinced that people actually like her rather than simply being polite. 

Sawako-chan is the ultimate best girl. And the faster the rest of the anime world realizes that I'm right, the better it will be for everyone."

Buy a whole chicken from your local grocery store.  It's way cheaper than paying for the chicken already separated.  De-bone the breast yourself (it's extremely easy--really!), save the wing thigh and drumstick.  Cook what you need and put the rest in your freezer.  After a few chickens you'll have enough wings saved up to treat yourself to some homemade wings one night.

Use ingredients that have multiple purposes.  Good crusty bread can be a topper for soup, toast in the morning, used for a sandwich or made into croutons.  Curry powder is really only good for... curry.

Cooking doesn't have to be a 4 course affair.  Check sale prices and stock up when things are cheap.

WowMilfy,CougarsAndCubs,1390215661.0,"Article so you don't need to click the bait:   


&gt;**1 Do: Be Yourself**  
&gt; Once you’ve landed that first date, resist the urge to behave differently. She’s going out with you, isn’t she? She must have seen something she liked, so just be you and see what happens.  


&gt; **2 Don’t: Obsess About Ages**  
&gt; Sure, the age difference will come up from time to time, and you’ll have different pop-culture references, but that’s OK. If you find yourselves only talking about your age difference, it’s a problem. Don’t let it get weird around your friends or family, either. If you’re serious about this woman, treat her with respect at all times. And remember, everyone you’ve ever dated has probably been too “something” for your friends or family.
 

&gt; **3 Do: Be Open Minded**  
&gt; Dating an older woman will open you up to a new world where you can try new things. The best relationships are the ones where you can be yourself (see first tip) and experience new things with someone you enjoy spending time with.  

&gt; **4 Don’t: Forget to Have a Relationship**  

&gt; If you don’t have much in common, it’s easy to rely on physical intimacy to pass the time and call that a relationship. If you’re interested in a long-term relationship, make it about more than sex. Unless, of course, that’s all it is about, and in that case, who are we to judge?  

&gt; **5 Do: Be Honest and Upfront** 

&gt; If your lady is only a few years older than you, she might be looking for a fast-track to a committed relationship and starting a family. Cougars, on the other hand, might just be looking for a good time with a great partner (that’s you). So be honest about your needs and expectations; do you expect to live wild and free for the next decade or settle down by next fall?  

&gt; **6 Don’t: Assume Anything**  

&gt; Just because she’s older than you doesn’t mean she’s more mature, happy and established at work, financially stable or anything else. Ask questions and get to know her for who she really is.  

&gt; **7 Do: Act Like an Adult**  

&gt; No woman wants to be a mother to their boyfriend. As tempting as it might be to let her cook for you all of the time or clean up after you, remember, you are an adult — act like one. Also, be a gentleman. No one likes a boyfriend who acts like a rowdy frat boy who disrespects women. She’s probably already dated and dumped a guy like that.  


&gt; **8 Don’t: Bring Lots of Baggage**  
&gt; We all have exes, so we don’t need to know all the gory details of what went wrong in your prior relationships. She is not a counselor and she doesn’t want to hear it.  

&gt; **9 Do: Have Fun**  

&gt; Old does not equal boring, and fun is not exclusive to youth. Enjoy yourselves!

Too long?  

[Golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) and age is just a number. 
https://duckduckgo.com/Golden_Rule   

Act your age too (same as \#7 Act like an Adult). I'm usually pretty serious in public, but very playful and silly (my SO loves that in private and at home) personality sometimes, and once I did something a bit immature in a restaurant or something and she gave me a stern look I'll never forget. 

I learned a valuable lesson in milliseconds but was instantly turned on all over again. I just love classy woman and getting *that* look, what can I say?   

I was young (duh) and obviously I grew up. She knew I was better than that, and I'd soon grow up. Shame that some couples can break up or not even connect because of that. 

If an OW tells a YM she doesn't want an immature guy and he says he's not and they meet, he's been warned and she can and will move on, but putting all YM in the too young/too immature basket must be frustrating. 

(Same with the 'Oh you're around *my* son's age!' so fucking what! Hate hearing that from OWs, especially when they're over 45 or 50. Grow up!)"

While explaining the basics of cs'ing to new players it is often mentioned it's not worth it to get harassed for a last hit. This is true, *to some extent*. In lower divisions creeps aren't as contested, therefore you mostly take the one's for free. The higher you go, the more getting last hits will be contested.

Eating one auto for one, two, three last hits is often worth it, because you can heal it easily back with your Life Steal quints, Doran's Blade, Vamp. Scepter etc. Often times fights will break off for the last hits. You have to know, learn what damage you can take, which would be too much. For example, the enemy plays Lucian, I'm going with Jinx. If Lucian gets one auto off on me, I'm going for the last hit. If he gets his Q + double auto off on me, I'm not. If I can answer his Q + double auto with a Zap and two, three rocket auto attacks I'm going for the last hit again. The whole fight came up because I wanted to take that low health creep. You have to keep your gold income on par and in higher divisions early cs becomes almost as contested as objectives, like towers and dragons. The first few waves are probably the most important cs, because often times it'll determine which side gets the upper hand throughout the lane phase."

So I took her hand and started pulling, just ever so slightly. Then I looked at her, dead in the eye, with my manly gaze and said ""Mayumi, I'm pregnant...""

She just gives me this look and says ""What the fu...?""

Then I ripped the nail right off.

Overall: if you're doing this for a money, just get 'a real job'.

But I had a lot of fun seeing other people judge my products nice enough to want to spend money on something that *I* made. It felt good. 

But if you want to make some actual money you have to:

* Have original items - crochetted hats &amp; scarfs are not going to do it because there are many, many other people selling it
* Be very fast in the craft that you're selling (so you don't spend to much time on an item)
* Spent some good time on promotion/search engine optimization/getting the word out, so you actually build a customer base.

Allegedly there are a few options, launch immediately once BBC Radio 1 goes out, join up with NATO under American Command, or drive over to Australia. Or others I guess.

The PM says what to do in the event of a devastating nuclear attack on London, and the letters are locked up in the submarines, so far unused and burned upon installment of a new Prime Minister.

There is no such American equivalent since America assumes it will still have command and control facilities even in the case Washington DC is nuked. Mainly via the two Air Force One planes and the four nuclear doomsday 747s.

The weight you lift will also depends a lot on your body mechanics. If you are tall like me the truth is you have to lift the weight further for each rep. I also have a 6'6 wing span so lifts like my bench press are going to be less naturally. Most importantly make sure you are consistently seeing strength increases over how much you are actually lifting.

You hang up, they don't, so the call isnt terminated, they play a ""dial tone"" so they think you are dialing the correct legit number (number is legit but you aren't actually really dialling), they pretend to be your bank fraud number, ask you loads of personal details etc for ""security"" and then inform you they will cancel or suspend the card or the transactions so you think action has been taken.

They go on a massive spending spree with your details and card info and you dont report it as unusal for many weeks later.

its also bad because some banks may try to argue they wont refund the false charges as you were implicit in aiding the criminals, i.e on paper you didn't report unusual activity for weeks etc. (although I dont know of any case they haven't refunded/wiped off)

 Mark, well, as we have gotten older we have had less and less in common. But seeing as we are in very different points in our life and we've been friends since we were 7 or 8, that isn't surprising. 

Melanie, some days it seems we have more in common than others. 

Kat, her and I, while not having much in common are so connected to each other, we consider each other (nonromantic) soul mates. 

Sam, she is the one I share the most in common with, so much so I'm actually surprised we became such good friends because generally speaking I just get along better with people who I have less in common than more. 

Now showing very close friends but not best friends, again, it varies. 

Rose, our friendship seemed almost kizmet, seeing how we meet in college, and she is two years younger than me but had I stayed in my adoptive home we would have ended up meeting and most definitely becoming friends in high school. 

Steph and Kari, those two and I share the same sarcastic humor and the ability to quickly bounce off each other. 

Jason, it's about half and half with him. 

Kyle, the only thing we share in common is our passion for trying to make a difference in our community, love of learning and in-depth conversation and caffeine addiction. 

For the rest of my friends, it depends.

Anyhow says he tested for Caterham. Maybe the business side didn't make sense. Not the most exciting of races in China and crowd numbers aren't there yet despite large population. Market might be good enough Toyota to reenter in 2020 or so to help sell cars on Monday morning. Honda comes back in 2015. Maybe Ma can race for them, but he'll be 24 or so then. Feeder teams prefer drivers under 22 or so. Or have won in GP2.     

The rich in China/Asia already buy the luxuries cars, they don't need F1 races to tell them which. They like Rolls, Lambo, Audi, Maserati and Bugatti, they're not in F1, but of course some F1 fans would buy the Ferrari and Mercedes too. Or the 'BMW' despite not actually using a BMW engine.

Finrayy,AskReddit,1390218705.0,"There's always an exception..

[Cryptolocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker).

This sneaky virus will, once on your system, begin encrypting your files in such a manner that even with the worlds fastest super-computers would take thousands of years to decode. It won't tell you it's doing this, will work away in the background, and once your entire HDD is encrypted, it will pop up with a nice message to say ""Haha, you're fucked."" There is no way to restore these files once encrypted, unless you pay £/€/$300 for the private key, which is stored on servers which the virus originated from. The only tell-tale sign is 2 processes in your task manager (usually a random string of numbers and letters), but by the time you notice that, the encryption is fast at work. Ending the processes (I'd recommend [Process Explorer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx) as Task Manager sometimes isn't good enough for it) will immediately pop up the ""You have to pay now"" window, but should stop any *more* files becoming encrypted.

The only true defence against this system is having a removable backup system for your important files (i.e an external hard-drive which you disconnect after every back-up (yes cryptolocker can work on more than just your main hard-drive)), or cloud-based backup, or having an effective anti-virus software which can pick it up before it infects your system. Most free anti-virus softwares don't actually recognise it (or didn't when I was still in the computer repair business a few months back, I don't know if they will now)."

Even if they don't stay very long and are comparatively weak, each of them will at least keep one enemy busy for a round, set up flanking for your groups rogue (he will be soooo thankful for that) and trip/damage/grapple/whatever.

This is only put in the lease so that the landlord will not be responsible when there is no utilities running in the house because of your inability to pay. 

Whose name is on the utility bills? The names on the lease and the name on the utility bills are not connected. The person on the utility bill is the sole responsible person. If you told her you will be moving out than that is a verbal agreement acknowledging you will not be living at the residence in question. A judge will not force you to pay the utility bill if your roommate was the only one using it and if your agreement states you moved out than the sentence is pretty clear. Try calling her and telling her you wont be paying the utility bill since you are not a residence anymore. 

I highly recommend you record that phone conversation stating you moved out and will not be using the utilities anymore which is legal under Indiana law. "

The oireachtas site is the most basic research and should list everyone's info or nobody's, what's your problem with this idea or justification for it being half-complete?

&gt;They're working as nurses, manufacturing workers, ""cops"", retail workers, and ""STEM people"". Once they stop and work to be public representatives then they stop being those things. 

I'm asking why so many come from specific backgrounds and not others

&gt; I mean the guy I picked at random is a ""STEM person"", he worked in the pharmaceutical and telecommunications industries. 

Again, why is the state's info about background so fucking half-assed?

&gt;Look at any who had to go to university when there were fees, 

Because the measure of someone's degree is the cost, right? Verging on elitism there

&gt;Ministers and TD's aren't supposed to implement things themselves, that's what the civil service is for... it employs specialists who actually know about the details to give advice and to actually implement it and who (theoretically) don't have an allegiance to any party.

Is it possible that expertise may contribute towards better management? 

&gt;TD's are there to represent the public interest, and the public by and large have no clue about economics or education or big pharma, so it's good to have a fresh set of eyes ""outside the box"" so to speak. 

This is the most indefensible opinion i have ever heard in my fucking life. Sure the people don't know about any of that high-falootin economic shite, why would we want those fellas in charge? WHY NOT HAVE PEOPLE IN CHARGE THAT KNOW MORE THAN THE VOTERS FOR FUCKS SAKE?

Stop calling me a political blogger, i spat out two paragraphs at 2 am in order to spark conversation and i'm being taken apart for it.

thro_way,changemyview,1390220255.0,"&gt;To paraphrase, what he said was ""Being blackout drunk is not normally what leads up to rape"".

I agree with this paraphrasing.

&gt;He's not denying that rape victims are sometimes drunk - he's saying there doesn't seem to be any link between that and their assault.

Right, and that is false.  Correlation *is* a link, and in this case, there's a strong correlation between being raped, and being drunk.  

I don't think you understand that correlations are tremendously useful, even when they are not created by causation.  Imagine if we knew that 75% of rape victims were albinos.  No causation, just correlation.  Do you understand how significant that would be?  By comparing their underrepresentation in the general population to their overrepresentation among rape victims, we could deduce that they were at an increased risk of being raped.  Similarly, by comparing the underrepresentation of drunk girls in the general population (less than 75% of girls are drunk in general) to their overrepresentation among rape victims (75%), we can deduce that drunk girls are at an increased risk of being raped.

Nobody is saying that drunkenness *causes* rape; the correlation alone is very useful.  


&gt;The issue is that conventional wisdom is often ""a woman goes out, gets drunk, does something to lead a man on, and is not in a position to reject him"" and people approach statistics like the '75% were drunk' with that confirmation bias. It sounds plausible. However, the more we learn about it, the more it appears that is not representative of a majority of sexual assaults.

The fact that that narrative as a whole might be wrong does not mean that each part of it must also be wrong.  And in 75% of cases, the idea of the woman being drunk is **not** wrong!  It really is the case that in cases of rape, the woman *is* usually drunk.  The fact that her being drunk is not what causes rape does not change this!"

Although some rabbits will have more if a prey instinct, but with proper training &amp; patience &amp; well-behaved humans, they can learn to trust people.

wufoo2,sex,1390220861.0,"It's the subtle touches that work. He has 50 percent more nerve endings than a cut guy (they're in the foreskin) and a smooth, supple glans that gives him a much wider range of sensations.

What this means for you is improved ROI: Less labor for her, more enjoyment for him.

The foreskin's nerve endings specialize in stretch-and-release, like the nerve endings in her lips. You know how good it feels when you're kissing and your guy manipulates your lips with his lips and tongue? It's the same when her lips and tongue work on his foreskin.

Rolling the skin with her hand stimulates those nerve endings, too, peeling the glans then rolling it closed again. Bonus: When it's closed, she can slide her tongue in between the foreskin and glans, then swirl. Whe may have to pause occasionally for him to stop shaking. ;-)

The glans likes gentle, wet friction. (It can be touched dry, but only completely dry. Even a little moisture will make her fingers feel like erasers.)

Also, he'll have a frenulum, whereas most circumcised guys don't. That's the raised strip connecting the underside of his glans to his foreskin. It's very, very sensitive to direct stimulation.

lanle,ACMilan,1390221163.0,"I think a 4-3-2-1 or 4-3-1-2 is more likely, provide we still want to play attacking football while nullifying Athletico force in the midfield and diego costa up front, a 5 man mid is the way to go, if no injuries occur between now and the match and everyone is fully fit, a possible formation imo could be:

Abbiati
Abate-Rami-Mexes-De Sciglio
Poli-De Jong-Nocerino(Cristante)
Kaka-Robinho
Balotelli
or Kaka
Balotelli-Pazzini

Nocerino is an unfortunate choice but I prefer him to Saponara, Constant and Cristante is because he is frankly more experienced, more defensive and has a high work rate, helping us closing down on Athletico when we lost possession. 
But Cristante playing instead on the right, moving Poli to the left is not bad as well, as we could bring the play to them, provide that we can be clinical and take our chances well.
I do not expect we to have possession like against Verona, nor do I expect we to be the more attacking side of the two against Athleti, I recognise the threat posed by them, but I also think we have a good chance to winning the tie."
ta1901,FeMRADebates,1390221163.0,"&gt; What makes a culture bintoan?

That's a tough one but I'll take a guess. My guess is it comes from hundreds of years ago where physical strength was needed to fight of warring tribes and protect the family and the village when we were all in subsistence farming in ""survival mode"". Women were expected to work on the farm doing lighter stuff, but men got the heavier jobs, including fighting in a war. This was further encouraged over time, even as we had an excess of food and peace, because, psychologically, many people fear change. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" is a real psychological phenomena where some people resist change. As more people who fear change get into positions of power, the male power structure continues through time. 

&gt;  What are the effects of a bintoan culture on how men and women are perceived? What happens in a bintoa to individuals who defy bintoan gender roles?

Men are castigated in various ways for not appearing heterosexual. Bintoan culture tends to enforce hetero-normative centricity. While this is happening less now, it still happens. I'm a straight guy who likes to wear bright colors sometimes, not pastels, but a solid neon color tshirt. I'm also fit and happen to like wearing tight clothing. So naturally people assume I'm gay. I'm also fine hanging out in a gay bar, so naturally, I suppose I AM a bit confusing when I'm in a gay bar. I like gay bars too, mainly because there is less drama IME.

&gt; Are men considered ""less caring"" than women in a bintoa?

Yes, this is an assumption made about men before a person even gets to know an individual. It's the ""default perception"" of an individual man. And since I like kids, it can get really annoying when someone asks me ""Are you sure you know what you're doing?"" Yes, I have my own kid, thank you. 

However, this is a trend too, where men are less in touch with their feelings, due to cultural and biological reasons. Some men are just not emotional, thus do not understand emotions very well. *This alone does not mean they are bad people.* Likewise, some women are very emotional. *That does not mean they are ditzy,* they just react more easily to emotional stimuli. But for an unemotional person to say all emotions are bad, is a bad assumption, and does not account for human variability.

Sperm can not live more than 2 hours outside the body unless kept in control cryogenics, sperm can not live more than 5 days inside the body.

Precum only contains live sperm if it occurs after an ejaculation without a urination taking place between the two events.

My partner used to have a similar phobia, He knew the above facts and I know deep down so do you, But that fear is still very powerful. I encourage you to talk to someone and get control over this anxiety, you know its irrational so you are clearly a smart woman and you know your mind well. My partner fell deeper and deeper into his fear and developed a severe OCD-like disorder where he was nervous that if he could impregnate a woman by touching something with his hands that she then touched with her hands, he scrubbed his hands raw and never masturbated and did all he could to avoid touching a woman, even a hand-shake. He knew it was ridiculous, but the fear took control. He was able to get his life back through therapy, I'm not saying you need that, But this is obviously a very distressing phobia, and returning to college is going to also be stressful, having someone, even a school counsellor to talk to can really help."

lordfuzzywig,short,1390221511.0,"&gt;Every generation is slightly taller than the last, but it looks like the gap between this generation and the next will be much, much greater.

I just wanna pick up on this. This is not true. At all. Humans have grown, and shrunk, throughout history. We are in a height ""boom"" because we're regaining a lot of the height we had lost from the 1700s or so, and that has been happening since the mid-19th-early-20th century.

Height, in general, is directly related to a nation's economic wealth, surplus of goods, wealth equality, etc. There is an obvious correlation to height differences in countries that had a great wealth disparity. Things like war, famine, disease, etc. all contribute directly to the average height decreasing markedly.

Basically, what I'm saying, is we are NOT going to keep growing and growing and growing. We are simply regaining the height we lost due to the hectic history we have had as a world. It just won't happen. At least not naturally (i.e. without HGH etc.)."

He did write ""DPRK trip"" on one of his checks and it was held by his US bank so he had to quickly find more money and write another check to cover it.

His original check was eventually refunded to him.

USCAV19D,army,1390221706.0,"Last I heard, right when I was leaving AD the 75th Recruiters were talking to 19ds. This was a change from 5 years prior when we were being turned away, our armor related MOS hiding the fact that we can do everything an infantry platoon can do with less people. So the solution is to go to Ranger School, pass, then reclass 11b and get into The regiment with that back door. 

Fact of the matter is most of like it where we are. I've had far more buddies go to SFAS than ever express interest in the 75th. Most scouts who want anything to do with that program just want the tab and free tomahawk. At its heart it's still an infantry regiment, and still full of wieners. 

On my last deployment TF Darby rolled through our AO to raid some HVTs hideout. They do their raid, hut hut hut, didn't find the guy, so they rolled off the AO. A very short time later they called our TOC and requested QRF support. 

TIC? No.
Help with a raid? No. 

The Rangers, infantrymen that they are, lost a radio on the objective and wanted us to go find it for them. The battle captain told their company commander to get fucked, and they had to go back themselves.

Considering my whole goal was not to disprove Christianity,  but rather to prove to myself that Christianity was the one true religion, I can say that I reached a highly unbiased conclusion that Christianity is false. Evolution alone disproves the creation account, hence the creationist's attempt to disprove a fact of life. Noah's Flood is full of scientific impossibilities. The Tower of Babel is false--our languages were developed over a long period of time, not all at once. The Tree of Knowledge Myth is full of holes. I'd love to explain *that* one to you, but I already wrote a diatribe on that one a while back, so if you're really interested, feel free to check out my post on this forum:
http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/1uia9z/how_does_the_fruit_from_the_tree_of_knowledge_and/. 

There's just way too much the Bible gets wrong for me to take it seriously anymore.

&gt;If any answer will do except a religious answer then how can you say it's true science?

It doesn't matter who gives the answer. What matters is if it's the true answer.

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1390222022.0,"I got onto TiA because I believe in positive social changes. I believe in lobbying government towards acceptance and I believe in making ourselves known in a political way. I fear that our voice will be overshadowed by people who do not know actual struggles trying to act victimized. I refuse to be a victim, of either a majority's ignorance at the speck that is my problem, or a group of people using my terms the wrong way so that majority can continue in ignorance.

I fear ""trans*"" because it means that anyone slightly uncomfortable with the rigid ideals of their gender may now claim to have the experience of someone who struggles inside their own body, even when they are alone. I fear the ""trans*"" label like a gay guy fears someone that claims to be bisexual, but only every seems to date women. If that asshole shows up at queer rallies, and acts like a fool, he will do so under a banner he has no right to wave and cause suffering to those that should wave that flag.

I hate this notion of ""cis"" and ""trans"" being radically different. I fight because I don't actually think I'm alien to my cisgendered friends. I just wanted a term to denote that difference in the odd examples where I'd need to explain the difference. Cisalpine Gaul is the Gaul you can get to without crossing mountains and Transalpine Gaul is the place where you had to cross mountains, nothing more. Now it's almost seen as a hate word, even if I use it in the academic sense that I used to. I hate that trans people and trans* people both feel that they are allowed to hate cispeople.

I especially when people take the terms that discriminated people use to ""legitimize"" themselves. ""I'm a trans-wolf otherkin."" It doesn't legitimize their movement, it allows people to make these comparisons. ""Oh, you feel you are a girl in a guy's body? That's as ridiculous as being an animal in a guy's body.""

I hate that this is the shit that is getting brought up in my community, when most countries don't acknowledge our existence, among those that do, very few acknowledge our rights. Even living in the ""Gay Marriage"" state, I could've been fired for being trans up until a few years ago. You don't really know oppression unless you have carefully scan all of a company's HR documentation to see if they included you in their non-discrimination policy. Until a boss has used this as extortion to prevent you from coming out.

If your boyfriend asks why you like TiA and why you don't like SJWs, tell him this; They do not help anyone. They hurt themselves and they hurt those that actually need help.

Also, fuck feminism. From a transgendered experience, almost everything they value is wrong. ""Gender is a social construct."" Is that why I'm disphoric? ""Check your male privilege"" yeah, right here on the list of things I can and can't do because I appear 'male,' oh, wearing a dress has a good chance of getting me beaten, thank god for that privilege. ""I find x game/movie/book/tv show problematic"" Maybe that's because everyone that was cool with the way things were went into making more, and everyone that had problems with it went into sociology. If you have a problem with the way Gender is portrayed in video games, make a video game with a better representation. ""The patriarchy"" You keep using that term, I don't think it means what you think it means."

Henry is now a risk to Jimmy no matter what so Henry is going to be killed whether he talks to the Feds or not. Henry knows this and it's what leads him to cut a deal with the Feds. Prison was the least of Henry's worries at this point because he was going to be killed whether he talked or not. 2) Based on the film, Jimmy had the biggest motive to want Henry dead. The film seems to indicate that Paulie was simply going to cut all ties with Henry but didn't have any real interest in killing him. Remember, according to the film, Paulie wanted nothing to do with the drug running and stearnly warned his crew no to get involved in that kind of thing. So Paulie probably had no idea just how deep the drug operation was and that Jimmy was also involved.

askgeeves,shittyaskscience,1390222664.0,"When you hear sound your ears actually consume a bit of the noise and your surroundings get a bit quieter. An example of this is when you are driving home from work and listening to music at a comfortable level but then, when you get in the car the next morning, the music is blasting loud. This is because your ears were consuming the noise all the way on the drive home, so the net volume when you got out of the car was lower than when there have been no ears there for the last 10 hours (in the morning). You'll notice that just after 5-10 minutes in the morning your ears will absorb some of the noise and this volume is bearable again.

The same goes for this diagram. A quiet office will only have about 5-10 pairs of ears around at any one time so the true noise levels produced (not the ear adjusted units given in this diagram) are quite low.

The stadium, however, has an abundance of ears to reduce the net volume. The true volume produced is very high but the ear adjusted volume only ends up being about twice as loud as a quiet office. However if there are a large number of deaf people or people wearing hats that cover their ears, the net volume will be louder than usual. If this starts to become too loud or painful people will start screaming or, even worse, cover their ears leading rapid growth of noise levels in a positive feedback loop (like putting a microphone to a speaker). If this effect were to escape the stadium, the results, needless to say, would be disastrous. This is why people who live near stadiums complain about the noise a lot. It's like living in an earthquake or tornado zone and insurance rates are very high."

4) Read a lot of the other Apple reporters - such as Mark Gurman, Rene Ritchie, Jim Dalrymple, John Gruber - see what they do well and take positive aspects from each of them

5) Don't be taken in by rumours (often applying a little thought shows how ridiculous it seems). Don't pay too much attention to what analysts say (they're normally wrong). Look at someone's reputation for accuracy before giving too much credence to what they say

6) Give each writer a separate profile and post stories under their name - this will allow them to build a reputation"

seanomenon,stopdrinking,1390223129.0,"If you can control your drinking and moderate it, then do so. Enjoy responsibly, as the liquor ads say. If you find it difficult or impossible to reliably moderate, then you know where to find help. 

Complete abstinence from drink is an extreme tactic. The only reason alcoholics do it is because we've exhausted all other means of controlling this problem. Non-alcoholics have a hard time understanding, because they can moderate. (Hell, alcoholics have a hard time understanding it, so why should anyone else get it?) 

Its been my experience that the people most bothered by quitting drink entirely are usually very heavy drinkers themselves. If your only option is to quit, then where does that leave them? In my experience, light drinkers have the easiest time dealing with a teetotaler. For me, quitting drink and staying quit required some adjustment to my social life. The big things were staying out of bars and avoiding heavy-drinking events. I was able to hold on to most of my friends, but our interactions changed a bit.

But it sounds like you're not there yet. The important thing is to be honest with yourself as you try to moderate. If you can do it, great. If you can't, there is help.

Good luck to you."

My advice would be to budget, maybe cut out a few things, but if you're saving a good amount of your paycheck, it makes your life really easy.

The other thing I'd say is, what 550k house do you need? Why do you need lots of rooms, etc if you're by yourself. There are plenty of centrally located 1Bedroom apartments in the 350k region.

thro_way,changemyview,1390223148.0,"&gt;Further investigation into actual rape cases, rather than an overview of statistics, appears to show that the intoxication of the victim is not a key factor in why they were raped.

This is false.

&gt;On further investigation, the theory ""Women can avoid rape by not drinking heavily"" is a) discredited and b) shown to be harmful.

a) Women can avoid rape by not drinking heavily, in the sense that they can reduce their risk to zero?  Of course not, nobody is saying they can.  Women can avoid rape by not drinking heavily, in the sense that they are less likely to be raped if they do not drink heavily?  They absolutely can.

b) There are people who say that it's harmful.  This is not the same thing as showing that it is harmful.

&gt;There is no compelling evidence that drinking causes an increased risk of rape.

Drinking does not cause rape.  Drinking does cause an increase in your risk of being raped.  Being drunk *is* an increase in your risk of being raped."

Oddbadger,AdviceAnimals,1390223216.0,"The inside (vagina) usually does 'clean itself', in a way. With a pH of about 4 it is quite acidic and kills any bacteria up there. Regular soap will be on the basic side with a pH ranging from 7 to 10. If that gets into the vagina it will make it less acidic and thereby reduce its ability to kill infections. That's where the warnings about soap and vaginas come from: using soap can make your vagina 'dirtier' and more prone to infection. It can also irritate the shit out of it. 

Using it on the outside (vulva), however, shouldn't be too much of a problem. Water already has a pH of 7, so that in itself shows washing with something with a pH over 4 won't magically combust your vagina.  However, a vulva is still very sensitive skin and it has delicate mucous membranes so you should probably go for a soap with a lower pH and as few irritants as possible. "

john_donnie,AskReddit,1390223373.0,"A very common and dangerous scam in Japan is called ore-ore sagi. (me-me scam).

Basically what happens is the Yakuza in Japan have a lot of power and one way or another they obtain peoples identities, name, phone number, parents name, friends name, etc. Then they call said persons close family (usually elderly parents) and pretend to be they're son/daughter. 

They will often say something like ""I was in a car accident"" or ""I got robbed and I need help"" in order to immediately get their sympathy and ask for a large sum of money. The parents will then be asked to wire money through a bank account and the money will be basically vanish.

This form of scam is such a problem in Japan, whenever you walk into a bank you constantly see warnings about it and when you're a elder depositing a large sum of money you are often asked just to make sure.

This scam has been attempted on both my grandparents which is rather worrying but thankfully they were able to recognize that it wasn't their children's voices."

These are unique to each account, entirely random and bigger than 10 characters long, although they are all different lengths. It is easier to remember than you'd think, all it takes is a few times using them, then my fingers know.

2. Moderate: these are things I'd rather not have compromised, but not very important: twitter, etc. These are very long sentences that I memorized. Something like the first sentence of a favorite book or part of the lyrics of a song.

3. Not important: I don't care if they get compromised. Stuff like random accounts that I'm forced to create for something and only use once. I have a standard password for that, all of those accounts share it.

4. None of the Above: these might become important some day. I create a random hard password and use it the first time. Then of course I forget it. If I need to use again, I will reset it using whatever method they allow me: e-mail, security questions.

seanomenon,alcoholism,1390223930.0,"Alcoholism and substance abuse runs in families. It sounds like you have it - whatever it is that makes us compulsively drink and abuse drugs. It sounds like it hasn't caused a big problem for yet. But the operative word there is ""yet"". (And, in my opinion, needing alcohol or other drugs to fall asleep at night is a bigger problem than you are making it out to be.) 

Alcoholism is progressive. There was probably a point at which you didn't average 6 drinks a night, and if you continue drinking this way there will probably come a point at which you have a very difficult time skipping a night. It happens slowly, though, so it is very easy to move those goalposts. Too easy.

Another thing to think about is the way you drink. Alcohol is meant to be a social drug, but it sounds like your drinking is antisocial. You're not staying out at the bars too late, you are sitting and drinking alone at home. Regardless of quantity and dependency, this sounds like alcoholic drinking to me. 

If you can moderate your drinking, cut back, just drink socially, then I think should make a serious commitment to doing so. If you can not reliably moderate your drinking, then I think you should seriously consider quitting. It is the only thing that ever worked for me, and my only regret about quitting drink is that I didn't do so years earlier.

But  I'm just some guy on the internet, and my bias is obvious. Don't take my word for it. [Try this quiz.](http://aa.org/lang/en/subpage.cfm?page=71) Answer honestly. (It's anonymous.) It can help you decide how seriously you should take this problem.

I know from looking at the code that it's Common Lisp, but a newbie might try to run this in a Scheme interpreter and wonder why nothing works :P And then the code itself is not ideal, for example you do `(if (numberp x) nil ...)` where you should be using `(declare (number x))` -- or even, if the goal is to show it to newcomers, nothing at all: type issues should be introduced later."

Oh, and you're wrong by about 80 years. from wiki : 

&gt;Payments were suspended for one year in June 1931 as proposed by U.S. president Herbert Hoover in the ""Hoover Moratorium"", and ended at the Lausanne Conference of July 1932.[2] About one-eighth of the initial reparations had been paid. Following the Second World War, the London Conference (1953) required Germany to resume payment on the money borrowed to pay for reparations. The final installment of this repayment was made on 3 October 2010.[3]"

I for one say that people *should* look at things they don't like.  I never cared for ""Friendship is Witchcraft,"" (batten down the hatches and prepair for fanboys!) but I've still watched most of it's installments.  I don't like Creepy Pastas, but I listen to MrCreepyPasta's readings on a regular bases.

Why would I do this?  Because now I don't only know what I don't like, I know why.  Because I thoroughly understand the material why I dislike the material, I learn a little about my tastes and personality.

Does this give the pests of the internet, the ones known as Flamers, the right to flame on things they dislike?  Nope.  Respectful decision should be encouraged.  People should be able to present their likes, dislikes and reasoning behind in a safe environment.  I theorize that if give the proper outlet to talk about these things, most of the Flamers (but not all,) will slowly die out.

nevertruly,AskWomen,1390224329.0,"As you are defining this as a ""player"", in my experience, there is a certain type of woman that goes for players just like players tend to be a certain type of man. They end up hooking up together because they see the type of interactions they have with each other as desirable. To a woman who isn't into players, the same things that attract the woman who is will generally repel a woman who isn't. I've met very few ""players"" that didn't immediately telegraph that through their interactions with women, so my assumption is that most of the women who fall for players are looking for at least some of those traits (this isn't to say that some players aren't good at hiding/manipulating unsuspecting women, just that, from what I have seen, many of the women who go out with players seem to do so consistently so there must be something about players that they find attractive).

To me, personally, a player generally stands out like a used car salesman, doesn't feel genuine, and from a quick conversation you can pretty clearly figure out what his interests and habits are both from what he says and what he doesn't say. I've never been interested in that, so I never went out/went home/gave them any of my time.

As an aside, there are female players as well and I think these things go for them and the men they see as well."

What is important is to look at the market cap of Bitcoin.  This is the total USD value of all Bitcoin in circulation.  Currently, it sits at roughly $10 Billion.  By contrast, Facebook has a market cap (ie, the total USD value of all it's shares of stock) of $150B.  Apple has a market cap of $500B.  Gold has a total world value of roughly $8T.  Some people have estimated that total world currency value is $51T, but I'm not sure I believe that number.  So, if you believe Bitcoin will achieve Gold Market cap parity (ie, $8T), then that requires the price per BTC to be $800,000 per coin.  At a minimum, I believe it will reach the value of Facebook within 5 years, which means we're looking at a 15x increase in value. "

Of course you have, everyone has. Get-godhood-quick schemes are *everywhere* and every conman with a lick of sense is selling them. They get your money in exchange for some nonsense along the lines of ""buy this particular candle and use it this particular way and you get infinite wishes"".

Every berk wishes that he could just say the three right words at the right time or learn a few fancy spells(and use them in a clever way) and punch overgods in the face the next moment.

But it never quite works out that way, does it? Get-rich-schemes are nonsense and get-godhood-quick schemes are equally nonsensical.

You wanna know *why* it never works out?

Because the Lady of Pain got there first.

She was just another shmuck eons ago, till she found a loophole in the laws of magic and then BAM!, she was punching gods in the face and ruling over the best piece of real estate in the multiverse.

Sigil ain't no prison for her. She can leave anytime she pleases. It's her *watchtower*. From Sigil, she can see the whole multiverse and keep her position as number one. Anyone tries to exploit any loopholes and they're flayed to the bone a year *before* they even *think* of exploiting the loopholes. You gotta be *really* clever to slip past her radar.

That's why she's such a mystery. She doesn't want anyone to figure out how she ascended or they might be able to find a weakness.

As for why she doesn't want any divinities near her place or why she doesn't wanna be worshiped? Sorry man, I'd tell you, but I don't want to wake up flayed.

For what it's worth, I do not recommend it based on the strength of the pilot episode, because I know that some people will not have it 'click' for them to way it did for me. 

Some people gravitate more towards television that is obviously trying to work to keep them engaged with a near constant stream of what-if scenarios that leads the viewer down a particular path and makes them alternately exclaim, ""I want to know what happens next"" and ""I didn't see that coming.""

The Wire left me with, ""I'm not sure where this is going, but with this array of characters, it feels like it's going to be amazing. I'm in."""

Resign Edelman. See if there's any way we can get rid of Amendola that saves us some cap. If not, try to trade for whatever we can get, he is not worth his paycheck.

In the draft, start looking for a replacement for Wilfork. Get a second TE who can catch. Not necesarily for 2TE sets, but for depth at least. Get some more depth for the o-line.

I'm torn on Talib. On one side, our defense is so much better with him in. On the other, he can never stay healthy to be a factor when it counts. I'd try to get him back for cheap, if not possible let him go and try to work with Dennard and Ryan.

&gt; If there's anything in particular you'd like me to open source I'll be happy to opensource it :)

I mean... Everything. The whole piece of software I have running on my phone.

It's not a matter of money -- I paid. It's a matter of freedom.

Freedom of my fellow users to check for privacy-related things, for example. Or to make changes that you might not want to make yourself (like, for example, my recent suggestion for multicolored top bars). I mean, I don't want to imply that you're an asshole -- I trust you, I like you, but... I still want to be able to see the source code for *everything*. And I think, given your past promises, I think it's pretty reasonable.

Is money the only concern? I think you'd still be able to sell Reddit Sync on the play store. You can ask, kindly, that others not compete with you there.

Ostrololo,AskReddit,1390225599.0,"The first half of season 3 was terrible. All characters were essentially reset, everyone making stupid decisions, imbecility upon imbecility. Plus it has a colossal amount of plot points that were just conveniently forgotten:

* Mama Petrelli tells Hiro he has to unearth Adam because he knows things. He literally gets killed 5 minutes later.

* Hiro sees the world is going to explode in the future. This is never mentioned again.

* Mama Petrelli has a weird prophetic dream that never comes to fruition and the future it shows is never heard of again.

* Speaking of which, the futures don't even make sense. Future Peter comes from a timeline where superhumans are persecuted. Fine. Then he brings Present Peter to the future...and it's nothing like that. Instead everyone is superhuman.

* Peter absorbs Future Sylar's ability to understand things because that's is needed to analyse the timeline and fix it. This plot arc is completely forgotten since Peter loses his abilities 10 minutes later.

* Nathan is resurrected because magic.

Papa Petrelli was a stupid villain whose major power was Diablos Ex Machina and whose motives were none. Oh god, that part where Hiro has a fairly sentimental scene with his mother (in the past) where he promises to protect the catalyst, then Papa Petrelli pops in literally 30 seconds later and steals it. Jesus H Christ.

And by Jove, the Sylar with mommy/daddy issues plotline. Why? How did the writers thing this was a good idea?

Plus, they switched the series's theme and tone from ""ordinary people trying to understand their extraordinary abilities"" to ""extraordinary people doing extraordinary things"". I mean, if you like superhero comics, that's fine, but it wasn't why I started watching the show."

What type of floors do you have in your bedroom? Carpet? Wood? Tile/Stone?

If its on something hard like tile or wood you might try putting some rubber pads under the places where the bed contacts the floor; this will lessen structural born noise transmission. 

Unfortunately there is not a whole lot you can do about airborn noise transmission unless you want to spend a boat load of money."

JAOM is the blunt heavy object recipe of the mead world. It is not subtle or nuanced, has some deep flaws, but relies upon overwhelming sweetness and spice to make up for its other issues. You can make an orange spiced mead with wine yeast and normal racking procedures, and end up with better results. And, of course, leave out the orange pith.

progbuck,AskWomen,1390226389.0,"Keep in mind two things. First, very young women, think 18 to 20, don't have much experience with *men* and therefore aren't even entirely familiar with what they want. They've only recently stopped fawning over high school heartthrobs, and they were told it was creepy to find an older man attractive.

Second, while many women fund the *masculine* man attractive, keep in mind that that doesn't mean sloppy. You can have a bit of ""cushion"" and lots of hair, but that doesn't mean you don't have to groom and you can let your moobs grow bigger than hers. You still need to be fit and clean.

This doesn't add up. Even the abstract fear that this *might* hurt the business model in some way is not worth stopping people from doing something good for the campus, let alone actively censoring the website, and fighting a shitstorm of negative publicity.

It looks to me more like Yale is having an issue with whoever the fuck holds the copyright to their course descriptions. Why they don't own their own is beyond me, but that seems like the much more likely motivator here.

Edit: Okay, it appears that the copyright holders might be the faculty members, individually. This makes sense. And adding copyright to the voice of faculty bitching, the whole thing makes sense, I think. Still, at this point, the shitstorm is loud enough that I'd guess Yale would give up."

I was 17 and needed money like no tomorrow. I just couldn't find a job that paid well. So after applying to tons of random ads on Craigslist, these people call me up one day to come in for an interview.

I had no idea who they were, but I figured I applied to so many places, what the hell. Right when I got there, I knew something was wrong--everyone was crowded in this assembly hall room. They all asked if we wanted to make $15 an hour and this is in a room full of people who look just as clueless as me, but of course they responded with enthusiasm. Then they told us we could sell Cutco knives and make our own appointments at people's houses to demonstrate them. We just had to buy the knives first (for $200, but they were valued at over $500, what a bargain!@#). Then they started breaking it all down and I realized it was a scheme to get you to buy a set of knives and go door to door like a shmuck, simply peddling the Cutco name. After they called me into the room to offer me a job (and remember, a $200 set of knives), I told them I was NOT interested and did not want to be contacted anymore.

**TL:DR** - Stay away from Cutco Knives and Vector Marketing. It's a scam. You'll buy a set of knives and kick yourself in the ass."

I think the 'model clothes' aren't really made for models but for tall,skinny people with at least B-C cups. Which, unless you are extremely lucky, doesn't quite happen.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AdviceAnimals,1390226865.0,"i love shit comments like that on reddit, the old ""if they aren't hurting anyone what's the problem"".

Just as i dont let a child eat whatever it wants, becuase ultimately the one who suffers is the child but is currently unaware of it.

people who engage in ludicrously socially awkward hobbies are stiffling their own happiness and acceptance in society.

you can stubbornly believe you are ""unique"" and ""Independent"" as much as you like, the truth is all of us are hard-wired and  built to seek and find rewarding social acceptance and esteem.

engaging in something that indicates you have no social awareness will indicate to others that social approval is not significant to you, and as a result you will be socially isolated.

Its actually normal and healthy TO CARE how you are viewed by society at large, and by seeming like you don't (unless you have some amazing apptitude that actually shows you are above societies level, i.e game changers and iconoclasts), people's hostility is actually a bizarre form of empathy.

edit: true to form Reddit's neckbeard credentials spring forth, you realise dissaproving my comment and any hostility is excluding me from this ""Reddit group"" legitimises my viewpoint, as i am being outcast from the ""Outcasts"". which is actually a very positive thing in my view

yourpants,WritingPrompts,1390227166.0,"I want it all.

For as long as I can remember I've been shy, awkward, out of sight, and generally unnoticed. I tend to hug the sidelines and hide among the shadows, and sometimes people catch a glimpse of who I am in social situations. For one reason or another, some may begin to inquire: ""What do you like? What gets you going?"" Or at least that's what I asked myself during my formative years. But now, after a quarter of a lifetime, I've solved it: I crave control in every facet of life.

Sacrifice your secrets. Lend me your doubts and fears. Surrender your inner desires to my hand. Give me everything. There is nothing you keep that should not be shared with me. I wish to dominate, or at the very least observe, every aspect of your existence. Your passwords, personal thoughts, nudity, etc. Anything you would not normally reveal should be mine for the taking.

I'm not proud of my pride. This power, this ego...it's an addiction I've sustained for quite some time. I've even used shady, underhanded practices to obtain the information I need to feel alive and confident in my peers' mindsets and attitudes. It's so dark, yet so...satisfying.

But I'm not a bad person. I'm not. Really. Is a lust for data really so selfish? Who wouldn't want to be omniscient, if only for a day? True understanding of the people around you; wouldn't you want it too? Imagine the immense influence you could obtain in your life if only you had the right stats to work with...knowing the correct answer to every question. And especially that one question in particular: ""Who are you?""

Well, I'm you, aren't I? I perfectly perceive the abstract classified material you call your personality. As long as I'm inside of your head, my identity doesn't matter. But yours does. At least to me.

So come, then. Be a dear and open your mind, would you? It's so deliciously beautiful. I just can't get enough. For me? Please?"
1989hmmm,AskReddit,1390227167.0,"I found out about it, confronted her about it, had a really long argument over it then she started apologising and crying etc. I ended up staying with her, barely spoke to her for a couple of weeks despite living together. Slowly started to move on from it, dated for a while long and then she dumped me over the phone, for a new guy while I was at an awards ceremony for a business I set up. 

That's the point I realised I hadn't forgiven her, just accepted it happened. It didn't really surprise me it had happened, more disappointed me, but I wasn't expecting it, despite the fact that's how we got together in the first place. I guess I should have been expecting it looking back.

I don't trust her, I found out afterwards that she cheated on me multiple times but it's not the only reason I don't trust her, she used to lie a lot to get her own way. 

My only other serious ex cheated as well, this time with her previous boyfriend that she was still in love with, I expected it those times. In fact I knew it was going to happen. Every time she suggested I shouldn't come see her at the weekend or spend more time with my family it was because he was coming over. I just ignored the fact it was clearly happening. 

Both of those relationships I was in a bad place and if someone liked me it was great so I didn't want to make that stop when even I didn't like myself. That's probably the main reason I actually put up with it all and tried to ignore it."

hornwalker,musictheory,1390227303.0,"Music theory is how we understand how music works and what it is doing.    Why does one thing sound good and another thing sound less good?  This kind of question is what music theory looks to answer. 

Over time we have learned a lot about music and how it works, and we used the theory to construct new and better music.  In fact now we know so much that we can craft songs relatively easy.  We know how all the different elements of music come together to make something that people enjoy.  Melody, harmony, timbre, tempo, and rhythm all come together and our knowledge of those things is called music theory. 

Without this knowledge, someone can put a song together, but inevitably they will come across a problem, such as ""what chord should come next"".  Their lack of music theory knowledge is the problem, because if they knew more they could easily figure out all or most of the solutions and choose the one they think makes the most sense with the song.

Tuccker,edmproduction,1390227310.0,"It entirely depends if you plan on releasing your music independently in the future and avoid labels and publishers all together. If so it would be a good idea so that you have full control over your music instead of sending it off and putting faith in another person.

Xnfbqnav,TumblrInAction,1390227318.0,"There are a few reasons. I will preface this by saying that you can never 100% create a safe space, especially on the Internet, and that it's absolutely asinine to think that your tumblr blog can ever be qualified as a legitimate safe space, but a room in a university that is clearly in use is a pretty good barrier on its own.

So, first off, a safe space creates a place where you might feel more comfortable discussing certain things that you wouldn't want to let people who are necessarily not having the same experiences in on. For instance, I won't ever really discuss my breasts in detail with my cis friends, but I will talk about it with other trans people.

A safe space also provides a place where you can talk with people and not have people from outside of the group saying messed up shit and then needing it to be explained to them why exactly that's bad. I know there's the whole ""it's not my job to educate you"" shtick, and if you refuse to educate people, you shouldn't expect people to change, but sometimes I'm just not up to explaining why I don't want to talk about the status of my genitals or that, no, I don't want to be like the hermaphrodites in my porn, if that were even possible.

There's some other stuff, much of it concerning sexual predators, but those are the two things I've found safe spaces to be helpful in."

With an older building its often the previous tenant/occupant was fine with it for 20 years but to the new guy the level is unacceptable. There may be NOTHING you can do to make this neighbor happen.

Try tightening every screw, bolt etc. If your carpet is on the thinner side you might still try putting some rubber pad under the point where it contacts the carpet. Don't go with foam, it will flatten out under the type of loads we are talking about and be useless.

Beyond that; if you take all of those steps and you STILL get notes it may just be your new neighbor is very sensitive to noise. At that point there is nothing much you can do besides not having sex in your bed. Quite honestly; screw your neighbor. If you want to have sex at 9 or 10 or 11; go for it."

TheEggKing,AdviceAnimals,1390227331.0,"Think of me what you will, but I'd like to put in my thoughts on this. Full disclaimer: I watch MLP.  

&gt;and trying to have something in common with a 5yr old.  

At no point did I or anyone I've talked to (anecdotal, I know, but it's what I've got) ever say that the purpose of watching the show was to get closer to children. The show is watched because people like it. It's true of every show that gets watched.  

&gt;If you see a football player with an odd interest in children, a red flag goes up. If you see a dentist with a weird interaction with children, a red flag goes up. If you see a brony, well shit.  

Watching a cartoon show isn't synonymous with being interested in children, though. I like Samurai Jack too, is that me taking an ""odd interest in children""?  

&gt;But I've also had to deal with the fact that she'll probably be waiting in line with a bunch of creepy 20-30 year old men, who'll try to talk to her.  

With all due respect, why in the world would a random 20-30 year old man at a con want to talk to your daughter? She's too young to really participate in any conversation, and with her dad (you) standing right next to her it would obviously be creepy as hell. Nobody wants to get labelled as a pedophile, wrongly or rightly. The only people I can see trying to start up a conversation with your daughter are the fans that have genuine psychological illnesses or dysfunctions, but those are inherent to every fanbase.  

&gt;Imagine you're 5, and you're into Ninja Turtles, and every toy you want is priced for 20-somthings with disposable income, and every comic is sold out because you can't get them before the fucking college students buy them up.  

It sounds an awful lot like the craze a while back over the Star Wars action figures. That may or may not be a fair comparison, but it's an example of a similar situation."

So until I was maybe 6/7 ish, I thought that you needed a man and woman to want a baby, and the act of them both wanting the baby was what caused the pregnancy.

We also had a book that I think was called ""the body book"", which talked about a woman's ""baby-making hole"", and had simple cartoon-ish illustrations.  I don't remember my parents explaining it to me specifically, but then as a kid it wasn't very interesting to me."

FIFA 14 is an entirely different game on the PS4 than it was on the 360/PS3.

Ghosts isn't that great, your same old COD probably worse than the previous ones.

AC4 is like all the other AC's with a different theme, although it does look stunning and the sailing aspect is fun.

From what I've heard you need to of played the previous and be a fan of the Killzone series to appreciate Shadowfall. 

I'd assume the NBA games are in a similar position to FIFA.

I've played BF4 on PC, both the campaign and multiplayer and I think it is probably the best game for the PS4 currently, the campaign is outstanding in my opinion and although the multiplayer is a bit iffy currently they're certainly updating it as we go along and is no doubt probably my favourite game currently.

prodikl,AskMen,1390227913.0,"Pick up the book ""Models: Attract women through honesty""

It's not a ""pick up"" book or anything, but it sheds a lot of light on dating / meeting girls.

That said, I met my current gf at a bar/club and just walked up to her and her friend and said ""hey, you friendly?"" with a smile on my face. She ended up not speaking English, but we speak a mutual language. I ""guessed her job"" and told her she looked like an accountant, we laughed. I told her she looks like a bad girl and her friend looks like a nice girl. Touch a bit, high five, talk about the atmostphere, talk about what she's up to, tell a related story of your own. We went karaoke afterwards and been dating a bit now.

My previous one was similar, at a bar. I walked up to her table (4 girls) and said ""hey, you guys friendly?"" Chat with her friends, chat with her, tell her she's cute, tell her she's silly, high five, round of drinks.

Neither of these girls did I kiss on the first night, and I didn't sleep with either one until a few dates later.

That book kind of discusses why the approach can be great. The riskier the situation, the ballsier you have to be to go up to her, right? You open yourself up for rejection, showing her your vulnerability. People who are comfortable in vulnerable situations are confident and comfortable with themselves.

So if I approach a girl it's ""damn, she has 2 dudes and 4 girls at her table, and her table's right next to the stage. this is going to be awesome."" And after you start chatting, find out if she's fun, if you have similar interests, etc. 

If you don't, you just made a friend! If you get the door slammed in your face, your hide's that much thicker. You didn't die or lose an arm, right? You'll become more comfortable with social vulnerability and realize it's no big deal.

So in a way, ""JUST TALK TO HER LOL"" is true, because without that, there's zero chance of making any connection. But after that, what do you say? Go in with the mindset of ""I wonder what she's all about"" instead of ""I hope she'll like me."" Girls can smell that shit a mile away"

Unfortunately, that is the nature of the game. If you really want the place, OP, my advice is to get on a month-to-month lease and resolve yourself to stick it out til it's done.

Tarnsman4Life,BDSMcommunity,1390228064.0,"Your kid is only 7 months old; is it possible she has some sort of postpartum depression that is making things worse? Does she generally seem unhappy?

Something I found from having a 24/7 slave for almost 7 years, stress tends to hit women in the sex drive a lot harder than it does men. Not to say theirs no effect but through the stressful times of our lives my girl was definitely the one ""less in the mood"" to have fun time.


I do not mean to be so depressing on a Monday morning but if her drive wasn't there before the kid, odds are this may just be how she is. If you try to bring up the whole ""what kinky stuff are you into in the bedroom"" thing over and over she may get tired of hearing it and shut down further. The only other advise I could offer would be to try something spontaneous; try being more forceful, dirty talk, a new position, a rough spanking, etc.

Twitchh,TalesFromRetail,1390228066.0,What an odd statement. 
thro_way,changemyview,1390228068.0,"That paper says the opposite of what you are saying, that being intoxicated contributes greatly to one's risk of being raped.  It even gives a list of reasons why alcohol contributes to sexual assault.

&gt;Working along the logic of ""women who drink are more likely to be raped"" is as helpful as working along the logic of ""Women who socialise are more likely to be raped"" or ""Women who are alone with men are more likely to be raped"".

Both of those statements are true as well.  The correlation between being blackout drunk and rape, however, is much stronger than the correlation between socializing and rape or being alone with men and rape, and choosing not to become blackout drunk is much less detrimental to most people's quality of life than choosing not to socialize or choosing not to be alone around men.  

Because of this, many women consider the utility of a decreased risk of rape valuable enough to justify the loss of the utility of getting blackout drunk.  In the case of socialization or being alone around men, the decreased risk that would result from giving these things up is not useful enough to justify the loss of utility that these things provide.

That's the difference between abstaining from becoming blackout drunk, and abstaining from socializing.  The former is what many people consider a positive tradeoff, the latter is not.

&gt;There are people who say that being blamed for being a rape victim because they were drunk when they were assaulted harmed them. That is proof of harm. The obvious example is Daisy Coleman.

If a rape victim were to say that not teaching kids about the risks of being blackout drunk at a party was harmful, would that be proof of harm?"

People advance and regress in ways that make no sense whatsoever -- one minute they're dying of cancer and too weak to close a door with their powers, the next they're chopping off hands with their minds. Most plot advancements make next to no sense because basically everyone has new powers as the plot demands, which are generally only demonstrated *after* they would be relevant, and are never explored or explained. Death is totally meaningless since there are multiple ways of coming back from it -- this in a series where there are probably 1-2 deaths per episode, and they're all played like they matter. Nobody behaves like a normal human being, or even a realistic psychopath.

In both cases I personally prefer *high* [90-110] FoV for better sights of surroundings etc. When desk gaming, which is 99.99% of the time for me, high FoV is must so I don't get headache.

I think a lot of games, especially when ran on older HW, disagree with yours assessment that FoV doesn't affect performance of the game. Lower the FoV less is rendered on screen at any given time, which in return uses less HW and this way decent FPS's can be achieved. On more graphically demanding games you can see FoV's affect on FPS.

I think you must admit that it's little bit hilarious when current-gen FPS game using Dx 9 engine as far I know, that is 6v6, is ran at 720p at 55-65 FoV. I hope they don't forget to unlock FoV for PC like many developers do and is then unlocked in later patches."

Dantilli,IWantToLearn,1390228856.0,"Right, I don't mean this to brag or anything, but I've always been told I have very good common sense, even from a young age. I've also always been told I do everything really slowly. Not really THAT slow, but often take twice as long as someone else, especially when cooking (on the plus side though, I always have every part of a meal ready simultaneously. Taking my time has given me a damn good sense of timing).

I'm certain that it's because I take my time and give myself time to think that I have such a practical way of thinking. I also, no matter what I do, focus on the task at hand and any way it could be improved. Even if it is doing something as simple as washing up. I don't let my thoughts wander or get distracted, it's full concentration from start to finish.

You say you're really good at focussing while doing your job right? think about how you feel when you're working compared to doing other tasks. Really close your eyes and feel how it feels when you're sat at your computer. Now, try and apply that feeling to other tasks, get so involved wth them that you gain a natural intution for the task at hand. Sounds ridiculous, but that's what it feels like to me when I'm doing anything. I almost never ""think"", it's all just as intuitive as your work is for you.

Also, remember that there might not be immediate results. Concentrating may not seem to make a difference at first but it will. If you really struggle, I think mindfulness meditation is really good for this. Helps you focus and whatnot, really good stuff, go google it.

Hope this helps. Especially the third paragraph, I'm quite proud of it :) .

codayus,feedthebeast,1390229227.0,"&gt; I'm using the latest Gregtech build with DW20 and...

Yes, very nice, and those mod interactions have always been one of GTs shining strengths.  But I'm talking about the direction things are heading.  Everything you listed was true in the original Mindcrack pack, and quite a lot more besides.

For a good example of what I'm talking about, let's look at your next point:

&gt; IIRC IC2 Machine were made of ""Refined Iron"". Stick an ingot in a furnace or stick it in a metal former - where is the difference?  I think the new way is actually better.

The difference is all those mod interactions you just listed.  Adding a smelting recipe for iron -&gt; refined iron is simple, and lets you use a hundred mods to smelt that refined iron.  

&gt; Smelting can't be done in a crafting table, the hammer can be used in your 2x2 crafting grid.

Actually, I know of at least two mods that let you smelt in a crafting grid, but that's besides the point.

Saying that you ""can"" use the hammer sort of glosses over the fact that nobody actually *wants* to use the hammer; it's a time and resource sink designed to tide you over until you get the metal former that nobody actually wants to build because it's actually just an expensive incompatible magic furnace block for creating refined iron instead of, as you used to be able to do, using your TE induction smelter or whatever.  We went from a world where you took iron and fed it into your existing smelting infrastructure to get our ""basic IC2 resource"", and now we have a world where we have a more difficult and complicated path to get the same basic resource. 

&gt;  I think the new way is actually better.

No.  It really, really isn't.  It was designed very specifically to be worse, because the IC2 devs believe that their vision for IC2 requires the basic IC2 resource (refined iron, iron plate, whatever the label says) to be harder to get.  Which is fine; maybe the mod overall is better for it.  (Hint:  No.)  But let's not pretend that this step has been changed in any way other than to make it slower and more tedious.

And then there's the wire, and the item casings, and all the other ways that IC2 is moving away from ""take resources, put them in crafting grid/furnace, get new resources out"" to using its own magic blocks and tools.  There's no way to spin it:  That reduces mod interactions.  Every mod interaction you listed is a holdover from the pre-experimental IC2 days.  What you *didn't* list:  How you can use other mods to make your bronze item casings, or your uninsulated copper cable.  Because you can't.  But you used to be able to."

No. I'm so sick of bronies trying to make this about ALL comics and cartoons. MLP is so specifically targeted for little girls that it changes things. Admit that to yourself.  

Okay, so if a grown *woman* watched Samurai Jack, would *that* be weird? Because SJ was a show marketed towards little boys, so saying that it wouldn't be weird is a double standard. I feel more like you're projecting your personal issues with the whole situation onto the adult MLP fanbase. And besides that, you're dodging my point. *Taking an interest in a cartoon show, regardless of that cartoon show, is not synonymous with taking an interest in children.*  

&gt;Comicon has a kid's day, you asshat.  

I'm poor, and so I've never gotten to go, nor have I ever felt any whimsical, pressing need to check whether or not Comicon had a kid's day. Should I apologize for not being omniscient, since my lack of all knowledge in the universe has clearly offended you? While we're on the subject of Comicon, by the way, if it *has* a kid's day, then why be worried about adults? Like, I'm genuinely confused here.  

&gt;Believe it or not, the entire world isn't just for you.  

I'm fully aware of that, and at no point did I claim or assert otherwise.  

&gt;Maybe if you'd stop trying to live your life like a child, you'd realize that.  

The fact that I happen to watch a particular TV show doesn't really say anything about how I live my life. And honestly, in regards to your daughter, I'd be less concerned about adult MLP fans and more worried about your latent anger issues."

dakboy,personalfinance,1390229637.0,"It really depends on that *type* of real estate that your REITs work in. Not all real estate is the same and some types do very well in down markets (for example, if mortgage interest rates go up, apartments will be in higher demand).

Just because you're holding a mortgage (which should be a very long-term single investment that you're also getting immediate utility from), it shouldn't mean that you avoid any other real estate related investment.

That Vanguard REIT fund appears to be diversified across commercial, residential and hotels, but I don't have time to look up the exact mix. But even then, within a particular company, they're likely diversified at least geographically (different markets), if not in lines of business (commercial vs. residential). For example, if a given REIT company has 200 apartment complexes in 2 dozen cities, they can weather a down market in Des Moines because they've got stuff outside Boston buoying them."

That said, they're both on their last legs, and my father's thinking about replacing them with a W201 (Which I will certainly try to change to an E34 5er). If you want one because you like them, try to find a W124 before settling for a W123. Mine're only 6 years apart but the driving experience is much better.

xadriancalim,dogs,1390229938.0,"Thanks for the helpful post.  Our Charlie is a rescue and we weren't told he had seizures.  We contacted the original owner and they confirmed that he did have seizures, about 1 every 3 months.  Since we got him he's averaged one every 8 days.  We've tried different foods and drugs but they seem to be getting worse.  The vet initially put him on phenobarbital and then added zonisamide saying we needed to ween him off pheno.  He's also taking allergy meds, we noticed he tends to sneeze a lot before attacked.  We've been trying to do a no grain diet, hi carbs, but the rosemary thing we just discovered.  Anyway, the vet said to get him off pheno so we stopped and he had a seizure every two hours.  We haven't been able to sleep or go anywhere, we have to take off work.  I mean, there's not much to do for him when he's seizing other than clean the drool off his chin or any pee/poop.  So, he's back on phenob and if the vet wants him off, he has to take him home with him. -__^

I'm really worried it's a tumor.  We haven't had that scan done yet.  All the blood work, tests, meds are really adding up.  But if this doesn't improve I'm not sure on average a seizure every couple days is good for him.  I can't imagine he'll be able to survive long like this."

TheEggKing,AdviceAnimals,1390230446.0,"&gt;No, it wouldn't. This is about MLP, and bringing up other comics and shows just isn't going to go anywhere.  

Your issue with the MLP fanbase is that they're grown men watching a cartoon show marketed towards and intended for little girls. My example with Samurai Jack and grown women is a perfectly valid comparison, and simply sticking your fingers in your ears and shouting ""BUT MLP IS JUST SOOOOOOOO GIRLY THOUGH"" isn't a valid argument.  

&gt;That's why bronies get so much shit, and endlessly they say 'but, but, what about Samurai Jack?', and we're not having that conversation, are we?  

We're having a conversation about cartoons and the people that watch them. You're badmouthing the fans of one show while shouting loudly that examples of other shows and their fanbases don't count, but it doesn't work that way. What's fair for one fanbase is fair for another, or you're a hypocrite. And if you acknowledge that you're a hypocrite then you're acknowledging that your issue with the adult MLP fanbase is a matter of personal bias, not grounded truth.  

&gt;There's a difference.  

In the simplest phrasing possible, what is the difference? Please, I really do want to understand here.  

&gt;There IS something wrong with you. Everyone sees this but you, and the small percentage of people with the same problem.

Then get it out there and see how *he* takes that. If he doesn't want to pursue the relationship because of that, good riddance (is what they say to us short men who get spurned be women because of our stature).

&gt; I PERSONALLY DO NOT want to be with a guy that is an obvious difference shorter then me.

Then you should also accept that maybe he has the same preference for shorter girls. You do not want to confront him by posing as a 5'8"" girl and end up meeting him as a 6'2"" specimen. Men have been keelhauled on OKCupid for adding 1"" :-)

&gt; When a girl is taller then a guy that can make them instantly feel intimidated

Once again, 'some guys'. That doesn't mean he's going to be one of them. He might take issue with it, but he might not care one bit as well. I know you want to stay in this 'wonder world' for a bit longer, but you'll have to meet face to face at one point in time.

&gt; Not to mention tall guys aren't usually into tall girls which is why a lot of tall girls end up with short guys

Not if you believe this subreddit. They love tall girls. At 6' however, he's not a tall guy, he's average-ish, and at the exact point where you are 'noticeably' taller. This might or might not be an issue for him.

Also, average men tend to inflate their height on dating websites, prepare for him to be 5'10"" and not 6'.

&gt; Im turning 17 &amp; Hes turning 18

And there's your most important piece of information: this will not be the end of the world, even if it feels like it at the time.
Get your 6'2"" out there and get some face-time (not the apple kind) with guys.

Anyway, good luck to the both of you!

But another example would be a girl who thinks the same way as I do, we have a lot more in common than the first girl, but I have more difficulty keeping a conversation going. I'd say I'll have an easier time being with the latter type of girl, because once you get to know them a bit better, get comfortable around each other, you'll have less trouble keeping a conversation going.

i.e. that 'jury-rig' is an old nautical term and implies a temporary fix which will be removed and replaced with a more correct/permanent solution at a later (hopefully not too much later) date, while 'jerry-built' implies a more permanent construction/installation which is shoddy and prone to failure. 'Jerry-rig' seems to just be an amalgamation of the two.

Both could even be used to describe the same thing. Having the hose split mid-journey and using a Pringles can you have knocking around in the footwell to get you driving again just so that you can get home ASAP? That's jury-rigging. You improvised a working solution to get you home quick and safe, and should be praised for it.

Leaving said solution in as a permanent fix rather than getting it swapped out for a correct part as soon as you were able/it was pertinent (Of course ""When is it pertinent?"" might be ""When i'm about to sell the car"")? That's now a jerry-built solution. It's not the correct part, it's a quick bodge that is probably more likely to fail than the correct solution, and it gives a bad impression to anyone looking as to the overall quality of the vehicle."

Whether its Carter, Clinton, Obama or whoever, they all seem to change what they 'supported' coincidentally after they either have no power or nothing lose.

&gt;Republicans can't force Clinton to fire his own staff, he chose to do that.

That's short-sighted reasoning. Obviously they can't physically do it themselves, but they can force his hand. Clinton can either succumb to their political pressure or commit political suicide and have it used against him. He would have had to, only because of the ignorance of the right."

Paul_Dirac_,Pathfinder_RPG,1390231371.0,"I personally think, a well balanced group consists of the following roles:

**The Tank**: Someone who stands in the first row,  and gets (or doesn't get) hit by the enemy. 

**The Damage Dealer**: Show me a group, where this one is missing.

**The Healer**:Natural healing is awfully slow in Pathfinder. So the group needs someone who can provide out of combat healing.
(anyone who can use a wand:cure light wounds qualifies even a rogue with high UMD)

Optional roles:

**The Buffer**: someone who increases your ability to do your job.

**The Debuffer**: someone who hinders your enemy.

**The Skillmonkey/Trapfinder**: So your DM can throw traps at you.


Ok, so what roles are already filled?

**The Tank**: not so much. The druid(and his companion) is somewhat beefy but he lacks the RK of a true Fighter or the TP of a barbarian.
He could of course conjure a meat shield. But your group is definitely lacking in this regard.

**The Damage Dealer**: If you manage to  set up the ninja's and your rogues sneak attack you have enough. Also the ranger does a decent job.

**The Healer**: A Druid does  a good job, especially, if he gets a wand.

**The Buffer**: The druid, but he might run into problems with action economy.

**The Debuffer**: The Druid. His entangle spells are deadly.

**The Skillmonkey/Trapfinder**: Rogues 'nuff said.

So I would recommend a Cleric. For more tankiness (get Armor Proficiency Heavy and grap a full plate and a large shield ASAP.) and more buffing. 
Note: your group is somewhat weak against enemies immune to sneak attack. Therefore you might want an cleric who channels negative energy and get the feat channel smite (no save roll) or selective channeling for save channeling.

Alternatively I would recommend a fighter (More tankiness) or a  paladin (THE TANK). Always with heavy armor and a shield.

The second you try to explain anything about Japan's history in an objective context, even admitting their war crimes, you will people throwing references to Nanking, Yasukuni, and Unit 731 while at the same time accusing you of white-washing history. On one hand I understand it since some of those redditors have Japanese colonialism in their history, but at the same time they refuse to let it go.

Same goes for Article 9 discussions. I am in full favor of Japan having full self-determination, and with that goes a military, but too many people seem to think they will just go back to being an Imperial power once more."

Bitch, please. The columbians might sell the powder, but our stone ground whole wheat flour sent those coca headed powder bunnies running back into the jungle like Chaco himself was coming after them. 

We don't grow beards, we were born with them on our faces from Day One,  when we were immaculately conceived by our mothers, whose wombs are cloaked in the American flag. If you don't see us with a beard it's because we don't want you to.

With the people I dealt with, the second any thought of compensation was mentioned, the subject was dropped entirely. They wanted a baby but I guess they didn't want to pay for it until AFTER it was born. Surrogacy is a HUGE deal and it should never be taken lightly. When someone treats it like its not a big deal to sacrifice your body for 9 months even though you have no children of your own, they aren't thinking about anything but their own selfish needs."

2.) Hardcore

Maybe there's more here based in tone that we're not seeing? Maybe he's expressing a fear of his sexual desires or lack of willpower in the context of your relationship?

I think making mistakes is normal, sure--not that this excuses them, always. To answer your question, though, I wouldn't call this normal or abnormal. I'd say this is a concept that many of us do explore in the back of our heads, even if only once, and maybe he's trying to flesh out his thoughts/feelings with his significant other: you.

Like others here have said, decide what you're comfortable with. But be aware that sometimes even if you think something is alright or not alright, that can drastically change after experiencing it firsthand.

Good luck!

feralkitten,AskReddit,1390231825.0,"&gt; I totally agree. **Murder** doesn't have to just be physical. It's **murder** long before the **stabbing**.

It is funny how altering just one word can change a statement.

I sometimes want to physically assault my co-workers. But i don't. That would be murder. Those aggressive thoughts/feelings/emotions stay right in my head and no harm is done. I can go a whole day without strangling/stabbing anyone.

Likewise, i sometime wonder what it would be like to date someone else. But i don't. That would be cheating/adultery. Those thoughts/feelings/emotions stay right in my head and no harm is done. I can go a whole day without fucking another woman.

If the act of thinking something bad was a crime, we would all be in jail. Acting on those thoughts are what get you in trouble."

CaliBuddz,gaming,1390231838.0,"They definitely have more sub themes than just genre in the background but I can sum up one simple theme. Murder. There is murder in these games. They are exclusively about murder. That is literally in no way related to dancing. Unless you have like a murder dance off (would be an awesome game btw). 

And why wouldnt they take into consideration the rating a little bit. Not saying a lot but a little.  It makes sense. If you play a lot of M games then they can suggest more M games. If you only play ""happy go fun time 3"" rated E. Then recommend more E games. 

Also how am I exaggerating a comparison? A game about murder is similar to a game about murder because of the murders. A game about dancing is not similar because there is no murder. Murder is literally the main game mechanic. Everything about these games is designed so you can kill things. The whole purpose of the games is to kill. The purpose of just dance is to dance.

donaisabelle,MakeupAddiction,1390232001.0,"**Product:** Sephora Cream Lip Stain in Always Red

**Price:** $13

**Review:** I saw this being touted in this sub as some sort of miracle eating-, drinking-, and make-out-proof product. I was extremely skeptical that any lip product could actually achieve that, but it's a pretty low price point, so I thought I'd give it a go. I must say it *is* one of the most durable, long lasting lip colors I've owned - it's the only one I don't feel like I *must* wipe off before I eat, lest I look ridiculous mid-meal. However, it absolutely does *not* last perfectly through eating and drinking. I got definite fading on the inside of my lips, it's just that the fading with this product was much more gradual and much less patchy than normal products. 

I haven't tried it with making out, but if it can't make it through a sandwich, there's no way it will make it in an encounter with my fiancé's beard. I did, however, try kissing the back of my hand after the stuff had set on my lips, and there was transfer, even with relatively light contact. Remember, ladies - if it sounds too good to be true, it is. But it's still a solid product, and I see myself getting a lot of use out of it.

TimDaEnchanter,funny,1390232339.0,"So...I shouldn't argue my opinion, because it is correct and the facts I provided to back it up prove that you are wrong?  I wasn't arguing an opinion: I was presenting facts that directly proved that whatever you looked up was wrong.  Your comment wasn't ""true for the most part.""   It was false.  It stated that every public school in the US bans dodgeball if non-foam cannonballs are used, which I proved to be false using a simple counterexample.  I wasn't wrongly accusing you of misleading an inquisitive redditor.  I was displaying the truth.  If the truth disagrees with your argument, then you are the one making a fool of yourself for wrongly accusing me of wrongly accusing you.

I understand that sometimes when people look things up on the Internet, they might get incorrect or misleading information.  However, when someone proves you wrong, it is immature to just say that they are wrongly accusing you of being misleading.  I was pointing out that whatever source you got that information from was incorrect.  While an opinion may not be universal across the Internet, the truth is always the truth, whether it agrees with what you said or it doesn't.  This isn't really a big deal, but you can't just tell someone to ""stop arguing your opinion"" when they haven't even mentioned what their opinion is, and only provided a simple fact that refutes your statement.

TL;DR:  Learn what an opinion is, and what a fact is.  If you want to try to argue with someone, then you have to be able to present facts, not just insult them with blatantly incorrect statements."

I don't think there is any law or rule anywhere that says you HAVE to read a book in *X* amount of time unless it's something you are doing under a deadline for coursework.  Reading is good however you choose to do it (then again, I might be a bit biased as I like to read and my sister is a librarian).  If a book really interests me, I get obsessed and can't think straight until I've finished it and by the end it feels like I've gone on a nice, relaxing vacation and I feel energized.  The effect after that tends to last a while depending upon what sorts of scenarios, sets of interpersonal or story dynamics, and/or questions the book gives me to think about.  If a book is just OK, I tend to take a lot longer and read it only in snippets in my spare time."

Being ""alone"" is just seen as a small consequence of lifestyle choices. Sure, they might think it sucks, but it can't compare to the many issues they can point out as stressful or troublesome.

You can cause damage to nerves and body parts from prolonged and I would imagine chronic prolonged compression of nerves (limb falling asleep).  I don't know to what extent or how long it would take to develop damage, but chronic nerve compression can lead to radial neuropathy that can result in temporary or permanent nerve damage.  It seems that typically only happens to people who are medicated heavily or so drunk they do not move from positions that are otherwise uncomfortable because they simply don't feel it.

A good example of what kind of damage that can happen from chronic nerve compression is carpal tunnel syndrome.

Sorry for no links, posting from my phone.

Edit: forgot to explain what happens when it falls asleep.  Imagine if you will, you're using a really big crazy straw to drink soda.  When you want to drink, you suck on one end and cause a transmission to occur from the cup to your mouth and your draw in soda at a normal rate.  This is exactly what you expect to happen and you enjoy your soda.  Now imagine that same straw has a kink somewhere in the line but you're not aware of it.  You try to drink soda through the straw but you only get a little bit because the kink is blocking the regular flow of soda.  You find this to be irregular so you are prompted to either adjust the straw or find the source of the blockage so that you can get back to enjoying that sweet sweet soda.  You uncover the issue, correct it, and soda flows freely again.

This is essentially what happens when a limb falls asleep.  Due to a specific positioning of a body part or pressure from an outside force, you are compressing nerve channels and circulation systems (straws) from sending and receiving impulses or nutrients (soda) to and from the area behind the compressed point.  Your brain receives some of the signals that something is amiss and activates a the tingling sensation which is formally called parasthesia.  Parasthesia prompts the body to adjust and alleviate the pressure, reopening the pathways for nerves and circulation.  Once the pressure is relieved, the different nerve types basically do a system reboot and start shooting out all sorts of impulses until they are back in sync with the main system.  In this case the nerves restarting is very much like the first few seconds of a computer bootup.  The GUI loads, then your antivirus, then background programs, etc.  The order in which they reactivate depends largely on the size of the protein barriers that encase each nerve.  Pain receptors usually restart first, causing the tingling/burning sensation, usually followed by motor nerves, then the rest of the sensory nerves.  This is why you can usually move the limb but can't functionally use it for a few minutes after sensation starts to come back.  

Edit 2:  guys, I am not a doctor and my medical knowledge is very limited.  If you have a concern about your limbs falling asleep or think you might have a case of neuropathy, please call your primary care physician."

Serae,raisedbynarcissists,1390232976.0,"My mother is...a piece of work.  I moved out at 18.  I did not move out the moment I turned 18 but during the last few months of high school.  I don't think I would have been able to do it alone but I want to try to help you prepare if this is what you want to do.

I had a part time job working at a pizza place.  This was years ago and I was making $6 and hour.  It wasn't much but I got by.  My boyfriend (now husband) was the one who gave me the push to leave.  I did not have a credit card and would not until years later when I needed to start building credit.  I got a new bank account without my mother having any part of it the day I left.  I went to the post office and changed my address.  When I left I did not give her any warning.  I let many things behind and took only when I needed.

I was luck in two regards, I had support but I also had a place to go.  One of my uncle's had died and left me a small bit of property.  It was merely a one bedroom, beat up place over a garage behind my Ngrandmother's house.  It was better than nothing and that's where I went.

My mother had declined all of my college acceptance letter for me.  She told me I was rejected (I wasn't) and I was still so down trodden that I believed here...but a letter and phone call got through.  It was too late for me to go to any of those school and my spot was ""given up"" but I made it work.  I did a year at a community college and did not pay a penny to go there because financial aid covered everything, even books.  I got my general education requirements done in a year, for free, before I transferred to a state school.  I milked every opportunity for financial aid and scholarships.  Until aid and scholarship took a hit was able to cover the cost of my education until my senior year ($15k in loans that last year, but it was still less than most people).  Keep your grades up, this was a huge factor for many of the scholarships I had.

I left without notice, had a place I was ready to go to, was willing to leave things behind and to seek aid.  I got out early and I made it through.  Yes, it's hard, you will never be able to just be a full time student.  I was a full time student but sometimes I held two jobs.  It just had to be done.  I did not have health care at all.  That sucked by I managed.  This was before Obamachangewhaterforkiddosblah.

Two things to consider: renting a room.  You don't need to rent an entire apartment.  That can help you find a cheap place to go.  The second being to consider a job that can give you discounts on living expenses such as working at the grocery store.  They usually are looking for help and you will get discounts on food.  This could be helpful when cutting costs.

If you have a cell phone you will want to turn it in and get your own plan.  Just get the cheapest even if you don't have texts.  Cell phones were only just coming into commonality when I moved out.  I wasn't too concerned about it but now you may need to be.  If you find a place to stay getting a house line is often much cheaper than a cell phone.  If you can't afford it a basic internet connection and a Google Voice number can suffice.

Be prepared to leave things behind.  Be prepared for the potential explosion and then groveling to come back, but stay firm.

Leaving is not always possible for some people.  There could be ways it could backfire.  You have to be willing to make sacrifices and go without until you can get on your feet."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390233028.0,"Late to the game, but haven't read (although, could have missed), in the comments this point:

I think you can get what you want by tweaking the phrasing. This is an important tweak, it makes all the difference.

You want to look at situations in which rape happens, to examine them, think about them, and try to learn/teach how to avoid them. That, I think, makes sense. I think it makes sense, because I do it.

The difference is, I DO NOT think about 'rape victims circumstances.' I DO think about 'rapists circumstances.' 

Firstly, it satisfies what you are trying to do, (if it works, and reveals anything useful that is).  If there are patterns to the rapists circumstances, and those can be learned and looked out for, then, when possible they can be avoided. *(Sadly, in truth, I think most of the time it's not entirely possible.)*

People confide in my about their sexuality. It's a gift.

Women especially confide in me about their sex, safely, and relationships. *(It turns out I know more women that have been raped/assaulted than I do women who haven't told me they were.)*

Everytime I hear about a consent violation, an assault, or an absolutely horrific rape, I look for patterns, because I am human and we look for patterns, and because I especially like patterns.

But I'm not looking for patterns on the victims end. I'm looking for patterns about the guy/girl that committed the assault. Frequently I know of them, if I don't actually know them.  And when I don't, I ask for as much information about them as I can without being an asshole that is missing the point of the conversation.

The point on alcohol for example:

Instead of focusing on the fact the rape victims were drinking, lets look at that, in the 'college party' setting, the rapists are ALSO drinking.  Alcohol could just as easily be playing a role, but that role is lowering the guy's inhibitions, filtering out social cues he doesn't want to see, that he very well might see if he were sober. So he might not see that she's obviously not into it, and if he happens to notice, can forget it very quickly, whether or not 'forgetting' is something he wants to do.

In truth, my largest takeaways, for myself, are these (meant to be gender neutral, women can be scary too):

Someone who has trouble empathizing with others is a very dangerous person to be alone with.

Someone who is not bothered by, AND does not react to, physical distress right in front of them, is a dangerous person to be alone with.

Someone who speaks openly about how long it has been since they had sex, AND says things about how much they need sex, AND how it doesn't really matter to them how they get it, is a VERY dangerous person to be alone with. 

A drunk person has to re-earn trust on their own and does not inherit it from their sober counterpart. They are to be considered dangerous until proven otherwise.

Adults whose secret porn stash I have not seen are not to be given the benefit of the doubt by me, and are not to be left alone with children.

Adults who have not proven themselves to have physical restraint when they are absolutely furious at someone much smaller and weaker than them are to be treated as dangerous.

These are my basics, anyway.

**EDIT**
By 'rapist circumstances' I believe I mean: someone's personality/behavior + being alone with them. Being alone with someone is all the physical circumstance necessary."

thro_way,changemyview,1390233235.0,"&gt;Like I already said, there may well be (and the paper itself equivocates this) a non-zero increase in risk where a victim drinks. My point is, what can you practically do about it?

You don't see any value to being made aware of a risk?  You don't see *any* benefit to better equipping kids to make the decision of whether or not the non-zero increase in risk of rape is more detrimental than drinking is beneficial?

&gt;As I said, are you seriously advocating telling all college-age women not to drink if they don't want to be raped? 

Can you honestly not tell the difference between ""drinking increases your chances of being raped"" and ""do not drink if you don't want to be raped""?  In your eyes, those statements really seem logically equivalent? (Hint: Telling kids that risks exist is different from telling them whether they should or shouldn't take those risks.)

I'm starting to understand why you've struggled to understand the difference between causation and correlation.

Take a look at the diagrams for [Front Squat, High Bar Back Squat, and Low Bar Back Squat, respectively](http://70sbig.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/squats.jpg).

In all cases the bar is vertically in line with the middle of the foot throughout the entire lift. It should move vertically along that line, not fowards or backwards.

In the high bar squat, the bar rests on your shoulders/traps and you have a more upright back position.

In the low bar squat, the bar is below your shoulders, and as a result you have to bend at the hips more to keep it from rolling down your back.

But in neither case are the arms bearing the load of the bar. 

Like I said, in your video you seem to have the back angle of a high bar squat, but the bar position of a low bar squat, which is why I guessed your arms were probably holding the bar up.

This probably sounds rather finnicky, but trust me it's important."

We usually have 40~60 people at the service every Sunday, and the place is about 10 x 5 meters, so I do think I could use active speakers for now but we are a bit of trouble regarding our location, the owner has had some problems and we are likely to move somewhere, probably somewhere bigger and maybe after that we should switch to passive speakers.

Regarding monitors... I don't know if I should buy any, maybe later. As of now the only editing I'll be doing is clipping tracks for posting online. I do want to learn post-production but it will be a while until I have the time to invest on that. Should I still consider buying them?

TheEggKing,AdviceAnimals,1390233347.0,"&gt;No, but saying 'MLP is the ONLY cartoon who's adult fans get treated this way is a valid indicator that it stands alone' IS a valid argument  

I'm not saying that MLP stands alone. My point was drawing a comparison between it and other fanbases to show how it's not unbelievable for grown men to watch a little girls' cartoon show. If grown women can watch little boys' shows without stigma, then it's only fair if grown men can watch little girls' shows without stigma. Basically, I'm saying that adults, regardless of gender, shouldn't be given a stigma for liking or disliking any creative content since it's all subjective.  

&gt;No, we're talking about adults who watch MLP, specifically. Stop trying to act like your fanbase can be equated with, or hide behind, the general fanbase of comics and cartoons.  

The MLP fanbase is a group of people that enjoy watching MLP, just like the Samurai Jack fanbase is a group of people that enjoy watching Samurai Jack, and the GI Joe fanbase is a group of people that enjoy watching GI Joe, and so on. However, *you* have put a special rule on *only* the MLP fanbase saying that every other fanbase is okay except *that* one. I'm using comparisons to other fanbases to demonstrate the hypocrisy there. MLP *is* a cartoon, in the same vein as most other cartoons, and the fanbase for one cartoon shouldn't be inherently snubbed simply for being the fanbase of a particular cartoon any more or less so than any other fanbase should be.  

&gt;People find it creepy.  

*Some* people find it creepy. Others don't. Some find it arousing. Some find it disgusting. Some find it saddening. Some find it gladdening. Others simply don't care. Welcome to the world of opinions, where nobody is right *or* wrong.  

&gt;People find it creepy because the show ONLY has content designed to appeal to little girls.  

This is factually incorrect. The whole series is seeded with references to things that little girls couldn't understand. To name a couple off the top of my head, Doctor Who, The Big Lebowski, and the Rocky movies. While the show certainly has content that appeals to little girls, saying that it has nothing designed for adults is definitely untrue.  

&gt;THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T SEE THAT IS THE PROBLEM.  

I think the problem is, as said elsewhere in this thread, ""Because people find it threatening when someone likes what they don't"".  

&gt;It's about how there's a tiny subset of adults who find it entertaining, while EVERYONE ELSE has an almost violent creepout when they see it.  

Stop trying to speak for the entire world. If it creeps *you* out then fine, that's your opinion on it. But it goes against sense to suggest that ""everyone"" is ""violently creeped-out"" by it.  

&gt;You have to admit to yourself that just maybe that's weird, right? Just maybe MLP is like a litmus test in our society for someone being creepy and fucked up in a certain way?  

Well, using this example, who says that the ones who fail the test are the ones that like the show? If this is some grand, machiavellian scheme to sort the worlds' population (which is honestly ridiculous), then who's to say that the bronies are the ones that failed? Ultimately, you don't like the show or the fanbase, that's on you. But applying sweeping generalizations, hypocrisy, and [special pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading) are also on you, and it's intellectually dishonest not to be willing to examine your own opinions."
The_Fart_Of_God,leagueoflegends,1390233347.0,"Most of my losses are caused by strategic mistakes not by mechanical ones as everybody around my elo is more or less equivalent mechanically (kind-of-good-bad-ish bronze II).

I'm trying my best every game to gather my team around after the laning phase and make some team plays. That's where I get the most enjoyment out of league of legends.

What is the course of action when your teammate(s) don't listen to you?  Examples :

* they don't b when they should to get these last 3 minions, get caught, die.
* scout when the map is unwarded and they are alone, get caught, die.
* keep on engaging in unfavorable numbers (1v3 / 2v4 ...) when the team isn't with them, die.

Should I just give up trying to lead the team and follow the most aggressive members? 

What is the right move when my team is ahead, when my team is behind?

What is the preferred role to make strategic decisions (I believe it's support or jungler)? Should it always be the initiator?"

avantvernacular,FeMRADebates,1390233408.0,"Western culture is not a monolith. American culture is not even a monolith. Therefore, asking the question ""is western culture a srolism?"" Is like asking ""are boys tall?"" The only answer seems to be ""sometimes,"" which isn't really much of an answer at all  it certainly doesn't leave us much more informed than we were before we asked. 

That being said, if I was to hypothetically distill all of western cultures into one average, I would argue that contemporary western culture is a sort of ""half srolism."" By this I mean that this average western culture is substantially more ""srolistic"" for men than it is for women, at least contemporarily. Would this have been the same answer 40 years ago? - no, but that wasn't the question. 

There has been a substantial and very successful effort to expand the role of ""women's work"" to be wide enough such that it would not be accurately fitting the definition of a srolism. Women's work is today's west is whatever a women wants to work at. Will there bet those who balk at this idea? Of course, because western culture is not a monolith, but the overwhelming consensus is that a women can be a provider or a nurturer, or anywhere between she chooses and that this is a good thing. Our laws reasonably enforce this position, and the disdain of Midwestern housewife will have little impact on the choices of a woman in New York. 

For men however, the contemporary average of western culture seems to be mucho the a srolism by contrast. While the roles of men have expanded somewhat, the majority of western men will still face ostracism or negative social pressure if the choose the role of a nurturer over a provider, or if they choose that which was in the past seen as ""women's work.""  While there are no laws directly barring men's choice of such roles, (or not choosing ""provider"" roles) there are de facto legal pressures against it. 

Legal action against a man working a job with children, which is traditionally associated with beings woman's job, is a much more severe threat against a man. Punishment for statutory sex offenses is usually much more severe for men than women, and the presumption of innocence is often woefully lacking by both the media and administrators, where accusations alone can end a career. Additionally, the state imposes the role of a provider with much more fervor on men than women, via child support and alimony, and child support is used to enforce the only legal form of debtors prison in most western law. Comparatively, this debtors prison is is enforced approximately 8x more frequently on fathers who fail as providers than mothers, reinforcing the idea that fathers must be providers, while mothers may or may not be. 

Still, is this a true and overt srolism - no, not really. But where it is, it is more so for men. So to answer the question, ""is western culture a srolism?"" It seems still the only answer I can give is ""sometimes.""

shytemptation,changemyview,1390233470.0,"I've been sober most times I've been molested or raped. The only reason it isn't 100% of the time is that eventually my dad got impatient with waiting for me to fall asleep at night in middle school and started letting me drink a glass of wine or a margarita in the evening so he could molest me sooner (he always waited until I was asleep). My dad was a nerdy, successful middle class guy with no criminal history. To an outsider we probably looked like the spitting image of the American dream. I was completely sober when I was raped by my first real serious boyfriend. We were fairly religious and had a few talks about wanting to save P in V sex for marriage over the months we had been a couple but one day when we were fooling around with our hands like usual he decided to just shove his dick in me without any warning. I was sober the third time I was molested as well, in the middle of the day, in a day room at tech school in the air force. I was sitting on the lap of a guy I was having a fling with, watching tv in a room with about 15 or 20 people in it and the guy sitting on the couch to my right decided to just jam his hand between my thighs and feel up my crotch. The guy I was with didn't even say anything about it and I was frozen with fear. I didn't know if they knew each other or what. We weren't in uniform so I couldn't even get his name to report him. I was so shocked and I couldn't even believe someone would openly do that in broad daylight with tons of people around.

I assure you there are plenty of ways to be raped and molested as a nerdy, pain, boring woman who doesn't really care for alcohol and hardly ever drinks. As for the few times when I have gotten drunk I was not ever taken advantage of, not even the one time when I was really naive and went home with a stranger from a bar because I was afraid to drive. I turned him down for sex and he politely let me get my rest and brought me back to my car in the morning.

Fyi, I never reported that boyfriend because all the talk about how women aren't supposed to put themselves in compromising positions if they don't want to be raped left me feeling too guilty to speak up, like it was my fault he decided to just shove his dick in me without permission because I simply trusted him enough to get naked in the first place. I also proceeded to stay in a relationship with him for over a year after that because I also thought no good Christian man would ever want to marry me since I was no longer a virgin.

If you want more rapes to actually be reported so that the rapists can be taken off the streets it might help to not go over the list of everything the victim did wrong whenever a rape actually does get publicized. Putting victims under the microscope just further intimidates future victims from ever coming forward if they know they skipped a step in the ""how to be a perfectly blameless and innocent rape victim"" handbook."

kicker7955,europe,1390233586.0,"Every thing you said is valid, but from my perspective, those visits cost money, and usually you leave some wine and some pastry out for the priest to enjoy. But if you don't participate in the ritual you are chastised and both the priest and your neighbors look at you like your are having a orgy with the devil himself.

Religiousness does not mean guaranteed morality, in fact in most cases the more his moral authority goes uncontested(he is contested by his superiors for his actions, politically not morally), the more his ego decides what is and what isn't right. 

A truly moral preacher can see how selfish and abusive manipulating voters is, while a self righteous egomaniac considers that the he is beyond fault and therefor the act of doing something makes it morally legitimate.

Also those chats, are exactly the opposite of physiotherapy, instead of assurance and acceptance of ones faults they are used to shame and control, especially in a small rural community where the preacher has a loose tongue and a drinking habit. And high church officials listen to high political officials they are as disconnected from the public as royalty, and as royalty they're decision to support one candidate or another is incontestable by the rest of the church.

Really don't want to start a religious debate because that is not my point, despite being a atheist I don't care about peoples beliefs, but I believe that organised religion (churches, clergy, doctrines) has been the most destructive and limiting creation of of human imagination trough all of written history. They are the only institution that is untouchable by the press, by the public, by politicians and even tax collectors. It is unhealthy psychologically for a person to be so beyond reproach but still be considered a moral rock."

1. There is an inherent limited supply and rate of accrual, and anyone can mine (though some will be more successful than others)
2. They allow secure, verifiable transactions without relying on infrastructure owned by any bank or government
3. People decide to use them.

AnyelevNokova,AskReddit,1390233855.0,"Or see a pro.

I had a debate with a customer the other night. She was Hispanic with black hair and wanted to go blonde; *super* blonde. She wanted to know which hair dye would get her blonde without bleaching (""because I ruined my hair bleaching it."") I tried to tell her that it was pretty much impossible without bleach; black to blonde is as far across the spectrum as you can go. There's no gentle, easy, ""I'll just buy a box once"" method for that. Sorry. There's a reason the side of the box has those before/after pictures: if your base hair color isn't on the side as a ""before"" shade, then you're probably not getting anywhere *close* to the color on the box. Going that dramatically far from one shade to another means you're looking at a strong lightener, which is almost always bleach. You can do it at home (at your own risk) or see a professional with experience to do it for you. If seeing a pro isn't an option, or you refuse to bleach, then reconsider what shade you're trying to go to. 

She didn't believe me and walked out with the lightest shade of Garnier Fructis she could find on the shelf, telling me that her sister told her it worked for her so whatever. Like, that's your opinion man. I do what I want. It was one of those moment where you think, *why would you ask my opinion if you aren't going to listen?*

She came back three hours later. Half of her hair was still black, and the rest was this irregular mis-mash of dark brown and dark orange. She was in tears.

thro_way,politics,1390234227.0,"&gt; You said that everyone with a penis is male.

My mistake, I phrased that imprecisely.  I meant to stress the ""more"" in that statement, as in ""anyone with a dick is a man"" is *more* correct than ""anyone who's a man has a dick"".

The definition I provided for sex in my previous comment is the one I go by.  By my definition, they are intersexed, because they have penises but XX chromosomes.  

&gt;It's totally irrelevant how 'most people' define sex.

No it's not, that's how words derive meaning, from however the majority of people use them.  Believe me, I'm quite aware of sex related gender disorders, and the definition I provided in my previous comment accommodates all of them quite well.

&gt;But psychological factors are a huge part of how people define their own sex. Imagine if a doctor told you today, to your surprise, that you were genetically female — something that happens to a lot of adult XX males with CAH. Would that make you feel any differently about being male? 

Of course it wouldn't; why would I feel an attachment to the state of my chromosomes?  I'd be an intersexed man with CAH, nothing else would change.  I think you might be confusing sex with gender.

&gt;I think in the end, you would think that you had the right to go with the identity you identified with, that you had grown into, rather than having to conform to what your chromosomes seemed to dictate.

What exactly would I have to conform to?  As I said earlier, intersexed folks are usually assigned a sex.  If I had a penis and was 6'3"", that sex would probably be male, which is how I understand it to be already.

&gt;The point isn't 'let intersexed people decide'. If intersexed people can decide, then why shouldn't we let transgendered people decide?

I'm not sure how you missed this from the name, but transgender people don't identify as a different sex, they identify as a different gender.  They can't ""decide"" their sex because sex is biologically determined.

shortyman09,AdviceAnimals,1390234413.0,"Let's break down your points made to show where the issue lies.

&gt;Why not try to be a doctor or pharmacist if you want to be involved in health care?

Because doctors, pharmacists, and nurses all have completely distinct jobs from one another.

&gt;Frankly I'd be pissed to have a male nurse if I have to be cared for.

Why?  They're just as competent and capable as any female nurse.  Their care doesn't change based on what genitals they have.

&gt;I bet you get called ""doctor"" all the time,

Nurses wear different scrubs.  Frankly, in the show Scrubs, when Eliot met the one male nurse on the show, it was completely obvious to me he was a nurse.  I don't know how Eliot missed it.

&gt;it can't be fun to say ""Oh I'm just a nurse.""

You really have no idea the responsibilities that nurses have.  No nurse would ever say they are ""just a nurse.""  If anything, based on responsibilities, if a patient asked a doctor to do something, they are more likely to respond, ""Oh, I'm just a doctor.  Let me get a nurse to take care of that for you.""

&gt;What would make you want to go into nursing?

Because it's a fulfilling job that let's you get into almost any part of the hospital depending on what you eventually want to do with nursing.  Doctors are stuck on their path if they ever specialize.

&gt;It seems noble for a woman to want to help people, as a guy it just seems like you're doing something unexpected for the sake of being ""progressive.""

I hope you recognize how sexist this is. It is just as ""noble"" for a man to help people as a nurse as it is for a woman.  And most men don't become nurses to be ""progressive.""  That train left a few decades ago.  Now men do it because it's a legitimate career choice, and some people like it.

Now I'll end with this.  If I ever married a woman who we as a couple could get to the point that she's making enough money to fully support our family, do you know what my desire is?  To be a stay-at-home dad.  I would love to stay at home, take care of my kids, maybe develop some programs because I wouldn't have a job in the way then.  Is that something ""noble"" or ""progressive""?  No, it's just what I would love to be able to do if the opportunity presented itself.  I'm no less a man for it.  Perhaps you should take some time to recognize that former ""female dominated"" careers are no longer that way.  If we are to strive for equality between genders, then *all* careers must be open to both men *and* women.  /rant"

I like when a cover features a celebrity I admire/respect/like, but I think it would be awesome to see a person with a great story I don't know about as the cover model.  For example, I learned about Somaly Mam in Marie Claire, an activist on the sex slave trade from Cambodia - but it wasn't her on the cover, and she's beautiful - it was Shakira or Kathryn Heigel or someone like that.  I like a women's magazine that has a bit meatier content about women's issues or news - advice on dealing with misogynistic men in the workplace, or sophisticated dating advice, or practical fashion advice, or stories like the one about Somaly Mam.  Marie Claire does always have a good few articles but the fashion is overwhelming.  Page after page of trendy expensive crap is of no interest to me.  There are so many successful fashion mags, it seems like mags that want to show something else HAVE to put fashion in there just to compete."

They often feel entitled to a level of respect and rewards that aren’t in line with their actual ability and effort levels, and so they might not get the level of respect and rewards they are expecting.”

tilsitforthenommage,AskMen,1390234641.0,"Talk to her, it's how i met my darling SO.

BACKSTORY TIME!


Once upon a time i was the owner of some funky green hair thanks to a dress up party involving a super hero/villian theme and i came as the Joker and looked equal parts terrifying and sexy. Whilst at this party i met a girl and inadvertently cockblocked a friend of mine who's secret intention was to chit chat his way into her pants, unfortunately for him i monopolised her time for most of the evening. 

Mean while

This girl gets a text reminding her of a meeting for a musical flash mob she is a part of. She invites me along to the meeting thinking i'd have a ball of a time.

Several days later

I turn up, while attempting to mingle and feeling completely out of place while auditions are on i run into this emo girl with straight hair and glasses and we get to chatting. Hurrah hurrah someone to chat too! We bond rapidly over ferrets, songs i don't know, wig wearing and some fairly heavy duty getting to know you flirting.

We become friends! 

Over the course of several weeks i get dumped by my long term partner and then live in hag which is a backstory of itself and i text my new friend first to tell the news, we develop a friendship built on some booze, chatting, joking and her support while i was emotionally crippled.

Fast Forward to my birthday/my degree's pubcrawl.

I get super hammered, and very silly because of a combination of Uni friends and a birthday mean a lot of drinks to be had by birthday boy. I had organised to meet my friend at one of the bars on the list we get down and boogy until i suggest that since it's my birthday she should give me a kiss, which she did on the cheek. I decided that this was not the kind of kiss in mind and go in for the full drunken pash.

Some drama occurred at this point involving a friend of mine who had their eye on her as well. We resolved that in the end and everything is hunky dory but that is a different back story for another time. 

The night ends with a combination of drama and making out!

The weekend passes in a flurry of texting between us. We meet up again in the sober light of day, awkwardly hang out until the last possible moment we kiss and thus a relationship that is useless as a precedent began. 

Several years later, we've been living together for ages, respectively saved each others lives in one way or another, all this love, met families, considered marriage and kids (keen for both, finances and life skills aren't quite there yet), exchanged jewellery and farted in front of each other. Many adventures in love and life were had and lessons learnt.

And i would suggest this, if i didn't network like i do i would never have made the connection that got me to that meeting and that same networking introduced me to the girl who has become the single most important person in my whole life.

So i would offer this advice network, meet people and make friends.

3. They can't, the writers just threw something in there to definitely explain that he's not dead.

4. Because shitty writing. The writers wanted a heartwrenching death to end the series and they couldn't use Dexter like had been planned (probably from the beginning), so they had to shoehorn it into Deb being killed.

5. See: 4

6. The writers stopped giving a shit.

keakealani,musictheory,1390234714.0,"Great! I love the Rimsky-Korsakov. The Adler covers a lot of the same material - it basically describes the instruments used in a standard orchestra as well as info about range, register, timbre, and basic sound production. It gets a little more into possible extended techniques and does include information for how to notate some major extended techniques (like extended bowing, multiphonics for woodwinds, etc.)

The reason I primarily like the Kennan better is because I think it reads better - it feels more like a conversation I'd have with my composition instructor in a lesson, rather than a regimented textbook style. I also feel it gives better and more detailed explanations about the specific instruments and how they can be used. It does kind of trade off the extended techniques which Adler is good at, but I don't honestly think most extended techniques are useful for an orchestral setting and for solo music a composer should be working very much with the performer about extended techniques anyway since books can't normally do it justice imo. 

Both are fine, though - I don't necessarily advise purchasing the Kennan if you have Adler and Rimsky-Korsakov already, unless you're trying to have a very complete library. Unfortunately textbooks aren't exactly cheap. You may find a previous edition for pretty cheap though. 

As /u/Thisglitch already mentioned, I'd still recommend Schoenberg as it does cover his theories on tonal harmony. I haven't used Aldwell &amp; Schachter myself but I have seen it highly recommended on this sub and elsewhere so I guess that's the other one to think about. Good luck!"

Yes. Sex is one of the top 3 things couples fight about, so sexual compatibility is real important. Religion's attitude about sex is a huge factor in unhappy marriages. See /r/deadbedrooms. Look at the sizable number of religious people who married as virgins. 

We just don't say this to be mean, sexual incompatibility is a serious issue. Someone who doesn't take that seriously is not suitable for LTR for me. 

&gt; Basically what I am asking is, if I do ever find someone who I think likes me, should I expect him to be patient with me or just give up on the idea of dating altogether?

You need to be upfront about this on date #1 or #2. This is a huge issue and a deal-breaker for most men. You should not hide your beliefs and waste his time.

As for us... All the things we have were bought before we started trying. So we have a house with room for a kid, but it wasn't bought AS the house where we would have a kid. And the car is one we bought for hiking just as much as having a car seat in the back, and so on. So I feel fortunate that our lives won't feel like they changed to accommodate a child that will never be there.

So... Our big backup plan is to move to France for three months.  My job is writing and Mr. Z has a job where a three-month sabbatical can be taken.  If we give up on kids, then I'll get my Mirena back in, and we'll spend three months living in Paris and traveling all over France (though not right away... we'll need to build up savings again first).  It doesn't seem like a terrible consolation prize, although it really isn't our first choice. But living in Paris for three months is definitely taking on the glow of a lifetime dream... to the point where if we do manage to have a baby, I may want to do it anyway, someday."

For me American Football is just to stop-start for me. It's too broken up and doesn't flow as well as a football (soccer) match does. Also to me it doesn't seem like you need that much talent to be great at it, you either need to be quick and able to dodge people, big and able to tackle people or able to throw the ball accurately. I know a few of those may apply to some football (soccer) players as well, but because it's more of a non-contact sport players develop tricks and skills to get past other players. Watching a player on your team trick his way around the other teams defender is great. 

Like I said though, it's probably because we're used to football (soccer) and you're used to American Football. "

ultimately, these are more important.  open-mindedness and enthusiastically willing to try new things is best.  

If someone gets flustered trying to talk to you about things, just own up to it in a non-shaming way.  ""I'll be honest, my memory isn't the best.""  Talk about it in the same way you'd say ""I'm tall.""

do you have fun and interesting hobbies, ones you can share with others, that you are really enjoy?  talk about those (just try not to talk too much about what *other people* do.  that gets old quick, because your listener doesn't know this person).  I'd suggest you take up creative, engaging hobbies that challenge you.  Cooking and baking are great for this.  Instead of passively watching TV, read books, even if they're trashy romance or kids lit.  engage in sports, ideally group sports.  Do you like home decorating?  Instead of just collecting things on Pinterest, *make them.*  Take some art classes at a community college (or, be a life drawing model).  volunteer for a non-profit.  These will give you things to talk about.  If you do things that intelligent, cool guys like to do, it will give you things to bond over.  

I do enjoy having engaging conversations, but the sunject itself doesn't really matter.  find ways to be encouraging, and be excited about something if your partner is excited to share it (politics, video games, computer code, literature, art, cooking, whatever).

AnyelevNokova,AskReddit,1390234981.0,"That's the ""if you don't know what you're doing"" part of the equation.

I'm used to people coming in and saying, I WANT TO BE A BLEACH BLONDE. TELL ME HOW TO BE A BLEACH BLONDE. I say, ok, well you're a dark redhead right now so you're going to need bleach, some toner, a good shampoo and conditioner combo, your desired shade, gloves, etc., etc. You might need to do it twice over time if your hair doesn't hold color well. The number of levels you're looking at going is not the kind of thing we have a premade kit for. As soon as you even mention anything like mixing, multiple steps, toner, etc., I immediately hear, ""no no no - that's too complicated. Tell me how to bleach blonde at home without bleach and straight out of a box so that a monkey could do it."" And when you explain that, sorry, but that's not really an option, they throw their hands up, tell you you don't know what you're talking about, grab something off the shelf (that won't work for them) and leave.

People who know how to follow directions and know what their hair will take don't need my help. They read the instructions and follow them exactly. No problem. It's the people that don't want to read the instructions -- or don't *like* the instructions -- that you end up in an argument with. You were willing to research the process, read and follow instructions, and were already close (in terms of lightness) to your desired shades. I mostly see people who are unwilling to do any research or even remotely complicated processes at home - they want it out of a box and done within an hour while they flip through a magazine. If it's not convenient, they refuse to do it. However, people also refuse to believe me when I say that some things *can't be done conveniently*. Black to blonde is not one of them.

That's why I tell them, look, please, just go see your salon. They can give you what you want. Yes, it's expensive, but that's the price of convenience. "

&gt;I'd be interested to know wage comparisons from the same jobs?

From what I've seen the situation is a lot more complicated than some feminists make out. eg. 2 people have the same job but different pay due to length of tenure and overtime. I worked in retail and there was a number of women who were earning more than me due to both of those reasons. Basically the gap isn't necessarily due to gender discrimination, which is what some feminists seem to imply.

This article might be of interest to you.

""Goldin and Lawrence Katz have done about as close to an apples-to-apples comparison of men’s and women’s wages as exists. (They talk about it here in a Freakonomics discussion.) They tracked male and female MBAs graduating from the University of Chicago from 1990 to 2006. First they controlled for previous job experience, GPA, chosen profession, business-school course and job title. Right out of school, they found only a tiny differential in salary between men and women, which might be because of a little bit of lingering discrimination or because women are worse at negotiating starting salaries.

As far as what kind of people you have things in common with, I will throw it out there that emotionally, tall women have quite a bit in common with short men.  We are both on the opposite end of what is average.  I think it is why it seems a higher % of tall women care less about height compared to women in the average range.

I can't say whether that guy will care if you are taller because some do.  Just remember you are pretty damn young and it isn't the end of the world if he has a problem with it.  The last thing you want is to let something make you feel insecure about a feature you have no control over."

As we get older, the amount we can spend is getting higher, but our focus is always to get someone a special gift that's personal to them.  We mostly order off the registry, but for my BFFs wedding I had a comic commissioned and had a custom frame made."

Kalfira,OneY,1390235389.0,"If I may posit a suggestion. Most people who make posts like this, the ""Cry for help"". Don't really want to kill themselves. I know you may FEEL like this, but you posting this means that you really do value your life and your experiences. 

This dichotomy of perceiving the world differently than it really is very common among the suicidal so you shouldn't feel alone with that. You seem to be really down on yourself and I expect much of your feelings are self imposed and not based on how others perceived. 

Now for some actual advice. Please read to the end if you read this part. No one gives a shit about you or your life. I don't say this to be mean. I don't say this to tear you down. I tell you this to tell you the truth of the way of the world. If you killed yourself TODAY your mother and your sister would be sad for sure. But beyond that who would care? Maybe a few friends? Some online buddies? But the world would continue to turn, business would still continue and the show would go on. 

In the grand scheme of the world, you are dust on the wind. A faction of a fraction of another unremarkable fraction. But DON'T let this get you down. Use this to empower yourself.

Want to know a secret? This is something people have spent their entire lives searching for but never found. There is no meaning to life. No purpose. No goal. No endgame. There is no directive. 

Life is ENTIRELY what you make of it. Whatever meaning you or anyone else feels is their ""purpose"" in life is nothing but fleeting ephemeral feel good crap. But this is a good thing! When there is no more arbitrary goals or rules on your life, when you finally ""see through the matrix"" all the bullshit about how ""I'm emotionally repulsive, personally contemptible"" doesn't fucking matter! 

You say you have contempt for women because you were fat and they made fun of you. Welcome to school age girls! Either put that shit behind you and find you a quality fucking WOMAN or just give up. Just because some bitches made snide remarks about a superficial quality of yours you feel the need to write off an entire gender? A full 50% of the population is no longer available because they have different parts than you? Fuck you. Women are awesome. Complicated yes, confusing at times also yes, but they are people just like you and me. 

Your friends abandoned you? Yup that happens. I'm a super nice guy, well adjusted, married, interesting, and I STILL have friends that have moved on from me. It's a natural part of life, so find new friends! There is essentially an infinite number of people in the world, you can find friends. I assure you. 

If you really want to kill yourself, fine, do it, no skin of my or anyone elses noses. But do it for the right reason. Do it because you've done everything else awesome in the entire world. If you've done that, great. Put the noose around your neck and kick the chair buddy. But i'll bet you haven't even touched the surface. Hell I'll be you haven't even fucking tried have you? 

""Oh but Kalfira, i tried asking a girl I really thought was cute out and she made fun of me!"" Get over it, ask someone else.

""Oh but Kalfira, I'm fat and I can't make friends."" Then put down the fork and go spend some time at a group activity!

""Oh but Kalfira, i'm just so depressed and i'm piece of shit"" No you aren't. And you know you aren't. You are throwing yourself a pity party because you are USED to feeling miserable. By being miserable you give yourself a shield and excuse as to why X thing hasn't happened in your life.

The world is only interested in what it can get out of you. So if you are looking to us to give you meaning in life, tough shit. Find your own fucking meaning. Get out there and do awesome ninja air kicks or whatever silly stuff that is interesting to you. Take a cooking class. Learn the sculpt. Make a video game. Write a book. Volunteer to build houses. Get on a plane and fly to Laos and start a new life as the only depressed white guy there!  

Personally, I look forward to dying. I WANT to die. **""For what dreams may come when we shuffle off this mortal coil""** I'm an adventurer! I want to see what's on the other side! If it's heaven, GREAT! If it's hell, at least I know! If it's nothing, well doesn't bother me I guess. But I don't kill myself!

Why? Because EVERYONE dies. Doesn't matter if you are a genius, a billionaire, an astronaut, they all die. Because we are all human. If you want to be dead, sure take the express lane with a 12 gauge in the mouth. But if you ask me, save that part, the dessert of life, for the end. Die on with a mountain of beautiful women, playing a rock guitar solo on the desecrated corpse of god! Not in your bathroom, alone, scared and hurting.

Take life by the balls and make it your bitch. You can do it. I don't even know you and I have faith in you. Peace out brother, I know you can do it. Now get up off of reddit and go do something fucking awesome! "

keakealani,singing,1390235452.0,"On the one hand, I think it's great to highlight that people know what they're talking about. On the other hand, I feel that it can create an elitist atmosphere - if you don't have the flair, you become less relevant, even if what you're saying is correct. This leads to people kowtowing to those with flair (even if they're mistaken), and discouraging other good posts by non-flaired people (even if they're helpful). 

Frankly, I'd like to think for the most part that karma + content of post indicate most of this anyway - it's usually pretty obvious when someone seems to know what they're talking about because they give detailed posts and cite specific information/resources. It's also usually obvious who is completely wrong because they tend to get downvoted (or at least not upvoted very highly). 

And, as you mention, we can't really use criteria like having a degree because singing is more fluid than the same kinds of backgrounds in subs like /r/AskScience or /r/AskHistorians. 

In addition, I feel like there are a lot of posters who know a LOT about one or two subject areas, but can't be trusted on others. Myself, for example, I'd consider to be pretty dang comfortable discussing anything choral, as well as a lot of music theory/musicology, and some about early music education. I'd also say I'm a pretty good resource when it comes to nitpicky things like diction and text analysis. I'd consider myself to be semi-qualified to discuss solo classical singing. And I'd consider myself *completely* unqualified to talk about anything more than broad basics when it comes to pop, jazz, or rock music. Having a flair may not differentiate people's specific specialties (especially since it could get really wordy to list everything that person is ""qualified"" to talk about) and still yield answers that are not helpful but taken more seriously because they're accompanied with flair. 

-shrug- I don't know. I like the systems used in subs like /r/musictheory (basically based on education level/professional status), but I feel it's hard to replicate here because singing is much less academic and shouldn't be held to only academic standards when there are other ways one can be experienced and helpful.

vohit4rohit,AdviceAnimals,1390235452.0,"I already have both. You CAN have too many friends. Life isn't about collecting as many connections and friends as possible, it's about spending time with the ones that mean the most. "
lamblikeawolf,short,1390235456.0,"There is a very limited amount of change possible with these attributes because they are limited by bone structure. If you have a larger rib cage, there is a limit to how small your waist is going to be, and it isn't going to be that small. If you have a flat butt, you're not going to end up with a Sir Mix-a-Lot level butt no matter how many squats you do. 

And about the hair - if your hair is not naturally curly, it won't hold the curl long at all, even with a million pins and all of the hairspray in the world. (And then it gets crunchy with the hairspray, and you just want to wash it all off anyway.) If your hair is not naturally straight, it won't hold it all day.

The point I was making is that the thought ""if only my body was different then I could be happy"" literally occurs in all people regardless of gender. (Which I specifically took the time to point out because OPs post seemed to concentrate on men.)

But there are a lot of other body image issues that men can face as well. Some guys don't get the big beefy-looking muscles when they work out. Some guys can't grow full mountain-men looking beards. Some guys have hang-ups over their penis size, even if it's average, because of the way western culture treats penis length.

That was the point I was responding to - a lot of people want to trade just a little bit with the thought that it would make them happier, when in reality, even if they were to magically gain that kind of change, they would still have the same kinds of body image issues. Because the way they feel about themselves for wishing their body to be different doesn't actually have to do with their body. It has to do with their own self-image."

funkymunniez,explainlikeimfive,1390235476.0,"Ehhh this is starting to venture outside of my realm of knowledge but yes, i believe that extremely prolonged constriction of vessels (i mean like really, really, *reallly* long)can result in a blood clot due to the slowed or stagnant movement of blood inside the body.  A quick google search on blood clot development yielded this:

&gt;Venous thrombosis or blood clots in a vein occur when a person becomes immobilized and muscles are not contracting to push blood back to the heart. This stagnant blood begins to form small clots along the walls of the vein. This initial clot can gradually grow to partially or completely occlude or block the vein and prevent blood from returning to the heart. An analogy to this process is a slow moving river. Over time, weeds and algae start to accumulate along the banks of the river where the water flows more slowly. Gradually, as the weeds start to grow, they begin to invade the center of the river because they can withstand the pressure of the oncoming water flow.

As with any medical concerns, if you are worried enough to ask strangers in the internet, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician.  They can give you detailed and definitive answers on your risks, solutions, and prevention.

Edit:  you shouldn't develop any clotting if your body reacts to the response of parasthesia normally."

About a month ago, it started making this sickening popping noise that made it unplayable. Contacted Fender and they sent me to an Authorized Service Center.

Before I had the chance to make the trek out there, I stopped into GC with it to see what they could do. They plugged it in and it worked fine. Turns out something must have happened to the electricity in my house and it was causing that problem. More than likely, it was interference from some kind of new wireless device (started happening around the holidays, so maybe a neighbor got some high powered wireless toy?) in the area. When I got back to my college apartment, worked just like normal.

My recommendation is to bring it to a new place and plug it in, because it could just be signal interference. If that is the case, there are things you can do to clean up your power signal."

amaefm,OneY,1390235620.0,"I would tough it out man, you're so young you don't even know how young you are.  It sounds cliche and I would have thought so at 19 too but it really is true.  I've spent most of my life going through bouts of extreme depression that would have me sleeping 14+ hours a day, kept me from working and kept me from eating.  My Dad died when I was 14. I've had horrible experiences with women.  I was 19 before I had my first kiss. I've had periods where I constantly wanted to not be alive anymore, I never really considered suicide an option but thought about it a lot. I willfully chose to destroy my body in ways that will surely pop up later in my life.  I drank excessively and still do, although not nearly to where I once was.  My 20's seem like a blur of misery with intermittent bursts of good times.

All that said I wouldn't trade any of that for where I am now.  I have had some amazing experiences, even if I wasn't emotionally stable.  The good experiences outweigh my persistent negative emotional state. Life has consistently gotten better over the past 10 years. I tried medication that didn't really work.  I went to see a therapist in my late 20's that helped a lot.  Previously I thought therapists were full of shit and didn't do anything.  I learned that your own mindset in therapy effects the outcome of what you discover.

I guess, what I really want to say is my life is so much better at 30 than it was at 19.  I am SO much happier.  My depression while still there is no longer the focus of my existence.  I would have missed out on so much. I'm glad I made the decision to keep on going.  I would hate for you to miss out on what could be a wonderful life.  You're only now just coming out of child hood.  You've only been a legitimate developed person for maybe 10 years. Give it another 10 before you decide it's not worth it. Give it at least 5.  19 is so impossibly young.  I know it seems like forever to you but I promise it isn't.  I know a 30 year old seems ancient to you, it's not as far away as you think.  Give yourself a chance. You have precious little data to go on. High School is bull shit.  Forget it. You can be someone else now. Go live.  Figure out the world.  It's worth it.

PS: Your Mom loves you and there's nothing arrogant or pathetic about wanting to spare her from devastation. I've had the same thought many many times."

The time being single (and in unsuccessful relationships) gave me perspective on myself and on relationship dynamics, and the fact that I was happy being on my own helped me to be excited but not overeager when the right women came along.

I had an OkCupid profile passively open for easily over 5 years, probably close to 10. I used other sites but never much cared for the people I met through them. Generally, I would let my OkCupid go dormant when I was dating someone, but I would never disable or delete the account. But when I went on my first date with my current girlfriend, I disabled my account the next day because I knew I didn't want or need to look anywhere else until I figured out where things were (are) going with her.

the KW test is a good call. For post-hoc pairwise comparisons you could use a Mann-Whitney U test, which treats the data as ordinal instead of ratio. 

Another thing that can be done is apply a logarithmic transformation to the data to normalize the distribution. This may solve the heterogeneity of variance problem and allow you to perform a one-way ANOVA and a Tukey test on your data. I don't know how R tests for homogeneity of variance. I'm familiar with SPSS which uses Levene's test. Maybe R has something similar.

DivineVodka,ShingekiNoKyojin,1390236067.0,"What???  I can't think of a single person who can't relate to Levi.  That is normally how people at least men deal with grief alone shut in and isolate themselves from the rest of the world because you will be seen as weak if you cry.  I am sure anyone who has been to war can relate how Levi looked during his squads death scene.  What I don't think anyone can relate to is Eren, the guy is immature plain and simple.  He has a role to play with saving the world as it is right now and he either gets kindapped, cries because he couldn't achieve one small thing ignoring the real goal, beats himself up over something trivial compared to the real picture.  All in all he wants to protect everyone and kill the titans.  What he can't realize is people are going to die, didn't Jean tell him this?  That's he's going to just trust him or something from now?  Eren's character is immature I can't relate to that.

Humanity?  Jean sacrificed so many people to reach the supply unit team earlier in the series...  Where is the humanity in that?  He sacrificed others just to achieve his goal.  That is a leader, a leader is about making harsh decisions and yes it will eat at you but that's your ROLE.  Most definitely but when Eren cries at any chance he gets or makes any and everything overwhelm him you can't deny the character is weak and has zero pillars.  You would think going through all of those things would make him stronger but to me the only thing that grows is his hate.  What can hate achieve if at the first glance you're kidnapped or better yet you're crying over something?

I honestly don't know how you can't relate to Levi.  Based off his series we can make an assumption that his team died and the world is so messed up he closed himself off and then when he sees his squad mates dead in the forest you can see in his eyes how it bothers him.  Instead of raging and running of crying to go kill Annie he remains calm and tells Mikasa they are going to have to achieve one goal which they agreed on saving Eren.  That's strong leadership that's what Eren needs but instead in that situation he would've broken down and cried on the spot and end up possibly being captured.  ""He's 15, he's just a kid"" so is Armin god dammit, So is Jean god dammit, so is Annie god dammit.  People are different I understand that but in that world how the hell can you be so different?  Everyone has at least gone through Titans killing someone close to them at least once ( except the new younger kids).

So how is that Eren can be so completely different.  If it were not for the other characters in the manga I honestly could not read this, it just doesn't make any sense at all.  People deal with death differently, we both agree on that.  Always crying?  It shows he still has something in him...  his humanity.  What this show is all about is throwing away that humanity in order to save humanity ( lol).  Erwin does this, Armin said that's how Eren can win.  He's desperately clinging onto something that is in the past now, which then just makes his character suffer.  How you can like and appreciate that is beyond me because in the world they live he as the shifter and {Manga spoilers thing didn't work!!!!  this thing in the brackets is a spoiler!!!! (control titans) he needs better traits as someone to help them achieve their goal.  As well as while we would love to believe that crying means you're alive in the 21st century it means you're weak.  The only times it's acceptable to cry is when death is around, Eren went through death when he was a kid, the best person besides his mother his dad left so he doesn't even have someone to console him.  Let's be real Mikasa doesn't relate she just pats him on the back and hold him ( maybe that was enough) but for 5 years to pass ( thank you) and he is the exact same as he was when he was a child the only different being he hates Titans more...  It's honestly just repulsive and can only turn people away from the series.

He's obviously a great character.  Reasoning is you love him and I don't like his traits, I am excited that he can and will bring change I am disappointed at the same time it seems his character is not growing or getting stronger mentally if at the wake of every death he breaks down then he cannot lead anything.  Also didn't you call him "" an emotionless douche"" why would you go out of your way to pretend to not have a problem with him?  That sentence alone screams how much you hate his character design."
mariesoleil,asktransgender,1390236067.0,"The thing about the Internet is that it makes it easy to be very loud about your beliefs. A few active blogs, extensive commenting on site like reddit, maybe even a YouTube channel. That's all it takes to make it seem like a view held by a handful of people is quite widespread. This effect is made worse by accidental selection bias. For example, if you are a questioning trans person, you might google ""sex change"" because it's the only word you know. So the results you get will be sites that use that word. And these sites won't be informative sites that use words like ""transition"" or ""SRS,"" they'll be sites that aren't very supportive of trans people. 

What I'm saying is that you shouldn't assume that TERF views are the norm among feminists, just because they are easy to find on the Internet. 

My other point is that you should not bother trying to engage them. Someone who bothers to exert a lot of energy on a point of view is not likely to change that view easily. I think writing an active blog and frequent commenting is something that takes many hours a week. So they have a lot of investment in that view, and that makes it harder to change. It's probably more difficult to convert someone who has been an active church elder for decades than a 20 something who hasn't really thought much about their beliefs. "

BullsLawDan,Libertarian,1390236433.0,"&gt;The rights a person has are forfeited in one case (both according to the NAP and the constitution): you are infringing on the rights of someone else who has done nothing to harm you. A reckless driver is infringing on the rights of everyone else on the road by putting them at an increased danger of crashing. A person who is trying to help someone get away with this infringement of others rights is also infringing on those same rights, and loses the right to free speech. (temporarily)

This is not the correct analysis.

There are four classifications of speech that are not protected (or receive reduced protections) under the First Amendment: Obscenity, ""fighting words,"" threats, and immediate incitement to unlawful action.

Of those four, the only one that even needs consideration here is the last one, ""incitement.""  The test for incitement is derived from *Brandenberg v. Ohio*, 395 U.S. 444 (1969).  In that case, the Court found that a Klan leader could not be prosecuted for disparaging comments about certain races, and advocating for their ""removal"" back to Africa, Israel, etc.  The key is that the Court looked at the immediate effect of his speech.  The immediate effect was nothing - people stood around and listened to it.  The Court, in *Brandenberg* and subsequent cases, looked at whether speech created a ""clear and present danger"" of an unlawful act occurring.

In this case, we have to look at what the immediate effect of his sign would be.  Not only does it NOT create a ""clear and present danger"" of someone violating the law, it actually **has the opposite effect - that is, his sign is likely to cause people to slow down and obey the law.**  Now, people might, somewhere down the road, increase their speed back to an illegal one, but his sign had no bearing on that, and that effect would not be ""immediate"" as required to prosecute him for it.

Because his sign does not incite anyone to an unlawful act - and in fact probably caused many people to follow the law - it cannot be considered an immediate incitement to an unlawful act.

The other part of the analysis - whether he violated some nebulous ""sign code"" in the municipality - is easy.  He was standing in a traditional public place, and his sign was obviously not for commercial purposes.  It was personally held, not affixed to anything, and it was small enough to be held.  There is no provision of a local sign code I am aware of that would allow a municipality to regulate this particular sign.

Edit: The City of Frisco's sign ordinance is [located here](http://www.ci.frisco.tx.us/departments/planningDevelopment/planning/Documents/Most%20Requested%20Ordinances/11-01-04.pdf).  It applies to signs affixed or stood on things, not signs held in hand.  The only sign that might apply, the ""human sign"", is clearly for commercial purposes and does not apply to this man.

It is absolutely protected speech under the First Amendment."

pigeonburger,TrueFilm,1390236548.0,"&gt;What struck me so much was that, instead of focusing on Theodore, the screen turns to black. Perhaps this is done so that the audience does not focus on Theodore pleasuring himself, but I like to think Spike Jonze fades to black to give Samantha's point of view on the situation. The audience knows what a bedroom or personal gratification looks like, but the personal gratification of Samantha comes from purely sound and imagination.

I thought this was rather made to contrast with the earlier scene where we are shown that he is picturing the pregnant actress with the dead cat girl's voice. I think this emphasises the fact that *this* time, he's fully present with his partner and not imagining someone else. He is ""*picturing*"" Samantha, which has no physical form, hence the fade-to-black."

Two, this may be a different war than you are used to.  Judging from your comments you are pretty used to offensive, aggressive wars, correct?  Here you will need to fight smarter.

OK, my first kiss with my husband is one of my favorite memories. I was in a horrible relationship when we met through my best friend. Met at a Halloween party. We spent the whole night talking about some personal stuff that we had in common. Even though I was miserable in my relationship, I made it clear that I was taken. He was respectful of that but told me I needed to give him a shot when things went south, ""whether its a week, a month, or a year, call me when you realize how bad he is for you"". 

We decided to stay friends and texted throughout the whole week, found out even more so how compatible we would be. My boyfriend at the time was out of town, so my then best friend, Ben, wanted to go out drinking at my now husbands house the following weekend. I had no intentions of doing anything. Just hanging out. Husband and I made plans to make dinner and desert for the 3 of us coming over... Ben ended up not showing. So we ate alone and talked more. Ben and others show up. *Side note, Ben knew how miserable I was and was planning on giving hubby and I alone time, he wanted us together* 

The night progresses to drinking and fun. Things start to die down. Hubby and i go to his room to talk. By this time I am really drunk, as is he. He starts telling me everything. How he feels, how he could see something with me, how he would never hurt me like this guy was, and how upset he was because he wanted to kiss me but knew he couldn't because he needed to respect my current ""relationship"", he kept going on and on. I was slightly overwhelmed, and in awe. No one had ever said things like that to me. So I did the first thing that came to mind. Looked him in the eye and said ""just shut up and kiss me already"". As corny as it sounds, that was without a doubt the most passionate kiss I have ever experienced. 

I broke up with my boyfriend the next week. He was actually fine with it (found out he cheated on me for the 3rd time before leaving) surprisingly still OK friends.

 Now hubby and i are married with a beautiful baby boy and couldn't be happier. 

Sorry this is so long! I feel like then story leading up to the kiss makes it more special to me :)"

If we don't want men making friends in prison, then prisoners need to be placed in solitary.  Most agree that would be cruel and unusual punishment.

I prefer the phrase ""group of friends"" to ""gangs,"" so we are not immediately dividing the world into two groups, one stigmatized: your friends in group A, and scuzzy degenerate prisoners in group B.  Now some groups of friends get into legal trouble even after they're imprisoned.  In doing so, they commit new crimes.  You need to make a strong case that those crimes need to be dealt with in a different way than crimes committed by other individuals, just because those crimes were committed by people who made friends in prison.

You haven't made that case.  You've made a case for denying the ability to make friends to people who are incarcerated simply because their values don't reflect yours.  Your ideas are cruel and thoughtless."

Now, when you think about it, its kinda realistic. You don't need to use it all, so you stockpile, and slowly you get enough to survive on. The problem is that things HAVE to respawn, even if you lowered the respawn considerable, they will respawn, so you can keep getting more.

Also, you have to take into account that there could be 2 people on a server, even with low respawns, it would still be enough for these people to stock up. But then on that same server, with 40 people, everything is insanely rare.

That is the problem, its hard to balance the respawns because you'll never know how many people you have."

You can easily access the chat room [here](http://chat.tripsit.me/?nick=Erowider?#erowid) to get in touch with me, Teknos. While you're there, check out the ~drug command with our omnibot, Tripbot.

screenmagnet,sex,1390237091.0,"The fix for me was going off birth control pills and waiting for the hormones to wash out of my system. Birth control pills increase levels of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which is a protein that binds up circulating testosterone, essentially inactivating it. Bound testosterone cannot be used; only free testosterone is used. In addition, birth control pills shut down the ovaries, so that they stop producing hormones (including testosterone). So on birth control pills, your ovaries stop producing testosterone (your adrenal glands still produce some, so overall production is not zero). And the testosterone that does get produced is all bound up and useless because of the excess SHBG. When you stop birth control pills, your ovaries 'wake up' right away, so your *total* testosterone levels go back to normal quickly. However, SHBG levels stay high for at least 6 months. In fact, it is not known how long they stay elevated -- for some women, it may take years, or the levels may never actually normalize. It seems the longer you have been on the pill, the longer it may take for the SHBG levels to go back down.

It is great that your wife is going to see her doctor about this, but be aware that many (if not most) doctors are going to be ignorant about this, or dismiss her concerns. The prevalent notion in the medical community is that a woman's sex drive is 'all in her head'. When the reality is that for most women, it is actually all in her hormones. That's why I think it is a bad idea for you to just sit back and wait for your wife to stop the pill. Because most likely her doctor will either tell her that it is not the birth control that is the problem, or her doctor will encourage her to switch to a different pill, rather  than stopping it altogether.

I think you should sit your wife down, explain to her the mechanism behind the loss of libido, show her the research (I can send you links if you want), and also explain to her that due to various reasons, most doctors are ignorant or otherwise resistant to accepting this research. Ask her to see her doctor, but ask her to stop the pill regardless of what her doctor says. The main reason she should see her doctor is to do a series of blood tests to check her testosterone level and also to rule out other medical causes of low libido. 
She should get the following tested: 
CBC, ferritin, and B12 (to check for anemia)
Vitamin D
TSH, T3, T4 (to check thyroid function)
Testosterone: total and free
Prolactin

Now, if she is one of those lucky women who gets their sex drive back a couple months after stopping the pill, fantastic! If not, then you are going to need to be patient. You can try to re-check total and free testosterone every 3 months will you are waiting to track the progress. You can also see if you can find a doctor that will prescribe her testosterone supplements (cream or patch). This can be useful even if her total testosterone level is normal, because she will need extra testosterone since so much of it is being 'mopped up' by the SHBG. But theoretically, if you want her SHBG levels to normalize, you should avoid testosterone supplements, since the supplements may interfere with the negative feedback mechanisms that are needed to lower the SHBG to normal levels. Another supplement you can look into is DHEA, which will help support her endogenous testosterone production.

Is she on any other meds, at all? Does she have any medical conditions?"

Neopopulas,dayz,1390237140.0,"The problem is, at its core, the degree that the FoV changes, and the fact there is a zoom-view.

Having a FoV of like, whats standard max? like 90? Would be fine. The problem is that when you add zoom-view and scopes which don't have independent FoV. 

Suddenly having a 'realistic' 90 FoV (or as close as possible to realistic/reasonable) makes your zoom-view basically hamstrung compared to a very very VERY low FoV. 

The way the two interact make the low FoV + zoom incredibly powerful compared to a high FoV. They simply need to detach the two and make the zoom fields independent of whatever FoV you have.

Since there are no numbers i'm not sure what the max FoV is, but having tried it, it seems WAY higher than 90, or even 120 which is normal for FPS, everything looks very fisheye lens and it seems unnatural. Whereas 0 FoV seems VERY narrow, like you're wearing blinkers.

That's enough to end it right there. This is abnormal and unacceptable.

&gt;asking myself if it might be me who makes him angry and aggressive

This is a classic sign of an abusive relationship, the abused one starts to believe that they deserve it.

It seems pretty clear to me that your relationship needs to end. If you aren't sure, here are a few statements you can use to evaluate any relationship.

How many of these are true for you? A great relationship will have all of these, in a good relationship they should all be at least mostly true. A bad relationship will be missing some completely.

Read the list, then judge for yourself.

1. Being with my partner makes me happy, whether they are trying to ""make me happy"" or not, and I believe the same is true for them.

2. I am able to spend time doing my own thing without feeling guilty.

3. I am proud of who my partner is and their behavior.

4. I believe my partner is proud of who I am and my behavior.

5. Being with my partner makes me glad I am exactly who I am because that is the person they love, I do not often think ""if only they were different.""

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390237435.0,"&gt;It's something I'm firmly standing by, but I'm also aware is the world's biggest red flag next to crazy.

It's not really a red flag, or at least I don't like to consider it one - a red flag is more of a warning to some sort of bad behavior in the future.  For example, if someone has a history of cheating, that's a red flag that they'll probably do it again (I don't subscribe to ""once a cheater, always a cheater,"" but if it's habitual, then obviously it's a problem).

In your particular case, it's just a dealbreaker for some guys.  I don't think someone is crazy or a bad person for not wanting sex before marriage - however, it *is* a dealbreaker for me.  Sexual compatibility is important, and I can't marry someone unless I know we're compatible in that regard.  Plus, I'd go insane staying with someone for that long without being able to have sex.

But there are other people that have the same beliefs.  Someone I know will stop guys at kissing because anything beyond that is going too far for her.  She recently found a guy that's okay with that, and I think she's looking for engagement rings.  I mean, being okay with something like that isn't all that common, but it's definitely possible to find someone that shares your beliefs, or at least can be with you even if they don't share them.

You could always try dating sites - there will be a lot of garbage there, but if you can weed through all the bad messages, you might be able to find someone.  Just stop reading once you see any sort of negativity and delete the message.  I know it's not the best option, but it's something, I suppose."

ping..pingpingping..

I stand up And THEN I can shoot, by now he's legging it like a pro down the hill, but hills randomly make you slow to a crawl so i got him in the end.

Still, when kneeling, i should NOT be shooting invisible walls, there wasn't even a tree nearby.

I know, i know, Alpha, but i don't even know what this glitch IS, like.. what is going on here? I can walk through the space in front of me, i did, to shoot him, but i can't SHOOT through it? there is an invisible bullet-shield in front of me?

And thats why bipods aren't very useful (for me, with M4's). The invisible walls, grass everywhere, assuming you get a spot on a hill you can aim down from you're going to hit those walls. its such a pain - plus even an acog isn't going to cut it to make a bipod THAT worth it.

Mosins, on the other hand.. the amount of times i'm killed from 800m away.. jesus..

500-800m - we've tested it - one shot WHILE i was running.. A mosin on its on, even crouched is deadly. Prone its insane, prone and a bipod its unstoppable."

My policy wound up being underwritten by ING.

Your advisor will help you with the amount.  You're not locked into 250K or 500K, these are standard amounts but many companies will write an in-between amount.

Thirty year policies are probably better than ten-year over the long haul, you pay very little extra for the extra coverage and much of the extra payment is made in future dollars (which are less valuable than today dollars, always.)

This woman is, at best, ten years removed from these events. TEN YEARS. Even if she pressed charges, there would be no evidence. It would be one persons word against another. It would likely leave the teacher, who would probably walk on the charges, in trouble for just being accused (and what if she *actually didnt do it, imagine other scenarios*), and would leave this woman feeling like the justice system supported rape.

Neither is the case. But it's so far removed from the event it would be pointless to try and prosecute. It would be doing it just to do it, when all the lawyers and everyone involved all know that it won't pan out. It probably wouldn't even make it to a jury. In the preliminary hearings, the judge would likely throw it out due to insufficient evidence for the claim. Sad, but that is just how it is.

NOTE: I AM NOT SAYING SHE DOESNT DESERVE JUSTICE OR THAT THIS SITUATION IS IN ANY WAY OKAY. PLEASE BE CIVIL."

floodimoo123,raisedbynarcissists,1390237772.0,"The first step to moving on is knowing that it won't happen overnight. I'm still trying to get over my father and we haven't talked in about 2 1/2 years. It's a long process that involves many good days and possibly even more worse days. You're going to feel guilty for not talking to her, or have feelings of ""what could I have done better.""

The second step is understanding that you can't change her. Like I said, people don't change unless they want to. You have to tell her that she needs to change in order for the relationship between you to move forward. Then you must distance yourself. And if she does seek treatment, by all means try to see her. Hold up your end of the deal, much like you hope she would hold up her end.

The third step is to surround yourself with people that understand. Try counseling, or a support group. Or both if you feel like it would help.

These steps will take years to complete, but I believe you will be able to do them. And don't worry about turning out like your mom. You know exactly what not to do, and because of your mom, you will be able to monitor your actions more closely.

As for the ex, I understand. Don't get into a relationship until you're ready. I've been cheated on, and trust was an issues for me for a while. Just remind yourself that not every guy is going to cheat and you deserve better than a cheater."

But that aside, a school social worker is a very competitive job to land.  They do tend to pay higher, but there are *very* few positions. In the major metro area I live, its not uncommon to have one social worker work at many large high schools.

The fact that your intern supervisor has had to work for 15 years in one of the ""better"" positions in social work and is still making ten grand less than the ""average"" is a sure sign that something is off.  You do not find many better off social workers than a school social worker who's been in the position for over a decade.

These two items are not analogous.

This man's sign was in fact the opposite of your examples.  He was not attempting to commit a crime, nor was he attempting to help others do so.  In fact, **his sign had the likely effect of causing many people to obey a law they had previously been breaking.**

The proper analogy for the two contexts you gave would be a person who calls a hit man and says, ""you know, what you're doing is against the law, you really shouldn't do it,"" or stands outside a bank holding a sign saying ""bank robbery is a federal crime, and there is security inside, don't do it!""

Women love drama and so when you get emotional and argue back you are giving them attention. You are essentially rewarding them for bad behaviour. 

On the other hand, when she does something that pleases you make it known. Show her affection only when she deserves it. "

cavemancolton,AskReddit,1390238031.0,"Randy is actually based on Trey Parker's father. He started out as not even a supporting character as much as a very minor character just there to be Stan's dad, and he ended up becoming such a favorite character of both the creators and the fans that now we have whole episodes centered around him.

That's the genius of South Park is it is no longer a show about just Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny. It can be about officer barbrady (who needs to return), or Terrance and Phillip, or about a character who's sat in the background up until now, which was butters,token, and jimmy before they became more full-fledged characters. And now that the show is almost 20 seasons in, I can't think of any characters in the show that are 1 dimensional. They all have very distinct thoughts and personalities and tendencies. "

sorator,AskMen,1390238047.0,"You're right that asking to touch can be taken badly, but it can depend on how you ask - it's a lot better to, say, go in for a kiss, pause a moment before touching, look her in the eyes, and softly ask ""Is this okay?"" than it would be to  be walking alongside her and nervously ask ""...can I kiss you?"" out of the blue. It helps if you make it clear by *starting* to touch and then pausing a moment before actually doing so to ask ""May I?"", instead of trying to describe what you're wanting to do while asking permission, because it shows/implies that you're still willing to put something out there more than just words, and that you aren't *afraid* of touching her but just want to be certain she's okay with it.

But more important than any of that... you need to learn when you can touch a girl and how. And the only way to learn that? Practice. If you need to ask for a while in order to get that practice, then that's fine. You might not have an enormous amount of success, but you'll still learn some things, and maybe get to the point that you don't need to ask as much anymore. (If you don't want to ask, then you can always just go for it whenever you think you might have the slightest chance, and the worst that will happen is that she'll slap you and you'll learn that wasn't the time, heh. Do apologize if that happens, of course, but then don't worry about it.)

The idea behind that applies to everything with dating - you learn by doing, and if you're too afraid of failing, then you never do, so you never learn, so you never get better. So you have to get out there and **do** even if it doesn't go perfectly, heh. It helps if you don't consider not getting her number/not getting a kiss/not getting a second date/whatever to be failure, but instead frame your personal definition of ""success"" around ""what did I learn?"" Later, once you've learned more, you can start focusing more on actually getting your end goal. (Though of course, whatever progress you do make with the person in question is a nice success too, that isn't your primary goal at the moment. Your primary goal is learning, getting experience, and building some confidence.)

With confidence, you do what you can and don't worry about the rest. Re-framing your definition of ""success"" may help with that. Talking to other people before trying to talk to pretty girls that catch your eye may also help with that - you can start offer to help old ladies in the grocery store, or strike up a conversation with a cashier, just to work on your social skills (because I'm assuming you have some trouble with most social interaction and it's just especially bad with pretty girls).

But even if your hands are shaking and you fumble your words, you can still *aim* for confidence. Don't get upset if you can't speak a coherent sentence; focus on what you want to say and what you find interesting about the other person. If you do something awkward, laugh it off. Smile. Don't let yourself get caught up in a cycle of worrying; if you realize you're worrying about something you can't really change, then consciously decide to think about something else instead, and remind yourself of that whenever you start to worry again (and don't get upset if you have to remind yourself a lot - it's okay).

In other words, you aren't supposed to look confident yet - you're supposed to *try*. By doing so, in whatever way you can, even if it's just telling yourself over and over ""I'm gonna be confident. I'm gonna be confident,"" you'll get closer than you were before. Any time that you chase perfection, you shouldn't be doing so because you expect to get there, but instead because that's how you improve."

Mata216,AskMen,1390238050.0,"Ok so this is what happens when some one hits you in the nuts.

If the impact is not that hard: At firts you know the pain its coming, so you start to feel the phases of pain, first theres some kind of pain in your guts, between your belly button and your penis/balls, its like a crescendo. The pain feels like when you have diarrhea, its not that intense (it depens on the force of the impact), the harder you get hit the more gut/lowerstomach pain you get, some how it is like a warning, the more i get this pain the more i know that my testicles are going to hurt, its proportional.
And when finally the gut pain is gone... you get the testicle pain, it is just like the firs, but in only occurs in the testicles, its very intense and can really put you down, we just grab our junk hoping that will easy it some how but man...you're doomed and theres no way back! The pain can last a minute or two depending on the impact, and it can make you pee blood if it was extreme.
Finally the pain starts to fade and you just feel...raped or somehow ashamed (Maybe its just me), even more if you gust bend over in the phase 2 and everyone laughs at you

The more harder the hit...the more pain you get. When you give a blow job, be sure to be gentle whith them, it is a very sensitive part and the pain you get is very uncomfortable, your can turn your man down if you hurt them. Some men dont like to be touched in there, some men like it, just ask first!

When you get cockslapped the pain goes the same way but is just like...very numb and uncomfortable.

Breakfast_King,swtor,1390238067.0,"Wow.

If all of that data is accurate, that is super impressive.  SWTOR's f2p system got a lot of flak from the gaming press when it was unveiled, but I actually always thought it was a good balance, considering you get to see the entire story without spending any money.

But this is really exciting.  If this game can stay this profitable, even with a significantly smaller playerbase than it had around launch, it (hopefully) means great things are in store in the future.  GSF hardly seemed like the kind of thing a failing MMO would sink it's money into, but if they've got this kind of support I'm really stoked to see what kind of ambitious stuff BW spits out in the coming months/years.

I'm curious how this relates to EA's exclusive deal with Disney over the Star Wars license.

screenmagnet,sex,1390238079.0,"To answer your other questions:

1. 'Just for him' sex: I don't think any man wants just for him sex. My bf didn't want it either, initially. But the alternative (waiting for me to be horny) just wasn't sustainable in the long term. It also made things much easier for *me*, because I felt that it took a lot of the pressure off of me. I didn't feel pressured to get myself in the mood, because I knew he was having enough sex. It also helped to alleviate my guilt. I had been the HL partner in previous relationships, so I knew exactly how my bf felt, and it broke my heart. I think the regular 'just for him' sex helped *both* of us feel better and less stressed about the situation. Your wife may feel differently though -- you would have to ask her.

2. The fact that she gets horny once a month (around the same time each month?) makes me think that the culprit really is the birth control.

3. Just tell her how much you miss the playfulness, and that it makes you feel loved when she is touchy-feely with you. Also tell her that she shouldn't be afraid of 'teasing' you or 'leading you on'. She may be holding off because she's afraid that you will interpret the playful touching as an attempt on her part to initiate sex. Reassure her that you won't expect sex simply because she is cupping your balls in the kitchen or playing with your soft penis on the couch. Tell her that that kind of touch fosters emotional intimacy because you feel vulnerable when she takes such a sensitive part of your body in her hand in that way.

You are going to need to walk a fine line between giving her space to figure this problem out, without dumping the whole problem in her lap to deal with on her own. Ask her how involved she wants you to be -- does she want you to come to the doctor with her? Do research and share your findings with her? How often does she want to 'check in' and talk about the progress you guys are making? Ask her how she wants to communicate about this issue -- go with the flow, or scheduled check in sessions on a weekly basis?

And ask her how she feels about managing your sex life together until her drive comes back. She initiates? You initiate? Sex only when you are both in the mood? Date nights? Ask her. If she is serious about fixing this issue, she should be able to communicate with you about it, and also she should be willing to come up with a workable plan together.

Good luck. Feel free to PM me if you have more questions."

New to you, but business as usual for the vast majority of men. You would think we'd have developed a better way to deal with it, but ""suck it up"" is still about as far as we have advanced in this department.

What makes this situation special and more difficult to deal with is ""the virgin's dilemma"". Which is resentment of the celibate period. If the celibate period is perceived as involuntary, then you've really got a difficult situation.

This 'dilemma' is posted about here almost frequently enough to classify it as an epidemic. One guy found success in secretly sleeping with another woman while away on a trip. It remains to be seen how this will work out long term and if he can live with the guilt. Others have opened their relationship temporarily. Some allowed only sex, some allowed both sex and emotions, some tried only opening it for the guy etc. 

A factor that is very likely to be on your side is age. Resentment of the celibate period is strongly tied to resentment of not experiencing sex with YOUNG women, specifically 21 years of age. As you are old enough to be out of the normal range for dating 21 year olds, age is on your side."

ashwinmudigonda,india,1390238228.0,"India's problem is more about lack of exercise than poor choice of diet. Yes, diet is a factor. Many of the older Indians tnd to eat a lot of rice (mainly in the South) and other carb-heavy food. Younger folks prefer quick foods. While McD's and Taco Bell-type fast food joints do exist in cities such as Mumbai, Bangalore, I don't think that they alone are contributing to the obesity pandemic.

You see, a couple of decades ago, people were relatively less well-off. They owned bicycles or walked/took a bus, rode a motorbike. The men had a relatively cushy life if they owned a motor vehicle, and normally ended up with a potbelly. Genes also play a role. Still, in genereal, there was a lot of exercise built into the daily routine, pretty much like New Yorkers. Then things changed. Everyone could afford a car, microwave, food processors, etc, and now women who traditionally performed the household chores with manual implements are also able to gain free time.

The point here is that very little time is invested into exercising. You will see people don their tennis shoes and go for a ""brisk walk"" in the evenings, but India's muggy climate makes that uncomfortable, and gyms are still seen as a luxury/chore. So if you can make an app that quantifies and lets users compare their energy expenditure, I think you'll have more bang for your buck.

It's very ironic that in trying to appear progressive towards gay rights, you're shitting all over religious freedoms, whereas both would be important for true egalitarianism.

Criticise the Vatican and homophobic Christians all you want, but as soon as you equate faith with the inability to think for oneself, you've become just as bigoted as those you're calling out.

And no, I'm not a practising Christian, I just can't stand hypocrisy and the mutual masturbation of ""edgy"" atheists. As if being atheist somehow made you better than non-atheists.

If someone was calling out objectification in that sub, talking about ladyboners would be a fair comparison. Both contain the objectification of celebrities.

The comment is just about some random woman who is doing something where how attractive she is shouldn't be a primary focus. The video is about karate. It's not a picture of a celebrity's photo shoot. And on reddit, you often see comments about how attractive a good looking girl is, despite the intent of the picture or video that she is featured in.

raika11182,Steam,1390238526.0,"Gaming family here. Wife and two kids, all share one Steam account.

Essentially, only one of you can be ""online"" at a time. The other computers can play but they need to be put in offline mode, and then only games that are fully up to date and don't require an active connection will work. It sucks, but it's better than the more aggressive DRM you see out of some companies, so I'll live with it. We don't usually get more than two devices playing at the same time, anyway. Trading cards confused the hell out of me for a long time. As a guy that pretty much just cares about playing games, I tried to ignore them. During the winter sale I crafted a couple badges just to try it out... I was underwhelmed. BUT - it turns out that people will pay you a little bit of money to be underwhelmed themselves. Some people care a WHOLE lot about those badges, so sell them! Most trading cards go for somewhere because 7 and 12 cents, but if you have a stack of them from various games, you can quickly rack up a buck or two in your steam wallet to spend on other games.

Valve IS working on a family sharing plan, but so far it seems worse than the informal sharing we have now. As I understand it, you can only share your entire library, and it's not accessible to you while the other person is playing. Valve is going to have to find a way to approach this for a better answer. I'm a PC gamer through and through, but local multiplayer is something developers and Valve need to work on."

The local coffee house with two locations is priced in between Starbucks and Tim Hortons. (A Starbucks recently opened within a Target here; we have four or five Tim's in our city.) Tim's is cheaper, though I can't stand their straight-up coffee. Generally prefer the coffee house that roasts their own coffee (as well as, funnily enough, McDonald's) over Starbucks, though Starbucks isn't bad.

If my partner were to say to me what your partner said to you, I would understand their desire. But the choice I make would really depend on how it was said. 

Was it said as, ""Just to let you know, I may slip and have a casual sexual encounter with other women/men""? In that case, it would be a red flag that the person is not concerned with my feelings enough to talk about it - they are simply informing me.

Was it said as, ""You know, even though we are getting married, I still have desires to explore my sexuality outside of this relationship. I would like to talk about the possibility of modifying our relationship to allow us each to be open to having other sexual encounters""? In that case, they are starting a discussion and then I would need to see where it goes. Clearly they want my input and my input matters to them, my feelings matter to them.

In the first case, it is simply a red flag for bad communication and a disregard for my feelings, and I might be wanting to reconsider the marriage. In the second case, it depends on the outcome of the discussion. If we both agree to the modification of the relationship paradigm, then no big deal. If we disagree and the partner chooses to go ahead with the plan anyways then see the first case scenario."

agent_of_entropy,AskReddit,1390239137.0,"Located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, Rome is the largest city in and the county seat of Floyd County, Georgia, United States. It is the principal city of the Rome, Georgia, Metropolitan Statistical Area, population 96,250 (2009), which encompasses all of Floyd County. At the 2010 census, the city itself had a total population of 36,303,[1] and is the largest city in Northwest Georgia and the 19th largest city in the state.

Although no Interstate highway passes through Rome, it is the second largest city, after Gadsden, Alabama, near the center of the triangular area defined by the Interstate highways between Atlanta, Birmingham and Chattanooga, which contributes to its importance as a regional center in several areas, such as medical care and education. Rome is the home of Darlington School, Berry College and Shorter University.

Rome's name is a commemoration of the Italian city of Rome. Rome, Georgia, was built on seven hills with a river running between them, a feature that was an inspiration for the name. This connection is emphasized by a replica of the statue of Romulus and Remus nursing from a mother wolf, a symbol of the original Rome, which was a 1929 gift from Italian dictator Benito Mussolini."

&gt;what could i have possibly meant otherwise when i stated that because the system is boring doesnt mean its a bad system, which follows nothing other than the context within this thread.

I've already accepted that I was also in the wrong here, that I quickly jumped to conclusions when I should've considered your words in a different light... But it seems that it's *you* that can't accept your own fault, that your wordings could've been interpreted in a different way.

This is a bit of a stretch for a comparison, but it's like you're one of those religious extremists that think only their way of thought is the right way and won't accept any kind of flaws pointed out by other people, even if it's clear that you are the one at fault.

&gt;so maybe u should get the stick out ur ass.

.....Get off your high horse and accept that you're also in the wrong, or are you too much of a ""macho man"" to acknowledge your own mistakes?

1wiseguy,engineering,1390239276.0,"A TEC is kind of exotic. Do you really need that level of cooling? A fan is a lot easier.

Anyway, the concept of thermal vias is that the via walls are made of copper, which is a really good conductor, and the rest of the board is FR4, which you can assume is a non-conductor. So you just have to figure out how much copper there is, and do the math. 

The copper plating on holes is generally 1 mil (0.001 inch), but you can verify that with the board shop. They can also do thicker plating, but it might be more practical to stick with the standard process.

You can control the via size and spacing, so you can get about as much copper as you need.

If the chip has a thermal pad that solders to the board, an issue that you must consider is that the vias will suck solder from the joint by capillary action. If there are a lot of vias, you might end up with a dry solder joint. There are ways to mitigate that, such as plugging the via holes with solder mask, either on the top or bottom, or filling the holes with epoxy and plating the top with copper (via-in-pad technology).

You can find articles that discuss these things in detail.

&gt;you would realise that nuclear is too big for companies to research, thus mayority of funding falls to governments, while a wast majority of renewable research is done by companies and not included here, since companies get tax breaks and other incentives for that, which are not listed as R&amp;D for renewable.

Sure, and that's one of the reasons why renewables are superior to nuclear in all its varieties: the private sector can help push the cart. Solar heaters and panels are within reach of private families, windmills are affordable for small capitals. You've got a double engine for R&amp;D and deployment.

&gt;Another part is subsidy and fixed buys of renewable electricity at extraordinary prices, even 3x above market price for German Solar.

Nuclear energy producers are worried because wind power is undercutting them. As I've showed, governments have been pouring prodigious quantities of money into nuclear. Without subsidies, they would be the first to close the books.

&gt;which is obsolete if we research fast breeder reactor

All of which are still in the experimental, if not theoretical stage. Come back when it works.

&gt;To add insult to injury most electric cars have way lower taxes then common ones while processing materials for batterys poison whole contries.

All of our industrial activities do that, once into circulation they can be recycled if used in solar panels. When used for nuclear, they'll just add to the pile of nuclear waste we don't know what to do with. Not to mention that uranium mining isn't exactly the cleanest process on the planet either."

She's insecure about your relationship and she deals with her insecurities in a very bad way. 

Either talk to her and tell her this behavior is unacceptable and the ""right"" way to handle her insecurities is to talk to you about them and keep open communication. 
OR you walk away and take a break from the relationship and reassess what you really want in a relationship and what you're willing to put up with.

Under no circumstances are you to help with her insecurities though because these things grow out of proportion very quickly. So don't tell her that she can have unlimited access to your phone and she has to delete those screen shots.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1390239621.0,"First of all, she's not interested. She was actively trying to set you up with her gorgeous friend, and she's ducking out on hanging out with you. She wasn't insisting you go to the party so she could hang out with you, she insisted you to go the party because you've been hanging around a lot and making it clear you have a crush on her and she's trying to deflect that interest to someone else. This is common in young women who haven't learned how to be both assertive and polite when letting someone down. 

Second, she's not interested because a girl who is really interested in your wouldn't be put off by her roommate or friend's disapproval without a very good reason. I don't see how it's any of his business who either of you date, and honestly, the fact that it's a concern is a signal of how immature all parties involved are. 

Third, she's not interested because I see no signs in your post that she is. 

&gt;We both can't help but smile when we make eye contact and she acts really bashful when she talks to me. 

Yeah, those aren't signs of interest. Girls will smile to be polite. Being bashful isn't a sign she's into you, it's a sign that she's either a) shy or b) wishes you would leave her alone but is too insecure or uncertain to speak up.

Look, I know I've put this across pretty harshly, but the fact is, you need a dose of reality. This is how you act when you are into a girl: you say, ""I really like you, and I want to take you out on a date. Would you like to go out to dinner with me sometime?"" Don't give a time that she could deflect with ""I'm busy that day,"" get a yes or no answer as to whether she wants to date you before setting up a time. If she says yes, awesome. If she says anything other than yes, she means no and doesn't know how to reject a guy yet.  "

NuttyFanboy,relationships,1390239702.0,"ASD is a funny beast in the respect to dating - I speak from personal experience here.

Body language is a major barrier here, and even if you tackle the mindset you quoted above, will be challenging to overcome. Of course, it's different for every person on the spectrum, as in, the details vary, but a lack of body language is often part of the problem.  
Mabye to explain it somewhat more relatable, I feel like there is a major bit of the Uncanny Valley at play here; In a nutshell: Something that looks human, but not *quite human enough* in its behaviour, so it gives us the creeps.

In the ten to eleven years I've actively worked on my behaviour, body language and mindset, I haven't had much success overall, and overall it is likely more a behavioral problem rather than one of looks (despite me being chubby, broad-shouldered and ginger - not in the sense of a turn-off in general, but I'm sure that I don't fit the bill of what some women want and was turned down because of that, and that's fine - each to his/her own preferences.).

The few women I have attracted over the years were, with one exception, all for a lack of better words mental. Borderline personality disorders, narcicissts, control freaks and one with a preference for cheating. I've become careful to look out for those signs and tread carefully when signs for those appear.  
On the flipside, the women I've been attracted to, and I've expressed interest in, had a tendency to turn me down for a 'lack of spark', though describing me as great boyfriend material, and dressing well, in many cases. I don't mind or blame them for turning me down - it happens. But more than one told me that I feel 'off', without knowing of my ASD.

Compiling all that data, and the disparate response between the manipulative/abusive group and the one attractive to me, suggests an issue with body language:

* I have very little 'natural' body language. I tend to mirror people around me, though it may or may not come off as a bit clumsy, as my fine motor skills are something lackluster.
* If I don't consciously use body language, I tend to revert to my neutral face and crossed arms position (which people often describe as 'haunted' or 'pissed off', even though it is far from the truth). Alternatively I tend to cross my feet under the table, and often begin tapping with one of my feet, which, I guess, can be irritating to people as well if noticed.
* I tend to periodically withdraw from the group to recharge my social battery. People are draining, and I find it helps if I can take regular breaks in a relatively quiet place. Seems to be a social faux pas at times, but I need it - for the sake of the group. No need to begin snapping at them because I can't recharge a bit.

* Additionally to the lack of body language, I rarely make eye contact, or even fake it. It's an *intense as hell* experience for me. Similarly, I have sensory issues. Physical touch (by skin) makes my skin crawl, though it is lesser and lesser the more I trust a person. Thus I rarely look people in the eye or touch them. This *can* come across as 'not interested' , 'withdrawn', 'cold', the likes, which puts one at a massive disadvantage in the early stages of courtship. Even worse may be that it comes across as being insecure or nervous, even though I'm not - and as I'm told this is the opposite of confidence, which also may explain a fair bit.

Don't get me wrong. It can be compensated to a degree with (quite) some training, but if one is naturally labeled as slightly creepy or giving off a 'mass murderer' vibe, without intending to, it's easy to see how it is challenging for people on the spectrum to progress, despite best intentions and possibly being a great match overall.

I don't mean this as an insult to the general population, mind you - the subconscious is hell of a thing, and serves a purpose more often than not, spotting trouble before it is too late. In the same vein, though, we can set off a whole lot of subconscious alarm bells, without even meaning to. In that respect, there might be some challenge for both parties to push through this initial barrier only to find they are perfectly viable partners."

ninety6days,ireland,1390239808.0,"&gt;Because those professions bring them into contact with a lot of people and they hear a lot of stories which might plant a seed that they should do something to help their community? I don't know, who cares... there are people from all spectrum's there, it doesn't make them better politicians depending on what they did before. What would a dairy farmer know about pig farming? What would a network software engineer know about the mechanical engineering his department covers? What would a nurse know about psychology? What would a stock broker know about bank regulation? Not much more than someone not from those fields, but what they would know would be poisoned by their biased view towards one field.

When an occupation that makes up less than 10% of the workforce is represented by nearly 18% of the politicians, the question must be asked. I'm trying to open a discussion about what experience makes a good politician, not claim that any makes bad ones.

&gt;But fine, even disregarding that: TD Byrne was a carpenter, TD Flanagan worked in a supermarket, manufacturing/retail enough?

No, not at all. Carpentry is construction, not manufacture.

&gt;Possible, but unlikely. Have you ever worked for a boss who thought he knew how to do what you did? It makes everything take twice as long because he wants you to do it the way he did it 20 years ago and not use new techniques or ones he's not familiar with. Bosses who just have project management experience are far preferable as they let you handle the nitty-gritty technical stuff and they deal with their bosses and overview of the team. **Nobody wants a boss who knows their stuff.**

More absolute nonsense. Ever had a boss that didn't have a fucking clue? I'm not saying you have to be an expert in the jobs below you to be a good manager but jesus christ don't make it sound like it's always a bad thing. Or should we abandon the whole concept of internal advancement in a field? By your logic we should.

&gt;We did have them in charge you idiot. And look where it got us, arguably we'd have been better off not having a finance minister who thought he knew better than his advisers. How can you blog about politics and be this ill informed?

When exactly did we have a group of economists and lawyers running the country? I'm ill-informed and your revising history to say that not only did we apparently have a meritocracy at some point, but that it was a bad thing (whenever you think it happened)??? Bearing in mind the 30th dail was about 25% nepotist appointments? Back up this statement, even if you've ignored the holes i've poked in everything further up.

&gt;makes you seem like you talk about politics a lot, and link you give to your blog is to an article about... politics. And the random article/month I clicked at at the bottom brought me to an article about the American elections. Amazing how I came to that conclusion isn't it? But fine, apologies. ""For a blogger who talks about politics a lot"" is more accurate I guess.

I do a bit lately, two posts in 4 days. BTW, nobody controls what fucking ads are at the bottom of their site. 

&gt; I'm just fine with people having worked in any field before becoming a TD. I don't think that it matters if there are 23 teachers, 8 lawyers, and whatever bankers. They aren't there to teach or to lawyer or to bank. They're there to be public representatives (ie: to represent the public interest), and as long as they're able to do that well (and yes, many aren't) who cares?

So tell me, what experience do YOU think makes a good TD?"

rboymtj,movies,1390239855.0,"Text:  

Actually, the movie was largely a lie about me. I was an engineer at HP designing the iPhone 5 of the time, their scientific calculators. I had many friends and a good reputation there. I designed things for people all over the country, for fun, all the time too, including the first hotel movie systems and SMPTE time code readers for the commercial video world. Also home pinball games. Among these things, the Apple I was the FIFTH time that something I had created (not built from someone else's schematic) was turned into money by Jobs. My Pong game got him his job at Atari but he never was an engineer or programmer. I was a regular member at the Homebrew Computer Club from day one and Jobs didn't know it existed. He was up in Oregon then. I'd take my designs to the meetings and demonstrate them and I had a big following. I wasn't some guy nobody talked to, although I was shy in social settings. i gave that computer design away for free to help people who were espousing the thoughts about computers changing life in so many regards (communication, education, productivity, etc.). I was inspired by Stanford intellectuals like Jim Warren talking this way at the club. Lee Felsenstein wanted computers to help in things like the antiwar marches he'd orchestrated in Oakland and I was inspired by the fact that these machines could help stop wars. Others in the club had working models of this computer before Jobs knew it existed. He came down one week and I took him to show him the club, not the reverse. He saw it as a businessman. It as I who told Jobs the good things these machines could do for humanity, not the reverse. I begged Steve that we donate the first Apple I to a woman who took computers into elementary schools but he made my buy it and donate it myself.  

When I first met Jobs, I had EVERY Dylan album. I was a hardcore fan. I had bootlegs too. Jobs knew a few popular Dylan songs and related to the phrase ""when you ain't got nothin' you got nothing to lose."" I showed Jobs all my liner notes and lyrics and took him to record stores near San Jose State and Berkeley to buy Dylan bootlegs. I showed him brochures full of Dylan quotes and articles and photos. I brought Jobs into this Dylan world in a big way. I would go to the right post office at midnight, in Oakland, to buy tickets to a Dylan concert and would take Jobs with me. Jobs asked early on in our friendship whether Dylan or the Beatles were better. I had no Beatles album. We both concurred that Dylan was more important because he said important things and thoughtful things. So a Beatles fan was kind of a pop lamb to us. Why would they portray us in the movie as Dylan for Jobs and Beatles for me?  

And when Jobs (in the movie, but really a board does this) denied stock to the early garage team (some not even shown) I'm surprised that they chose not to show me giving about $10M of my own stock to them because it was the right thing. And $10M was a lot in that time.  

Also, note that the movie showed a time frame in which every computer Jobs developed was a failure. And they had millions of dollars behind them. My Apple ][ was developed on nothing and productized on very little. Yet it was the only revenue and profit source of the company for the first 10 years, well past the point that Jobs had left. The movie made it seem that board members didn't acknowledge Jobs' great work on Macintosh but when sales fall to a few hundred a month and the stock dives to 50% in a short time, someone has to save the company. The proper course was to work every angle possible, engineering and marketing, to make the Macintosh marketable while the Apple ][ still supported us for years. This work was done by Sculley and others and it involved opening the Macintosh up too.  

The movie shows Steve's driving of the Macintosh team but not the stuff that most of the team said they'd never again work for him. It doesn't show his disdain and attempts to kill the Apple ][, our revenue source, so that the Macintosh wouldn't have to compete with it. The movie audience would want to see a complete picture and they can often tell when they are being shortchanged.  

And ease of computer came to the world more than anything from Jef Raskin, in many ways and long before Jef told us to look into Xerox. Jef was badly portrayed.  

And if you think that our investor and equal stock holder and mentor Mike Markkula was Jobs' stooge (and not in control of everything), well, you have been duped.  

Jobs mannerisms and phrases are motivational and you need a driver to move things along. But it's also important to have the skills to execute and create products that will be popular enough to sell for more than it costs to make them. Jobs didn't have that success at Apple until the iPod, although OS X deserves the credit too. These sorts of things people would have wanted to see, about Jobs or about Apple, but the movie gives other images of what was behind it all and none add up.﻿"

 * Mother was *Donna Reed* -type

 * Father served in Marines, went to Korea

* Dislikes Maggies parents, especially hers father

 * Tries not to engage in conversation with him

  * Just wants to get out of there

* Show didn't beat around bush. He is tapping Lisa, court clerk

 * Hart, even years later, is making up excuses for hes cheating

     * *""You gotta decompress before you can go being a family man""*, *""Some times you gotta get yours head right""*, *""It's for your wife and kids, too""* etc.

    * Not clear yet what Lisa gets out of fucking with Hart

     * He is a lot older and married while Lisa clearly isn't some naive blue eyed child with beliefs that Heart would leave hes family for her

     * Naughty girl tho, somehow I think handcuffs would be only peak of iceberg of hers... naughtiness

 * Hart cares for Lisa, e.g. telling her to avoid partying etc. when perp is still out there

 * When confronted about cheating, by Cohle, he lashes out. With flavors of regret and fear?

     * Tries to turn situation around, how Cohle is the one stepping out the bounds by talking *nasty* about hes wife, but they both know that Cohle knows now

* Before dinner tries to convince Maggie that theirs marriage would work better if she just didn't ask too many questions and how he wants to be with hes family

 * In frustration paints picture where he expects hes family to help him, to be for him

 * In anger and frustration ends up slashing out on Maggie, *""Feel bad for me crap""* &amp; *""Even your mom thinks you're a ball-buster""*

 * Ends up regretting pretty much everything what he said to Maggie in frustration

* Wants to stand on higher moral ground, but hes *weaknesses* pull him down

**Cohle**

* Distant with hes parent

 * Mom is alive, maybe

 * Father lives in Alaska? Fought in Vietnam

* Accidental[?] death of daughter, Sofia, pushed him and ex-wife apart

 * *""And as for my daughter, she uh...  she spared me the sin of being a father""*

 * They tease Cohle as reason for girls death, but I suspect it being red herring

 * Death of child caused hes marriage to crack

 * Transferred from robbery to narco soon after

     * Started doing a lots of drugs, 24/7

     * Caused him to lose hes wife, Claire, for good

     * Bust dealers etc. for free drugs, clipped crankhead that got him into real trouble

     * Stayed out of jail, see below

 * Tells Hart about incident, gets hes sympathy

*  4 years of undercover work, as *floater*, related to narcotic

 * *""...and there was no fuckin' expiration date, baby""*

 * Feb '93 killed 3 cartel men, got shot and got landed into Northshore Psychiatric Hospital, in Lubbock, Texas

      * As a Finn I didn't get joke about hospital being in Lubbock, Texas

 * Got offered psych pension, but instead cashed in favors to get into homicide. Landed to Louisiana

      * The body is not one member, but many. Now are they many, but of one body

 * Caused him problems with sleeping, *""PTSD.. exhausted nerves.. what ever""*

* Years of drug use caused him to see *things / visions* that weren't there

 * Learned to tell difference, what is real and what isn't

      * *""Most of the time I was convinced that I'd lost it""*

      * *""But there were other times... I thought I was mainlining the secret truth of the universe""*

 * Still uses drugs on daily[?] basis, but has it under control seemingly

 * He doesn't anymore have those visions, at time of interview. Being clean for years has stopped them

* Less and less looks like he is perp as he is actively pursuing leads from Johns and other prosts on hes own time

* Too smart for hes own good, especially because he isn't afraid to say how things are

 * *""Xerox all you want. Make you feel like good cops.""*

 * *""Be serious, boss. This God-bothering shit. It's a political circle-jerk. You know this.""*

* Confronted Hart about fucking around as expected

 * *""You wash up. You got some pussy on you""*

* *""Has sharp eye for weakness""*

 * Turns out that taking toolbox to head with quite a lot force is mans weakness

 * Most likely this line was intended as reference and foreshadowing, combined with Hart sniffing hes fingers, to how fast Cohle got read on Hart. Figuring out how Hart is stepping out on hes wife and possible a lot more

* Marriage

 * Was married only once, to Claire

 * Almost married another time, to woman called Laurie

      * Was hooked up with Laurie through Maggie, but thing fell apart

* Doesn't think it's good for people to be around him. He wears 'em down, makes them unhappy

 * Job didn't change him, but him being that way made him right for the job

**Maggie**

* Knows something is up with Hart

 * Has she *smelled* pussy on him?

* Doesn't share here concerns, thoughts, with hers mother

 * Hers mother talks to Hart. Maggie afraid that if she shares to mom it would come back to her?

 * Hart and Maggie's mother talk. *""Well, you beat up on what you can't control""* is Maggies mother referencing Hart's work?

**Audrey &amp; Maisie Hart**

* They know mom &amp; dad aren't doing so well

 * *""Are you coming""* little girl asked from hers daddy, hoping he would come to dinner with them and mommy

* Dads work has creeped into house, into girls minds, even when Hart *tries to keep it out*

 * See hes justifications for drinking and cheating

 * *""You don't have a mommy or daddy anymore. Yours just died in an accident""*

      * Borderline creepy crime scene setup with dolls 

**Case**

* They address sculpture showing up like that in that small playhouse

 * Nobody knew why it was there

      * Aunt suspected girl did it, but Cohle saw it as sign, conversation, by perp

* Dora [vic]

 * Dora's mother got informed about hers death

      * Dora's father is dead. May 11, 1984

 * Dora started visiting church, told hers mother ~month ago

      * Dora's diary has leaflet for church between pages, instructions / map for its location

      * They suspect someone was steadily drugging her at church, increasing dose over time

 * Had gambling issues in past

 * They get hold of hers diary

      * References to the Yellow King, Carcosa

      * Church leaflet

 * *""She sounds sad, Marty, like a torn-up person on her last legs""*

* Spanish Lake

 * *""Shelter""* for girls, called *""The Ranch""*

 * Protected by local sheriff, Bilson, to some extent

 * Shelter / workplace for prosts, no age limits

      * *Hillbilly bunny ranch*, like Cohle puts it

      * Hart wants to take moral high ground, but also gets set back by uncle remark from *Ma'am*

* Perp

 * Hits prosts

 * Artistic

 * Religious

 * Has scope and vision, not drug insanity

* Cohle's history in undercover help them to find new leads through CI's

 * Old Johns

 * Prosts

 * General locals

* More pressure is building from top and shit is sliding downwards

 * New detectives get tasked to investigate cases with *possible occult links*, they get hooked into this case

      * No connection between dead cats and murdered women, or is there?

      * Hart &amp; Cohle don't want had this case over to this new taskforce

 * Major

 * Commander

 * Governor's Office

* Higher ups want to sweep case under the rug *ASAP* while Hart's &amp; Cohle's boss, Major, doesn't want hes best detectives in spotlight with dead case

 * Deadline to get something factual together is two weeks now

* Big throwdown in the wood, between Hart and Cohle? What that will be about?

 * Interviewers, for now, brush it to side and want to know how **Cohle** worked the case

* Church

 * Birds, Cohle's hallucination, flying and form symbol that was on vic

 * Old and burned down years ago

 * Very remote, middle of nowhere. Next to industrial area

 * Owl, more symbolism with significance?

 * Woman with hers hands bound and antlers on hers head painted to wall

*""And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean""*

 - Mark 1:41

      - King James Bible

*""He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people who were therein""*

Then, come along people that call themselves anarchists (When previously called 'Liberals' in the 19th/early 20th century) just because they are against the state (And even when their main thinkers came right out and clearly stated, ""We are not anarchists.""), and do not understand the origins of anti-statism in anarchist circles.

Now, I couldn't care less if they called themselves ""anarchists"", whatever. However, the problems start when they start to muddle and change the meaning and history of the movement to the point where the historically consistent anarchists get called ""Not real anarchists"".

That summer, our love truly blossomed: we took road trips together across Texas; eating at new resteraunts, checking into cheap motels, and walking downtown, hand in hand at night. We helped each other out when our kids were stressing us out, and after our kids were put to bed, we would cuddle on the porch of my cabin, and look at the stars.

fnredditacct,relationships,1390240051.0,"It could be that marriage is not for you.

It could also be that you know he is not the one you should marry.

I agree with /u/idontwearsweatpants. What does marriage really mean to you? Do you want *that?*

Does your bf fit into *your* picture of marriage?

Since getting married, I have realized what older people meant when they said, 'love is not enough.'

This does not mean that love isn't strong enough to overcome obstacles. It also doesn't mean that love isn't important to a relationship, or a marriage.

But marriage is *about* commitment. It is easier, and better I'm sure, to commit to someone you love. Love probably makes for a stronger commitment. But love does not give someone the ability or desire to commit. 

It really is about having 'a partner in life.' 

Like a safety buddy whose hand you don't let go of. It is far easier not to let go of the hand of someone you like/love. But you have to be okay with not having the use of that hand as well. And agree to keep holding on even in times when you don't like/love them.(Analogies kinda suck, apologies for that.)

Not wanting that is okay! And it doesn't mean you love a person less than someone who does want that commitment. At least, not IMO. 

Wanting to commit is not the same as feeling love. Loving someone is not the same as being able, or wanting, to commit. "

That's not ""police business.""  Police business is enforcing the laws and ensuring that people follow the laws.  One way they do that is by setting up speed traps.

He did not interfere with that business.  He did not obstruct their vehicles, or prevent them from arresting anyone, or interfere with their lawful ability to enforce the laws.  All he did was stand there with a sign designed to prevent people from breaking the laws.

Interfering with police business is a crime that requires certain elements to be met.  Those elements are not met here (which is why the police did not charge him with that).

&gt;And the police want those people to think there could be cops anywhere so that they'll slow down all the time, not just for a few minutes when they see a sign.

What the police want, in this instance, is irrelevant.  The police do not get to charge someone with a crime based upon what they want.  They charge someone with a crime based upon that person having violated a law.

&gt;This has already been discussed extensively in this thread so I have to assume you're just being willfully ignorant now.

I'm not being willfully ignorant, I'm correcting other people, who are flat out wrong. 

This man has not violated any law.  Interfering with police business is a very specific set of circumstances, which were not met here.  **The fact that this man was not interfering with police business or obstructing justice is borne out by the fact that the police did not charge him with either of those offenses.**  What he was charged with was a violation of a municipal sign ordinance."

You say that you wish it was ""that easy"" to change your behavior. In fact, it's not that easy and no one is saying it is. Look at what you've done here. You are aware there is a problem, you know what the problem is, you have posted here seeking advice for the problem, and yet you state, up front, with no apology, that you are going to perpetuate the behaviors that are part of the problem with the very people you have asked to help you. 

The fact is, *the only way you will stop doing this to your relationships is if you stop doing this.* You have to change your behavior if you want the results to change, full stop. There is no easy way around that, and it's sure as hell not ""that easy"". It may be the hardest thing you've ever done.

Of course you're right that insurance rates get adjusted as a result of accidents, but there still has to be an initial rate that is set prior to any accidents happening.  An insurance company wants to make money in the long run, so if the probability of them having to pay for a man getting into a car crash is greater than the same for a woman then it makes sense for them to charge the man higher, since in the long run they will be giving more money to men than women.  If the drivers can prove themselves to be safe and thus get their rate lowered then that's great.  But, when someone first signs up for insurance all the company knows is their past driving record, and statistics, so that's how they have to calculate how much to charge.  It is not discrimination based on gender.  It's based on empirical evidence that one group gets in more accidents on average than the other (although I've now found out that those statistics are false, but for the sake of argument we can pretend they are true).

I don't like either of your examples because in both cases you're taking a consequential action (jailing someone, paying someone for work) and comparing it to a preemptive action (setting an insurance premium)."

Even if you have a cheat meal/beverage you should log the calories to the best of your ability and it should not be frequent. It is okay to do this on occasion. 

Use a food scale and make sure you are eating a portion size. I would also consider dropping to 1500 calories if not more (but not less than 1200).

Montuckian,confession,1390240574.0,"&gt; I believe your statements about STDs are greatly exaggerated

You don't have to believe me.  It's why I linked to the CDC.

&gt; Your fear of casual sex

I've never been accused of that before. I suppose there's a first time for everything.

Life lesson?: I think as you age a bit, you'll find that people who have a healthy respect for the risks of casual sex (as well as a healthy respect for their partners) are the ones who engage in it.

The players, misogynists, boasters, and their ilk all have their time, but it's short lived and centered on women who don't know any better.  There's a reason why that creepy dude at the bar only goes after 21 year olds, the older ones know the tricks.  

The folks that are the most promiscuous are the ones that are discrete and respectful, in my experience.

&gt; Implying that she now holds an unhealthy body and it's my responsibility to confess to stop her from spreading more disease to future romantic partners is silly and childish.

No, what's childish is trying to hide your misdeeds when they have a real risk of hurting someone else, especially someone who you've claimed to be close to.

The fact is that you don't *know* if she has an unhealthy body, but if she does that it's likely because of something *you did*.

Getting yourself tested (which I'm assuming you haven't done) and telling her to be tested is the least you can do in this circumstance.

&gt; It has to do with emotional, philosophical and spiritual reasons.

She's not going to care about the existential implications of this breakup if she has bumps on her lady parts.  You're also assuming that she's going to take this poorly, maybe she's just about to do the same thing to you.

Beyond that, it's my experience, people put these complex reasons forward when they don't want to look at the simple reasons staring them in the face.

In the spirit of /r/confession, and in an effort to show that I'm not trying to judge but rather to impart some perspective, this is the axe that I'm grinding: 

I'm in my 30s now and even though I've been in a relationship for a bit, I've been lucky to have had a number of encounters with a number of women both long-term and casual in about equal parts.

When I was younger, I was less careful but very lucky, thankfully never having to shamefully call a former partner.  But that's not the case with many of the people who were in the same circle as I was, who were all living in the same college town, sleeping with the same network of people.

Over time more and more folks, although not a plurality by any means, began to contract things.  HPV, Herpes, etc.

And there was one theme in almost all of their stories.  Although many of these folks were sex positive, promiscuous, life-loving folks, they almost universally did not contract their infections from their casual partners.  Rather they contracted their STIs from long-term partners that were either sleeping around or who hadn't been tested and assumed that since they weren't showing, they were clean.

Yeah, long story from Uncle Montuckian, but the point is that in relationships, however tacit, maturity means that you accept responsibility for your actions and attempt to limit the harm that they cause.  Everyone makes mistakes, but it's how you deal with them that shows your mark of character.

Also:

&gt; Technically the most upvoted comment at this time is stating that I should not actually confess to her as it'll only cause more damage

The fact that upvotes are swaying the way that you think should really give you some reason for self reflection."

That being said, it's often a good idea to give comforting thoughts like, ""Things will be alright"" ""I'm here for you"" ""We can handle this together"" etc... It's also not a great idea to downplay her feelings. Telling her something like, ""There's no reason to worry so much"" or ""It's all in your mind"" because it's dismissing something that is a very real concern for her.

When you are going to try new things out to help, keep in mind what the problem is. If she is in a situation she can't handle, removing her from it without drawing attention can be good. When she is going through the attacks and her body is full of that fight-or-flight stuff it can be good to do something active to work through it. Some people like space and to be alone, others like having someone there. 

Also, it's worth mentioning, take care of yourself too and make sure your psychological and emotional needs are taken care of too. For one thing, you remaining calm and being alright will help her. For another, being the primary support of anyone can be taxing and you need to make sure that you're alright too."

One thing I learned in econ 101 is businesses don't like to get involved in ""price wars"" for instances because in the end, while it's great for the customers, their bottom lines get hurt.

I got a second job as a janitor for a small sensor company near my home.  I made a point to always be curious and knowledgeable about what they were doing whenever I ran into one of the engineers or the owner.  I was eventually offered a job in sales, with a semester left to go.  When I graduated, I was a full time sales engineer for them.  Again, I made sure to always know what the other engineers were working on, and did my own research to better understand.  I was able to help come up with solutions to issues they were having.

Um, adults who value consent and whether or not their partner actually wants to have sex at that moment?

No, I'm not a virgin. I get that for some people having sex while high or drunk enhances the experience. I have feminist friends who have no issues with doing this. And if that's as far as your intent goes in getting drunk before having sex, I really don't care.

But **legally speaking** (and the person who originally typed this was a different poster, to clarify), if you are impaired you can not give consent. The reason for that is that while some people like drunk sex, it's also pretty easy for assholes to take advantage of people with little more than alcohol."

I envision it as some sort of smallish building that has a large circle of effect surrounding it, and increases crop yield of flowering plants (apple trees and the like) and/or increases honey yield, based on the number of flowering plants in that area.

To be really ridiculous the game could start modeling flowering time on crops, and to maximize honey production you'd want a wide variety of flowering seasonals in the hive building's area, so that the bees have a constant source of food during growing seasons.  Like, not all apples, but apples, pears, sunflowers, and all that, such that there are fewer/no 'boom and bust' cycles for the bees.

The honey and wax then become commodities in the local market sure, but iirc there's already a brewery right?  So add mead as a potential fermenting option.  And houses need light right?  Beeswax candles provide a more efficient light source that reduces the use of some other resource use, like, wood, or something.

I agree its a second order-type concern, but if you want to introduce synergies into the game, I think this is a great option."

Kaisharga,asexuality,1390241049.0,"32m here.

It's actually surprisingly likely for a relationship to survive for a while without sex, but it takes people a few years after college-age to realize this. There's a lot of pressure in mainstream American culture to have a bunch of sex all the time (except if you're a girl in which case the message is *super* complicated although ""have a bunch of sex all the time"" is in that soupy mess), and that takes a bit of doing to shake off.

(I also feel compelled to note that virginity is kind of a shitty and oppressing concept. I'll spare you the rest of my thoughts on that matter.)

I live with a couple (24 and 30, maybe?) who, as far as I know, have never had sex with eachother, and they've been in a relationship for some 4-ish years. I suspect they're asexual but that's not really information to which I'm privileged. It developed organically; they met (and I met each of them) on an online messageboard community, and it just sort of happened when they found they had compatible relationship needs. 

I think that's the key, though. Find someone who mostly wants what you want, and respects your wishes when theirs don't quite line up. If you regularly have to ""compromise"" in order to allow them to even function (as I have heard in many cases of relationships between nonlibidinous asexuals and distinctly libidinous sexuals), that's probably not the right place to be.

So don't have sex just because he wants it. Have sex because you want it (even if you want it for his sake). Stuff is crazy and if it's not working now, it's not likely to start suddenly working at any point--pay most of your attention to the present, and the future will be much easier.

However, I think the untouched photos being published is a good thing because Lena Dunham *is* a walking advertisement and image, as are all celebrities. They are bought and sold, published and plastered, all through-out society. If their likeness is constantly being modified in a way that creates an unrealistic image of beauty then I think *that* should be exposed. 

Women should be shown the reality of what the magazines publishers and fashion editors are peddling when they are largely responsible for the beauty culture, the objectification of women, et al. 

Maybe I'm pointing a fat finger here and some people are dodging the blame, but my point is pretty simple: 

If media is willing to distort the images they use to make money off women at the expense of women's confidence, then they deserve to have their tricks exposed so as consumers we can stop comparing ourselves to the imagined and produced perfection of a marketing team.

We spend a lot of time together, but never more than half the week because I have other stuff going on. I quite like my time alone, so that works quite well with not being in his pockets all the time. I try to get him to communicate his plans early after a similar incident to yours when I ended up alone for a whole miserable weekend when I had expected him to be around. Now I make plans for myself (regardless of whether that's cleaning, socializing, etc.) and if he fits into them then that's great, otherwise it's no big deal. 

You could try just spending less time together (particularly the living together thing - no wonder your old friends don't invite you out! Get back in there with them, ask what's occurring and ask to join them). 

I'm sorry to say this but he's (in a way) been quite clear about his feeling re: you moving to his country. He's not interested in a scenario where you're TOTALLY dependent on him. Having moved abroad for work myself but met many foreigners here who moved for love I'd say it's a long tough road and most do not make it. Do you really want to be heartbroken just after moving somewhere amazing? 

Take a deep breath and start your action plan. Socialize more with your old friends and drama group people (you've got a start there already, see if more want to join you), and see if people in your language class want to hang out. I don't see the point in taking on more activities and getting stressed out when you've got 2 pools of people you hardly seem to be exploring. 

When you socialize with your boyfriend treat it as a fantastic opportunity to practice what you've learned in class. Yes, it's awkward as fuck, but 99.99% of people *love it* when someone is trying in their native tongue. You can even get them to teach you funny words if you and they are up for it, and that's quite an easy way to be the life and soul of a party. "

Did I ever deny that it makes sense to keep speed traps hidden?  Please show me where I did.  Good luck, because it's not there.

The fact that it makes sense to keep speed traps hidden is wholly irrelevant to whether this man committed a crime.

I didn't ignore those arguments, they simply aren't relevant.  Similarly, it would ""make sense"" for the police to walk into known drug houses and arrest everyone, instead of waiting for a judge to issue a warrant.  Doesn't make it legal.

He did not commit a crime, his actions were protected speech under the First Amendment.

&gt;He wasn't charged with ""speech"" either. 

He doesn't have to be.  If a person is charged with a crime for actions which constitute an expression of protected speech, it doesn't matter what the charge is - the person cannot be convicted.

&gt;So if that's your understanding of ""why he's being punished,"" - what the charging documents say - then you've just proved yourself wrong.

The charging documents say he violated the sign code.  While the First Amendment does allow for reasonable time-place-manner restrictions on speech, there are no reasonable time-place-manner restrictions that would prevent this man from doing this.  In other words, whatever he is charged with, it violates his First Amendment rights to do so, and he cannot be convicted."

Not trying to field a competitive roster at all while giving tons of rookies time to shine (Wroten, MCW) is the definition of tanking.

plusoneeffpee,AskMen,1390241587.0,"&gt;So tell me exactly how it went down for you. Please

I met my wife by an introduction from a mutual friend. ""Remember that girl I was studying with last week? You wo would hit it off. Here's her number."" NOt very complictaed, I just had a good friend.

As for the rest....

&gt;she'll eventually have intercourse with me on my Pokemon bed sheets

If getting your dick wet is your primary goal, I can't help you. I never was good at that, and that never really was a big goal in my life. So if that is what you are after, stop reading. The rest of what I'm going to say is useless to you.

&gt;Granted I don't really have any redeeming qualities...so I guess I can't blame the wimmins for not being so eager to speak to me. 

That is going to kick you right in the ass. Confidence is attractive in both sexes. Step one is to just stop saying things like that. EVER. If you secretly think it's true, fine. Just staop saying it. Don't write it in an anonymous internet post, don't bitch about it to your friends, don't put it in your journal, anything. Stop saying it. I'm not saying you have to do some Stewart Smalley bullshit (google it), just stop saying the negative crap.

&gt;The tired, abused, run-into-the-ground ""talk 2 herrr"" argument feels unrealistic 

That's because that only works for getting laid and if you're attractive. This doesn't work to well for actualy relationships. It can work, but it's not terribly effective.

&gt;most relationships I find happen by chance in completely unpredictable ways

Eh....I wouldn't say that. All relationships start from the same thing: commonality. 

This means that if you want to find a relationship, enrich for commonality. This is *really* easy in college....there are probably hundreds of clubs on your campus, runing the gamut. There is probably a website that lists all of them, complete with meeting times. 

Go attend a few meetings that sound interesting. Pick things you love to do, things you think sound cool but never have done, things that you have no clue WTF they are. Don't go analyze the male to female ratio and try to find one that gives you the best chance to ""get some""; find the one that you think sounds like a lot of fun, or really interesting. Something you can get into learning about or doing. 

You will meet people; people that like the same shit you do. And don't shun the guys...make new friends. This not only improves your chances by expanding your social group, it also reinforces your personality.

Hell, worst case scenario here is you waste an hour with some assholes. Next worst is that you find something fun to do, and make some friends doing it.

Jezzikuh,oddlysatisfying,1390241667.0,"Digital files often compress audio to the point where it loses subtle nuances. MP3s are a good example of this. They sacrifice quality in favor of file size. 

Vinyl records use physical means to play audio - a needle moving along grooves in a record. If taken care of properly, records can retain their sound quality for generations.

Taken from [How Stuff Works](http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question487.htm):

&gt; Original sound is analog by definition. A digital recording takes snapshots of the analog signal at a certain rate (for CDs it is 44,100 times per second) and measures each snapshot with a certain accuracy (for CDs it is 16-bit, which means the value must be one of 65,536 possible values).

&gt;This means that, by definition, a digital recording is not capturing the complete sound wave. It is approximating it with a series of steps. Some sounds that have very quick transitions, such as a drum beat or a trumpet's tone, will be distorted because they change too quickly for the sample rate.

**TL;DR - Some people prefer analog because it preserves the quality of the original recording.** "

mr_fishy,asexuality,1390241676.0,"I think it is definitely possible, although it depends on the relationship and what you and your partner do to make it work. My SO and I started dating when we were both 16, and we didn't have sex until we were college freshman at 18. We still have sex fairly regularly, although probably not as often as other couples. I'm pretty neutral toward sex, so I don't mind doing it with him because I see it as just another activity we do as a couple, like going on a dinner date. I enjoy it because I'm doing something with him, although obviously since I'm asexual I don't really get much out of it physically. But we're also in an open relationship so he is able to fulfill his sexual needs with other people as well.

I think the key thing to having a lasting relationship as an adult is that you and your partner communicate openly and frequently and have a lot of trust and understanding for each other. Considering the fact that asexual people are a pretty small minority compared to sexual people, it might be hard to find a partner who is willing to have the sort of relationship you're describing, and even then it will be tough to keep the relationship going. I would suggest talking to your boyfriend about it and seeing what he thinks. Honestly, it's not unrealistic to expect that the person you love will want to make you happy, so I doubt that (assuming he is a decent guy) he will ever want to force you to do anything you don't want to do.

So to answer your question, the future holds a lot of possibilities. It largely depends on you and your partner, but what you want certainly isn't impossible to achieve."

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1390241702.0,"&gt; ""making a government"" and ""banding together"" are not compatible concepts. Governments do not come into existence through voluntary trade and agreement. They come into existence through force, conquering, or some other method that demands subservience and participation. If government were voluntary, it would be a business, and there would be many of them competing for customers in the same territories. This is not the case. You are confusing ""government"" with ""society""...

I don't deny there's been some conquering in the past and all, but honestly, if you wanna leave, I dont see any reason why you can't...assuming someone else will take you. 

&gt;I am not suggesting we all die at age 30. ::sigh:: What I am suggesting is that you, as a human, have the obligation to seek your own protection, be that by yourself, or with others that you feel a kinshp with. I have no problem with people banding together in any way they wish to do so... however, when those people decide to force me to band together with them, lest I be locked in a cage... Then you are not talking about vountarism, but government.

What I was trying to say is the ""defying nature"" argument was really ****ing stupid. 

Look, you're gonna have to deal with someone you don't really want to who has power over you regardless, it's inevitable. It's the nature of the human conditions. If you didn't have the nice, democratic state we had today, someone else would just take over, and they'd be less kind in all likelihood. Without government, business would even become the state, as they'd be free to exercise force over you.

So honestly, it's best to quit complaining about how awful the state is and be lucky we have as good of a state as we do. You know, one based on limiting the power of factions and preserving liberty. One that is ultimately, at least in theory, responsible to the people. Because do you think if we got rid of it everyone would sing kumbaya and live in this utopia ancaps seem to obsess over? Think again? Another state would just rise up, or a business would become the state.

Do you think businesses would really practice voluntaryism in the absence of government regulation? Think again. We'd just regress hundreds of years back into slavery. And there's be nothing you can do about it because those businesses would have men with guns to keep you down.

Force is inevitable. The key is to get a government to use that force for good. Still unhappy? There's always somalia for you. Because this ancap utopia, if ever brought to fruition, would be a failed social experiment, and then we'd regress hundreds of years as we'd have to reinvent the wheel and progress back to where we are all over again. I'm not willing to throw this great (although admittedlty imperfect) democratic society away chasing untenable utopian dreams."

I'm sure outsiders looking at this will think we are having a pity party, but there is solace in knowing there are other people struggling with this. If we are alone, we should at least be alone together... If that makes sense...

&gt; ""it'll happen""

I agree with you. That's the worst fucking advice ever. I'm an adult with a demanding full time job and responsibilities (an effect of you know, growing up). I'm looking for someone who also has these two minimum attributes. And you know what? These two things take up a lot of time and energy. Add dating to the mix? That's even more time and energy. I know when people say ""it'll happen"" they mean if you keep putting yourself out there, you will meet someone, but it would be awesome if they could make that easier. Have a bunch of single friends? Plan a party with them. See your friend is alone on a Saturday night? Let's go to a bar and meet some people. Don't make us feel more alone by making us go at it alone.

I know how you feel about people taking these next steps in their lives and I'm still trying to get my act together. I'm *only* 27, but already people are talking about family planning and moving. It's hard not to feel left out. Honestly, I've just tried to make more friends who are single. I can't expect my friends with young kids to all of a sudden drop everything when I have a personal crisis.

To butcher my favorite exchange in Good Will Hunting, you're not perfect and she won't be either. The question is whether you are perfect for each other. There are 7 billion people in this world so let's face it, we all can't be objectively great. But those flaws that make you ""less than perfect"" are just quirks. You shouldn't feel the need to constantly question who you are because someone can't appreciate what makes you human.

Though Ive discovered over time, that our interests are actually very different. But because of our friendship, we have learned about each others interests and developed interests in those as well. And are aware of each others faults, and help support them. But do not dislike each other because of those faults, enough to end the friendship.

Not sure why this distinction is so hard to see. A threat, but a *justified* threat. He, quite legitimately (as I would have likely done) indicated that he would inflict pain on the person were that person to continue with his assault.

Even with Jenny Craig or a program similar the weight stays off as long as you do it. In juicing and with programs you don't really learn how to be out of that diet. You just juice and eat what you are given. 

So I did Fat Sick and Nearly Dead for two months total and lost 20 lbs. 

Then did Jenny Craig for 3 months and lost 10lbs after I gained the 20lbs back. After JC I gained the 10lbs back. 
So now I'm just eating healthy and it has only been 25 days and I've lost 10.8lbs. I'm learning how to weigh food, portion sizes, how to balance my diet, how to count calories, etc. Skills juicing and JC couldn't help me learn. Though I can say I did develop a liking for veggies and JC forced me to eat foods I otherwise would not have so I eat a bigger variety now. 

**TLDR Juicing is only good as long as you juice. It is temporary weight loss.**

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1390241986.0,"&gt; I just reeeeeally don't like the idea of planning for a failed marriage

I think that's a very negative way to look at a prenup.  As most posters have mentioned, it's a very touchy subject **because** it's making you think of a potential reality/future where your marriage does **not** work out.  

I don't think being prepared for the worst is **asking** for it t happen; I have life insurance on my fiance, and he has a policy on me (we own a home together).  I'm not saying ""I want you to die so I get a free house;"" I'm simply protecting myself in the event that the person who is paying half of these bills is no longer around."

AdamColligan,AskMen,1390242034.0,"I think the best answer for you right now seems to be ""the Internet"". Physical distance from like-minded people isn't the excuse that it used to be, especially if your issue is that you want to *limit* physical contact. There are tons of specialty sites and sub-sites where you can probably still find someone interested in traditional courtship.

I think it is probably still good advice, though, to talk about your sexual desires as openly as possible before you get married. You said in the title of your thread ""without giving up my beliefs,"" and your beliefs here are about virginity before marriage, so I'm not going to subvert your premise by telling you that you need to explore your physical compatibility with someone before you marry them. But at the very least, you need to have very frank conversations with a potential spouse about your ideas on sex, your kinks, your expectations, that sort of thing. 

I don't think your biggest problem is going to be finding someone who matches your ideas -- there are plenty of people like that, especially if you live in North America, and they are on the Internet. Your biggest problem is going to be sorting through the pile without the benefit of experimenting with sexual intimacy. And so I think your best substitute is going to be the kind of very direct and explicit conversation that you may find even *more* difficult than chastity.

MikeCharlieUniform,NeutralPolitics,1390242129.0,"You only have to look at the range of opinions or diversity in points of view available on the Sunday morning news talk shows. In the run up to the Iraq war, the media was largely unquestioning of the ""they hate us for our freedoms"" talk, and there was virtually no voice out there deconstructing the ""Saddam is linked to Al Quada / 9-11"" bunk.

However, this is much more pervasive (and subtle) when it comes to economic policy. It is impossible to find informed opinion on the news that isn't rabidly pro-capitalist. And why not? Because it does not serve the interests of the owners of for-profit news firms, nor the interests of the firms advertising on those shows. As a result, most Americans haven't even the foggiest idea what non-capitalist economic ideas even *are*. Hell, they don't even understand what *capitalism* is. Big corporations influence public opinion this way, and then they also influence public policy via campaign donations, ensuring that - to the level they can control - public policy and public opinion align with *their* goals.

It is important to understand that corporate inputs are not deterministic; grassroots activism does have impacts, but the policy landscape is largely impacted by corporate influence of public opinion via mass media, and that includes both opinions and what is deemed ""newsworthy"". Not a lot of discussion of net neutrality stuff in the mainstream media right now, is there?

That's not an explanation.

&gt;That is why it is also false to directly compare national R&amp;D budget.

Not at all. It's a measure of the support those sources have gotten from stateside.

&gt;Nuclear power plants do not have any subsidies as wind or solar have. Only ""subsidy"" is when state build them and stands as an insurer for a loan.

And if the state didn't do that no nuclear plant would be built anywhere, the risk is that huge. But it doesn't only subsidize it explicitly. Nuclear has low risks during a very, very long period. Those enjoying nuclear profits now are probably long dead when something serious happens, and who'll have to clean up the mess? Somebody else. Much like the banking crisis forced the hand of the governments.

Anyway, I have yet to see the first nuclear reactor that wasn't built with subsidies... while there are plenty of renewables that do just fine without. And indeed, this one is owned by no less than two countries, who have already swallowed the up-front costs, and will be plagued by the decommission costs for centuries.

And then we're not even talking about the fuel. Right now most of the used fissiles are recycled nuclear weapon material: fabricated with the aid of cold war budgets. Uranium production is lower than what we use up, it's silly to expand.  We're living of our reserves.

&gt;India has a working 300MW Thorium reactor, which can work as fast breeeder.

An experimental reactor, that hasn't worked as a breeder yet and doesn't produce net power.

&gt;Come back when you recycle waste caused by neodymium processing.

Since when are Chinese production methods the only possible ones? As I said, with that reasoning you're not going to build *anything at all*. Only a fraction of windmills use neodymium, anyway."

From your question, I'm guessing you've had a similar situation occur. 

On the whole however, I've acclimated to the situation. He has changed enough to give me what I would consider the 'minimum threshold' of validation I need to feel wanted and loved. I have found that when he does compliment me, it helps if I give him some sort of positive feedback about it. Not a big effusive thing, but a genuine, heartfelt, ""Thank you"" while looking into his eyes, and maybe touching him. Show him how much it means to you that he is going out his way to compliment you when it's not 'in his nature'. Also, even tho it feels like you're asking for compliments (and you are), ask him questions. ""Do you like this dress?"" ""How do I look?"". Use these to remind him. 

That's not to say that my acclimation is a good thing. And that's not to say that as I got older, or say, was in situations where I NEEDED that validation (pregnancy, illness, advancing age) this wouldn't become a bigger thing. I think (from my limited viewpoint) that you should have another talk with him. Maybe youguys can take the 5 love languages test together.

positmylife,relationships,1390242364.0,"I know you already said you have a lot to think about, but I really feel like some of these posts have missed how deep an issue this could be.  You really need to take awhile and think long and hard about what this sudden omission could mean.

You mentioned you both grew up on a farm and animals dying or being put to sleep wasn't such a big deal in that environment.  I didn't grow up on a farm, but I've always been under the impression that when that decision comes, should the decision be available, it's always the farmer's decision.  In this case, she was your animal so it was your decision.  I feel like some silent farmer's code should have made him realize that he has no right to make the decision about your animal for you.  You said he's still your boyfriend (read not husband with legal rights to your property) and this was several years ago so there should still have a clear line of your things and his things.  I don't think his upbringing has any bearing on this.

Furthermore, since it was YOUR decision to put her down and you obviously didn't choose this, he decided he knew better than you about your cat.  Think about that for a moment.  This could apply to anything that is yours that you care for.  He decided you weren't making the correct decision so he made it for you.  He could have felt you were wrong, but he never had to do anything about it.  He actively chose to go above you and make this decision.  This decision happened to end a life that can never be recovered.  That's a much bigger decision than throwing out an item he things is useless.  It's a big deal.

Lastly, he did this years ago and you never suspected.  He did this years ago and just told you.  Why did he wait to tell you or even tell you at all?  What motivated him to hide it then if he was so high on the ideal that he did the right thing?  He hid it because he KNEW it was wrong.  Even as he did it, he knew it was wrong and would hurt you and HE STILL DID IT.  You never suspected a thing because you trust him.  So now, aren't you curious what else he did behind your back that you never suspected?  You told us this is the only thing he's really done in 7 years, but the truth is you actually don't know because if he hadn't told you, you still wouldn't know.  What has he done since?  Was someone about to rat him out to you so he beat them to the punch?  Why did he tell you now?  It's even more alarming that he did this to ""help you feel better/be less stressed.""  Really?  He thought this was the best way to make you feel better?  My question is, did you feel less stressed?  Did he ever say, well at least you don't have to worry about her messes anymore?  He freaking lied to your face when he denied doing anything to her too.  That doesn't sound like someone who feels they made a mistake, that sounds like someone who was manipulating you.  It sounds more like, she comes home and cleans up messes instead of spending her time with me.  She is too upset to do things I want to do.  I will get rid of the thing competing for attention. 

It really disturbs me to my core that he would do something like this.  You don't just decide one day to take your SO's matters into your own hands.  There had to be other things before and after he was doing behind your back.  So what happens to other things that compete for your attention.  When your kids grow up, if one of them gets rebellious during the teen years, is he just going to enroll them in military school?  boarding school?  call the cops on them?  He doesn't have respect for a living creature you loved.  The jump between pet and person should be bigger, but will it?  These are all things you need to think about.  You loved that cat which means you probably think of pets as more than just animals you care for.  He knew that and he removed something you loved to better his position in your life.  If you let him get away with it, he will continue to do it."

**Review**: I wanted to like this so badly because youtube gurus rave about it but I've applied it twice and hate it :(. It's thin, doesn't cover anything really and doesn't blend well. I might pick up a beauty sponge and try to apply it that way and see if it's any different. I tried a flat top kabuki brush and my hands and it just doesn't cover anything. It works if I wear a medium coverage mineral powder over. I do like how pale this is because I'm very fair. That is the only plus. I wish it worked for me :(

**Overall rating**: 3/10 :/

I had to talk to my academic advisor and come up with a plan to better my grades.  We decided it would be best if I re-did some courses while continuing on with ones I did ok in.  
It ended up taking me 6 years to complete a 4 year degree, but it made it a lot easier to manage.  By my 4th year in, I was taking 3-4 courses per semester (instead of 5 or 6) and had more time to focus to my classes and assignments."

A game company consists of more than just general-purpose programmers.  When the game doesn't need a steady flow of, say, new art, you move the art team over to another project, only pulling them back when you need updated assets on the main project.  Likewise, if the main work on the engine modifications is done, you start the engine team on another project.  And so on."

To point 2, aye. Isshin couldn't have stood up to Nui even with kamui senketsu. I just thought it was strange, but looking at it from the perspective that Matoi was using the scissors as a false positive of sorts makes it clever on his part.

I disagree a little here. I think, as with any craft or art, a part of one's self is integrated into the finished product. I believe that is part of the story. That Isshin's will has been passed through Senketsu. If not through a direct correlation, it does by Senketsu's existing in the first place. Like you said, its unlikely that Isshin has lived on as a physical part of Senketsu- but there is no doubt that it carries his final will.

Thats the story we have, after all.

Are you saying the bees are dying unnaturally quickly, or that this is their normal lifespan?  

From wiki
&gt;workers may live for a few weeks in the summer and several months in areas with an extended winter.

Now I agree it is not good to use commercial bees.  But veganism is about reduction of harm.  I try to eat fairly seasonally but I don't know if my tomatoes were from a greenhouse or just shipped from a warm area.  

However, I *do* know that my honey is 100% from a bee colony.  So just because I may eat some greenhouse food why does that mean I should eat all the honey I want?  

&gt;Bees that would NOT be alive without people helping them to make honey,

That is the same argument people use about why raising cows is a good thing.  Remember, bees do exist naturally.

&gt;remember, those same bees propagate the fruits and vegetables in EVERY farmers field,

GetOffMyLawn_,Fibromyalgia,1390242754.0,"Rheumatologists are usually the fibro experts. They will give you a complete work up including checking your pressure points.

Having a chronic debilitating illness makes you depressed but it's not the source of the problem. You can tell the difference between depression disorder and being depressed from being ill if there are a million things you want to do but can't because you're sick, or if there's nothing you want to do because you're depressed. 

Some of the drugs prescribed for fibro are antidepressants, usually SSRIs or SNRIs, because these drugs also work on chronic pain. So when you find a good doc don't be surprised if they prescribe one of these. It's not because they think you're crazy, it's because you're in physical pain. Tricyclics also work on chronic pain but they have stronger side effects than the SSRIs. All of these take months to start having an effect on pain. I used to take a tricyclic and it took about 6 months to kick in on my pain but then it was like someone flipped the pain switch to OFF.

emptyhands,short,1390242757.0,"Many, many young people grow up to be taller than either of their parents.  You're 16, and I believe males usually continue to grow in height until they're between 19 and 21.  You stand a good chance of being 'average' height, but if not, being short does not have to be a devastating lifelong source of sadness.  It will only be that if you allow it to be. You'll do best if you come to terms with all of your features, including your height, and focus your energies on the bits of you that you're able to customize, like grooming, fitness, skills, et cetera.  

There is a man I know very well who is of tall-ish height.  He's in his 30s now.  He is pretty decent-looking and always has been.  He is incredibly intellectually smart and is also a talented musician.  He is reasonably social.  Guess when he had his first date?  University.  It's not uncommon to start dating later than others around you, and it's okay.  

I am in my mid-30s and I still get carded at the liquor store on a fairly regular basis.  So, expect it, but try not to let that make some sort of statement about you.  Want to look older?  Don't wear graphic t-shirts, ill-fitting jeans, and sneakers.  Wear stylish button-up shirts, well-fitting reasonably slender pants with no holes in them, and business-casual shoes.  Grow a beard when you can.  Style your hair but don't over-style your hair.  Subscribe to the male fashion advice subreddit if you want to do this stuff.  Also, make it a goal to be a well-rounded person.  Have a hobby you actively work on that is not a man-child thing like video games or anime.  (Not that there's anything wrong with these things - they're just likely to make you seem younger rather than older.)  

The main thing in control of how your life goes is YOU.  I know it doesn't feel like it, but you are so fucking young still.  Get a head-start on being a really cool and interesting adult, and the particular things you mentioned here that bothered you will sort themselves out.  You have a great adulthood ahead of you if you want it to be great!  Good luck to you."

We should probably back the bus up all the way back to ""what is a society"" and ""why do we have laws"". I hope you are involved in some kind of contract negotiation some day. The reason for this is that you'll be presented with a situation where you try to enumerate everything that might happen and what will happen if that said thing happens. 

You will quickly find that you cannot list out every possible eventuality and agreed upon cure. You will **HAVE** to rely on the spirit of the agreement and actually have some loose ends. 

Then, when you contract is in place, and you have a disagreement with the counterparty, you could attempt to resolve it in good faith, using common sense and reason, but knowing you so far, **THIS WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO HANDLE**, so you and your counterparty will go to court, and the friendly judge will apply the rule of law, common sense and reason, as well as the whole point of what you were trying to do and determine **WHERE THE LINE WAS**.

Apple devices and basically all other devices use different methods of detecting whether the device is connected to a computer USB port or dedicated charger that are incompatible with each other.

This might work in your favor. A Masters degree gives you a bit of a boost in the States, as opposed to Europe where it's more of a prerequisite.

&gt; We do not use GPAs. 

You need to have some way to convey your academic performance, especially if you're still in school or are a new grad. I would suggest splitting your GPA into two categories, Theory GPA and Project GPA. If you *really* think that 2.5 Project GPA isn't doing you justice, you might be able to include your performance percentile.

&gt; How should I approach doing personal projects, should I start working on a portfolio of projects? What kind of things look good right now? And languages? Would potential financial viability be better than something more complex?

Yes, start working on a portfolio of projects. That's what gets you your first job, and to a lesser extent your second and third. More sophisticated projects are better.

&gt; How is volunteer work viewed?

Work is work.

&gt; I've been thinking of applying for an internship at US-based companies because of the familiarity of their name. Is this something that will help me, or am I over-evaluating the name familiarity?

Now, as to *installing* SteamOS on your drive... I'm not actually sure as I've never tried. The installer probably only has access to the lowest level components on the motherboard, and I'm not actually sure if the USB bus is one of them. "

No, the bank robber is making a threat and/or an immediate incitement to unlawful action.  That's what you're lacking - an understanding of the specific Constitutional analysis of protected speech.  There are four types of speech with reduced or no protection under the First Amendment - threats, obscenity, ""fighting words"", and immediate incitement to unlawful action.  

Your bank robber example is classified as a threat.  This sign-holder's actions do not fall under any of those four exceptions to the First Amendment protection on speech.  His sign was not obscene.  It was not a threat.  It was not ""fighting words"".  It was not an immediate incitement to unlawful action.

Sorry, I'll rephrase: The Supreme Court of the United States of America has ruled that such a restriction would not be reasonable under the Constitution.

&gt; I don't like either of your examples because in both cases you're taking a consequential action (jailing someone, paying someone for work) and comparing it to a preemptive action (setting an insurance premium).

Employees are not payed based on work they will probably do.  An employee who neglects his or her duties will quickly see a pay cut or even get fired.  Payment is based on quality and quantity of work, and can easily be adjusted after the employee works (or doesn't work).  An insurance rate prior to an accident cannot be adjusted after the accident has occurred.  An insurance company can't set a flat rate for everyone and then after an accident occurs say, ""Oh I guess you *were* going to get in an accident so you owe us all this money for the increased premium you should have been paying.""

Let me try a comparison:

Imagine men are now represented by households in Florida, and women are represented by households in South Carolina.  Both states are at risk of getting hit by hurricanes, but we have the data to show that Florida is much more likely to encounter a hurricane than South Carolina.  There's no way to see into the future and determine exactly where hurricanes are going to hit, and a household can't go out and buy insurance to pay for hurricane damage after it has happened, so when a household from Florida buys hurricane insurance, they will naturally have to pay more than a household from South Carolina.  It would be silly for a household from Florida to claim state discrimination, since the higher cost is based solely on the likelihood of a hurricane hitting a particular area."

TioTaba,summonerschool,1390243219.0,"It happened the opposite for me.

I started main suport because of a few succesfull games on Lulu and I loved it. I started to study and tried to improve. When I got bored of it, I decided to check other lanes.

In time, I realizes that the support role helped me to develop a lot of basic stuff:

- I learned how/when/where to ward (and that I have to ward no matter the role I'm playing)
- Gave me map awareness
- Helped with my positioning
- Helped me learn lane control

Try to transit to jungle first, it's very similar to supporting (you can even still be a support if you play support junglers like Naut and Mao) but it also helps about stuff you don't get to do as a support, like dueling.

Then, when you get used to jungle, try Top Lane. Most of the stuf I mentioned above I noticed when I started to play a bit of top lane.

Also, since you've spent so much time with an ADC, you'll probably know more of this role than you think, and altough it's a bit harder to put it into practice, when you get to do it you go pretty well.

Also, it is much easier to approach from a health-standpoint unless they seem interested otherwise.  If you approach from an animal cruelty standpoint you would be making them admit to themselves that they are cruel.  Peoples' brains don't like that so they fight it.

Once people eat vegan-ish for health, then they can more likely be open to other reasons as they are not participating in it.

A large part of the reason celebrities are famous is because they are attractive and in their appearances, they go out of their way to seem so. 

Also, as a woman, I think that attractive isn't an awesome compliment to receive from anyone (man or woman) when my looks aren't related to my accomplishment. People are allowed to say other people are attractive, yes. But I also feel that in society, women are reduced to how attractive they are a lot more than men. When a hot woman does something awesome, you're almost always going to see it reduced to her being hot. That doesn't always make you feel great. She's devoted her life to karate and in a video that's showing her talents, she deserves to be commended for exactly that. I really don't think there is as a great of a double standard with who is giving the compliment as you seem to believe there to be.

However, I am also just speaking from my own personal experience as a woman and from what I've heard other women say. There are times you want to be told you look pretty and there are times that you want your actions or your hard work to be recognized. She busted her ass for years, yet people still reduce her to her face.

I'm also still failing to see how /r/LadyBoners connects to the comment. That is a subreddit dedicated to 'objectifying' men (usually). It is similar to many subreddits that are dedicated to 'objectifying' women. I've never really seen either receive much flak and both are popular. This comment came from a subreddit that was dedicated to a craft, and yet it was still reduced to 'objectifying.' 

And I do agree that men objectifying is seen as a bigger issue, but I would say this is a result to objectification being a larger problem for women than men in society. And I'm not trying to say that men aren't objectified or that men don't have huge, huge problems of their own related to objectification and many other varied issues. I find the whole gender war, oppression olympics thing silly. 

I also really don't have a huge issue with the comment. My problem sprung up with its comparison to LB. I agree that it isn't offensive, per se. I also agree that it shouldn't be attacked. I do think it reflects a larger issue with society on objectification and the recognition of accomplishments (and I think both men and women face this issue). 

But you're right, this particular comment isn't worth our time. I'm glad this stayed respectful. This also ended up way longer than necessary, so sorry about that."

I'm confused since I can't see why you'd have trouble at least making friends with guys, let alone continued conversation when you have no problem doing it with other girls.  it's essentially the same.  are you a not so good conversationalist?  shy?  do you really try and meet new men as often as you think you do?  because i'll talk with new people and maybe one in ten or one in twenty will actually end up becoming a friend, but all that means is that you have to put yourself out there a lot."

Exactly. Computer algorithms only get you so far, but at the end of the day, you still need a human to figure out whether or not they've actually found that needle. And that'd be a lot of humans just to check every needle.

&gt; They've already missed the Boston Bombing, and there were clear signs pointing to the Tsarnaevs. Heck, Russian intel pointed them out to us and we still didn't do anything. Our intel agencies do not need all this information, and all it does is make their jobs that much more difficult.

And that's the other big thing. The NSA/CIA/FBI have already demonstrated clear incompetence when actually *applying* this information. They may have it, but it's not much different from rote memorization in school: if you don't actually know how to use that information, it's basically useless. 

We're currently able to literally hide in plain sight simply by being a citizen. And it's going to be a little while before the NSA can actually figure this problem out. So we'd better start attacking it now. "

It's my only external goal, but internally I have to deal with the fact it may be fruitless or a waste of time.

I am only happy about my increased social skills in the context of sexual probability =P

Internally, I strive to end my cravings for things I can't give myself easily, so I slowly crave sex less as I become more apt at obtaining it. I attempt to remain humble, and hope that when I get older I can discard my need for strong external sources of euphoria as it becomes harder/impossible to obtain.

Great (no, seriously, excellent). I think it's awesome that you're a ""self-made"" man. But please note that not everyone has your mental abilities, mental potential, and/or other things. To say, ""I did it, so why can't everyone else?"" is a flawed argument.

&gt;Kids today with their constant phones and socially media are being raised by misguided parents to believe that they are special

Perhaps you feel that you have not done something ""special"" with your life, but please don't hamper the dreams of others' due to your life. Teaching kids that they are special is probably one of the largest sources of the unspoken ingenuity that harbors some of our more groundbreaking innovations and inventions. 

Phones and media are the future. That is the bottom line.

Sorry, but this is simply not true.

Imagine that, instead of growing up in a house with loving parents, you don't. You live in a cesspool such as Brooklyn, and your life is horrifically tainted with violence, drug use, and prostitution. Your entire life, from age 0, lived in squalor. Good education? Ha, that's a joke. The public school system is failing and teachers don't even show up half of the time. Dad is gone, mom's on drugs, and you have to work minimum wage (while in high school) to support your three little brothers. 

But, somehow, you make it out. You're ready to apply to college, and you have a 3.5 GPA from high school. It isn't stellar, but you tried as hard as you could, and you feel really good about it. You get turned down from college. Turns out that a well-off white kid took your place. His GPA was 3.6.

What if I told you that most of these people who live in squalor in the city, for example, were black? What if I told you that the reason they're there is because of policies white people put in place 60 years ago? Black people literally couldn't get into white and suburban neighborhoods 60 years ago. With a single court ruling, segregation is outlawed. You think blacks are just going to waltz into white suburbia? Racism still exists, and affirmative action is an effort to say, ""Hey, you have experienced hardship in your life. It also isn't your fault that you went through this hardship.

wweezzee,TwoXChromosomes,1390243938.0,"True, they have to consent to tell you the information. But I actually DO have a right to demand that information or walk away. Sure, four dates is pushing it and a bit crazy, but its something I would want to have a conversation about before things got at all serious (say 2 months or so into the relationship), not after you've already started thinking about the future.

I am 26 and don't have any debt and I didn't want to be with anyone who had any significant amount of debt, especially if they didn't have a real plan of paying it off (like a professional or STEM degree).  For me, 100k debt would be a huge hurdle in life and most likely a deal breaker. So many of my friends have that much debt and all they have to show is a liberal arts degree from a small private college. I understand it is common to have debt, but that doesn't make it smart. 

So, I'm the type of person who would want to know before I got in too deep. Luckily, I have found someone who shares the same values, and we are starting our life on the right foot. A young couple starting off life with no debt is huge, and looking for that doesn't make you a gold digger, as you have implied in some other comments. It means you know what you want and are willing to actually make certain decisions to get it.

ForgottenLore,explainlikeimfive,1390243981.0,"In a closed bottle there is always a two-way reaction going on. Some of the air in the bottle gets diluted in the liquid, and some of the liquid (also alcohol) vaporizes into the air. This happens even if the temperature is lower than the boiling point of the liquid, because temperature is proportional to the **average** kinetic energy of molecules, so some of them will have greater speeds, some even enough to evaporate.

The rate of the two-way reaction is in part dependant on the air pressure, i.e. the greater the pressure, more air gets diluted in the liquid (and vice versa). That is why when you open a fizzy drink, the carbon dioxide diluted in the liquid escapes (in the form of bubbles), because you just decreased the pressure.

The same holds for the liquid. If you rapidly decrease the air pressure, the two-way reaction shifts in favour of the liquid evaporating until equilibrium is reached. Some of the alcohol therefore evaporates. If it is enough to get drunk, though, is beyond me."

silverionmox,europe,1390244016.0,"&gt; Don't see nuclear fusion as 'just another energy source'.

Indeed: it's the only one that certainly won't produce any measurable energy before 2050.

&gt;No other energy source has a higher energy density than a fusion plant.

Currently fusion plants aren't energy sources, and even the most optimistic projections say they won't be in first 50 years from here.

&gt;And yes it may not be finished before 2050 but between the first panel and those thing on your roof also passed 60 years.

Nuclear fusion has been funded for decades before people event though about funding renewables. So far, the return on investment on renewables has delivered more and faster results than any nuclear research. Clearly, renewables are the better choice. I'm fine with funding fusion on the side, as a fundamental research project, but people who consider it a useful energy investment are delusional or heavy gamblers... Even the people working on the project just say ""By 2100, fusion *could* be producing 20-25% of all our energy."" Those are the people whose livelihood depends on this thing getting funding.

* Point #1 SB/RB rewards compared to Arcade are not where they should be from a time spent to rewards given standpoint. This can be documented simply by hopping in an RB game and seeing how long it lasts -- approx. 2x longer than Arcade, for a similar or lesser reward than Arcade on a plane-by-plane basis, because you only get one.  
* * Even assuming an Arcade game lasts as long as an RB game, 20-30 minutes roughly, an RB game gives you only one plane. So while in AB, you can earn points for FIVE PLANES in that time -- and score a maximum of somewhere around 80 air kills (assuming you do literally all the work), RB gives you a maximum of 16 possible air kills in one plane. The RP bonus does not even come close to matching those gains, extra time spent climbing etc. notwithstanding.

* Point #2 The current system of giving rewards, particularly as they apply to RB/SB does not encourage a playstyle any different than Arcade. You are still rewarded for throwing yourself into a furball, hoping you get a kill or two, and coming out alive. The RB/SB system
* * The current system of compensation in lions does not encourage playing RB/SB due to the massively increased repair costs. You either kill and die quickly, or your time is better spent dropping game and starting a new round.  
Hence, as I've said, playing in a ""realistic"" manner, or a manner consistent with accomplishing the objectives is null and void. You actually penalize yourself by doing so. Escorting planes is an invalid tactic because of this.

* Point #3 You will not have nearly the point potential -- in lions or RP -- as you will in Arcade due to the drastically decreased available targets, both ground and air. The RP and lion compensation for RB/SB does not in any way reflect this disparity.

* Point #4 The repair costs penalize players FAR TOO MUCH. Flying a B-17G costs me 50,000 to repair un-upgraded. With that, I can hope to kill at most 8 ground targets. Killing 8 Light Pillboxes (all it can destroy with default load) will net me not even 1/3rd that repair cost. So if the plane is destroyed before, after, or during the bombing run, I am still LOSING MONEY no matter how well I performed my task. The same goes, in a large way, for other -- especially American -- TIV aircraft. In a Mustang, I have to kill at least 3 planes to make my repair bill. 3 PLAYER planes, no AI. When the standard RB round only has 4 players and 5 AI, the risk v reward is skewed greatly.

I would direct you to point #2 particularly. There is literally no reward, at all, to do anything other than throw yourself haphazardly into a furball which conflicts GREATLY with point #4. You're just throwing away lions by playing RB.

The problem is multi-faceted, and they all tie in together. ""Either throw yourself in the furball and do well, or make no points for a large time investment with a massive penalty if you get shot down and don't do well."""

keakealani,singing,1390244289.0,"Hm. It's absolutely possible that you're singing with a different vibratory pattern than what you experience when you speak. It could also be that when sustaining a pitch, you're less aware of the vibrations (because they're more even in nature) than during speech, where pitch variation is more common and the vibrations will feel and sound less even. 

Chest resonance is a particularly tricky issue because objectively, very little primary resonance involved with vocalization (in both speech and singing) actually originates from the chest. However, some people feel secondary vibrations in their chest that give the impression of ""chest resonance"". However, others may not feel those secondary vibrations for a host of reasons - you may just not notice the vibrations, or your body type dampens most of the sensation. 

Ultimately, it's hard to tell what is happening even if you're working one-on-one with a highly trained instructor, and I think it's even more impossible to give you more definitive answers online without hearing you. If this is something that really bothers you, I'd recommend working with an in-person voice teacher who can help you evaluate your individual voice and identify some of these aspects. 

That being said, I actually don't know how useful it really is to know about things like registration - at least in the Western classical tradition, the goal is to create a unified sound that doesn't indicate explicit changes in register. Regardless of what's happening anatomically, the goal is just to maintain a pleasing sound. So unless you're studying a style that requires deliberate use of obvious register shifts, it doesn't seem as important to me, compared to learning how to sing in a way that limits the tension that causes most obvious changes in voice quality.

As you said in your initial post and in your name, you are lonely, and you believe that there is a very small pool of men who could even in theory be a match for you given your commitment to premarital chastity.  That can be a depressing way to feel, and from that position, it is easy to say things like ""I don't expect anything from the other person.""

The thing is, it seems likely that once you start having one or more relationships and start feeling more confidence about yourself, there seems to be a strong chance that that will change. And I would advise you to prepare for that now. You may be feeling: ""I just want something, anything, so that I'm not *miserable*"", but a better place to focus may be: ""What do I want that I would really be *happy* with?""

fridge_logic,todayilearned,1390244401.0,"&gt;An educated electorate can be about both popular and right.

I'm not sure I can agree with you here. I agree that an educated electorate is preferable to an uneducated one and will be right about more things that an uninformed electorate (and therefore I still stand behind education of the public).

However I do not think it is possible to educate everyone about everything and therefore I think it is inevitable that the electorate will always lag behind in their knowledge of law, governmental bureaucracy, science, engineering, business, diplomacy, military science, and the arts. The elector will lag behind even the educational establishment (which tends to focus most of its energy on educating the young who have yet to reach the age of majority). I mention all of these categories to underscore how varied the topics are with which our government must deal and to what extent we as a people must elect to place decision making in the hands of those experts dedicated to the development of national policy.

It is simply impossible to expect the electorate to know enough about all the subjects which matter to make informed decisions on them unless we are to expect the common elector to expend exorbitant amounts of time learning on all of these subjects. By this I mean not simply reading news articles and watching news (for we can all agree that bias and journalistic economies will at times undermine the integrity of these sources). Instead an elector would have to immerse themselves in primary sources reading and listening directly to the experts in a given field and be able to overcome the knowledge barriers present whenever one listens to an expert.

The time required to establish such a comprehensive knowledge would amount to a full time job and is a major reason why representative democracies are so preferable to true democracies.

I make this point not to say we should not aspire to have a more educated electorate. But to instead underscore that we should not be surprised to find the electorate to be wrong on an issue, to be misinformed on a science, or unaware of every event. Instead we should be prepared to meet ignorance, and unless these persons are willfully and maliciously ignorant we should treat them with respect. Because without respect we cannot learn and we cannot teach."

A more secure person might let his definition of his ideal woman role off their shoulders and move on with finding a normal human - one who doesn't hold their imperfections against them because s/he's not perfect either.

Part of the problem may also be that many of these girls get their idea of an ideal mate from discussions with their friends - it's more of a group consensus on what's attractive than an individual preference. None of the guys I hang out with do that; it's fine with me if Jerry likes butts, but I personally prefer pale, dark-haired women, regardless of the size of their badonkadonk. If females assume that, like them, other guys are listening to these boys and taking them as authorities on female beauty, then their outrage becomes a little more understandable - ""If he says freckles are attractive, than no guy will ever want to date any girl without freckles!""

Admittedly, it helps to throw in an unhealthy dose of black-and-white thinking / extremism, and some massive anxiety complex too, but that leads right back into the insecurity problem."

Heliopteryx,explainlikeimfive,1390244543.0,"There isn't actually all that much genetic variation between races. Looking at just the DNA, there is no way to know for sure what race the person is, but it might be possible to make an educated guess. For example, lots of genetic diseases are more common in certain races because the disease granted some sort of advantage in that environment. 

Humans became a pretty widespread species, with lots of isolated populations. Isolation led to different groups looking different and having different allele frequencies (% of people with one version of a gene) depending on what helped them survive in their environment. Though natural selection did drive a lot of traits to develop, sexual selection (one trait is seen as more attractive whether it is better or not), the founder effect (small population becomes isolated and has a few people with one trait that is much more uncommon, percentage-wise, than in the whole species), and genetic drift also played a role. 

A very common example is skin colour. Darker skin gives you protection from the sun, but makes it harder for your body to synthesize vitamin D using sunlight. Lighter skin allows you to synthesize more vitamin D, but makes you more vulnerable to sun damage.

Wiskie,TheRedPill,1390244597.0,"Maybe yes, I wouldn't say that a good tattoo is a negative though, from either a man or woman's perspective.

I remember going to a fish store not too long ago and the girl that helped me was cute enough, but what really got me was that she had a really nice, detailed, colored angel fish tat on her arm with the scientific name underneath.

At first, she was just another girl, but now she has the fish tattoo and works at the fish store = she has a personality and might be someone I enjoy spending time with on top of that.

Anything resembling a quote, a past lover's name, a heart etc. also gives me insight into your personality, it's just not the sort of impression you want to give off. :P

Edit: Another thing, that might be true, is that I come from a very suburban, sheltered background and I'm pretty methodical, and so seeing the sort of impulsivity that you'd expect from someone who has a tattoo turns me on."

wweezzee,TwoXChromosomes,1390244623.0,"&gt;Unless you consider student loan debt to be an accurate reflection of someone elses character or think it's something that's infectious and would affect your financial health (neither of which are true imo)

But it does affect your financial health. You want to go on vacation with your spouse, buy a house with your spouse, etc... These are all things that the other person's debt can affect. Also, someone who is 150k in debt getting an English degree at a small private college does not make smart financial decisions, imo. That is a reflection of how that person feels about money. 

&gt;I mean unless you're a gold digger (I went there, but hey I was thinking it) and want this guy/girl to surprise you with a new pink BMW I don't see why it would matter.

There's an advantage in combining two incomes with no debt. There is a difference between wanting to buy a house together and raise kids and save for retirement and perhaps saving to pay for your kids college and getting new, pink BMWs. Its hard to think about saving for your kids college when you and your spouse are still paying loans 20 years after one of you went to college. "

These experiments are stupid, and there are several textbook writers I'd like to slap silly.

The internal resistance of the designed battery won't allow it to drive a normal lightbulb.

The resistance of the light bulb is to little, and as soon as current begins to flow through the battery, the voltage drops like a rock.

To check that this is true:

set the voltmeter to amperemeter mode, and check the maximum current the battery can deliver.

Check the voltage as soon as you connect the bulb to the setup.

The only way to make it work, is to use a ultra-low power LED - something in the single-digits mA area.

Nelerath8,AskMen,1390244662.0,"As many of the others said you come off at least in this post as very articulate. Which for me is one of the markers of what I'd call intelligence.

As one of the men in the world that gets very much so irked by stupidity I'd like to clarify at least from my point of view what bothers me most. I believe intelligence is quantity and quality of thought put into things. The best way I've found to measure this is to see them in a learning setting.

If you're like me then you breeze through school, but a lot of people aren't like me and I've had a lot of respect for people who took four times the amount of time to learn the same things. The reason I respected them is because they tried to learn. You could see it as they struggled to get everything down. Or my favorite moments were watching them turn things over in their head to try and UNDERSTAND it not just KNOW it.

There is a difference between understanding and knowing. Understanding is being able to take something you know and apply it to new situations or beyond the scope of what you've been taught. What are the implications beyond the immediate situation? Acquiring an understanding of things is harder and requires you to put more thought into the operation, it also improves your memory of it.

Being able to vomit out facts is not intelligence, nor is necessarily a powerful vocabulary. Intelligence is being able acquire an understanding should you apply yourself as well as having a desire to do so. Can you think about things and through this contemplation begin to understand them? Logic puzzles are great examples of this, they don't require you to KNOW anything, they require you to UNDERSTAND the rules and put your brain to work to solve the puzzle.

It is when people don't bother to at least try to acquire an understanding that I am bothered. And I'd also say that being proud of such an ignorance would also anger me, though I haven't ever experienced anyone doing that yet? I am also a little bothered when people just say they can't do it and don't seem to really be applying themselves to it. Your brain is mostly like anyone else's, through application you should be able to learn a lot of the same stuff."

So the way it works is, each block has an amount of shares (or strikes with the ax) that are needed to get to the Doges. This can vary from 100,000 to 300,000 shares. So the way it works is for you to use your GPU or CPU to help you strike the rock. Sometimes it takes much longer than expected, such as 250,000 strikes (strikes are officially called shares), but other times it could take as little as 25,000. Basically the more people you have the faster the payout. Once the Doges are extracted, they are divided by whoever did the most work. Some people might have contributed 500 Shares while another user did 50,000 Shares, so the dogecoins are distributed proportionately.

Why waste your time? If you are out there looking for sex and love, remember it is a NUMBERS game. If a girl says the words ""boyfriend"" or ""husband"" those are your instant cues that this one is not worth your time and energy, and that you should go approach another girl.

If you legit thrive off of being just friends with girls, then so be it, and what I just said does not pertain to you one bit. If you are a guy who knows what he wants and doesn't want to waste his time/energy/wellbeing getting there, just next these girls until you find one who is actually worth your time.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390244818.0,"Awesome, thank you!  The only thing that I think is slightly misleading is:

&gt;But neither is as effective for reducing harm as preventing access to children, or providing close supervision.

I'm not sure if you meant it to, but I don't think that really supports your second statement (that I quoted).  That's like saying that no treatment for alcoholism is as effective at preventing someone from drinking alcohol again as removing alcohol entirely from their environment (assuming this were possible).  Well, of course that would be true - even at a 99% success rate at being able to change someone's addiction/attraction, whatever, completely removing them from the possibility will always have a 100% success rate.  Sure, you could say that saving the 1% is better than leaving it to chance, but I guess my point is that particular statement that many don't succeed isn't necessarily accurate.  And to clarify, I'm not saying it isn't - you may very well be right, I was just wondering if there was anything to support that claim.

I also wonder how well the drug therapy actually works. Think of all the other mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, that still have a pretty big stigma around them, such that a lot of people think they cannot function in society.  However, people definitely can and do, so I wonder if it's similarly treatable.  

I also wonder how many people actually do act on their urges.  The reason I say this is look at the rape fantasy fetish - from my understanding from what I've read before (I don't have the time to look it up as I'm about to head out, maybe I can later if needed), it's a pretty popular fetish/fantasy.  However, I don't think those people are seen as a threat to society.  What's the difference?  Honestly curious.  Is it because people can emulate rape with a willing and consenting partner, while that can't be said for someone sexually attracted to children?

As for LinkedIn, all you have to do is make a full profile and search for people. It's not like facebook, just add loads of people. I once got a job based on my LinkedIn profile - they never even asked for a CV!

Don't be complacent. Send a CV, then ring to ask if they've received it. Leave your name and email with the recruitment officer or manager. Ring a week later &amp; ask when the shortlisting will begin. This will normally spin it in your favour, as one interviewer told me I was one of 2 people who rang about the job out of 100+ who sent in CVs.

Don't sell yourself short. You've done loads of good stuff.

One thing when writing a CV - don't just send out a generic blanket CV. Find the Job Description/ Person Spec and write your CV to cover all the points. If there isn't one, ring the company and ask."

I agree; a threat must be ""genuine"" to be a crime; phony threats are Constitutionally protected.  ""To the moon, Alice!"" is protected, at least until Ralph Kramden has personal access to a Saturn V launch vehicle.

&gt;In what case?

There are many in which various ""people holding signs"" arrests have been invalidated; I would also point to the many cases in which there has been found to be a Constitutional right to ""blink"" headlights at someone to warn them of a speed trap.

In general, though, *Greyned v. City of Rockford*, 408 U.S. 104 (1972) and its companion case, *Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley*, state the test pretty well.  To wit: ""The crucial question is whether the manner of expression is basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time"", *Greyned* at 116.

Here, the normal activity of the place where the man was standing was driving.  His demonstration and sign, done (near as I can tell) silently, in the middle of the day, on the elevated median of a public road, was certainly not incompatible with that place and time.  He didn't obstruct traffic, his relatively low-key sign was not a danger, nor did it overlap into lanes of travel.

In fact, his sign was meant to get people to follow the traffic laws of that area; in other words, his demonstration was not only compatible with the normal activity of that place and time, it was *encouraging* the normal (safe) activity.

What really reveals this arrest as an unconstitutional one is found in the case of *Snyder v. Phelps*, the 2011 case about the Westboro Baptist Church (God Hates Fags).  In that case, the Court saw through the statutes designed to ""protect"" funerals and found them to be, in effect, content-based restrictions, which are usually unconstitutional.  They realized that, ""A group of parishioners standing at the very spot where Westboro stood, holding signs that said 'God Bless America' and 'God Loves You,' would not have been subjected to liability.""

This case is no different.  It can hardly be argued with a straight face that this guy was arrested for any other reason than what his sign said.  If his sign had said, ""God Bless America,"" or, ""Support the Frisco Police Department,"" or ""Drive safely everyone,"" we would not be talking about this.  The police targeted and arrested this man for the content of his message, unquestionably, and that is why his arrest is unconstitutional."

SeaNilly,runescape,1390244933.0,"Now that Yelps' business has failed, he is forced to 
move back home with his parents in goblin village 
Numbskull (his mother) and Nuthead(his father). 
They live in a small tent in Goblin Village. 
Yelps' family has been providing the Generals with 
laughs for years. Yelps comes from a long line of 
goblin dummies (jesters). This is because Yelps 
great-grandparents preached peace between goblin 
tribes. Bandos wasn't happy so he ordered them to be 
the dummies, and for all of their children and their 
children's children (etc...) to be dummies as well. 
With Bandos weakening in the most recent world event,
he is no longer enforcing this, and the Generals are
far to preoccupied with the latest fashion trends to 
be concerned with humor. 


His mother, Numbskull, is an old, sick looking 
goblin. Her skin tone is a muddier green. Her eyes are set back and and she 
looks malnourished. She wears a piece of goblin
armor stitched together in the middle. It is half 
orange and half blue, many years ago she found that
some perfectly good, though horribly colored, armor
was thrown away. When she found it, it looked as
though somebody had tried to eat both pieces of armor
so she had to take parts of each to stitch together
a full piece of armor. 


His father, Nuthead, is also very old and his skin color is a very pasty green. He walks
with a cane (it is actually one of the poles that
used to hold up the back corner of their tent, 
which is collapsing.) He is wearing a very tattered
jester costume from the Fremmenik isles quest. An
exceptionally dumb adventurer attempted to wash
his costume in a boiling cauldron, but it shrunk
to be goblin sized. 


If I think of a decent idea for a quest to go along
with this, then I will post it here. I will leave you
with this for now, though.

I would invite you to consider the source of your hesitation, though: is it hard to talk about because it is painful for you or because you think that it might be a turn-off for your SO? If it is painful for you, rethink whether it is totally in the past and really does not affect you anymore.

If it is concern about your SO's reaction, remember that if he or she is a mature person who loves you, then he or she is not going to start looking at you as anything less because of this.

Nix the Xmas spending entirely. I don't care if you're only using 80% of what's ""budgeted"", that's still $2000 you're handing out to people. **You are spending more on Christmas than you have in your savings account**. Let that sink in.

I love my pets, I understand the dog is a part of your family but be realistic here - how much are you paying to maintain a questionable quality of life for an old, sick dog?

cokeisahelluvadrug,cscareerquestions,1390245185.0,"It just doesn't look attractive. It also looks like you did it in MS Word. Focus on how your eyes move when you look at it. A quick glance should home in on your name (the centerpiece of the resume), and for a sustained look the eyes should be guided to the subheadings, in order. The way that you've chosen your font styles and organized your white space has broken the ""flow"" of the resume.

Specific comments/concerns:

- Why so much white space at the bottom? 

- Your name should be more prominent. I can't really see how your heading works, but -- Why do you need a *three-column* header? Surely you can just have your name, and then a single address right below it.

- Underlines are tacky because they're a giant horizontal line across the page. Horizontal lines should be used sparingly, when layout dictates -- not when content does. Font sizes, bold, and italics are expressive enough for your needs. Although you might want to consider small caps.

- Your tabulated sections look really weird. They also mess with whitespace, especially in comparison to your dense ""Work Experience"" section.

- It's ""Extracurricular"". Use the commonly accepted spelling of words. Even if your chosen spelling *might* be correct (and it's not, since ""extra"" is a prefix), you're not going to be able to reason with recruiters before they toss your resume in the trash. You don't want to look sloppy. A sloppy undergrad won't get hired.

- Your bullets are too heavy, they draw the eye when they should be *directing* the eye to their respective line items.

- Your extracurricular activities are pretty much bullshit. Especially since you stopped doing most of them in high school. 

- Your ""Technical Skills"" section should not be under ""Education"". It should be its own section.

- Consider right-aligning certain pieces of information: date ranges, GPA, etc. It's confusing to put two pieces of information on the same line without separating them with whitespace -- it's difficult for English-speakers to start reading something mid-line, so help them out. (At least for me, it's confusing. My mind is going, ""wait, why are we skipping all those other words?"")

Also, your resume should be done in latex. You claim to be getting a CS(E) degree, so walk the walk."

phomaniac,Fitness,1390245319.0,Eat more and work out. Don't even need pictures. It won't be comfortable. Most people that are skinny are going to have a hard time putting on weight. They've become accustomed to eating a small amount of food. You're going to want to puke. But that's something you have to overcome if you want to gain some solid weight.

Slukaj,Steam,1390245323.0,"The only game I'm aware of with anyone Windows 8 problems at all are Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but both are easily fixed by running in Windows 7 compatibility mode. 

I looked up the specs of the AMD E300, and I've got to say, that is a *very* low-powered processor. I don't know if your nephew was using the same computer before and just upgraded to Windows 8, or if he got an entirely new machine, but if I was going to blame ANYTHING it'd be that processor. 

Based on [this](http://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-E-Series-E-300-Notebook-Processor.60141.0.html), it's pretty clear that this processor was designed for very light-weight notebooks and netbooks, computers that are *not* known for being able to play games.

TL;DR: That processor indicates that his new computer is very underpowered for any type of gaming. This problem has nothing to do with Windows 8."

silverionmox,europe,1390245326.0,"Feel free to cite the obvious observations yourself: 

&gt;Nuclear fission investments account for the largest  share  of  the  EU  RD&amp;D  investments

And that is for 2013. I don't see why I shouldn't be allowed to discuss the investments in the years before that, since they shed such a clear light on the effectivity of decades of nuclear funding.

Or this one:

&gt; For   the   non-nuclear   SET-Plan 
technologies,  corporate  R&amp;D  was  usually  higher  than  public  investment  (59.2%  of 
total investment). 

The state already is favoring nuclear over other options. There's no need to draw that further out of balance."
