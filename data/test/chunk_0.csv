ejchristian86,TwoXChromosomes,1388534402.0,"I hadn't ever heard of them before joining this subreddit. They're not really a big thing in the US, but are apparently very common in many European countries.

A menstrual cup is a small silicone cup with a grip on the bottom (usually a small stick, though some companies offer ball and ring grips too) that you fold up and stick in your vagina; it pops open and catches your menstrual fluid. You empty and rinse it every 12 hours and then reinsert, and sterilize it in boiling water at the end of every cycle. Unlike a pad or a tampon, it can be reused for multiple cycles - some companies boast their cups will last 10 years.

[Diva Cup](http://divacup.com/) is probably the most popular / common brand, but I prefer [MeLuna](http://www.meluna.ca/) because they offer the great variety of sizes and grip styles.

Edit: Just realized in linking to the MeLuna site that the FDA has changed regulations regarding menstrual cups and they can't ship to the US until they get approved. Their FB page says that won't happen until next July at the earliest. Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame."

talldane1,tall,1388534451.0,"I don't have exactly the same problem, but I've gotten a lot more aware of body language.  It's not always perceived the way we intend.  My problem is social anxiety.  In crowds, I'm nervous to the point of sweating and I'm always the one in the far corner hoping no one will talk to me (and at the same time wishing they would).  My SO has been helping me overcome it for years and recently made me aware of a bad habit I have. 

When I'm nervous, apparently I unconsciously wring my hands.  For most people, that just looks like someone nervous, but I have large hands and since I'm tall, they're up higher so the gesture is pretty obvious.  What I've been told (now by several people) is that draws *more* attention to my size and looks vaguely threatening or intimidating.  Anyway, I'm working on what to do with my hands too.

My point was that from a purely economical/technical mindset, one would think that the worse the recession got, the more attractive it'd be to marry/cohabitate (tax, shared costs, etc), especially for the lower and middle classes that suffer more from it. Other factors may be working overtime to counter that.

If a whole movie were to focus purely on parodying Twilight, for example, then that means a lot more source material gets used (even if it all gets properly abused in the jokes). By spreading around the source material, that means less is taken from any one particular source while still filling up the time needed for a feature film.

Sorry, I did not know that. I am not a Christian and have never been one, so I know very little about the Bible. If you can tell me about the features that Biblical dragons possess, I would be happy to discuss that.

As for giant sea serpents, I don't know what that means. A serpent is a snake, right? We know that sea snakes exist already (although they are not giant). It's very possible that there are giant ones in existence, considering how little of the ocean's life we're familiar with. Remember when we used to think that giant squids were old sailor's myths, and then it turned out they're real? So I remain agnostic on the subject of giant sea serpents.

Talking snakes are impossible (based on snake anatomy). Multi-headed beasts exist (two-headed kittens, cows, etc., are born all the time). As for giants, you'll have to tell me *how* giant you mean.

Changed the processor to a 4th gen i5 and got a compatible motherboard. Changed memory to a little faster. Got rid of the SSD. Changed HDD to 1tb. You probably won't need more than that. Changed the 770 to a 760. You could eventually upgrade that using EVGAs step up program. Changed case to a Source 210. PSU is now a Semi modular 600w. Monitor is slightly bigger, and less expensive."

He didn't see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to the American People were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.

Lee was a Marine for three years. When he was young he watched the war videos and he said to dad ""I want to be in the war daddy.""

Dad said ""No! You will BE KILL BY FREEMASONS""

There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in Houston Texas he knew there were Freemasons.

""This is Merletti"" the radio crackered. ""You must fight the Freemasons!""

So Lee gotted his Model 91 rifle and got in a window.

""HE GOING TO EXPOSE US"" said the Freemasons.

""I will discredit him"" said the Cybermason and he fired the coverup missiles. Lee shotted at him and tried to blew him up in the papers. But then the censor fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.

""No! I must kill the Freemasons"" he shouted

The radio said ""No, Lee. You are the Freemasons""

And then Lee was a government assassin.

Will_Im_Not,AskReddit,1388534869.0,"&gt;What it seems like they are saying, however, is that because they made some big mistakes they shouldn't be afforded an option or a path to get out of it and better themselves.

Seriously, who the hell is saying that?

&gt;being forced into a shitty minimum wage job and deciding wether to feed their children or have heat this week.

If you work minimum wage and you have a child then you're eligible for food benefits. Plus, there's food banks, volunteer programs, and church food drives. Schools provide subsidized or free lunches to poor children. If you ~~have a job~~ live in America then you're not starving. 

&gt;My major issue with the ""paying consequences"" theory is that you are now saying that their children should have to pay for their parents mistakes as well, which is in no way fair or even excusable.

Absolutely not. Like you said, one major reason that people get into this mess in the first place is because of their childhood. Children should have all of their basic needs provided for; shelter, clothing, education, food, etc. And for the most part we already provide that. 

But we weren't talking about the children, we were talking about the parents. The parents should have opportunities to better themselves and they still do. But if they decided to have kids before they got **any** valuable job skills then they shouldn't be surprised if they're poor after they have kids. "

No, see, what many don't understand is that climate change is a change in probabilities. Imagine you had a set of cards to play Blackjack with, except all the suites were removed and all face cards are replaced with 10's(since they have the same value). You play with it and nothing changes, the probability is the same. Now add another '10' card, not much changes, you can still play normally. Now add another, and another etc. Suddenly every hand you get is 2 10's, but so is the dealers, the only way you win is by getting an Ace, but the chances of that is now *very* low. The game has completely changed, and just like with climate change, you can't tell if was an added 10 or an original one that doomed you.

So maybe that Cat 5 hurricane that hit the Philippines would have happened if the industrial revolution had never occurred, maybe not. Maybe it'd been weaker, possibly it could've been stronger. But storm aren't the big worry, the big one is lack of snow covered mountains, which millions depend on to give them water as they melt in the summer, without those, entire cities will dry up.

For example, I'm very pale, with strongly yellow undertones and a tendency to flush. I cannot find a drug store foundation that actually works for me. I've occasionally found one in the right color, but never also the right texture. So I use Indie powder foundations, and look to pro or high end for liquid or cream ones.

Another example is matte eyeshadows. NYX has a few good ones, but theBalm is unrivaled in quality, and Inglot has an fantastic selection. For shimmery ones though, I love Wet n Wild (I still have some high end, but more because it feels luxurious and I love the added variety).

&gt;""In psychiatric care, weighted blankets are one of our most powerful tools for helping people who are anxious, upset, and possibly on the verge of losing control,"" says Karen Moore, OTR/L, an occupational therapist in Franconia, N.H. These special blankets are filled with weighted pellets, which are sewn into compartments to keep them evenly distributed. Weighted blankets are also sometimes marketed for general use as an aid to sleep and relaxation.
&gt;
&gt;""These blankets work by providing input to the deep pressure touch receptors throughout the body,"" Moore says. ""Deep pressure touch helps the body relax. Like a firm hug, weighted blankets help us feel secure, grounded, and safe."" Moore says this is the reason **many people like to sleep under a comforter even in summer**.  [Emphasis mine]

Source: [Choosing a Blanket to Help You Sleep](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/minding-the-body/201112/choosing-blanket-help-you-sleep)

I'm in my thirties and I still find a blanket to be one of life's simple, glorious pleasures, no matter the season.  Never had the pleasure of a weighted blanket, but I have a number made of cotton.  They're over six pounds (2.5+ kg) at queen size.  A flimsy, poly-whatever stuffed comforter or a thin cotton sheet just won't cut it; and a wool blanket is crafted for much colder climes than where I live.

If this rings a bell, the ""amazing"" effect of a hot shower / hot tub may be due in large part to its anti-anxiety effects described by a number of redditors in this thread.

pathein_mathein,badhistory,1388535315.0,"&gt;...but the Athenian idea of land owning being the barrier was almost entirely broken.

*Ahem.*

The primary barrier for Athenians was lineage, not land ownership. Yes, Solon did create ""grades"" of citizenship where agricultural production was the key to opening different levels of possible authority in the government, but note that the non-property owning class had voting rights, just not the rights to serve as officials, or to belong/vote to certain councils. I'd suggest the property requirements more Second Amendment than *Starship Troopers*, and more about military organization with a hint of the (nearly totally lost on us moderns) ancient feeling that STEM was wicked as compared with agriculture and husbandry - and I'd suggest it's that hint of an idea that's more important to Aristotle in discussing democracy that Jefferson picks up and runs with and imparts to the rest of the more Plutarch-loving Founding Fathers. Land ownership had more to do with what the ancients thought land ownership imparted to one's character rather than property itself. The non-landed and the dis-landed made up a voting block that would become increasingly critical to the fate of Athens.

If you're talking about a clear-cut point in time in Athens when only landowners had political power, it was pre-Solon and before most of the interesting things that you think about Athens happened, and not really representative of the messy nest of political bodies the Athenian government would become. Even then, I would suggest they would conceptualize it as Athens for the Athenians rather than about land ownership itself - notably, over time the property rules became less important while the citizenship rules became tighter.

And yes, I've wanted an opportunity to rant about this myself for quite some time."

&gt; ‘If you worry about such things, and I do, then I specifically said John Hurt’s Doctor doesn’t use the title. [Matt Smith's Doctor] is in his 12th body but he’s the 11th Doctor, however there is no such character as the 11th Doctor – he’s just the Doctor – that’s what he calls himself.’

So really, none of them are the Xth Doctor, that's what *we* call them.  And we call Hurt the War Doctor, but that's still just our name for them.  So technically they all just call themselves Doctor - but Hurt's character didn't.  Therefore we can call him the War Doctor for clarity's sake (or 8.5), but *he* didn't consider himself ""the Doctor"" - the next regeneration to do so was Eccleston's, thus becoming the 9th person to call himself ""the Doctor.""

andytheg,AskReddit,1388535344.0,"I joined a fraternity in 2005 and saw the ""hazing"" get easier and easier. My frat was pretty mild as there were consistently issues on campus. There were always rumors about bad things that would happen but from what I can remember it wasn't THAT bad, just took up a lot of time and most of the hazing was getting yelled at and cleaning the house. I was the last pledge class where the brothers were allowed to completely trash the common room, trash cans overturned, food everywhere, condiments on the wall. This happened twice and we had to make the room spotless before we could go home. The first time someone peed in a cup and left it in the middle of the floor, the second time someone pooped on a plate.

I didn't see much of it as hazing, just a lot of cleaning and getting yelled at. We did some pretty awesome stuff though, like playing ultimate frisbee at 5 a.m. instead of the usual jogging around campus and towards the end of pledgeship we were blindfolded and driven to a very secluded cave about 45 minutes outside the city. Upon arrival we were un-blindfolded and got to explore the cave together, so awesome. Some of the people I pledged and lived with at the fraternity are still my best friends today

Borror0,CanadaPolitics,1388535595.0,"The reason that deficit spending boost demand is GDP = C + I + G + (X-M). To end the paradox of thrift causing the shortfall in C (consumption) and I (investment), government artificially boost GDP by increasing G to bring GDP back in line. However, if ΔG is financed by increased taxes, then it comes at the expenses of C and I. As a result, the impact on short term GDP is neutral *at best*.

The tax cut works in reverse. While holding G steady, it increases both C and I as people have more money in hand that they can either spend or invest. I consider it less effective than increasing G (which, in turn, is less effective than monetary stimulus), since it still runs into the paradox of thrift, but it can work.

The most baffling part of TheBluePill/SRS is how not one single person from these sites ever tries to disprove the allegations against them or whoever they fight on behalf of without resorting to mockery, spiteful commentary, and deceit. I don't know about you, but I'd think a sub devoted to satirizing TRP, as the more rational and civil party, would be making fun of red pill concepts by providing examples from reality that completely and utterly counters the notions it purports in an amusing light-heated manner that not only shows TRP is bunk, but also proves women aren't going to behave like wild bitches that don't understand humor or irony.

I hate to say something that may sound insensitive but sometimes you just have to give an ultimatum:  *""Stop doing xyz or we can no longer be in your life...""*, and be prepared to follow through and stick to it if necessary.  As painful as it is, sometimes that is the only way that change can be brought about.

Also, up until the middle of the last century, it wasn't a secret or even a problem that women were paid less than men because men were automatically assumed to be ""bread-winners"" while women were primarily employed as supplemental income. Single women couldn't get paid as much as single men, if they could even get employed, because there's always been this concept of single women ""belonging"" to their fathers and being given to their husbands when married. If a single woman was poor, it was the fault of her retainer, and she had no power to better her situation except marriage. That's why so many poor women turned to prostitution.

Do you think that someone born to a single, alcoholic mother in a lower socio-economic class has the same opportunities at age 17 as someone raised in a middle class neighborhood with a two working parents with college educations? 

Are you familiar with the research that shows that ""on average, children from families on welfare were provided half as much experience as children from working class families, and less than a third of the experience given to children from high-income families. In other words, children from families on welfare heard about 616 words per hour, while those from working class families heard around 1,251 words per hour, and those from professional families heard roughly 2,153 words per hour. Thus, children from better financial circumstances had far more language exposure to draw from.""

Just because you're black doesn't mean you deserve special treatment for something you never endured. You didn't endure slavery. Your parents didn't, your grandparents didn't, your great grandparents didn't. The closest thing any of them (minus them and maybe their parents) experienced was the extreme prejudice of the early and mid 20th century in the south. If you are under maybe 50, you have zero right to complain about anything. You endured nowhere near the amount of hardship the slaves endured, and a lot of prejudice that exists is because of black people perpetuating it by playing the race card. Again, NOT ALL black people. Some do though, and that's enough to continue the prejudice."

On several occasions, they have been black (just coincidence), and when confronted have said, ""what, you think I'm stealing because I'm black?"" No. She thinks you're stealing because she sees you stuffing shirts in your pocket and under he stuff in your purse.
What I'm trying to say is that if it weren't for people like that, a lot of the racism that innocent people experience wouldn't exist. People who get caught play the race card, and that perpetuates it."

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1388536297.0,"I love the Sonia Kashuk brush sets. They tend to be quite affordable, while still being good quality and attractive. Elf is also excellent.

You certainly need eye brushes. In particular, I'd recommend one for applying on the lid, a crease brush, a blending brush, and something smaller for highlighter. Eyeliner brushes are essential if you prefer that type of eyeliner. For a basic starting set, I'd recommend the [elf studio eyeshadow c brush](http://www.eyeslipsface.com/studio/tools/single-brushes/eyeshadow_c_brush) (for patting eyeshadow on the lid), [elf studio contour brush](http://www.eyeslipsface.com/studio/tools/single-brushes/contour_brush) (for placing eyeshadow in the crease), [elf essential eyeshadow brush](http://www.eyeslipsface.com/elf/tools/single-brushes/eye_shadow_brush) (for placing the highlight), [elf essential blending eye brush](http://www.eyeslipsface.com/elf/tools/single-brushes/blending_eye_brush) (for blending everything! If possible, pick this one up in person, at Target, to make sure it's not scraggly. These can be amazing, but the essential brushes are inconsistent), and at least one [elf eyelash and brow wand](http://www.eyeslipsface.com/elf/tools/single-brushes/eyelash_and_brow_wand) (for getting the clumps out of your eyelashes). If any of these cannot be found, Sonia Kashuk also makes great ones, although a bit more expensive, and has a little eye brush set, which is great, although all of the brushes in it are a little smaller than I prefer. 

For face brushes, it depends what you're doing. The elf studio line is very good very face brushes, I think, as again is Sonia Kashuk. I've got a big powder brush for mineral foundation, a stippling brush for blush, a random smaller brush for face contouring, and a fan brush for over pigmented blushes or highlighting. "

dakru,AskMen,1388536313.0,"&gt; Aside from it being just a number, a new year means more of the same, more working to pay the bills, more wasting time just to get closer and closer to the end

I think you have it backwards. People aren't celebrating the monotony of daily life itself, they're celebrating things to *break* the monotony of daily live. Throughout history you might have spent the spring, summer, and early autumn working on your farm and going out hunting or something. When something significant happens, like the harvest, you take that as an occasion to celebrate and break the monotony of all the work you've been doing.

Nowadays we focus less on practical occasions (celebrating after the work of the harvest is done) and more on sentimental things like birthdays and the coming of the new year, but the idea is the same.

It sounds like you just have a negative view of life in general (""more wasting time just to get closer and closer to the end"") and you're taking it out on people who are feeling positive, like the ones celebrating New Year's Eve."

It wasn't until it tore open the tent and shoved his nose in that my dad thought maybe the family would be in danger, so he grabbed a can of canned veggies (don't remember if it was peas or carrots) and hit its nose with the can as hard as he could.

It immediately backed out of the tent, but then he heard it knocking around the rest of the campsite so he got out and waved his arms and yelled, trying to scare it away, but... that... didn't work.  Instead it charged, so he jumped behind a tree, grabbed a canoe paddle, and started beating it with the paddle.  It ran away pretty soon after that.

Not really related, but a few years later my dad was shoveling snow and accidentally got his shoulder popped out of its socket.  He popped it back in and finished shoveling.

myrrlyn,teslore,1388536347.0,"The Kalpas run from Convention (the end of the Dawn and the final act of the Creation process) to the eating by Alduin. When he finishes eating the world, Mundus snaps back to the instant of Lorkhan's death, and the pantheons on occasion shuffle around. Malacath, Akatosh, Mehrunes Dagon, possibly Molag Bal, and sort of Sheogorath, are all new entities to the role this time around.

Trans-kalpic beings, especially the Dragons which are intimately connected to Time, can retain their state across the cycle. The Hist, which are completely alien creatures that don't seem to understand (or like) Time all that well, may also retain their information.

The ""longest kalpa"" postulate comes from the fact that this kalpa is **hella long**, to use a technical term, and has been extended beyond due several times. Akatosh intervened against Dagon's destruction, Alduin has been thwarted twice, and we have reports that the world lasts at *least* into the 9th Era, which is pretty radically different from the 4th."

One expects a certain degree of maturity out of the SO, and not having a schedule even for an ongoing evening is not a great way to demonstrate it. It's inconsiderate towards your partner, who may be cooking dinner for you or expecting you to do it, or just waiting to see you before sleep.

OrangeredValkyrie,news,1388536526.0,"The thing is that I don't label myself as a feminist. I think both genders should be treated equally and individuals should be treated in the way they want first and the way they deserve second. (as in if you want respect, you'll be given respect until you prove yourself to be an enormous prick) The ""feminist"" label has too much attached to it and I'd prefer to just have my own ideas about the subject, since a lot of feminists are attaching way too much of their own misandry and personal vendettas to it. However, I stand by the idea that when the hate is stripped away, there are a good set of ideas there that can benefit society. See,

&gt; Either way, it was batshit insane, pure cowardice and is coming from the same spirit as feminism.

Here is where we agree the most. You're not in the MRA uniform and I'm not in the feminist uniform. Based on how much we're agreeing on that point alone, I'm tempted to demand that we kiss or something, but maybe after dinner or something. 

My point is that no system is perfect, this one least of all. I feel it fills a necessary role, but does so imperfectly. I don't think dogpiling it was a good idea. I think reasonable discussion would have been better. In short, I think 4Chan mishandled this, which is news to absolutely no one. 

&gt; But I still don't think you respect what it is being a man.

Frankly, I'm not sure what it *is* being a man. Female identity seems to be pretty established, albeit beginning to evolve further, but male identity just hasn't been spoken about as much. If you'd like to explain it yourself, I'd definitely welcome it. I'd rather hear it from someone who isn't on TV or relying on their book to sell or anything like that.

&gt; I commend you for not destroying your ex-husbands life more than you probably could have (but likely shouldn't have the power to be able to do in the first place).

Just a tiny note on this. I didn't destroy his life. I destroyed all ties I had with him, legally and emotionally. He lied to me for months and wouldn't even admit what he had done, even when the landlord was screaming at me and even when our power was cut. He was punished by the Marine Corps for trying to abandon them. I explained the situation to his family, since he was too far away for them to visit and he wasn't getting any phone calls, and they were deeply disappointed in him. His father especially, since he was a former staff sergeant in the army and took it very seriously. So really, since there wasn't any property between us and we had no children, it would have been impossible for me to wreck his life the way you see other divorces going on. 

&gt; But at the end of the day you stood infront of everyone in your life that mattered to you and promised you would love him for better/worse, sickness/health, rich/poor until death.

I was with him under the understanding that he wasn't lying to everyone who ever cared about him. However, that's exactly what he was doing. And after realizing just how willing he was to lie to me about so many things (he tried to convince me he was sterile when he couldn't pay for my birth control, which I wasn't able to foot since I had moved several states with him and hadn't found a job yet) I saw no reason to just say ""Oh well, I still love you, even though you're willing to be such an irresponsible douche."" And for the record, we had a small ceremony in the mayor's office. No gigantic wedding or honeymoon or anything.

&gt; He had an occupation where the currency he traded in was the ability to unflinchingly take life and die.

Also for the record, he was an IT guy for the Marines. Yes, he had gone through boot camp, and for that I thought he had grown up quite a bit. Frankly, the fact that I knew he could kill me with his bare hands made me a little timid about speaking against him. He did almost break my neck once by accident when we were wrestling. (No, I did not sue him later for this. It was an accident. I'm not a horrible person.)

&gt; Then you have a problem with guys having ""abandonment issues.""

Ex husband thankfully wasn't one of these, but later on I dated a guy who grew increasingly upset when I would talk to someone other than him. He thought I was badmouthing him behind his back, so he would demand to see my phone and demand that I never speak to my family of anything that went on between us. And frankly, I can't blame him for having such issues. His mother had him when she was 15 and tried to leave him in a dumpster. That's absolutely tragic, but I don't have to subject myself to that just for the sake of being a good girlfriend. I tried to convince him to seek counseling and he refused. 

&gt; But if you are going to go around having no respect for men and treating them as such, now it is on you because you will have become the same.

And it's a good thing I don't do this. I don't shout at men for being pigs or for being violent or for anything else. They don't deserve it because they're not the ones who did those awful things.

However, it's very intriguing that I would have to explain all of this just for you to accept that I should be able to decide which relationship to stay in and whether or not I'm justified in leaving. Reminds me of old divorce laws. But oh well, I'm sure that has nothing to do with any of this."

DuneBug,AskReddit,1388536854.0,"A problem I have is that adjusting the minimum wage doesn't adjust everyone else's salary.
If I'm making 10$/hour to do construction or some sort of labor, and the minimum wage is raised to 10$, then now I will make the same amount of money as a 15 yr old kid.

You can argue that market forces would take over... And that if an entry level job at mcdonalds pays the same as construction, i would just go work at whichever job I prefer. 

And everyone raising their wages has to make a choice: 
1. Do I take a smaller share of profit in order to pay these people more?
2. Do I pass this cost along to my customer?
3. Do I just eliminate this position?

I feel like the majority of businesses when faced with option 1 are going to decide that they can't afford a smaller share of profit, because they're either too greedy or really can't afford it.. Because if neither of those were true they'd probably have already raised their wages. 

2 is pretty easy to justify when there's a massive news cycle about minimum wage hikes."

Sabu113,soccer,1388536859.0,"Ok I am conflating things a touch.

Welbeck *is* pushing Kagawa out of that hole. In the super rare games he starts in the hole (thinking Everton and another one) he was quickly shunted out to the left in favor of dropping Welbeck alone up front and Rooney to do Rooney. The idea being we can run around being physical to compensate for Tom in the midfield. 

The other thing I am conflating it with is this whole notion I am seeing pushed by more nationalistic fans about rating Welbz over Kagawa in general and I think that's verging on delusional.

mountainunicycler,technology,1388536864.0,"But as a photographer, my values are: 

Lens quality

Sensor quality (resolution, dynamic range, color depth, sharpness, noise levels) 

Startup time (sometimes good photos are gone before you can bring the camera to your eye, so you flip it on and guess) 

Usability (with gloves on, in the dark without looking at a screen that will make my eyes adjust, being able to set it one handed, or while running) 

Reliability (I've never had the camera crash or need rebooting, it's only corrupted two files ever, and I can run on-camera RAID so that loss is almost impossible) 

Battery life (I can shot for weeks with my dual batteries and 64gb of storage) 

AF precision (when shooting with longer lenses) 

And other very specific stuff. I have better tools for processing, uploading, and printing, so if you could tell me I suddenly could spend $600 more on a camera, I'd want that money to go into those things and those things only. 

Or really, if I had $600, I'd put it into a lens because that lens will work for the rest of my life on nikon DSLRs. Most of the lenses I shoot with are already older than I am. "

Handyland,KerbalSpaceProgram,1388536895.0,"Personally, I don't want multiplayer and would rather they spend their time on much more important things.

I don't want multiplayer in part because I don't know anyone else who plays, but mostly because the game is all about progressing and exploring and developing, and playing around with other people mostly seems like it would get old really fast.  Those multi-man space stations take time and coordination to build, and one quick incident wipes it all away.  Space fights would either be short lived, or long awkward drawn-out affairs where nothing really matters, just because the game was designed to be nothing like that (controls, limitations of parts and staging, etc).  How does time warp even work?

Whereas, instead of developing multiplayer, they could be fixing aerodynamics (think FAR + Deadly Re-entry), adding more features to improve game depth (life support and other ship resources needing management like heat, communications like Remote Tech 2, resources like how Kethane has been implemented, just more parts available to play with), and they could be making simple improvements to the game as well (smoother and better developed VAB, a refinement of the maneuver node system, things like Kerbal Engineer, Alarm Clock, Improved NavBall).  There is such an extensive list of fantastic mods that are really just comprised of things that should simply be in the game.  I hope most of them will end up implemented in some form, but it's slightly disappointing when something like multiplayer, which mostly amounts to a novelty because the game was never constructed to support it in any way, takes precedence over those other features.

Just my two cents."

Bigger words are only useful if the person I'm speaking to knows the words.  Otherwise I'm just communicating with myself.  The bigger words more effectively communicate the idea to me, but not the other person.  I used to huff and puff about feeling I had to dumb down my speech, but effective communication eventually took precedence to my vocabulary as my job (and often relationships) hinged on my ability to get my point across to others."

That's my problem with this. I need to see empirical evidence of a deity. And there is none. But this deity will still send me to Hell because I'm questioning his existence, using the rational brain that he apparently gave me! Does that sound fair to you? If I went up to you tomorrow and gave you a book filled with ancient tales about a cosmic, *transcendent* horse that governed the universe, and demanded that you convert, would you join my religion? What if I showed you a few historical points here and there, would you join? What if there were a few morals in the book but it was also filled with blood and gore? Would you join? What if I told you if you don't, you'll burn in a giant wasteland filled with the cosmic horse's dung? Would you join? No, you would ask for evidence of the cosmic horse. And I would say, ""You just have to believe in him. Let him into your heat. He's not visible because he's *testing your faith*."" Would you join?

Now I ask you, how is that any different from Christianity?

I don't see how your first paragraph represents god. When you get into a relationship, it takes time to nurture it and allow it to blossom. You don't just sit down at the first date and plan everything out.

An ancient book isn't exactly the best way to communicate your message if you're a god. You can claim that the stories are simply allegorical and that they were written for the time period, but that would beg the question, *wouldn't god know how humanity would progress?* In the present moment, there's hundreds, thousands of debates raging about the historicity of the Bible, and whether or not things should be taken as allegorical or literal. This makes the Bible impossible to interpret truly. God wasn't very smart if he expected humans to know exactly which stories were allegorical and which were literal. There's hardly anything in the Bible that tells us what is allegorical and what is literal (as I mentioned before, the Parables of Jesus are said to be parables). But how about Noah's Ark? Should we take that as allegorical, as a story, since all the geological evidence goes against it? The Exodus out of the Egypt isn't supported by mainstream history or archaeology. Adam and Eve surely did not happen. There's vague evidence of the existence of Christ, and even if he did exist, how do we know that he actually did all those miracles? If Noah's Ark, the Exodus, Adam and Eve and the Talking Snake, etc did not actually happen, isn't that cherry picking to say that ""yes those are just stories but the Jesus story is true""? How do we draw the line?

The answer is that we can't draw the line. The Bible is an ancient, chaotic book filled with contradictions, and obviously written in a time when people weren't educated and didn't know what the hell they were talking about.

If I were god, I would show empirical evidence of myself to humanity, and give them a book (if I go that route) that cannot be questioned and can only be interpreted in one way. No debates, no contradictions, no cherry picking. What would that book look like? I'm not an omnipotent, omniscient god so I don't know, but if I was I would know the perfect way of distributing my Word. And the current method, the Bible, isn't up to par."

everyone wants to be a general and not a grunt. fast food used to BE a livable wage, because minimum wage was originally implemented to make sure the people on the bottom could make enough to live.

and to say that there's no challenge or diversity to working at best buy...

in 16 years of scraping by on minimum wage jobs, and having worked a couple of ""respectable"" jobs when i could, i worked far harder, with far more diverse groups of people, at those minimum wage jobs. i now have a job making ten bucks an hour. and it's gravy compared to the job i had at minimum wage before that. it really is true the old saying, that the harder you work the less money you make. 

if you spend 5 years at best buy, or any retail place, you're going to face more ""challenge"" in your life than any cush office job or equipment operator job. my shifts in retail some days were more grueling a challenge than any factory job. in fact, the only job that came close to matching retail in terms of pure exhaustion was farm field work, and it paid cash, less than minimum wage."

I'm very happy knowing that you're actually making an effort to improve player behaviour. One thing I might point out is that you're not very vocal to the players about this fact.
 

Let's take a random player, let's call him Dave.

Now, Dave has been playing League of Legends for 6 months, he found out about it through a friend of his. Despite all the trolling, disconnects and flaming he has received, he still enjoys the game, but every so often he finds himself contemplating the fact that the players he encounters can really hamper his experience in a negative way.

Dave doesn't use Reddit, and has only used the Riot forums for occasional support he needs, so he doesn't know that Riot are actually trying to improve player behaviour and the standards at which players behave.

Positive reinforcement is a wonderful thing, everyone loves being rewarded for something, but in a free game like this you can't reward that much, other than something aesthetic. The Honor system worked for a very limited time and any improvements you make to it are only really a temporary solution. The only real incentive people have, in regards to the honor system, is that they're getting a ribbon and a number goes up on their player profile. Now, to me, that doesn't sound like much.

I don't know what could be done, I'm sure I could brainstorm up an idea, but alas, that's your guys' job, not mine.

One thing you should do, though, and that I believe would be of great benefit, in relation to the Dave issue above. Is to create a public awareness of player behaviour and the need to improve your behaviour as a player. Maybe create a motivational video and have it featured in the game client. The video would first focus on a player with bad behaviour, then a player with good behaviour. Perhaps this could be tied in with a reformed honor system. Sure players know they *should* behave well. Sure they know that if they misbehave they might get warned or banned. But they don't really know Riot's stance on the issue, not in depth anyhow. A reply like yours is fine and dandy for player like me that really cares about the issue and tries to find out more information, but most people just want it handed to them.

There does need to be more public awareness of the problem, as bad player behaviour can really ruin any experience you can have, especially for new players that are still forming an opinion of the game.

On another quick note, I do believe that restricting chat to misbehaving players could be a good move on your part, and would like to see it fully implemented, if it isn't yet, that I don't know.

As well as informing players that someone they've reported has been dealt with appropriately."

xgloryfades,depression,1388537392.0,"I'm completely the same. There's something about the concept that repulses me. Being indifferent/repulsed/uninvolved with attraction doesn't make you any less human though. People tell me to look on the bright side so I guess I should remind you that not experiencing sexual attraction means not being sexually frustrated which is one less potential problem there. If my loneliness doesn't have a physical dimension then that's a positive. 

Your body's worth has nothing to do with aesthetics or any sexual ideas attached to it - your body has worth in its functions. Just think how amazing it is that you can turn thought into language and food into energy and that you're the product of years and years of evolution. Your body's valuable because it's served you well, it's grown from two cells to you. And that's pretty damn awesome. I'm not making a whole lot of sense but hopefully you know what I mean, your body is amazing. Your brain had these ideas, and your fingers hit the right squiggles to get ideas from head to screen and send them to me and loads of others miles and miles away. 

You're not broken or wrong and your sexuality isn't a problem. Others would have us believe we're meant to be getting our rocks off and getting in relationships and shit but that's their standards. If you don't want to be a part of that scene then don't.

I agree. If we witness a 2007 style crash then bitcoin will spike upwards while stocks and most commodities will dive. Even gold dipped in 2007 as investors deleveraged and moved back to relatively safe USD. With most investors not yet invested in bitcoin, the money flow will be into BTC not out(in the event of a crash).

That was also my most volatile relationship, we had the highest highs and usually things worked well... It worked 100% of the time I let her have her way, and I was happy to for a long time which made it so I couldn't change how much say I had without everyone around us thinking I was doing something wrong to her. I just wanted a say in what was happening in my/our lives. :|

CambodianDrywall,AskMen,1388537761.0,"Yes.  Met a woman at a Christmas Party.  We hit it off.  About an hour into it we knew we'd be leaving together, but she had to stick around a couple of more hours to appease her boss.  She used those hours to drink.  A lot.

Fast-forward to intimate time at her place.  Things were heating up and she stepped away to use the restroom.  She returned and things started up again.  Lights are off.  She reclined on her bed and removed all her clothing.  I worked my way down to provide some oral loving.  

Something was off.  I flipped on the bedside light and there was a soaked square of toilet paper stuck on her vagina.  There were red and brown streaks on it.

The turn-off was total and complete.  I pointed it out as discreetly as I could.  She was too drunk to properly care (IMO).  I dressed and bounced out."

Tote_Sport,AskReddit,1388537781.0,"Very well then...

Once upon a time, there was a young man who traipsing along ye olde road through the city of Belfast. Our particular hero was minding his own business when from out of nowhere, he hears a cry from a damsel in distress, being ravaged by a horde of angry trolls. Even though the odds were against him, the young man wasted no time in drawing his sword and running to the young maiden's aid.

With his first strike, he cleaved the first troll's head from its shoulders and quickly rounded on the others. One lunged at him; his gargantuan hands the size of an anvil. The young man sidestepped the strike and swiftly chopped off the attacking troll's arm, causing him to howl in pain and anger. Taking advantage of his temporary weakened state, the man thrust his sword deep into the wounded troll's heart, killing him instantly.

As the second troll fell in a heap at the man's feet, he turned to face the final troll, his sword dripping with the blood of his two fallen comrades. Upon seeing the rage and anger in the young man's eyes, the final troll turned and fled for his life. But it was not enough, as the young man hurled his sword after the final troll, sending it arching through the air, as it reached it's intended target and embedded itself in the third troll's back between its shoulders and it fell face first into the ground. 

With the assailants defeated, our young hero turned to the young maiden and helped her to her feet. 

""Brave sir!"" she began, ""you have done me a great deed in rescuing me. However can I repay your heroics?""

""Fairest maiden,"" the hero replied, ""I ask for nothing in return. Save that you simply ask HBO to include me in their list of extras for the upcoming filming of series 4 of Game of Thrones!""

""Consider your wish granted"" she said

And so it came to pass, that on the 18th day of the 10th month of the two thousand and thirteenth year, and again on the 25th day of the same month of the same year, that our young hero had his wish granted and got to meet that totally hot blond babe with the dragons...Danaerys, yeah, that's her name; and some other totally awesome characters from the show

**The end**

**TL;DR**: was walking down in Belfast, somebody from Extras NI asked me if I wanted to be in GoT, I said yes. Was paid handsomely for doing very little. Got to see some of the cast. "

I think the biggest hurdle is trying to get over being ugly, which is the vibe I'm getting with OP. This advice can only take you half way if you didn't win appealing genetics. Personally, I feel like I was able to skip many of the things you've listed by simply giving online dating a go.  No more bullshit small talk at the grocery store and in other places with extremely low probability odds. Some people don't want to meet women in bars or clubs, nor meet them casually. People like OP will absolutely not take this advice and apply it at the bar/club scene. OP wants a nice, shy nerdy introverted girl who despises these settings as much as he probably does. 

Anyways. 10/10 would read again. Good advice all around. I feel like I have a good grasp on all of the things you mentioned, except the crippling fear when it comes to small talk and cold approaching, as well as being the complete opposite of fat. Gaunt.

And until world travel became more common and possible it was usually one race being the aggressors against another ethnic group of the same race.

200 years ago, referring to a bad situation as resulting from the 'whites' or the 'asains' would give you a dumbfounded look. Hell, Germans and Gaelic peoples weren't considered to be 'white' by popular society until the 20th century. And in Asia you would find a bit more national alliance than racial alliance. Though I am not too familiar with Asian ethnicity I am aware of some white/European ones.

downvotesattractor,AskMen,1388537992.0,"&gt;I'm not talking about the cheating part. I'm talking about the her intentionally ODing

This is speculation, but if she did OD with the intention of trying to get OP back, that is pretty manipulative. OP should not fall for that.

Not falling for that is not feeling responsible for her OD'ing and ending up in a hospital. If she tries to get back with him, OP should keep in mind that she is the type of person who would OD herself to force him to get back to her (if that is what really happened, which probably is true).

However, OP's question was ultimately about visiting her. The answer is yes, he should visit her. Visiting a person in the hospital is a very humane and decent thing to do. When the girl starts convincing OP that he is responsible for her being in the hospital, that is when I agree that OP should not fall for her manipulative bullshit.

If we were to break up, it would be very complicated to do so, more so than if you're in a relationship that doesn't involve cohabitation. 

I get where you're coming from - but for two people who live together and have for a lengthy amount of time - it can be almost as complicated as a divorce. You still have to split assets and turn your life completely upside down.

I mean, sometimes they get fussy and stuff, but until they can talk, that's their only form of communicating needs they can't get on their own or that something is wrong. After that point, when kids misbehave, it's a toss up between bad kids and bad parenting. Sometimes you can definitely tell when it's bad parenting and that's when I think kids aren't to blame so much as the parents. Of course, this is all subjective, but in general, I feel like kids can't be blamed for the things people would hate them for. All of that ends past a certain age, of course, but then they're less kids and more teens. All my opinion though. "

miked4o7,starcraft,1388538102.0,"&gt;You're engaging in more ad hominem crap. I am not being an asshole for having an opinion that isn't popular.

I don't believe that it's the popularity of your opinion that makes it a little offensive.

&gt;Stream numbers have nothing to do with the right of a player to enter a team house to train. Skill does. Destiny is not invited to team houses to train with them even though he gets many viewers.

In Starcraft 2, Team Houses are funded by teams that are sponsored by companies.  Starcraft 2 teams are there to make money.  Being in a team house does not win you any games in tournaments.  The idea about being in a team house meaning something other than being a financial interest to the companies that run it is where I think your characterization is off.

&gt;Skill level is not the sole determinant of viewers. Having very little skill at the game should be a detriment to viewers, however, that is not the case and that is also not what I am protesting. I am protesting the fact that Kaitlyn thinks that she should be welcomed into a team house.

She said she badly wants to go to a team house.  With the tweets that this entire thread is the subject of, I don't see anything resembling entitlement... just desire.

The boyfriend stood with his friend, her sister stood with her boyfriend, causing an understandable rift in their relationship, which her parents and brother decided to treat as her(the victim's) fault, blaming her for causing drama in the family. The rape charge ended up going nowhere, as far as I know(I don't bring up the subject) the rape charge went nowhere, but the perpetrator then turned around and *charged her for slander*(which luckily went nowhere either, as far as I know).

It's been a long time since I played competitive Magic. For the life of me, I do not understand how any altered cards have been permitted in sanctioned events. It seems to me that card alters are rife with potential for abuse, and I don't know what the printing procedures are today, but (back in the day) very convincing forgeries were produced using foil lands. I have always advocated for intentional card alters being non-permissible in competitive play. I say intentional because there are always playable misprints and otherwise ""marked"" and damaged cards, but there's a difference between that and outright painting your cards.

Am I crazy? Or is there something I'm not realizing about the modern printing process on cards that wouldn't allow any forgeries?

Edit - And a PM from a dude with a DCI number two digits smaller than mine. Congratulations, we're old!"

Hatewrecked,news,1388538500.0,"It's fucking sad that I have to do this, but let's go over his exact response.

&gt;Thank you for bringing intelligence and rationality into the discussion. I don't know why people think ""the cops"" is some big international entity of like-mindedness. Different jurisdictions treat conduct and complaints differently.

Was my original quote which he quoted.

&gt;Non-internal affairs officers often derisively refer to the departments as the ""rat squad"".[1]  
Several police departments in the USA have been compelled to institute civilian review or investigation of police misconduct complaints in response to community perception that internal affairs investigations are biased in favor of police officers. For example, San Francisco, California, has its Office of Citizen Complaints, created by voter initiative in 1983, in which civilians who have never been members of the San Francisco Police Department investigate complaints of police misconduct filed against members of the San Francisco Police Department. Washington, DC, has a similar office, created in 1999, known as the Office of Police Complaints.[2]  
Due to the sensitive nature of this responsibility, in many departments, officers working internal affairs are not in a detective command, but report directly to the agency's chief, or to a board of civilian police commissioners.  
Internal Affairs investigators are bound by stringent rules when conducting their investigations. In California, the Peace Officers Bill of Rights (POBR) is a mandated set of rules found in the Government Code.[3]

Was a direct copy and paste from Wikipedia.

&gt;Sounds like somebody has never been on the receiving end of police action because beatings and intimidation are the same in every jurisdiction, language, and country.

Was vague, uninformed, condescending, and entirely tangent from the points I originally brought up.

&gt;Did you read your own fucking link there, chief?

Was a condescending introduction into his copy-pasted Wikipedia article which was, again, entirely aside from the point.

So what the fuck are you talking about when you say ""He did, you just fail to see it?"""

Personally, i think a mechanic like Aatrox Q could work wonders for him, but he cannot really get rid of any of his skills. W makes him pretty much unkillable though DPS, E+Q are just great waveclear (his strongest point, IMO), and allow him to be a decent support.

And plus, I'm 6'4, I already literally stand out from most everyone else.  Haha I've never been one to slouch over, when I walk I usually tend to look upwards and I tend to smile far more then I frown.  .  In the past 16 or so months I've made a concerted effort to improve on that, before hand I had only gone out on dates with three girls.  As of now that number has quadrupled.  In some aspects I'm happy about it, if I had not taken the initiative and made a 'move' nothing would have ever happened between myself and those girls.  At the same time however I'm really jealous how they and most of the other women my age (21) don't have to make any moves.  For the most part they just get to sit back and enjoy.  From the first move to the last move it seems that its the guy who does all the work.  It just seems that in society (at least American society) its the man's job to 'prove' so to speak that he is worth of the woman's attention.  I personally would much rather be in a woman's position, from my perspective it seems far easier, less stressful and I might even say more fun.  

In the end, I do fake it, I fake it every time I walk out the door.  People have even gone so far as saying that they wish they could have my outlook on life.  The thing is they probably don't, because what I show them is not who I really am and acting the way I have been for the past while as much as it has helped me just doesn't feel right.

I know women have their own problems and I'd be more then happy to hear about them (besides my mom everyone else in my household growing up was a guy) and maybe discuss them.

I automatically put a set amount per check into my Savings account.

I give myself a spending budget where I can do anything I want with it, which is $750 per month. The rest (minus Roth IRA) goes to Savings.

I have four credit cards, one that only pays for Netflix, one that only pays for a couple yearly subscriptions (like 6 or so transactions a year), and two other credit cards that are cash-back/travel. All four credit cards are on Auto-Pay so I don't worry about missing a payment.

My company doesn't have a 401k yet but they will sometime next year and I plan on putting in what they will match before considering putting in more.

My plan right now though is to move out of my parents' early next year, which will be a $700-900/mo expense. Then on top of that are things my parents used to pay for that they won't anymore, like the cell phone, Sunday lunches, a lot of food, and other small things. All in all I expect the move to affect my finances by at least $1000/month. But good news: I'm prepared. I have the basics down, and everything is in place."

Say what you want about O'Brien but he's an unproven HC. He could end up being the next bill belichick or the next josh McDaniels. There's no way of knowing but it'd be stupid to pay him like belichick. 

You also run the risk of setting a dangerous precedent with future contract disputes. If you present yourself as a push over that's what they're going to treat you as.

It's also not like he's being offered peanuts. McNair is not cheap and it's evident by the facilities, and their constant upgrades. 

It sounds to me like O'Brien is trying to up the price by bluffing, but McNair is calling his bluff. 

I mean let's face it, this is where he's probably gonna end up. I might be inclined to throw Detroit as a possible destination but his disabled son shifts the chances heavily into our favor.

I'm sure he's going to shop around and see he's not going to get a marginally better deal anywhere else.

snobord,pics,1388539519.0,"Close, but not quite (at least not Southern Cal). They pretty much offer everyone the same thing depending on BAC, with the cutoff usually at .20 (by statute). Hiring a lawyer generally won't get you a better initial offer. If you're happy with the standard 1st (yes, we even call it that), then save your money and don't hire a lawyer. In all honesty, most times, a lawyer won't be able to get you a better offer unless there's something special about your case. Some people then say ""well, then why would I hire a lawyer if there's nothing special about my case?"" The problem is that most people wouldn't know if there's something special about their case and have to hire a lawyer to find out.

**TL;DR**: hiring a lawyer when your case is a typical case is usually a waste of money but you probably won't know if your case is typical unless you hire a lawyer."

eyememine,detroitlions,1388539601.0,"Raider fan here, let me give you a quick rundown on Cable.

The first year he took over it was as an interim coach after the Kiffin firing. That team sucked so it's hard to judge him on that. The next year he was stuck with JaMarcus and no offensive coordinator. The team seemed to play hard however the lack of offense really killed them. After benching JaWalrus the team played a lot better winning 3 of the last 7 with Gradkowski and Charlie Frye at QB.

2010 rolls around and Hue Jackson is hired as offensive coordinator. The team as a whole looks a lot better, better than they have looked since 2002 the Super Bowl year. They swept the division and lost a couple of heart breakers on the way to an 8-8 year. At that time I was working at a fancy restaurant in SF and while I was deilvering food to a table I heard ""Coach Cable got fired!"" (he wasn't fired, he just wasn't re-signed) and a bunch of dudes really upset. It was Quinton Groves, Jacoby Ford and some other dudes. They seemed to be really upset and had taken a liking to Cable. Word on the street was that Oakland was in a position where they either had to keep Cable or Jackson as Jackson was getting head coaching interest around the league. 

The point is that I don't think he will be as bad as a signing as everyone is thinking. The players loved him (apparent with post game locker room videos and players statements) and he is a good motivator. As long as you get a good O-coordinator to run the offense the team will play hard for him. The domestic violence stuff I cannot comment about."

I believe Cleveland should use their first round draft pick for Gabbert. Use that other pick on Johnny Football. Gabbert's skills will rub off J. Football and groom him accordingly. The Gabbert-Manziel duo will be something to watch for years to come!

Pros:  Very small.  Silver plated pins, top is floating.  Good button.  Stainless steel with durable threads.  It's not the ubiquitous Nemesis clone.

Cons:  No 18350 batteries.  18650 is max size with no room for a kick.  3 section telescopic so it's a bit awkward to adjust.  Stainless steel is not as conductive as brass or copper.

Disclaimer:  It's my first mech.  It's better made than my SVD, but I have no other mechs to compare it to.  I'll have another from fasttech in a week or two, so we'll see how that goes.  Regardless, I love this thing.

American education dictates that 6th grade is partially devoted to geography with an emphasis on locations and cultures of countries around the world. Unless she didn't get that far in school I'm not sure how she has formed the opinion she has. 


All that said this:
&gt;but All 50 of them are still in America, there is still the general overall culture of being American.

Is just wrong. I've lived in Michigan and I've lived in Texas. The two are extremely different and the cultures couldn't be any futher apart. The secondary language in Texas is Spanish and the secondary language in Michigan is Dutch. They don't eat the same food, use the same dialect, have the same education, use the same infrastructure, etc. etc. etc. I'm sure as a Canadian you're aware of vast spaces like you mentioned but to try and insinuate that American states have the same general overall culture is extremely wrong. Certain American states don't even want to be associated with one another. Oregon for example just passed a law that will make higher education free. Vermont just passed the first single payer heath care system. Colorado just legalized marijuana. I could go on and on "

And then they tell you it's all rad, but you're a feminist so it can never happen. That's usually *after* they have sex with you because you don't play hard to get and see no problem with having the sex you both want - which is all right and a sensible and logical approach, but only *before* sex. *After* sex, you're a worthless whore and there must have been something wrong with you if you agreed so fast.

Today I'm taking more boring tests. ""What would you say motivates you to set fires?"" I don't understand. I don't make fire. I make Pretty! I tell the man this. He shakes his head and writes on his gray little clipboard. I start to cry. I want to leave! I want to make the Pretty! Pretty, Pretty, everywhere. On buildings, trees, and people's hair! I'm singing that, and the man writes on his clipboard some more. ""Get them back to their room,"" he says.

I get taken back to lay down again. I try to imagine the Pretty, but I can't do it. I have to see the Pretty.

A Gray Man opens my door early. He tells me, ""There's a woman here who wants to see you."" Who is she? I hope she brought something Pretty.

We go to a new door, one I haven't been to before. The man opens it, and tells me to go in and sit down. I sit on the chair and wait. It's really boring. I pretend my hands are people, and one of them makes the other one Pretty. It runs around, shouting and laughing! It's happy to be Pretty.

An old lady comes in and sits down across the table from me. ""I have other things to do today, so I'm going to make this quick. I'm having you released from this nut house so you can work for me. You can set as many people on fire as you want, and you'll get paid for it."" I ask her if I can make them Pretty instead. ""Oh, yes, you can make them as pretty as you want. You can make everything pretty.""

I clap my hands and laugh! I get to see the Pretty again! I ask her if I can see it right now. She sighs and gives me a little Pretty maker. I flick the rolling thingy, hold my finger on the button, and...

I see it. After a long, long time I see it again. I start crying, and the old lady waves at somebody behind me. ""Get this pyromaniac out of here, I want them sent to the site immediately.""

Pyromaniac. That's what everybody calls me. I don't know why. Maybe it's my name! I like it. I tell her that. She says, ""Fine, all the other idiots are making up names for themselves, you can do what you want.""

I smile and make the Pretty again, and again, and again. A new man grabs me and leads me outside. But I don't care.

tangerinelion,buildapc,1388540604.0,"I'm going to assume you're planning on using Windows.  In that case your question has more to do with how one moves the OS partition to a physically separate drive.

You can backup/restore via 3rd party programs, and you can clone, but typically these are hit-or-miss and may not work perfectly.

Still, if you want to plan on trying that my suggestion is:

1) Using a HDD as the only drive, setup Windows on a 100GB partition.  

2) Once Windows is installed, install your programs as you normally would to the C: partition.  

3) In the partition manager of Windows format the remaining unallocated space in one partition as NTFS, label this D:

4) Install your games on D:, and also store your music/movies/whatever there.

5) When you end up with an SSD, you can clone the 100GB partition over to your SSD using something like g4l or you can try a backup/restore via something like Acronis (I've used Acronis with Win7 and it does work, provided it can find your drives).

6) Unplug the HDD and see if it boots.  If it boots then attach your HDD again, set it up so that your large partition is D: again, and test it out.  The point of booting off the SSD only is to check that the bootloader works.  If it doesn't boot, try using the Windows install DVD and have it check for boot issues.  It will typically reinstall the bootloader and find the copied Windows setup; if that fails you can try again with the command prompt to install the MBR.

7a) If it all works, then you can delete the old Windows partition on your HDD, and expand the large partition so you recover that 100GB.

7b) If it doesn't work, then from Windows on the HDD use the Windows Easy Transfer wizard to create a backup of your account (you can store it on either C: or D:).  Now wipe the SSD and do a fresh install on the SSD.  Once in, use the wizard again to restore your account.  You will have to install lots of your programs again, but at least you get your settings setup right, lots of your programs will have accounts pre-loaded.  Then go to 7a.

8) Now when you boot in with the SSD, go back to the partition manager and expand your SSD's partition to the maximum.  On a 240GB drive this will let you use the other ~140GB, for example.

The only important part here is to ensure that when you first install Windows on the HDD that you put it in a small partition that will fit on your SSD that you get later.  If you're set on a 240+GB drive then you could go to 200GB, for example, but 100GB will work on any 120GB+ drive.  Don't try to go to the limit, since the exact size may be off by a few megabytes and thus can't be bit copied.

BritishyAccent,AskReddit,1388540685.0,"Met her at uni, we were pretty compatible but she was older than me and her friends didn't like me. That sorta covered why it wasn't gonna blossum into a typical partner relationship but if two similar people are around each other enough.. stuff happens.  
I don't remember who made the move first but she sorta went to uni just for the 'uni experience' and seemed to think a FWB relationship was part of the 'uni experience'. I really liked her and we did all the usual relationship stuff but weren't exclusive which kinda hurt. Sometimes it was funny, flirting with waitresses in front of her but it hurt when she travelled and stuff and I couldn't see her or know who she was with.  
Nevertheless, I got a lot of sexual experience, learnt a lot about relationships and how just sex doesn't make a good relationship. Personally i think we could have dated properly but she wasn't really into that idea.  
I guess my advice is go for it if you don't mind potentially losing a friend and if you want to learn about your attitude towards relationships. They are a pretty good idea but its important to remember you aren't exclusive and it is really tough not being jealous.  
Goodluck."

Cykuta,RichardArmitage,1388541241.0,"I'm just back from (a rather sub-par) New Year's Eve party, where *DoS* was a major conversation topic, and a friend of mine said he actually had a problem with Richard because ""he was too pretty! They made all dwarves typical and suddenly you get this one beautiful dwarf!"" And I can understand where he got that gripe from. When pressed, my friend admitted there was no problem with his acting, just his looks: he said, ""I look at him, and he's *prettier than Aragorn! A dwarf!* How does that make sense?!"" :D I had no answer, yet felt curiously good about that critique. :D

Phillip Durrant was amazing partly because, let's be honest, that film was bad. It was a bad adaptation, there were bad decisions all over the script. But Richard, somehow, grabbed me by the hair and forced me to pay attention. That scene when they play charades, where he's sulky and uncooperative and hangs around in the background... by all the gods of heaven and hell I can't even remember any other people in the scene.

Thanks for quoting PJ here, I've never seen that particular opinion. But it's true. Richard can stay perfectly still, not say a word, not make a gesture, and my eyes will be riveted to him, just in case he does. Gods is he addictive."

I draw my line at the capacity of an animal to understand their situation. Ive been on farms, and I can tell you that cows truly do show their low intelligence test results. In my own moral views, no object has more worth than any other, but as it is the nature of life to consume and convert matter, it is far better to sacrifice things that cannot truly understand their own existences. Even if pigs are not at our level of knowledge, there are limits. As such, I would eat most cats and some species of dogs, though I have only had the opportunity to try dog. The other issue I have with some meats is the capacity to spread disease: Human meat, being our own species, can spread disease and infection much more easily. Cooking does not kill every pathogen, and some animals are much more prone to spreading disease as their immunities are more closely related to ours. It is irresponsible to risk introducing new diseases into the species unless necessary.

Of course, these are my views, and I dont believe that I have a right to speak for anyone else."

My manager came up to me a few minutes after he had left and asked me what was going on. I told him that I suspected the man had been using a fraudulent credit card. We had to alert mall security, but they never caught the man.

TL;DR: I'm pretty sure I inadvertently aided an identity thief."

Wolf_Stansson_DDS,AskReddit,1388541712.0,"I don't have a reference or citation, but based on a [fairly conservative estimate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_raising_a_child), they ballpark it to be $100,000 to age 18, per child (roughly $5200 a year, factoring in inflation).  I have seen other estimates as high as $250,000, but since those are typically for a middle-class family, I don't think they're as applicable.  These don't include the cost of college.

It is incredibly unlikely that the average child is going to contribute $100,000 to the family expenses (barring extraordinary entrepreneurial, athletic, or entertainment-based success).  This is why I felt comfortable saying that most will be a net negative."

IeatPI,EDC,1388542068.0,"&gt;genuine hamon line

Hamon lines are visible in a blade that has been differentially heat treated, typically made of homogenous steel. Since this blade looks to be a san-mai construction (three-layer), with Aogami Super as the core, what we're seeing is actually the lamination line between the two metals, with the patina of the carbon steel (it must be laminated between a stainless steel since the outer layer doesn't look to be oxidized in the least bit) adding contrast.

tl;dr: No hamon, which is only visible on differentially heat treated blades

edit: Shoot, I don't know now from looking at the picture. I'm mildly familiar with Hiroaki Ohta's work, and he does both differential heat treating and san-mai work. Pre-laminated billets of Aogami Super (AS) with mild/stainless steel are common for craftsman to purchase and forge for their wares. Differential heat treating a homogeneous (honyaki) blade for a friction folder is really incredible. The more I look at the clouding the more I think it might be a differential heat treat and it's a homogeneous (honyaki) blade, but the line is oddly straight and distinct. If you look at the spine you would be able to tell if it's san-mai or honyaki.

edit 2: From Ford Henry:

&gt; This was the second time that Hiroaki collaborated with Master Takeda and used Takeda’s Hand Forged  Aogami Super Steel  for his blade!  Takeda creates this steel by making a San Mai of Softer Stainless Laminated over a core of Aogami Super Blue Steel with an RC of 63-64. - See more at: http://forthenrycustomknives.com/product/hiroaki-ohta-collab-friction-folder-5/#sthash.c2Ct863Y.dpuf

So I'm assuming that the creation process is that this starts as pre-laminated SUS4xx/AS YSS, heat treated by Takeda, sent to Hiroaki Ohta (or whoever does his grinding, and then sent to him). The billets are generally purchased pre-laminated from a specialty supplier, such as Takefu Specialty Steel Company. Now I can go home!"

Fizjig,AskReddit,1388542433.0,"I fully expect this to get buried under the thousands of other comments.

The exact opposite of what you described applies to me.

I spent 16 years of my adult life working in corporate America. I made better than average money doing anything from paralegal work to Network IT work. I was the prototypical image of that environment when I was in it. 

At one point in time I made 25.00 an hour. Not the highest pay rate, but better than a large majority make. 

The thing is this. I hated my life. I hated my job. I could not stand the people I worked with, or for. For a long time I had convinced myself that the money justified the misery. 

I pissed away so much money on worthless crap trying to fill the gap left by my unhappiness. In the end I had nothing to show for it and I still hated my life.

I know this sounds like some cheesy, self help, infomercial nonsense, but it was my life and I had to do something to change it. 

When I reached a point where I no longer cared what happened I straight up quit. I didn't crap on my boss's desk, or yell F you to anyone. Nothing that dramatic. I just told them I was done and stopped showing up.

It was scary for about ten minutes. Then it was elation. It was a great weight being lifted off of my shoulders. I was now free to pursue any career I wanted.

No more cubicles! 

I had dreamed of a trade skill job. Something creative that allowed me to work with my hands. I settled on leather working. It was a discipline I knew next to nothing about, but I was enthusiastic to learn. 

I took a minimum wage paying job in a leather shop and for once the money just didn't matter. Of course I still had bills piling up, and had to make a lot of sacrifices to stay afloat, but not once was there ever any regret, because I needed the change. My previous life did not work for me. So I simplified. 

I put my head down and jumped in both feet first into learning everything I could about the craft. I never gave a single thought to where I was going with it. It didn't matter. I was finally in an environment that I understood. I was finally creating something useful. 

The first thing I ever made was a crappy leather case with bad stitching for a portable Nintendo system. I still have it and use it, because it's a humbling reminder of how far I've come. 

I still work for that same leather shop. I still make minimum wage. Sure I don't have a big house, fancy car, or the other luxuries I had grown accustomed to. I don't miss any of it. 

I have since made a pretty good supplemental income selling leather cases and things on the side. That keeps me afloat and happy. 

Some things of note you might find interesting.

1. I never finished college and I currently don't hold a degree. A little bit of charisma and a lot of ass kissing will land you 25.00 an hour job regardless of your education. 

2. I got my first high paying tech job at the age of 17. I knew very little about computers at the time, but I realized my employer knew less than me, so I faked it until I learned enough to do my job correctly.

3. 25.00 an hour today is small fries. 25.00 an hour in the 90's was a big deal for someone with very few bills and no family.  

4.  You don't have to get your foot into all the doors. You just have to get your foot in one door and the rest will open on their own.
The trick is making sure they can't shut the door, because you are in the way.

5. Most importantly. The pursuit of money will make  you miserable. Pursue happiness and the money will follow.

Coachskau,WritingPrompts,1388542579.0,"He didn't quite remember how it happened, exactly. He remembered a few things here and there leading up to it, but not the exact point of change.

He stared out at the breathtaking skyline from atop an emerald-grass hill, gold and silver and plastic making a delicate piece of artwork, reflecting in the sun like jewels. Large clouds listed above, forced into their perfect shapes by countless years of total geographic control. The floaters swooped gracefully around buildings, never touching one another.

The people never died. They never got sick, or hurt, or angry, or sad. There was no need for doctors, emergency services, law enforcement, therapists. Hadn't been for countless years.

It was perfect. Unrelentingly, unavoidably...*perfect.*

And he hated it with every fibre of his being. He used to love this world. He used to be like them, completely carefree. But then, somehow, he wasn't. He stopped going to his perfect job, stopped talking to his perfect friends, left his perfect wife. He cut up his body, because he hated its sheer perfection. He wore grungy clothing, strapped a big black-and-white angry mask to his face, and never bathed.

But, perhaps most importantly, he was insane. He killed people, then ate them. He couldn't stand all of these perfect beings around him, so he stabbed them, shot them, gutted them, whatever it took. Then he ate them raw. When he was full, he carved messages of pure hatred into what was left of their skin, then left them there.

Nobody could stop him. But his goal was being accomplished.

He was making this place imperfect. Dead bodies found with their fluids splashed against walls and across the ground tended to cause a bit of a ruckus. When he saw news of a murder having been found to take place, he felt validated.

The world was perfect, but soon its little blemish would grow to a gash that burned across the planet."

artthoumadbrother,AskMen,1388542973.0,"&gt;Of course, but you're thinking women can love. 

And there it is. They're not like us. They're lesser. Certainly women never give their lives for men or waste away over unrequited love. Tell me, when a woman commits suicide because she's finally realized that the man (who has ignored her) that she's loved for years will never love her, is it because he's stopped making her feel good? Was he making her feel good while he ignored her? 

Let me put this another way: Prove to me that men love women, and not just how women make them feel. Then prove to me that women aren't capable of that.

I really am sorry that you've gotten this poison into you. I hope you break out of it. "

I only meant prestigious as compared to, say, Spanish or German or other commonly-studied and similar-to-English languages. And that, only because it's connected with a widely admired culture and is considered to have a beautiful/elegant sound.

But I agree, given that so many people study French, it's not nearly as prestigious as others. I said a bit about this further down but I'm not sober enough to find it.

Put it this way: among the commonly-studied languages in the Anglophone world (being Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese etc), French is definitely the prestige language, followed closely by (or tied with?) Italian. But, in the grand scheme of languages, those which are

a) more difficult / more distanced from English,

b) less commonly studied, 

c) economically pragmatic,

d) associated with admired/interesting/familiar cultures 

are generally regarded as prestigious."

artthoumadbrother,AskMen,1388543361.0,"&gt;Of course, but you're thinking women can love. TRP assumes women don't love men the way men love women. Instead, TRP assumes women love the way men make them feel. Men believe women can love because men experience the love a mother has for them, however, the man will search far and wide for it his whole life, and never find it. The nearest thing he will find is the love of this daughter or son.
A rich woman will want a sexually attractive male, but she has no need to marry him, unless she can gain some sort of benefit from it.
The female, not the male, determines all the conditions of the animal family. Where the female can derive no benefit from association with the male, no such association takes place. — Robert Briffault, The Mothers, Vol. I, p. 191

Persons generally tend to hang around persons in the same social classes as themselves. When I was young, ignorant and on welfare I hung around with likeminded individuals. Back then I could rattle off dozens of 'welfare queens' (or dollbludgers as they are affectionately referred to here). That was the way of life for us as we lived the way we learnt. At first when I started to pull myself up into the next rungs of the societal ladder I began to resent those beneath me and wished they would work to better themselves and society as a whole. I was in favour for drug testing or welfare and the like for instance. It wasn't until I reached (what I perceive as) middle class that I began to appreciate the full benefit of the welfare system, not just for the individuals on it, but for the community as a whole. "

ariven,WTF,1388543771.0,"&gt;  He doesn't call the cops/medics because his dad owns a gun and has told him point blank, ""If anyone tries to come and take me away, it'll be the last thing they do."". The last time they had a blow up about it, he grabbed his gun and locked himself in his bedroom.

Having once been committed to a mental institution and currenting exhibiting mental illness, he may not legally be able to own that gun any more.  Your buddy should call the cops and ask them about it, and if so see if he can either get the gun out while his dad is unaware of him taking it or if the police can help.

Yes, it is a risk that he will react badly if the police show up, but, if he truly has a mental illness, especially having threatened to kill people if they try to help, he really shouldn't have that gun any more.

artthoumadbrother,AskMen,1388543861.0,"Prove something I don't believe to be true? I believe men love women. I've been in love before. Prove to me that men love women, without using your own experiences in love. Do you understand why I am asking you to do this?

You have no evidence that women don't love men the same way women love men. It is a central underpinning of TRP philosophy, but it's based on air. It's based on the idea that women are lesser (because anyone incapable of loving someone for themselves are truly lesser, you don't have to say it, it is just the case.). 

If you can't prove that men love women, without using your own experiences of being in love, then you cannot prove that women don't love men the same way. It's a ridiculous thing to say, and your 'well you prove something random first!' idea is EXACTLY what I expected---because you have nothing. 


If you want to know why I believe what I believe---I'll tell you what got me started thinking this way: 
My mother is a Ph.D'd geochemist working as a university professor. Geology, and geochemistry especially, are incredibly lucrative---if that's what you want. She met my dad after she'd gotten her masters and while she was working on her Ph.D. At the time, he had a bachelor's degree in history, but he was doing fairly low paying construction work. Overtime, his economic prospects didn't get any better. She finished her Ph.D work. They got married. They waited 15 years to have kids, at my father's behest. He raised me and my brother while she worked as a university professor---basically the least lucrative work she could find with her credentials---and because it was what my dad wanted to do. They've recently gotten a boat (43 foot sailboat) with her money, because it was what he wanted to do. Their whole marriage has, essentially, been about what he wants---while she pays for it. Why? She was very attractive when she was younger, she dated several of my fathers friends (including several current millionaires) who were better looking than my dad....so why? What motivated her to do all of this?


She loves the living shit out of my dad. More than my brother. More than me. After they met, she made her entire life about him when, according to your philosophy, she had zero reason to do so. You're wrong. Just so stupidly wrong. "

darthbarracuda,Christianity,1388544243.0,"No, I do not expect every little detail to show itself to me from the get-go. I understand that for such an important topic as this, one would need to spend a lot of time to read through it all. It's like reading a physics textbook; you can't expect to suddenly know *everything* the moment you open the book. That's arbitrary. What *is* arbitrary is that god made an ancient book filled with inconsistencies and confusion. We were just discussing this, whether or not something is literal or allegorical. A physics textbook doesn't tell you on one page that D=M/V and on the next that D=V/M. Likewise, it doesn't tell us things that contradict known science. It doesn't say that ""gravity"" doesn't exist, even though we know it to be. If the book said that, we wouldn't just say that it was ""allegorical"". We'd say the book is bullshit and deserves to be thrown into a fire.

Concerning Sims: How is that any different from the god you believe in? You believe in the Bible, you ""accept"" Jesus into your ""heart"", hoping to get into heaven and not suffer in Hell. True, we have ""free will"", but how free *is* it when the punishment is clearly visible. It's pretty much forcing you into submission to god. God is poking you with the spear, telling you that you *technically* have free will but insisting that if you don't keep walking he'll stab you in the back. How free are you really? Without the threat of Hell, there's really no incentive to follow god, to accept Jesus. Why should I waste my time when there's no punishment? And god seems like a total cosmic douche when it comes to being a ""great, smart, kind god."" Accept me, or die. I said it before and I'll say it again: he gave us ""free will"" and then gets mad at us for disobeying him.

If he had designed the world to be like Sims, it would work out a lot better for his purposes. In fact, there's no good reason why he even gave us a consciousness or free will if he's just going to get pissed when we disobey him using the rational minds he gave us!

Azhain,offbeat,1388544398.0,"Actually, if I remember correctly it isn't law per se, it's a precedent legal ruling on a trademark case. Which means that if you want to change this particular 'law' it's going to involve taking to court an actual real world case, this case would require that a company fail to protect it's trademark, and then later try to defend  it.  Because the precedent already exists, that means any company worth their weight in salt is going to try to avoid being the new test case for this particular problem.  
  
I actually think that the problem isn't necessarily that companies have to defend their trademark in order to keep it, but that there aren't really very clear guide lines on when it is appropriate to act in the defense of your trademark and what kind of response you should use.  This means that some companies are going to be on the paranoid side and be overly agressive just to be safe.

What do I find interesting about Australia?  Well, I've never been there, but I've seen some pictures/media/movies about the place.  I'm a diver, so the reef and ocean life is particularly appealing to me.  I also like the unique varieties of animals that aren't found anywhere else in the world, not least among them the kangaroo and koala.  I find your aboriginal culture and symbolism to be fascinating, and somewhat mystical.  And then there's the rough, untamed beauty of the deep outback that I find particularly attractive - but mainly as an idea.  I'm pretty sure that even though I'm fairly competent in our bush here in Canada, I'd probably be dead inside a couple of hours out there in your bush without a knowledgeable guide.

It's funny.  Seems like maybe we're both suffering from the 'grass is greener on the other side of the fence' syndrome.  Maybe it's a good time to stop where we are and look around a bit closer.  Might find beauty in unexpected places.

They were not locals, turned out to be from Chicago. I honestly think I rang up real-life 'Married to the Mob' women. Also, LaToya Jackson came into the store once to buy a patio set with her scheevie manager/husband. She was done up to the nines, as you would expect and was very soft-spoken and mild-mannered. When she got to the check-out to pay, she whipped out a credit card, which was declined. She ended up laying down about 5 credit cards to purchase the patio set, all of which were declined.

bunker_man,getting_over_it,1388544514.0,"&gt; For me, all this the pain and misery seemed to (almost magically) go away (and never come back) when I did some totally unrelated-seeming things: 1) quit a job I hated, and 2) changed my diet to address stomach aches: cutting out gluten and forcing myself to be healthy generally.

Well, I can't say I have a job or school I hate. If anything it's the other way around. I was fine at school, but now am not even sure I should go this semester, since I'm not sure I could handle it in my current state. (Unless it hopefully improves at least a little bit.)

Ironically, I started eating a lot healthier and even slowly took up exercising at the beginning of this year. So if anything, I should feel better already if those were the issues.

But that's the thing. There's plenty of things in my life that I'd in theory like doing. But in the state my teeth have reduced me to, especially in the last slightly over a week, I barely retain any enjoyment out of any of them. I'm going to a party tonight that in a regular state I'd have really enjoyed. For how I am now, I barely even decided to go, and only did, since I feel like not going would be like capitulating to the depression. I had barely any worries Slightly over a month ago. So I don't think it COULD be anything else. It's just that my teeth acting up changed me overnight. And after a few weeks of that generated a depression that I feel trapped by as if it were inescapable.

But yeah. I can understand why teeth are linked to anxiety. Everything else is more steps removed. Teeth on the other hand are stuck to your face. So however they are is however they are and you can never escape them. I can only imagine how people managed to deal with them in the time before there were dentists."

derleth,TumblrInAction,1388544788.0,"I notice they have 'allistic' on their page. [Here's what it means](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Citations:allistic):

&gt; (neologism) nonautistic

""Neologism"" means ""recently created""; all words were neologisms once, so that isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, the world already has a word which means ""not autistic"": ""Neurotypical."" Most people aren't autistic, so if you're not, you're typical. There's no judgment attached to that unless you're a SJW loser.

I will admit that ""allistic"" is shorter and easier to say, but ""neurotypical"" is more self-explanatory and doesn't come from Tumblr, so it's got a couple advantages right there. Also, speaking in terms of ""typical"" and ""atypical"" is a step up from saying that certain things are necessarily diseases: There's an autism spectrum (which has subsumed Asperger's in the latest DSM, but that's a yak for another day, schmendrick) and it's possible to be on it without needing much in the way of special treatment. (Like me, BTW.) Even though there is no absolutely typical individual, there's a range of 'being typical' which shades into 'being atypical', and it's nice when people acknowledge that even if you're different from most in some ways, you're otherwise pretty much like most people.

OTOH, 'allism' doesn't lend itself to the spectrum model as well. It's another oversimplified Tumblr category, where you're either autistic or allistic and never the twain shall meet. It just isn't how the world works. Brains are more complex than that.

Also, if you search for 'allistic' you get [stuff like this](http://www.fysh.org/~zefram/allism/allism_intro.txt), which describes allism as a disease. It's pretty funny to me, but it is a bit precious and pretty much just a big in-joke. And do we really want a word which lends itself to dumb in-jokes?

OK, OK: Allism it is."

Rodalli,AskMen,1388544793.0,"Inordinate amounts of messiness. Allow me to provide some examples.

I was once into this really nerdy chick in college. She was smart, funny, cute as a button, played video games, totally my type. Then I visited her apartment one night and what. the. fuck. Right when I walk in the door, there's a full bag of trash sitting in the middle of her kitchen floor, leaking I-don't-know-what-the-fuck all over the floor. She walked right past it. Shit just strewn all over the place. Her living room look like a daycare had exploded in it. Bean bags, and stuffed animals and blankets and random shit everywhere. She had the tiniest bed known to man, and expected me to spend the night with her in it. I didn't sleep a wink because I was spending 90% of my time trying to keep myself from falling off the side. I left the next morning, didn't stay for breakfast or anything. Broke things off with her a day or two later. No thanks.

Similar situation just this past year. I met this seemingly cool lass on OkCupid. Once again, cute, nerdy, petite, just my type. I had already graduated and had been in the workforce for almost 3 years, she was just finishing up a degree in anthropology. She lived near campus in a small apartment by herself, so I wasn't expecting anything fancy. I was totally ready to walk into her place and see something very humble. She tells me she has 3 cats and a small dog, and I start to worry...how the hell can 3 cats, a dog and a human live in a small 1-bedroom apartment. Spoiler alert: they fucking can't. I walk in and the place reeks of cat piss. I mean the smell of ammonia hits me like a hammer in the face. Right off, I notice this girl has way too much shit for someone in her living situation. There is just random crap everywhere. On the walls, the floor, shelves, all over her ""dining table"", which just seemed to be a storage table. There's a giant ""self-cleaning"" litterbox under said table that obviously hasn't had any attention in at least 2 or 3 days. I use her bathroom, and yep, it's a sty. The sink is covered in dust, and dander and soap. The bathtub hasn't been cleaned in months. Now that I think about it, I think the girl may have been a stage 1 hoarder, or something? Like what hoarders are like when they're young, quasi-normal people. The 3 cats was probably a red flag. On top of all this a day or two alter I discovered she has halitosis (breath was a little off that night, but was even hotter the next two times I saw her). Ended that one as quickly and delicately as I could.

IndieLady,AskReddit,1388544893.0,"That's not necessarily true. In communities such as Two Times, there seems to be quite a clear understanding of what kind of content requires a trigger warning.

It is content that is graphic or descriptive, content that is victim-blaming, content that uses language that marginalises or demeans a group within that context of that trauma, graphic images or video. In short, it's when people go into graphic detail about a graphic incident.

Can trigger warnings always be trusted? No. Can they be a helpful guide to assist someone in negotiating content? Yes. They can be very helpful. Just because you don't find them helpful doesn't mean other people don't."

TheCarpetPissers,sex,1388544921.0,"Once a girl showed up at my house wearing nothing but panty hose/garter and a long coat.  That was awesome.

I had a girlfriend recently who had a habit of waking me up with head.  She also would sometimes be waiting on her knees when I got home from work.  She also liked giving me road head and did it fairly regularly.   Another couple of times I came home and she was naked in bed, in doggy style position. 

There was that one chick I was hooking up with who came over to my old house to go swimming.  She went to the bathroom but hadn't come back outside in like 15 minutes.  I went into my bedroom to see what was going on and she was 69ing with her girlfriend.   That was fun.

There was the raver chick who liked it rough.   Like, draw blood rough.  I ended up giving her a black eye that night after she slapped me while riding my cock and called me a pussy.  She loved it.

There was this other raver chick who orgasmed so hard she fainted.  There was ecstasy involved.  That was a fun night.  We were having sex with a glow in the dark condom while rolling.  Watching it dissappear/reappear in the mirror was awesome.

There was the cougar who let me do her in the butt first time together.   That was awesome.

And the other cougar who invited her other cougar friend to the bar with us. After a pitcher or two her friend started grabbing my dick under the table.  Cougar 1 pretended loke she didn't notice for a while and then ""busted us"".  She acted mad for about 30 seconds before transitioning to both of them grabbing my junk.   We all had fun that night.

TheDarkHorse83,AskMen,1388544979.0,"I took yoga classes for a year, some time ago. When I started in class I felt uncomfortable, yoga had always been billed as a woman's activity. The commercials of female yoga classes, TV shows with women doing yoga classes together, and even when I started it was an all female class with a female instructor. The only saving grace was that I was 22 in a class of women mid-30s +. We were so different in age that I didn't feel too creepy about it, but I would never haven taken the class that my college, which I was attending at the time, offered. 

Advertisements for women-only gyms, tv shows, and the way my female friends seem to talk about guys at the gym I feel like a creep anytime that I get close to a woman. For a while there I was a regular. Actually over the course of time I was a regular at my college gym, the YMCA, the gym at work, planet fitness, and a martial arts gym, no more than two at a time. I made a number of male friends that were also regulars, the only woman that I had become familiar with was from the martial arts studio, I felt like I'd be considered a potential attacker in any other scenario. Ironically, in the matial arts studio I actually did play attacker for her a number of times. (As I did for everyone else in class.)"

Why are you so sensitive about misogyny? Is it because you have a hard time embracing your subconscious craving for dicks in your mouth?

&gt; It's just like 9/11. The fact that a couple of guys with blades managed to take over full planes and kill everyone on board without being overpowered is disgusting and shameful, and everyone on board who sat in their seats, crying, praying or just waiting for someone else to save them are as bad as the terrorists themselves.

That's just amazing.  These are burning questions I have for assholes like you that use the internet as their own personal thought dumpster, do you ever just stop and self reflect on how shitty you are?  What can one really expect from a genuine turd of a human being that holds the opinion that the terrified people on a hijacked 9/11 plane were just being pussies.  How does one ever explain something logically to the awful mind that generates that unthinking bile?

&gt;Alcohol­ is not digested upon absorption, nor chemically changed in the bloodstream. As the blood goes through the lungs, some of the alcohol moves across the membranes of the lung's air sacs (alveoli) into the air, because alcohol will evaporate from a solution -- that is, it is volatile.

This IS closer to a free market system the way econ 101 describes because you're not dealing as much with super powerful corporations with high bargaining power. You also may be dealing with more informed consumers. Which addresses SOME of my complaints on the marketing side, although if you look at say, the employment side, it's not that great. There's a lot of employment scams out there, which is why I rarely touch craigslist as a job site. You REALLY need to be on the lookout for scams on a lot of sites. A lot of the legitimate online work opportunities are either highly specialized or pay very poorly compared to offline work. And let's not get into the tulip fever that is the bitcoin and other similar currencies. While I am generally against regulation of the internet, I wouldn't necessarily say that a lot of the deals you can get on there are applicable to real life. The people on average seem less informed, everything is a lot more oligopolic in a lot of cases, and as I said, while the selling side is good, the employment side is tricky, and that's where a lot of my concerns are oriented."

evilbrent,fatlogic,1388545981.0,"Basically what she's trying to say is that her weight problems aren't due to accidentally having oversized portions. She's admitting that the gastric bypass surgery won't fix the emotional problems that cause her to overeat in the first place. It's a well known occurrence that people who emotionally eat will find a way to do it even with the surgery.

We've discussed getting surgery for my wife if we could afford it. Thing is that she actually has good portion control and cooks nutritional and cheap food for the family seven days a week (really). But she just sabotages herself between meals. Whereas the surgery would probably help me because my problem IS serving size. Whenever I go out to eat or go to eat with friends and family I use the ten minute rule: it takes ten minutes for the message that you're full to reach your brain so I cram as much eating as I can into the ten minute window after my first two plates of food.

Anyway, it's kind of dumb for this woman to blame the surgery for her problems, but in a way she's right that you have to fix your head before fixing your body."

I admit the system needs reform. A lot of those arguments are arguments against our current system, not government intervention altogether. Quite frankly, I'd like to replace our current system with universal basic income.

Also, minimum wage also ensures a minimum standard of living. Without it there's no telling how low we can go. I do think with UBI we can later evaluate the wage to determine whether it's worth keeping or not. It might be, it might not. I wouldn't get rid of it at the same time as passing UBI, but I wouldn't be against repealing it if we get a system up and running like UBI and then can evaluate the consequences."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388546270.0,"That's a very one sided view of history. It's called the gilded age for a reason. I suggest you look up what gilded actually means. It means it was covered in a thin layer of gold on the outside, while being rotten within. This libertarian cherrypicking of history is laughable. Yes, it was a period of economic growth, but below that thin veneer is a mess of poverty and corruption. You can talk about the new york skyline, but you forget about the ghettos. There's a reason those ""captains of industry"" were seen by some as ""robber barons.""

In other words, your view of history is very one sided. You romanticize a time period in which you apparently know little about."

[Galciv 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/202200/) is probably still the best turn based 4x that isn't Master of Orion 2. The tech tree is neat, the different win conditions are all fleshed out and engaging. The resource/starbase mechanic adds a ton of extra dimensions. It's getting a bit old at this point, but still a strong recommendation. The only real downside I can think of is that the combat itself is totally noninteractive. (50% off, but I've seen it on flash sales)

[AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400/) is realtime, and a lot of fun. It's pretty much solely singleplayer/co-op, and I really like the way they use asymetric sides to force the player to think strategically. There's a bit of a tower defense element as well, but the really neat thing is that you have to actually think carefully about what systems and objectives you take. Too little and you aren't strong enough to kill the AI homeworld. Too much, and you provoke the AI into killing you off before you're ready. (75% off all sale)

[Star Rule](http://store.steampowered.com/app/70900/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1) has one of my favorite ship design systems, especially once you include mods, but the rest of the game is a bit unremarkable. (70% off)"

hotbox4u,Planetside,1388546424.0,"&gt; It's just sad that air to air game play has degraded in to this mess. I really hope something gets changed before every good pilot has quit the game or stopped flying.

Actually, i say let them go. If this is not the game they want to play, well fine with me, im sorry for them but this constant complaining is really annoying. Lots of people fly around, most of them are scrubs like me in the air, i like to fly and shoot rockets and then i explode. 

What is gamebreaking about this video or this rockets? It would be if just one empire had them. If two good pilots go at it with A2A loadouts they have equal chances. Nothing in this video was game breaking.

They do harm to to new pilots? The way it *was* did lots of harm to new pilots. 

If a well certed ESF pilot, with BR100 and lots of experience in A2A combat brings havoc over people with less certs and experience then this is fine with me.

Do you also complain when you get stomped by a max level character will all epic gear in another game? No, you suck it up because you know he invested a lot of time in this character and you can get on his level when you do it as well.

tangerinelion,Coffee,1388546676.0,"Generally coffee will taste better if you increase the ratio of grounds. 

For a FP, I typically use 17g of coffee to 260g of water for 4 minutes.  The grind matters, I go as fine as I can without getting a lot of silt.  Only a couple grounds get in the cup.

Now here's the fun part: The density of beans changes as you increase the roast level.  A dark roast needs more beans to reach 17g than a light roast.  I would pickup a relatively inexpensive scale, something that can weigh your grinder + beans, and then your FP.  

On measuring water by mass: The density of water changes with temperature, by a couple percent.  If you use 260g of water you'll have 260mL at room temperature, but more like 270-275mL at boiling; moreover, if you need more or less coffee than your last batch the volume of grounds changes which changes where you would stop filling on your FP.  It's not a huge effect, but I like being able to reproduce it and not have to worry when switching beans."

But again, I don't have contractions

However, I have had non-orgasm contractions.  Sometimes when I'm thinking about something arousing, I get these little mini contractions.  But I'm not masturbating or having sex, I'm literally just thinking about something and I get these mini contractions that last for 1-3 seconds, like butterflies in my stomach only...in my vaginal walls.  Lol.  Pretty sure it's not an orgasm, or at least not a noteworthy one.  The ""good feeling"" without contractions that I get from masturbation feels better tbh.

Nausved,DebateAnAtheist,1388546931.0,"That comment wasn't pointed at you specifically, but at people in general who make positive claims about the world (even if that claim is that X does not exist) that they either will not or cannot defend. If you (the general ""you"", not the specific ""you"") have a reason to support an opinion, why not explain that reason and put it to the test? And if you don't have a reason, why do you hold that opinion at all?

When a large proportion of atheists claim not God does not exist, but then refuse to offer a good explanation for that opinion, it looks an awful lot like they *don't* have a good explanation—that they're just going on faith rather than reason. That reflects very poorly on atheists and, speaking as a life-long strong atheist, I resent that.

I do not know what *your* particular feelings or behaviors are. That's not my focus here. Instead, I am arguing against the notion that atheists—specifically, atheists who think there is no god (agnostics are off the hook)—do not have a burden of proof. 

*All* claims carry a burden of proof, even if that proof is hard to provide. If there is no proof/evidence for an opinion someone holds (even if that's because no such proof/evidence can possibly be provided), that person has no business holding that opinion—unless they're willing to embrace faith-based thinking, in which case they have no justification for attacking anyone else's random faith-based thoughts."

&gt; there isn't 'one' but there are definitely some and they are worth searching for rather than settling for the nearest person you **can** compromise with.

Weaponized whips, apparently, are capable of cutting off smaller limbs and breaking bones. It's actually a clever weapon to use against a gorilla if you have the skill, because it's a fast ranged weapon that's almost guaranteed to do damage and can be really precise. The demonstration dude could whip about twice every three seconds and was precise up to about twenty feet.

The more I think about it, the more I like it versus the gorilla. With the same level of skill as the guy I saw, you can reasonably expect to hit a body region of choice, like the neck/head area. With the range, you could feasible hit it two-three times. And we're talking about enough force to break a jaw or concuss the animal in the head, or just bust its neck open.

My local Barnes &amp; Noble had a Doctor Who-themed night for the 50th Anniversary (costume contest, life-sized daleks you can crawl inside, etc.). My younger sister (14 years old) was meeting a few of her new friends there, and she didn't have a ride, so I was ""volunteered"" to drive her.

During the 2-ish hour ordeal, there were so many shrieking pre-teens *running* through the whole damn place, practically tearing it up and knocking books off the shelves.

I managed to get away from all of that by heading to the History Books section (a lot of interesting books on JFK), but B&amp;N had a 'scavenger hunt,' sending the aforementioned shriekers throughout the store.

professor__doom,AskEngineers,1388547246.0,"&gt;  Get in a 1957 Chevy, and drive it across the country. Have your friend get in the 2014 Caprice, and attempt the same thing. Who's going to get there faster, and with what level of fatigue? Who's going to be able to maintain the higher speed, and use less fuel? 

Pretty much anything that goes wrong on a '57 Chevy can be fixed by a 17-year-old with a socket set for $50 or less in parts over the course of an afternoon.  Many problems with newer cars seem to require a Masters in Electrical Engineering (or at least a factory-trained specialist), specialized (and expensive) tools, and expensive proprietary components.  

One absurdity I'll never understand is the sealed ball joints in today's tie rods and control arms.  In the old days, you'd grease them at every oil change and not need to replace them for at least 20 years.  Today they're non-greasable, saving you a whopping five minutes every oil change.  Good luck getting more than a few years before they start groaning and creaking--within 10 years, they're done entirely.  The sealed joints can't possibly save the manufacturer more than 5 bucks.  

Aftermarket replacements from high-end manufacturers like Moog are designed the old-fashioned way: with Zerk fittings to receive fresh grease every oil change.

The purchase price of a new car, compared to the median wage, is also much higher than it was back then.

My father's first car, which he purchased in 1969 with savings from two summers working at minimum wage, was only two years old.  Owning ANY car on that sort of budget is impossible today.  It did need repair work more frequently than anything you'd purchase today, but he was able to do 100% of it himself on a tiny budget, with no special tools, no ""we have to ship that part from the factory overseas,"" and no real training.  I'll take that over the alternative any day."

KapitanFutball,explainlikeimfive,1388547827.0,"This is because of 'conditioned/unconditioned responses'.  When you smell something new/distinct, your brain links it to that person/thing/event/emotion/reaction.  
So naturally, when you smell the same scent again (even in a different setting), your brain elicits that same memory and/or initial reaction along with it.

Example:  John finally gets a date to the prom.  Her name is Sally.  He has had a crush on her forever.  Right as they start dancing for the first time, John feels those jittery butterflies in his stomach (he has yet to get laid, so naturally he's excited/nervous at the same time).  At the same time, he catches a big whiff of her perfume.
Five years later, he's in a grocery store buying apples.  A lady who is, unbeknownst to John, wearing the same perfume that Sally was during prom walks by.  He catches another big whiff of it and is reminded of that lovely night with Sally and again feels that jittery feeling in his stomach.

Hope this makes sense!

* I got a coffee, but he got an herbal tea because he kept his body ""pure"" 
...so I assumed he was a health nut. 
* Then he noticed my necklace (Thor's Hammer, because I liked it) and said something about the Norse.  Sure, Vikings are cool. Okay, maybe he's trying to appear to be a comic book nerd.  

I only went through with the full 2 hours because it was a comedy of horror and I wanted to see what happened next. So, for two hours, this idiot is dropping clumsy hints and I was missing them altogether. 

Big reveal was when he asked me for a second date and I declined. 
He told me he was something of a celebrity and a big deal in the area, and I would be missing out if I left. Then he told me why he was a celebrity.

afishisborn,AskReddit,1388548166.0,"I think the major difference between simple shyness and social anxiety is in physical symptoms.

It becomes a disorder when it interferes with your daily living. For instance, I suffer from some mild social anxiety, but it generally doesn't keep me from living my life. I suck it up, so to speak. The fact that I can do so disqualifies it from being a disorder. Not everyone is so lucky. Panic attacks can be paralyzing, and some people experience them on the regular. Anxiety disorders are not new; they can apply to any number of things, like heights, spiders, or clowns.

All that being said, people who self-diagnose themselves tend to be wrong. It's just like when people claim to have ADD or obsessive-compulsive disorder; it diminishes public perception of the actual disorder by trivializing it among the general populace, which is unfortunate.

In short, most of the people who claim to have social anxiety disorder are probably just shy, but for some people, it truly is a crippling reality."

Corbenik,relationship_advice,1388548242.0,"Explain to him that it's hurting you. Which, from your post, it clearly is. Pay attention to how he responds.

To be frank, you're probably right. I'm a pessimist, so take this with a very heavy amount of salt, but it sounds like he likes her. This fundamentally fractures the relationship. If you were to ask him to spend less time with her, he'd take it as a lack of trust. 

If you still want to keep a relationship, which I'd assume that you do, you need to explain to him how inadequate that makes you feel. Not that you think he's going to cheat, but that the things that he says off-hand are actively hurting you. Get him to teach you about his hobbies, just the two of you. Teach him about yours. Don't stop him from talking to her or spending time with her, but ask him to tone it down.

If he laughs it off and keeps doing it, you've got a major problem in your relationship. If he doesn't at least try to make you think that he loves you more than anyone, you've got a major problem in your relationship.

So yeah, talk to him about. Don't let him avoid it or dismiss it. Explain how important this it to you.

My final suggestion is to approach this as clinically as possible. I'm not trying to offend you when I say that you could be seriously overinflating a small issue. It happens in relationships the time, by both genders. Approach it like a math problem. My best friend is a beautiful women who shares my hobbies, and I've never had any romantic interest in her.

Yes, there is such a thing as a mild person being wild in bed (or vice versa), but I have not personally experienced somebody who is generous in daily life and selfish in bed.

If she cares about you and is attracted to you, her behavior in the bedroom would be quite different to your description. It honestly sounds like she is only putting up with you. Sorry if that is harsh, but there are other women out there who would be happy to be more generous in bed if you are willing to put in the work to find them.

And as a sad last note, the kind of person you describe is the kind that will end up confessing someday that she cheated with some guy who absolutely dominated her in bed and will lie through her teeth trying to convince you that she didn't love every second of it. She has tried to instruct you on how she wants to be handled and it didn't work. She doesn't understand herself what she wants.

professor__doom,AskEngineers,1388548431.0,"&gt; Regarding the comfort of a trip

A lot of the difference lies in gas-charged shock absorbers, which [hit the consumer market in the 1980s but were invented much earlier](http://www.tirereview.com/Article/98307/the_advantages_of_twintube_shocks.aspx).  Sway bars, now universal, were only found on sports and luxury cars back then.

You also have to compare apples-to-apples.  A 1957 car with brand-new suspension components (even ones built to 1957 specs) will ride much better than components with 60 years of wear.

*Off-topic but important: I read once that a survey of junkyards revealed that 87% of vehicles still have the original shocks.  I can't begin to say how stupid this is.  The fluid loses its viscosity very quickly and the gas charge escapes--most manufacturers suggest changing shocks every 50,000 miles.  It's not just a matter of driver comfort; it's a SAFETY issue.  Bad shocks mean bad cornering, [loss of road contact](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Q1XAgHsz8&amp;hd=1), and [increased stopping distance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoBf45J3s6c&amp;hd=1).

Coachskau,WritingPrompts,1388548484.0,"The little girl lay still under her blanket. The monster under her bed could get her at any moment. She imagined giant arms reaching up around her mattress and grabbing her. She shivered and pulled the covers higher.

Nothing happened, though. She let the blanket drop a little, and looked around for what may have been the 1000th time that night, straining to see some kind of movement.

Her closet door creaked, just barely. She may not have even heard it if she wasn't trying so hard to be quiet. She stopped breathing. She listened harder, staring at the door. There it was again! The door creaked a bit louder this time, and she thought she saw it move.

The little girl couldn't move. Her little knuckles were bone-white, gripping her blanket so hard her hands hurt. The door was now creaking more and more. It was opening. Something was in her closet. She'd been afraid of the wrong the thing this whole time! She started crying silently, hoping whatever it was wouldn't know she was there.

A dark shape started oozing from the blackness behind her closet door, untouched by her night light. It crept along the wall, in front of her window. It blocked out the moonlight that had been pouring in. The little girl made a meek, fearful yelp. The monster loomed closer. It was so close, she could smell it. It smelled rotten and terrifying.

A massive groaning noise emanated from underneath her bed, and a bright red light spilled from it as well, bathing the room in a bloody hue. Two massive, burning red arms stretched from either side of her bed, and one reached for the pitch black beast.

It attempted to dodge, diving for her closet door, but the other arm slammed it shut. The monster screamed, then jumped across the room at the girl. Both arms whipped toward it impossibly fast, and the groaning returned, louder and deeper. Her room shook from the massive noise.

The arms started pulling the monster in two directions, while the groaning intensified. The monster screamed, but it was drowned out by the groaning from beneath the bed. The arms pulled harder and harder, and with one final tug, the monster ripped in half, then dissipated into puffs of black smoke.

The little girl stared at the arms, eyes wide as saucers. The left arm patted her head as the right tucked her in. The monster under her bed groaned softly, then retracted its arms as the red light slowly dimmed.

Despite all that had happened, she felt her eyelids growing heavy, and she drifted off into a very restful sleep, dreaming of friendly beasts and red lights."

eithris,AskReddit,1388548524.0,"who the fuck are you to judge man? some people enjoy the challenge of retail, the chaos and the exposure to new people and the nature of the job keeps it from being routine.

how much profit did mcdonalds rake in for 2013? what about walmart, target, or best buy?

i'll grant you that people on the bottom aren't working smart. if they were smart, the fast food strike that i'm not hearing about on the news anymore would have been a nationwide ""stay at home if you're minimum wage"" day.

the problem is that when you're at the bottom like that, the simple challenge of surviving from paycheck to paycheck, usually across multiple jobs, means you don't have time to organize. i was amazed that as many people went on strike recently. when i made minimum wage, i couldn't afford to go on strike. i couldn't afford to miss a single hour of work, let alone risk my job by not showing up.

i have a fairly easy job now, at 10 bucks an hour. i'm literally the only one among all my friends who isn't at minimum wage though. this job fell in my lap like a gift from god, and saved my life. i hope i can help some of my friends when i get closer to being debt free. you talk about people being ""stuck"" in jobs like that, but you have no idea how ""stuck"" you can get when you're living paycheck to paycheck, skimping on your own food to feed your kids because you make too much money to qualify for any kind of assistance but not enough to get ahead. there's a dead zone between qualifying for those programs, and actually making enough money, and that dead zone keeps growing and growing as basic things get more expensive.

my brother got a letter last month saying that he has to get health care by jan. 1st or he'll be fined 2500 bucks and it'll get added to his taxes. there goes his tax return. which is how every minimum wage worker i ever met even survives. you get farther and farther into debt as the year goes by, praying that you can get caught up at tax time. my brother can't afford even the cheapest of the health care plans. his wife left him and took the kids, and even though she's a junkie and her family is a junkie he lost in court and after child support he's stuck living off less than 300 bucks a month. health care? what the fuck do you mean health care? state and federal assistance doesn't give a damn that most of his money gets ganked for child support, so assistance eligibility is still based off his gross pay. with less than 300 a month he can't afford rent, let alone utilities, even though he walks to work. forget about luxury items like healthy food. affording health care is an entire universe away.

yet his shitty employer can get away with using loopholes in obamacare to cut the number of employees and hours and keep from having to pay anything, and every employer in town is doing the same thing. sure he could move, but how? if he misses work to look for a job somewhere else, he'll be short on child support and go to jail, lose both jobs and his driver's license before he gets out, and then be even MORE fucked with job prospects.


minimum wage is not enough. this is a FACT. the very fact that people survive on it is a stunning example of human resilience and toughness and ingenuity(and most minimum wage people i know deal drugs to cover bills, i did, and all my friends did or do. you get hungry enough and silly things like legality go out the window).


minimum wage has not kept up with inflation, it's nowhere near the level it should be, adjusted for inflation from the time it was put it place. minimum wage would be closer to 14 bucks an hour or more if it was. and businesses could afford to pay it. walmart and mcdonalds and these factories. and anyone who screams about the risk of american jobs going overseas, the solution to that is simple. import taxes and tarrifs. slap a fee on anything coming into this country. that cost will get passed onto the consumer, and american made goods will be competitive again.


but the government will never do this. the liberals would rather just give out welfare and the conservatives would an hero if they were forced to pay a fair wage to the peons."

somethingelse19,TalesFromRetail,1388548585.0,"YES!

I had a woman come in who wanted a certain item in a certain size. She was in a hurry, gave me her name and asked me to put items on hold for her. She wanted everything we had in that particular size, in every color and style. In fact, I remember her name a year later, it was Dawn. The next day, I did not work at the time she came in but my manager helped her. My manager, found that we didn't have any of what Dawn wanted in stock, proceeded to order EVERYTHING for her (even though she even told me she checked our inventory computer system and it showed in stock). She ended up getting the sale AND commission on it. A sale worth $2,500!!! What upsets me so much is she was so cavalier about it and was all ""LOL OH YEAH SHE CAME IN AND ORDERED EVERYTHING!!! LOL :SMILES: SHE SAID SHE HAD THINGS ON HOLD BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY IT WAS YOU! LOL I'M THE MANAGER AND POLICY STATES I CAN TAKE ANYONES SALES"" Um no. Actually policy states that sales cannot be taken if a previous associate has already shopped for a client; regardless if you are manager or not, sale goes to the original associate. 

I was PISSED. What made me so angry especially is that as a manager, her salary starts at $60,000. she is single, no children, not married and lives in a condo her parents paid for. I was living on my own (before i had roommates) and this would've made my sales for the week! she couldn't understand at all.

eta: i actually had petty revenge on her. i ended up ordering some items online that were from that particular department and then went back in store to return all on one day. i did it on a holiday when I knew that the sales would be high as well as the sales goal. I did it an hour before closing. Bad enough to harm the manager but none of the associates income."

RichardBehiel,spacex,1388548867.0,"&gt; The real advantage is that it is far less likely to clog up the engine, making maintenance between flights far easier for a reusable vehicle. 

There's an interesting study out there which compares kerosene and methane
 as fuels for reusable liquid booster stages.  


""The study
showed that the advantage of the higher energetic
content of methane was counterbalanced by an
increased motor mass and an increased booster size,
hence higher aerodynamic drag and increased mass.
The payload performances of the reusable kerosene and
methane booster are therefore almost identical with
some edge for kerosene. In view of the increased size
and dry mass of a reusable methane booster stage, one
can expect a cost disadvantage for CH4 from a launch
vehicle system level point of view.

However, if significantly lower operational and
maintenance expenses of the reusable methane rocket
engine are achievable, a methane powered fly-back
booster could get competitive in comparison to a
kerosene powered solution""

Many of my friends have been raped, and i know you can't always just ""pull yourself up by the boot straps"". But time can help a little. You've made it another year. And you can make it another after this one. You're really down this new year, so make a resolution to try to enjoy this year and be ready to celebrate come December 31, 2014.

lumpking69,videos,1388549509.0,"No Insurance here! I got into a car accident with a coworker. The car was t-bones and totaled. I bumped my head on fuck knows what and the driver had a sore shoulder. This happened very close to the office, so everyone poured out to enjoy the show. The pain all but vanished by the time everyone made it outside so I was 99% sure that I was fine. But all the girls at work worked me up into a concussion-sleep-death frenzy and insisted I got to the hospital. So I did and jumped in the ambo.

They looked me over and told me to have a seat. We drove to the hospital. They gave me a room fairly quickly but I waited 2 hours to be seen. A doctor came in and asked me a couple of questions, rubbed my head a little bit and offered me a Tylenol (which I declined, no pain). No tests, no xrays, nothing. He just rubbed my head. Anywho, he said I would be ready to go in just a couple of minutes. Another 2 hours pass and they set me free with my plastic bracelet. 

A couple of days later I get the bill. The ambulance ride cost me a cool $550 and the doctor rubbing my head costs $1000. I got a ride to the hospital in an ambulance and a doctor rubbed my head. That cost $1550. 

God bless America!

With the holidays, it will have been almost a full week after I ordered that my shipment will actually be on the way to me. 

I gave them a call today and they gave me some BS excuse that they were seeing an increased volume of orders due to the holidays. You know who else I ordered from the same day? Airsoft GI. Bought a new gun a few new mags, and some misc tactical gear from them that same Friday and they had it packed and shipped within 3 hours. Now I'd assume they have just as big of an increase in, so why did it take them a bit over 10% of the time to pack and ship my product?

To be fair though, I think that VASIMR is pretty much the best bet for getting to Mars quickly.  The VX-200 is designed to have an ISP of 5,000s at optimal efficiency, which destroys SpaceX's Merlin 1D's ISP of 311s (vac).  Most other chemical rocket engines have a vacuum ISP of ~300s.

deepshallow,sex,1388550631.0,"Well.. I'm not a psychiatrist but let me offer this as a theory.  In a threesome you feel you have 'permission' from your female partner to perform gay acts and that permission somehow makes it ok absolving you of responsibility and allowing you (seemingly) not to question your sexual orientation. Because she's there you are willing to give yourself the 'green light' shall we say.

Outside of a threesome scenario however you DON'T feel you have permission and you won't give it to yourself because you fear being gay.  You will most likely know the reason for your fear. You might fear God (feel guilty) or you might fear the reaction of your family or friends.  In other words you don't want to be gay... unless (of course) your girlfriend tells you you can.  

The day will come when you DO give yourself permission OUTSIDE of a threesome scenario. You might then find your claim to be 'straight' more difficult to justify.  "

For cc: have you every had your brows shaped before? I think they'd look lovely!

When combining bright shadow and lipstick I think everything coheres better if you use something w/ the same undertones. Ie, your eye shadow is yellow and your lipstick is blue based.  having done a yellow based lipstick or a silvery eye would've gone together  more IMO

Try and blend the darker crease shadow up a bit more. Instead of having the bright color go all along your bottom lash line, pop it on your inner eyes and then bring your  crease color along the outer part of your lower lashes.

Yes and everything went well. I knew she was there for me if I needed her, she listened, and was supportive. I didn't ask her to do anything.

professor__doom,changemyview,1388552165.0,"To a random stranger, my mother looks to be in perfect health.  She's not old--60--and she looks quite a bit younger than that.  However, she has a knee replacement, a respiratory problem, and a pacemaker.  None of these conditions are visible from the outside, but none of these are ""pseudo-diseases"" or ""treatable, if not fully reversible, with exercise.""  By the way, she watches her diet very carefully, and she DOES exercise whenever possible--sticking to low-impact exercise like swimming, to avoid aggravating her knee.

The knee replacement does not affect her visible gait, but it does mean that walking takes more effort, and is sometimes painful.  Walking long distances--possibly carrying heavy objects--is tiring at best and dangerous at worst.

Yet somebody with your view would, based on cursory examination only, conclude that she does not ""deserve"" a handicap placard.

There are many, many conditions like this which justify the issuance of handicap tags.  People have a right to privacy--when a doctor requests and the state subsequently issues a handicap tag, they have the right to not have to explain their intensely private medical issues to every indignant passerby.

Even ""treatable"" or ""reversible"" conditions like obesity are still dangerous before they are treated.  A friend of mine was once dangerously obese and has since lost a great deal of weight through diet and exercise.  Fortunately, he did this while he was still young.  

Most states issue permanent disability license plates for irreversable conditions, and plastic window-hangers for temporary conditions, which are issued on a 1-5 year basis and renewed only by medical necessity.  My obese friend received the plastic tag, and will return it if his efforts meet with continued success.

An obese person, even if he's in the middle of a weight loss program, could still have a heart attack and drop dead in the parking lot due to overexertion during the months/years it takes to lose the weight.  In my opinion, preventing heart attacks is a pretty damn good reason to give somebody a handicap placard, even if his condition is reversible."

Nausved,FeMRADebates,1388552208.0,"I think these are good messages for young girls, too. 

On a somewhat related note, I was also very energetic as a little girl, but I lost a lot of that due to bullying and low self-esteem in areas relating to sports and physical activity. I was not as strong or as fast as the little boys in my PE classes, but I didn't realize this was due to biology; I was inundated with *supposedly* empowering message that girls are as good as boys at sports, so I thought it was my personal failing that I was below average (when boys were included in that average) despite how hard I worked at it. It didn't help that boys and girls were always made to compete with each other—we all ran in the same races, we played on the same teams, etc.—so it was rubbed in my face *every single day* how physically incapable I felt, and how much I was letting my teammates down because I couldn't swing a baseball bat very hard.

If someone had simply gotten it through my head competing physically against boys was like competing physically against older kids—my failures against them was not a personal failing, but a reflection of the differences in our bodies—it would have saved me a lot of grief, and it would have done a great deal to preserve my passion for physical exertion.

Before school crushed my passion, though, I was a roamer. I was always swimming in creeks, catching minnows, climbing small cliffs, building forts of leaves and sticks, making mud pits, running with my dogs. I also got into my fair share of fights (all of them mutually consensual and with good friends—we liked wrestling and boxing for fun). I look back fondly on these childhood memories and feel sad that they came to an end so much sooner than they should have. It makes me sad that the repulsion I developed for my own physical abilities translated into unhealthy habits that I still struggle with today—specifically, a reluctance to exercise in sight of others (making going to things like dancing classes and the gym feel embarrassing to me).

However, I am now in a relationship with a man *drastically* stronger than me (not only is he over a foot taller than me, but he's also one of those lucky ducks who's naturally broad-framed and seemingly builds muscle by sitting on the couch). It's actually been very freeing for me. He's *so far* out of my league, strength-wise, that I don't feel self-conscious about it; I don't feel competitive or judged around him. This is the first time since I was a child that I haven't felt ashamed for not being as strong everyone around me, and it has finally freed me to start recapturing what I lost when I was younger. He and I live together on a farm where we cut secret passageways through wild hedges, dig out sunken greenhouses, build structures out of dead branches, etc., and it doesn't make me feel illegitimate that he works twice as fast as I do. It's not about that."

True though, the remarks are made by racists, but if men are attracted to appearance first before personality, how can she rationalize that any guy that finds her attractive only does so because he is attracted to her race? That's the fallacy that I have with the statements of the OP. I'm black and I mainly date white chicks, but its not because they are white though, it's more because, culturally I identify with them more than I do with ghetto black chicks. It doesn't mean that I don't find black women attractive though.

She speaks on people being attracted to her ""Asianess"" as fetishization, but its not. People like what they like, and it is what it is. The more that she harps on about it, and castigates potential suitors because of it, the more likely that she will find herself alone, bitter, and writing shit articles like this one."

The tie should end with the shirt, so if the shirt is out then the tie will look far too short, also making you look shorter. Or, if you have the tie long enough to end with your untucked shirt it will come across as far too long. There's no in between.

SOSBTK,changemyview,1388553016.0,"While I do agree that the SO in such a situation is the one who would 'deserve' it the most, I think you are assuming too much about the person who has been cheated on. I'm not going to say that they are unstable, but they are in a very emotional situation and you do need to ignore pure rational logic for emotional logic.

If I were in a situation like that I would choose beating the other person over my SO. For one, I am/was in an emotionally intimate relationship with my SO. Just because they cheated doesn't mean those feeling immediately go away. On the other hand, this hypothetical other person not only may be the cause or instigator of my SO cheating, but they tried to take what is mine. That's MY significant other they were with. So it's going to be MY fist that hits them. 

Now, I have never done this and doubt I ever will, but I'm just saying that's the logic I'd apply to it. "

gonefishn,WritingPrompts,1388553522.0,"Beginnings are terribly difficult simply because the word itself requires more consonants, vowels, and syllables than an ending.  Kenji, he’s casting smoke rings into the air and making faces at the people who are walking by.  Few stare, and even less make faces back, but most don't even see him.  For hours, he has been on the bridge leading to the train station at Hon-Atsugi, and you could say that this is the story of his life.  Being on bridges, that is. In a metaphorical sense.

He says that ugliness can be found everywhere, but every so often he proves himself wrong by admiring the scattered graffiti along the sides of the bridge.  Taking a finger, he enjoys tracing the outlines of what he calls messages from God, as though each stroke could change the fact that he often says he does not believe in such things.  Can you hear them, he asks, the voices in these walls?  I shake my head, and he gives me a look of pity.  Kenji insists that they are hints to the mystery of life, tempting and elusive secrets waiting to be discovered, but I am reminded of Kenji’s perspective of life: a long tube that grows smaller and smaller until we are unable to move forward.

Tatsuo believes in the opposite.  He is sitting on the side of the bridge, trying to predict the destinations of each person walking by.  The woman in white is going to meet her friends at the department store.  The young teenagers are headed to soccer practice.  The married man with the briefcase heading to the escort service will soon attend his own funeral.  The elderly man with a hunchback, who has walked by twice, is God and he is going everywhere and nowhere at once.  He stirs when Kenji speaks of the graffiti on the wall, and shakes his head.  He argues that these writings are only truths we already know but choose to ignore.  All in all, they are there to be observed and have their existence acknowledged.  Reminders, not instructions, the difference is monumental.

Me, I’m just checking my watch.  Your train comes in half an hour, and soon I’ll meet you at the station.  We’ll catch the express to Shinjuku.  Maybe we’ll walk around.  Get some coffee.  People watch.  Fall in love.  Who knows.  Kenji and Tatsuo, they're still arguing about the messages you left on the wall, and even when we’re far away, they’ll still be there forever trying to figure out what you’re trying to tell me."
NDaveT,DebateAnAtheist,1388553524.0,"&gt;  If someone had proposed that pulsars existed based on absolutely no evidence whatsoever, would it be rational to claim with certainty that they don't exist?

Yes.

&gt; Please, try to focus on the point without being distracted by unimportant details about the hypothetical examples.

That detail was very important. Humans very rarely postulate something that might exist based on no evidence that eventually turns out to exist. The vast majority of the time, when something new is postulated, it is because there is some evidence to suggest that it might possibly exist.

Nobody proposed pulsars existed based on no evidence whatsoever, or black holes, or microbes. That's why it's safe to dismiss postulates based on absolutely no evidence. 

If there's some evidence, but it's not conclusive, that's a different story.

Now, I don't have that sensation anymore, but it does get sore sometimes. I haven't really figured out what the pattern is that causes the soreness, though. I'll have a really intense workout, do lots of squats, etc., and the next day I'll be fine. But, some days I'll just wake up and be like, 'aggghhh, what the fuck?' Even then, it's not horrible, it's just sore. It doesn't inhibit my movement. 

Where I do notice it is - and this is where my fellow 12's will freak out - is when I need to make a suddenly acceleration forward. Because the tissue helps brace the femur for movement forward, going to a sudden sprint can cause pain. I don't know what condition Harvin was in, but because I waited so long to do something about my hip, there was very little fixing/re-attaching that they could do, so they had to just clean out the ligament entirely."

1) Women do not get paid less. 

2) Women getting free drinks is only one symptom of an over-arching social overtone of putting women on pedestals. 

3) I could very easily argue that the radically preferential treatment women are given in the entertainment industry, and judicial system more than make up for a lower pay grade. 

&gt;And let's not forget other parts of the world.

That's not a reasonable argument as other parts of the world are radically underdeveloped.

Why risk a drying up of real pics? Just because they're not famous fit porn stars with fake tits doesn't mean they're not allowed to post in /r/MILF"

Some games are also exclusive to consoles, or other gaming devices that people may not have (I just have a PC, so I watch Let's Plays of games that aren't playable on PC). 

Also, I am too much of a wimp to play even slightly scary games, but I like to watch Let's Plays of them.

This is the preview to a battlefield expansion pack that takes place in vietnam. And look at what it shows you. MURDER. But backed with Vietnam era rock music, and good graphics. The first thing you see is a Vietnamese soldier shooting down a helicopter. This is so disrespectful to the veterans of Vietnam, and read the comments. It's like they don't even care that they're glorifying a truly awful war. Now if they saw the real thing I bet they'd be horrified, but because it's in a video game it's acceptable. There's no scientific consensus, but man I think stuff like this is toxic to young mind. "

Just because it's a trick he *can* do, doesn't mean he has to.

The idea here is not unlike an artemia creating innert cysts where the young will remain in suspended animation until conditions improve (called diasporia).  Except, with this, the apparent strategy is that the cells in the jelly fish will undifferentiate back into the planula phase of their life cycle and become free floating.  Currents, and apparently also ballast from ships, should transport them to better grounds where they can lay into their life cycle again as normal.

From what I read, this not a permanent strategy; rather this is an emergency scenario to guarantee survival, or at least to better a chance at survival in times of low to no resource availability.

They just can't seem to handle that there are people out there that can still enjoy the same person after one fuck ;-p Shh commitment issues and all). I just look at what some fad in society does and do the opposite, hey you got a nice tattoo? Ugh, no ink for me! Piercings, I'm right thanks! LOL       

Anyhow, as for accents, yep, the Southern accent is so sweet, not just female. Haven't met many except where I've been in east coast, but on TV/celebs I like Dolly Parton, Paula Deen (never watched her show, but her laugh was infectious on Oprah etc), who else? That multi-multi mom, Duggar, with 20 kids! ;-p Well hers was nearly annoying as it was all soft and almost childish, but she's forgiven because she's a Bible-lovin' girl and I just love the thought of corrupting them LOL. I liked watching Cajun Pawn Stars just for the accents, forget his name, but the crazy one with the 'gater and coon' stuff. He was hilarious. Could barely understand him. Just cracked me up with that happy go luck carefree spirit. 

Well if I sent pics of my SOs hand with tape for scale, perhaps it'd be something to go on. I don't know if I want to start collecting flint, but I guess it's educational to my nieces and nephews and MILFs granddaughter - she'd love that. But I'm really interested in learning to carve timber. If I could do it well my first few goes I'd just do it myself. But yours was really cool, plus my SO is a Van Gogh fan.  So if you find another burl like that, I'd pay in cash for it. I should show her actually to see her reaction. Maybe she'd want me to do it, or she'd want me to have a go of finishing it off, and sanding it and she might paint it just like the VG Starry Night and then put a clear coat over it.     

How about we just trade for cash for now. You gotta name and shame those redditors that conned you. Fucking shits, karma better bite their ass so fucking hard they squeal and wish they'd done a proper trade with you. Maybe start with minor stuff first. Do you go to shows/meets and stuff to trade also?      

We get geodes, maybe not many naturally anymore, but imported from South America and Africa sold in crystal stores for a few hundred to a few thousand for 3 foot Amethyst, maybe weighting 300 lbs or so, not sure, haven't nudged one ;-p We're pretty much like America but smaller. They didn't call us the 51st state for nothing during the Iraq War debacle.  Anyhow I don't know much mineralogy to be honest, but have been interested in gems. Get that from my mother. My father used to bring back quartz chunks with gold specks in them from the mines. I just like the birthstones stuff, people say they heal with them etc. One thing I have done is put quartz in a jug of water, and I don't know if it's placebo but it seems to taste less chlorine-ish ;-p     
 
If you ever holiday in Australia, and you ought to if you like the beach etc, they're better than Florida! Go to Victoria and you might even get yourself a tiny little gold nugget. They're pretty cool. That's what got me interested in all this stuff, wanting to make stuff for my SO, she doesn't really like yellow gold but I do. She's platinum or white gold type. I think rose gold is nice too. Would be awesome to find nuggets and melt then down and pour into casts to make stuff.  Can get personal gas or electric furnace $400 or so now. 

Anyhow I can always just buy some opal, but it'd be fun to dig for it. There are a few kinds. Send me your email in PM and I'll bring some over and post it to you when I'm in US later.

Carnivores have super-short digestive tracts, so everything goes through within a few hours. The food isn't processed as much, but that's ok, since meat is a great energy source. Any bacteria that hitched a ride on the food (think salmonella) will be out in a few hours too. Because of this, it doesn't have much time to reproduce in the intestines or cause much damage.

Herbivores have long digestive tracts. This is necessary because plants tend to be really hard to digest. In fact, some bits of plants are literally not possible for herbivores to digest, so they have bacteria in their gut to do it for them. This works out well for everyone. Except the plants.

The main plot in 2 touches on the idea of freedom vs. security and blind faith in ones ideas and principles. Multi-colored scenarios with everyone looking through their own color filter.

Tires generally are not meant for going over bodies and are very susceptible to slipping. Tire do not have grip when going up against our zombie hordes then they will spin and make a lovely spew out the back end. No matter the size with out gaining much in the way of progressing forward. If You put treads on the same vehicle the treads dig in and gain traction by using more surface area and gripping ridges to dig in and move. The slippery sludge of zombie endtrails will pose a much smaller hazzard. Also at full stop to go the tires will require a dryer surface then the tracks would. The tires would provide a much better maneuverability. So if zombie crunching is your goal then go for treads. If escape and avoidance is the goal use tires.

Seriously, I don't get how you can manage to sound like you're complaining about things that aren't problems, but how they should be. Of fucking course the heatsink is the main reason the pump 'cannot flow worth a damn', that's where you want flow restriction to increase thermal interchange.

And if there were bacteria or algae producing gas inside the system, it wouldn't have to be fast. It would just have to be any sort of volume increase at all to make the pressure in the system build immensely. Screw holes (especially plastic ones) being threaded and the screws popping out isn't really unusual with any sort of force pushing them straight outwards...

Caveman#1 (Ug) wishes to tell Caveman#2 (Og) where he found this giant beastie he caught for breakfast, which was down by the river. He tries to communicate by hand signals. After Ug keeps waving his arms wildly about, he notices Og is getting very confused. 

Frustrated, Ug points to the beastie and makes a frustrated sound, ""Gah!"" He then points to the river and makes another sound, ""Argh!"" 

Now Og is figuring out what Ug is trying to say. He now knows that ""Gah"" means beastie and ""Argh"" means river.

Over time, more words come out of their frustrated exchanges. They get words like ""urph"", ""clar"", and ""fin"". Over time, the two can speak entire sentences to each other. They meet other cavemen like Irg, Ack, and Ip. In order to communicate, the two teach them their words. They go on to teach others, and so on.

Eons pass, and as different cavemen pronounce words differently, the words change slightly. Separated by distance, cavemen from different regions keep some words the same and change others depending on how they like them. 

Even longer spans of time pass, and each caveman language has added more and more words to itself until the different ones branch out to form the roughly 6,500 languages spoken today."

sBcNikita,ShingekiNoKyojin,1388556085.0,"Exactly. There's an excellent post on this thread below that details exactly why it makes no sense for Annie to have killed Marco:

http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?t=121890&amp;page=5

The most convincing points to me are:

1. Marco's injuries are clearly a bite wound, not a sword cut. Had Annie transformed to kill Marco with a bite, the lightning from the transformation would have been obvious. Titans are confirmed to ignore corpses.

2. As the titan captives had not been captured yet, Annie could not possibly have known that she would have needed Marco's maneuver gear in the first place, and would consequently have had no reason to kill him or to take it from him. In addition, it is hinted that multiple people were involved in killing the test subjects, not just Annie.

3. Here's a key subtlety that many, many people fail to grasp. Annie presumably used HER OWN maneuver gear to kill the test subjects. AFTER committing this act, she needed to present a fresh, unused set of gear for inspection to appear innocent. As Eren was tried, turned over to the survey corps, and relocated to their headquarters before the titan test subjects were killed, a period of a week or more had likely passed since Trost. So, either Annie killed Marco somehow predicting that she'd need to scavenge his gear to pass inspection over a week later in order to kill titan captives that hadn't even been captured yet... or she simply presented his gear after the fact. It doesn't take a genius to tell which course of action is more plausible.

4. Were it still functional, Marco's 3DMG would have been routinely salvaged from the battlefield during the cleanup that Annie was a part of. Cleanup is clearly well underway at the point at which Marco's body is discovered.


In general, it makes no sense for Annie to have killed Marco. In the midst of a chaotic battle involving hundreds if not thousands of soldiers, it's impossible to guarantee that there won't be witnesses, and doing it all for the sake of a set of 3DMG gear is illogical when a full set can likely be recovered from any number of bodies following the battle. The risks completely outweigh the benefits. Several bodies of dead garrison soldiers (one missing a head, another missing a jaw and several limbs) are lying around within sight of Marco's body in the manga, further implying that he simply died in fierce combat."

I can understand why he might ask regardless. It's not a stretch to think that one might keep ""casual encounters"" not listed for appearance purposes. When I used the site, I always noted that I was looking for something longer term and left ""casual"" out, but that's because listing casual is more likely to drive away someone I might actually be looking for, even if I listed both. That said, depending on the person, I may have been up for a little fun in the meantime while I still looked for something more serious.

As for his comment, he seemed pretty straight forward and polite about what he was looking for. If he was attractive, it could be a fun evening. Your ""absolutely not"" could have much more tactfully been a ""no thanks, I'm not interested."" All in all, I don't think he was rude about how he approached you in any way. It could be seen as analogous to him saying ""Hey, would you like to get a drink?"" with the response, ""Fuck off, gross!"" Totally fine to not be interested, but the response doesn't have to be abrasive.

&gt;Has there actually been success with this with people who aren't ~~wanting~~ listing casual sex?

Yup. Definitely."

puaSenator,AskMen,1388556243.0,"What you quoted is very true though. Don't get upset that we make generalizations for the sake of argument. It would get really annoying and redundant if we always wavered with, ""I know not all women are like this, but...""

Also, that's sort of the underlying theme of the sub. Now maybe not you (NAWALT), but generally speaking women don't know what they want. Now we are talking about what to eat and what to do today. But more down the lines that often women say they want something, and honestly do personally believe it, but then turn around and their actions are completely different than what they said they wanted. 

For instance, the nice guy thing is really popular. Women are always going on about how what they really want is just a really nice guy that fits X Y Z admirable traits. But at the end of the day, these same women are going out going to bed with men opposite of what they say they are interested in. Frat houses have no shortage of hot chicks to fuck, while all the ""nice guys"" are home alone watching porn. That's where the idea of, ""Women don't really know what they want."" This type of behavior tends to cross over a few different areas. 

&gt; I don't want to be ""dominated"" or ""put in my place,""

Of course not when you put it that way. But most women do like men who lead the relationship. Again, you may not think this is true, but in practice it tends to be true. Leadership tends to correlate with masculinity and yada yada yada.... There was even a few studies showing exactly this. Including one that showed relationships completely fell apart once the guy started giving his SO all decision making power in the relationship. Women start resenting any man that acts weak around them. After all, she married a man, not a women, for a reason. 


And don't worry about us saying what we say to each other. If TRP logic wouldn't apply to you, which I would say is 50/50, then you and the guy just wont get into a relationship, and everyone goes their separate ways. "

JacobMHS,minnesotavikings,1388556288.0,"I wouldn't want to do three years of firsts, but the thing is, we'd have to move up from the eighth pick. We wouldn't be the only ones after that pick. I mean, it would probably have to be a 1st from this and next year, and this year's 2nd and 3rd. And possibly a 2nd from next year.

Thing is, I'd say that if RGIII hadn't been hurt, I think he'd performed at a high enough level to still be considered ""worth it.""

Teddy's a much better prospect than RGIII.

komnenos,totalwar,1388556301.0,"I'd personally say that if they were going to do a total war game based in China the Three Kingdoms would be best.  I just finished reading Romance of the Three and there is plenty of info on the era plus there have been countless series made based on the age.  I'd be interested in how Creative Assembly would handle the era.

I actually think that there is quite a bit of info on the warring states period, and for that matter the Spring and Autumn period.  I would highly recommend that you read the [Spring and Autumn Annals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Annals) or watch the TV show [The Great Revival](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLxSJ0AnS-Y&amp;list=PLYRGCE_sj_lE1Ii96dtuBXYjf-Nv152mi) which is about the Spring and Autumn period conflict between the Yue and the Wu (the same state that Sun Tzu supposedly served under) the action can be a little cheesy but the series is really fun!  And if you don't have time to read Romance of the Three Kingdoms you could always watch the [tv series!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTax6-DUsM8&amp;list=PL33A390995E9A7F00&amp;index=1)  For some reason I've always seen a lot of hostility from the Total War community against any games set in China, I'm not sure why..."

It was divided up between warlords of the Islamic International Brigade which slowly took control of the region. The IIB then attacked Dagestan, the closest neighbor under Russian control - starting yet another war with Russia.

Meanwhile hundreds, literally hundreds of apartment bombs were going off in Moscow, as well as a international Kidnapping ring being used to fund the Islamic International Brigade. Soon after a hostage crisis in Moscow and continued terroist attacks, Russia had enough shit and went back into Chechnya and took back control.

Two, she says pay the minimum on anything below 8%, only sacrifice 401k if you're over 8% (personally, my number would be 7%).

sockalicious,personalfinance,1388556745.0,"&gt; You need to be really careful not to price yourself out of your neighborhood with this addition. I would do every bit of research you can before you proceed.

This.  Location is by far the most important determiner of property value; lot size is next.  Home square footage is not anywhere near as important.  You'll read about price per square foot but that's a good way to compare homes in a given neighborhood because homes are often built similarly in a neighborhood.

Your $300K addition to a $500K house is not going to change location or lot size.  You most likely will not end up with an $800K home; you'll have a 'white elephant' property that is at significant variance to the average home in your neighborhood and that may even pull the value down.

In fact, I just googled ['white elephant'](http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/white+elephant) to make sure I'd used the phrase correctly, and the definition in that link is 'a house that is overbuilt for its neighborhood.'"

IndependentBoof,changemyview,1388556849.0,"&gt; I believe that a church is like any other profit making business and therefore most pay similar taxes.

To the contrary, churches are not businesses and aren't for profit. The simplest answer is that they aren't taxed because not-for-profit organizations get tax exemptions. A church could randomly decide one day that it was no longer interested in religion and only wants to be a not-for-profit charity and their tax situation would be the same.

Of course, with the benefits of tax exempt status comes regulation -- for example, they are not supposed to be involved in political campaigning."

awkward_peach,AskWomen,1388556867.0,"My dad died about 3 years ago. My mom and him had been married for 20 years. They had a very active sex life and apparently (according to my mom) it never got boring. She always tells me ""Why do you think he stayed with me and never looked anywhere else?!"".

Anyway, my mom dates around a lot, like, a lot. Young guys, mid guys, old guys. From 20 to 60, some of those guys are just purely for sex because according to her they really know what they are doing.

She has told me many a tale where she either mentally, or physically noped the fuck out.

* This guy had the smallest penis my mom had ever seen. And my mom has seen A LOT of penises. She said that she looked and looked (apparently the guy wasn't groomed down there) but she had a really difficult time finding it. She didn't say anything because she didn't want to make him feel bad, but she texted me from the hotel bathroom telling me to call her in 10 minutes (she ""fooled around"" for those 10 minutes), so I bailed her out of that one.

* Another guy was extremely handsome and ripped, I saw his pictures and the guy was actually very handsome. My mom said that she didn't think she needed to ""feel around"" a bit before she actually went anywhere with the guy, because his appearance said *manly*. So they were getting ready to go at it, and the guy just can't get it up, my mom hadn't had sex in a week and she was pretty eager to do it. She said she tried everything for about 2 hours and the little guy just wouldn't go. The dude gave all sorts of excuses, but my mom wasn't having it. He has called several times to ask for her, she's never home.

* My mom is usually really nice about letting guys down easy, so they don't feel bad. But this time she couldn't do or say anything nice to the guy because she was so disgusted. She said the smell emanating from his crotch was so pungent, her eyes were watering. She didn't even attempt to touch it, but just started coughing and putting her clothes back on. She never called the guy back and she still ignores his texts.

* This other one was a younger guy (20) and for someone like my mom, pretty inexperienced. The guy finishes in like 15 minutes, rolls over, and says he has to go. My mom hadn't had sex in like 3 weeks so she wanted an orgasm badly. She literally told the guy ""you are not leaving until you make me come"". So the guy did. He keeps calling her to apologize and to say that he ""loves her"", my mom ignores his calls and when she does answer she tells him he's too young, go away.

There's a lot more that I would have to think about to remember, but it's always a good laugh during breakfast. My mom is my best friend."

Otherwise, I found seroquel to help my depression. I'm kind of bipolarish, so I guess that what I really need is mood-stabilizers rather than anti-depressants.

Btw, what made me go from full-blown ultra depressed to not depressed recently was a very strong psychedelic trip. It sounds really dumb but it's true. It removed the psychological barriers that I had and I was able to think much more clearly. It's as if my brain did a ""reset"".

There is nothing actively preventing women from choosing a field that they desire but themselves.

It's just as dumb as ""women aren't able to consent to sex"" because they've been ""brainwashed by the Patriarchy"" or whatever.

Eyes on him 24/7, if you aren't watching him, he is in his crate. He will not use the bathroom in his crate. You have to assume that every second you are not looking at him, he is peeing in the house. When you see him sniffing to go, bring him outside. Bring him outside every couple hours. When he goes outside, have a party and let him know this is the best thing ever. (lots of really high value treats like real meat) If he starts to go inside, you have to catch him in the act. Interrupting my dog was what made it click for her I think, because it was really annoying when I would pick her up or drag her by her collar to go outside while she was in the middle of eliminating. If you do not catch him in the act, and find it later, this will be a set back. Clean it with Nature's Miracle (or a similar product) and move on. (no scolding or punishment, he will not understand and it will set you back further)

When I say I potty trained my dog in 1 week, I don't mean it was perfect after a week, I mean she started asking to go out on her own. What a relief that was! It had been a long week and I had no clue how long she would take to catch on. She still had accidents here and there but they were all my fault. "

&gt; if you have expertise, you're a know-it-all 

Nor is this.

&gt; and the second you get married they shove you onto the 'mommy track' where you have fewer opportunities for career advancement and less interesting work. 

No, the second you get *pregnant* is when that happens, if it does, and to be honest, that's something you're going to have to deal with. You're a woman, you have to choose between family and a fulfilling career. You can't blame society because you can't have both, the choice is entirely up to you, no one is making it for you. If you choose not to have a family you can most certainly pursue a career just as rewarding as a man's.

* More reasonable motherboard for your budget. You are sacrificing a lot of money that could be spent on actual performance.

* 16g is useless to gamers. This model is all you need.

* AMD is out of the question to gamers right now due to the market. This list is geared for in game performance so I grabbed the GTX 770 which is a solid two tiers better in performance.

* With the items you left out, the case you chose was too expensive, I grabbed a cheaper Red/Black AMD themed case to fit your style.

* You don't need all these fans right away.

* You forgot a PSU.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1388558208.0,"&gt;Maybe the statistics have changed since I checked, but I'm pretty sure women are paid less.

Women aren't **paid** less, women simply **earn** less. 

The idea behind the wage gap is that women, in total, control less of the fluid capital than men do, which can be easily accounted for in several ways:

- Women work less overtime, arguably less hard, and more often take more time off than men do often because they physically have the baby aka mat leave.
- Women are less likely to demand promotions and/or negotiate for higher pay upon hire 
- Women simply have less, or no interesting en masse in many of the higher paying jobs like science and politics.

If companies were literally handing men pay checks for $1000 and $750 to women, there'd be riots in the streets.

Furthermore, women should want to be paid less. In a perfectly equal pay society, there'd be no rational point in hiring a woman because men are equally intelligent to women and have physically stronger bodies most of the time, so if women are X, men are X+1.

&gt;I agree that free drinks and held doors are outdated. It is incredibly ethnocentric to ignore the problems of women in 'places you've never heard of,' although I'm sure you've heard of many Middle Eastern cities. Whether or not I've heard f a women's hometown, I still think that genital mutilation and subservience are travesties.

My point being, you cannot form coherent positions about countries that still operate with a level of civilization akin to the 14th century. It's not women who have crappy lives there, it's everyone. "
TheDarkHorse83,AskMen,1388558215.0,"I, too, watched futurama and drank beer. It was a good night!"
sfzen,FifaCareers,1388558222.0,"Wolves in League 1, they've got decent money and players that *should* have made them one of the better teams in the Championship, but they were relegated. 

Accrington seems to be the worst team in League 2, with little money, so if you're looking for a challenge, there you go. I like their kits, and they've got some semi-decent young players.

Newport County, newly promoted to League 2 has been absolutely the most difficult team for me to manage. I can't stand using a 5-back formation, and they've got almost nothing but defenders on the roster. Little money, little talent, you'll have to completely overhaul the roster if you want to score any goals."
TheWhiteNashorn,pics,1388558226.0,"&gt; once we're on the way down, that doesn't matter and they just enjoy the view.

rising_son,Guitar,1388558232.0,"In regards to thumb placement you should do whatever feels most comfortable for you. When I'm rocking more blues/feel oriented licks and low position chords I often bring my thumb round to increase my grip or to fret notes, and when I'm getting up higher and really going for fast playing I move it to the back of the neck. There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to do it. Classical teachers would tell you that it's wrong but someone like me wouldn't bat an eyelid when seeing it. I guess some kinds of guitar playing have more inherent discipline than others."

If your boss disagrees with your being there, they may fire you (citing a different, but usually overlooked, reason, of course). If you don't protest in a sufficiently peaceful and organized manner, the police are well within their rights to stop the protesters. It also doesn't guarantee any change, just that a few dozen or hundred people out of a population of over 300 million care enough to visit Washington, D.C.

It's a really high risk for an incredibly low chance of sufficient reward."

I went to multiple stores and all I could find is clocks with massive, ultra-bright blue LED displays. I bought one to try, but had to return it when I could easily read by the light of it's dimmest setting.

5 years later I still have the old novelty clock. I will never understand why manufacturers insist on putting spot-light intensity blue lights on a freaking alarm clock."

xthorgoldx,AskReddit,1388558519.0,"Consider it like this (geneticists, be warned, I'm simplifying/obfuscating a lot of things):

Nipples are a vital part of the female biological structure because of its importance to child rearing. Babies need to be fed a certain diet, so the mother is evolved to provide them with the nutrients they need (and other benefits such as maternal imprinting, immunity inheritance, and so on). For the nipples and mammary glands to develop, they need to be biologically coded for in the DNA.

So, let's put it in the sex chromosome, shall we? 23rd pair, X chromosome - that way it'll *only* show up in girls. Note that the 23rd pair would be split into (X1, X2) and (X1, Y); as opposed to just (X,X) and (X,Y), because if mammaries were encoded on X1 then guys would still get it.

So a person will only get mammaries if they're female with the X1X2 chromosome set. But wait - a parent only contributes *half* of a chromosomal pair to the child. The dad will always contribute X1 or Y, but the mom could contribute X1 or X2 - which means you could get a girl with an X1X1 genotype. This presents an unacceptable genetic problem that would be eliminated by evolutionary pressure - you can't have a species in which half the female population is born unable to produce!

So you put the genes for mammary development on another pair. Now boys and girls *both* have mammaries, but this presents a problem in that there's no pressure for males to *have* functional breasts - they don't get the hormonal triggers women get during pregnancy which prevents them from serving as backup feeders for children, and besides - men have a genetic pressure to mate more like bears - quantity with an eye for mate quality (find a mother that's strong and can take care of kids herself; other factors have partially overridden this in favor of social mating and ""quality over quantity"").

Since there's no reason for men to have *developed* mammaries, a compromise is reached - *all* humans will develop the baseline structures necessary for mammary development, but what causes them to fully develop - hormonal triggers - are encoded on the female-specific X chromosome in the 23rd pair, which is overridden in males by the dominant Y chromosome's hormone switches.

------

Shorter, alternative explanation:

The human body is like a lego set you're building one page at a time, let's say it's a car. You don't know if this car is going to have a laser gun mounted to the roof or not until you get to page 12, but you have to make a decision on page 2 - even though you know, being an experienced builder, that the presence of blue-colored wheels means that this car *won't* have a turret, since the kit itself doesn't ""know"" that. So you put in the infrastructure for the turret, a mounting piece and a swivelling chair, onto the car on page 2, and then when you get to page 12 you figure out whether you're going to attach the rest of the parts or just leave it be.

Now, on parts where you don't attach the laser turret, the car's functionality and overall look isn't changed at all by the presence of the mounting slot. There's no reason to remove the mount, and it'd cost time and money to change the instructions to say ""Remove this part from earlier"" on page 12 or ""Don't put this part on at all if you have blue wheels,"" so the manufacturers leave the kit as it is."

Nope. We're in complete control over how our journeys play out, and even if that's not the case, we have some power over what we can do about it.

We're all heading in the same direction along the fourth dimension, but we have three whole other dimensions to explore to our hearts' content, filled with other people who have their own unique experiences and stories. Sure, many of them may suck, but others are worth the time of day, and maybe a dozen or so are worth more than that. Those dozen people or so, in turn, have people of their own that they cling to, and so forth. That inter-connectedness is what gives life meaning to me.

It doesn't matter what we draw energy from, be it music, literature, art, video games, clubbing... What matters to me is that at the end of the day, we're all in this together. (That's also why it pisses me off to no end when people treat each other terribly, but that's a rant for another day.)"

Raise the body temperature (of the female, as suggested elsewhere) and you start getting malformed proteins, which leads to genetic mutation or prion disease.

RadiumGirl,Disneyland,1388559229.0,"&gt; Those parents are probably annoyed that so many childless adults and teens are hogging up the lines when Disneyland is ideally for children.

When I was growing up, my family had very little money. Certainly not enough to take an family trip to Disney World or Disneyland (especially since we live in Australia). 

As an adult I saved and saved to make my dream of visiting Disney a reality. So, yeah, I'm one of those *'childless adults and teens hogging up the lines'* - because not everyone had the sort of privileged childhood that afforded them the opportunity of being at Disney when they were little.

Also, bear in mind that adults pay more to enter than children, and take up considerably less space when allowing for strollers.

&gt;The bulky strollers are just the easiest target and that is unfair to parents.

They're easy to target for a reason: they take up lots of space when moving and when parked, some parents think they double as battering rams or ice breakers, and everyone can remember a time when their ankles have been clipped by an inattentive or impatient stroller navigator.

""The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask.

eithris,WoT,1388559638.0,"they use horses for labor and hauling stuff, but that's it.

most of the things aiel ""just don't do"" boils down to their early times in the waste where they spent generations having to do without. they don't use chairs or other furniture(except for certain traditional moments) because in the waste, wood is rare, construction grade timber is nonexistent, and what wood they have is better put to use making tools and weapons.

they don't ride horses because they didn't HAVE horses, the original aiel were servants who weren't allowed horses. as their cultural identity changed in the waste, a lot of views inverted compared to ""wetlanders"". instead of seeing a horse as a status symbol, having to ride a horse because seen as a weakness. the swords thing is explained in book 4, but it's also kinda related. a farmer or other lower class person would be more likely to use a bow, lords and professional soldiers had swords, so the aiel turned them into an insult

there's lots of other little things you'll pick up on, i haven't done a read through of WoT in a few years though so i'm not refreshed on the subject

dbaker102194,askscience,1388559731.0,"I'm inclined to disagree about bullets. The kinetic energy of most bullets is actually quite low. The kinetic energy of any bullet cannot exceed the recoil (conservation of energy, the powder expands in all directions, so really, the recoil has more *Newtons* than the bullet does. Since the bullet receives maybe 1/5 of the explosive force. There is something to be said for the pressure within the barrel, but at the amount of force produced by the combustion, it would be insignificant.) since people are able to fire guns without any major injuries, it would seem counter intuitive to switch to an ammo with *less* penetrating power, as that's where a bullet's effectiveness comes from.

Seriously, an arrow fired from a bow with 5 lbs. tension has more kinetic energy than your typical 9mm bullet.

WalterFStarbuck,wargame,1388559736.0,"I use them in groups to set up a no-fly zone corridor.

A single one isn't likely to take anything down very easily but if you can get 4 or 5 of them in a general area with some overlap, anything that ventures into the danger zone will be fucked. 

They also help to give your planes some cushion to fall back into. Put some damage on an enemy plane and your fighter can take the killshot more easily. It puts them on the defensive even if you're not immediately getting a kill out of it."

There's nothing in the Constitution prohibiting secession, and there's nothing in the enumerated powers that allows the president to forcefully stop a state from leaving the union.

[Sasuke wants to](/m ""crush a genocidal system and make sure no one else will go through the hell he and his clan went through"").  Between the two, Sasuke is more righteous then Naruto.  Don't know if that is intentional or if Kishi is a moral hypocrite.

- [Jiraya is an asshole](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold). My head cannon is the Ame siblings left when he got too frisky with Konan. (head cannon 1)

- Karin has a lot of depth potential and is getting the early Tobi treatment (or so I hope, because it would be such a waste).

- Itachi was a terrible brother.  Yes, he did a lot to protect Sasuke, but he was an abusive, negligent, lying bastard!  Sasuke could have easily died in the hotel after Itachi beat him into a coma with broken bones all over.

- Minato is not a good leader (from what we have seen so far).

- Kakashi/Kishimoto seriously pulls horrible double standards with Sasuke's revenge and Shikamaru's revenge.

- Obito would have been one of the most popular villains if he was presented after Zabuza and BEFORE Orochimaru.  The reason he's so hated by manga readers (and pretty soon Anime watchers) is because his loss is nothing NOTHING compared to what Sasuke or Kimmimaru had to go through.

ecclectic,AskReddit,1388559903.0,"First time it was a mutual parting of ways:  I was the dish washer, they had an antiquated dish pit with only a sanitizer, so EVERYTHING had to be hand washed before going into the thing.  I watched a 'chef' take a par cooked steak out of a freezer, nuke it and send it out to a customer.  I put everything through the sanitizer then stacked it on the shelves, and walked out without doing a scrub down.  They never called me to come in, when I finally called them after two weeks and asked if they wanted me to come in, they asked if I really wanted to.  We both declined.

Next time I was laid off for 'renovations' and the restaurant never re-opened.  That was too bad, I really liked that place.

Seasonal work shortage.

Started school, requested to be laid off as my work schedule was starting to seriously interfere with my schooling.

I got laid off when the welding shop I was working in lost it's lease and the owner closed the doors.

I got laid off from another shop due to several major jobs being clawed back due to some cross-border trade issues.

I requested to be laid off from another shop because I needed to be able to seek other employment options when their work pool dried up."

mundabit,ChronicPain,1388560022.0,"I don't really agree with the final part of the metaphore, that once the tires are full everything becomes the patients responsibility, while its true that we all need to be our own health advocates and look after ourselves, we are not the only ones who need to remain involved in our care. I'll return to the car metaphore, You may of filled the tires, but you haven't replaced them, they are still the same old porous tires that get flat often, and if medication was one thing that filled them up, you might have to keep refilling them, for this reason a prescribing doctor is partially responsible for keeping that wheel inflated. Similarly depending on where you live, physical therapy, counselling and other methods mentioned can cost a lot of money, so there is a small amount of responsibility on insurers or public health to provide access to treatments, or else how can we (the patient) be expected to maintain an active role within those treatments and programs. 

The metaphore makes it sound like once we find something that works, that initial pain will never be a problem again, it doesn't talk about how we can experiences flare ups or crashes, sometimes randomly despite a good maintenance and management plan. The metaphore allows room to talk about ""blow outs"" and ""rough surfaces"" that cause unpredictable tire troubles, I think it should of gone over that a bit.

rising_son,Guitar,1388560123.0,"My practice varies from day to day. If I have only a short while to play due to work/other commitments I will sometimes just mess with my Looper to come up with some new licks/riffs/chord progressions, or I will just burn through my main licks, perhaps jam along to some songs too.

Interestingly enough a lot of my practice is done mentally. What I mean by this is when I listen to a song (one which I don't know how to play) I can visualize in my head how the lines/parts/melody are played on the guitar. I spend a lot of time training my ear and transcribing music. If I am doing a long playing session I usually I spend up to an hour transcribing music. This provides me with a change in what I am doing, and allows my hands to rest if I have been doing things to burn chops.

Nothing like some solid time with the metronome working out difficult passages or speed-training myself, I try and do some of this most days, for at least one hour.

Not sure if I am alone here, but some days I just feel as if I am playing like shit so I go for a more theory/mental based practice schedule. E.g. I will do transcriptions/listening sessions/practice improvising over changes. My rationale for this is that I do not practice my mistakes. If I am playing poorly and making mistakes when trying to play fast/hard stuff then I am wasting my time. This is a kind of ""principle"" I have about practicing."

To use it, he first fires out a tracer that travels in a straight path. When it gets to the point you want, you hit the button again, and the actual projectile is fired and will reach its target in ~1.5 seconds (travel time is static across most ranges, there is a minimum speed it will move at). There is no maximum range. It affects a larger AoE the further it travels. You can see this happen in the video, but it's a short distance and so happens very quickly.

Enemies that are hit take a lot of damage and have a DoT and debuff applied to them. Even enemies that the projectile flies over have the DoT and debuff applied to them (though not the huge chunk of damage). The debuff not only prevents all healing but also instantly kills heroes if they drop below 12% of their maximum hitpoints. When fully upgraded, the debuff lasts 17 seconds.

That's the sort of stuff we're talking about. Supports get to have all the fun."

PurpleFrogSundance,IWantOut,1388560690.0,"I did, back in 2007.  I had a bad day at work and wasn't happy.  I had been thinking of moving to NYC for years but it was always 'sometime, when it's right'.  I hadn't been at my job 6months and was hating it.  There was one really bad day, bit of workplace bullying when I was sick and had an assignment due.  This was a Friday.  I resigned on the Monday telling them I was going to work overseas

I had no visas or tickets booked.  The day after my last day (1 week later as I was still in my probation period) I sent off my application for a working visa to the UK.  I decided on London over NYC as there was easier visa options at the time and I wanted to travel more around Europe than the Americas...

It was about 3 months between handing in my resignation and moving - it took that long to get visas sorted and wrap up my life in Australia.  I am now a British citizen too. 

I wasn't happy and I knew I needed a change.  I am really glad I did it but it didn't make me magically happy.  I wanted to change some things, so did some therapy which I loved.  I learned how to really stand on my own two feet and travelled to see some amazing sites...  I had a small setback along the way with being diagnosed with a chronic condition, but it was all worthwhile.  The move was right

The only thing I like to tell people is that the move won't magically make you happy.  And starting over is hard in your 20s - making friends etc.  it's really a great thing to do but go into it with realistic expectations.... :) "

He said ""do not just learn to play something, look at it and try to understand what you are playing"". Greatest advice ever. Learn the names of the notes of the fretboard, learn the chord structure of all the types of chords, learn the scales of every key. Knowing all of these things means you can ""cross reference"" them to each other in your head and learn to interpret everything you read/hear/compose/play. 

This means that when you are reading a score you can say to yourself ""yup this is in DMinor and the chords are X X and X, and for improvisation I should be using X/X/X scales.""

I can't really give a better explanation than this. I was really ""into"" the theory stuff really early on so I kind of just unconsciously learned it while studying music and learning to play the guitar."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388560793.0,"I think you're right that we're leaning toward a progressivism vs libertarianism way of thinking, but to say that people are gonna lean libertarian in the future, I doubt it. A lot of the liberals are NOT flocking to conservatism and libertarianism in the millennial generation. Many are actually finding themselves to the left of he democratic party. That's where I am ending up at least. ACA's failure doesn't make me wanna adopt free market healthcare. It makes me want single payer. Unemployment and a weak economy doesn't make me want an elimination of the minimum wage, it makes me want universal basic income. 

You also seem to be forgetting there are two groups that can be considered liberal in that libertarian poll you posted, both of which combined create a majority favoring big government. While libertarianism is definitely growing among millennials, I still think people who could be considered progressives probably outnumber them by a significant margin, even if many are becoming disenchanted."

*You don't forget moments like these. Every scent, every sound, every little pinpoint of light in the sky. I had hoped to forget this moment. A night of harmless fun turned to blackness. I sat in the driver's seat leaning back on the headrest looking up into the sky. I may have felt it then, but I didn't know what it was.*

""Show me your hands! Do it now!""

*It was beautiful. I don't know where I was at that moment, but I sure as hell was not in that convertible. I think I was up there, in the stars. It was beautiful. The stars were singing to me. I'm sure on some level I was aware of the smell of burnt rubber, gasoline and grass, or the sound of idling diesel engines, boots shuffling on the asphalt and dirt, tense voices shouting for compliance. But I was up there, in the stars.*

*The driver side door opened with the sound of unhappy metal scraping against metal. I came back. I came back so fast that I didn't even notice the police, or their guns. I came back from the stars so quickly that I startled the rookie's trigger finger. Back to the stars I went.*

Charlie woke, and slid to the edge of the bed, his feet resting on the cool hardwood floor. The world refused to focus. To his eyes everything seemed to glow with the comforting golden hue of early morning. He felt a presence behind him in the bed and knew without looking that it was her.

Lisa.

The world seemed wrong.

""What time is it?"" Charlie asked.

""It's morning. Always morning. Don't want to wake up."" Lisa said with a contented sigh.

He always told me though, it didn't matter to him what I called him as long as I treated him with love and respect. I learned much from him :)"

From what I've read in reddit some three ways go swimmingly but lots do not. I don't want to be a couple that does not.

The third: what happens when you short out the electronics? Well, worst-case, it was that electrical charge holding things in a safe fashion. Your electrical short might have just pulled the pin/ allowed to explode that thing you didn't want exploding.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388561081.0,"I think we would disagree in implementation though.

Libertarians would likely propose a smaller UBI, probably one just to cover current government spending, while progressives would want a more comprehensive UBI package. Keep in mind, progressives care about the poor, while libertarians care more about reducing government spending and bireaucracy. I could see them being against any...well...decent UBI plan on the whole. Screaming taxation is theft and all that crap. I think they'd be more likely to support a UBI around $6-10k, while a liberal would want one closer to $12-15k.

Libertarians are more likely to also promote eliminating the minimum wage in tandem with UBI based on my discussions in the r/basicincome sub."

The thing about Air China is that, once you are in the air, no one gives a flying fuck (hurrr) about what you do on the plane as long as it's within reason. Old people congregate in the back to do tai ji-esque stretches, little kids tear up and down the aisles, and the lucky bastards from first class smuggle goodies down to the relatives in economy. People also tend to get up and help themselves to beverages, and the stewardesses ain't even mad. 
 Well, I decided that the best way to while away the 15 hour flight was to slam some nyquil and sleep it out. Imagine my surprise when, several hours in, I am rudely awakened.... by a flying slice of mayonnaise-sodden ham to the face. *splat*. I jerk awake, and see that my compatriots (both 17) are absolutely shit-faced off of pilfered tsingtao and vodka. The next few hours consisted of me trying to subdue the two sloshed Americans- forcibly taking their dismantled sandwich projectiles, belting them down to keep them from climbing over our neighbors, returning stolen items and trying to keep one from stripping her piss and puke stained off all the while trying to shakily communicate in Mandarin my deepest apologies on behalf of the incapacitated classmates. It was hell on earth, but I do have to chuckle.

The project is being led by primarily by a team who has never worked on manned spaceflight. When asked for specifics, Bas Lansdorp has only responded with vague and poetic answers. The small portion of their mission architecture that they actually revealed looks like it was thrown together by someone with no idea what they're doing. Lansdrop has been caught in a number of lies and half truths about the project (EX: Claiming they're partnered with SpaceX, SpaceX has denied this. Claiming that Astrobotic is [""a very established aerospace company""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tw2fy/i_am_bas_lansdorp_cofounder_of_marsone_mankinds/cec1q49), Astrobotic has never built anything that has flown into space. etc). 

Lansdrop has again and again showed how little he knows about manned spaceflight (when ever someone asks about a real and serious concern he brushes it off with more vague and poetic answers). [Lansdrop has bragged about having endorsements](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tw2fy/i_am_bas_lansdorp_cofounder_of_marsone_mankinds/cec5bwt) from people who's field of expertise [is completely unrelated to manned spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_%27t_Hooft). Their cost estimate is too low and Lansdorp has declined to reveal the specifics on how he arrived on that amount. 

His plan to raise capital is fundamentally flawed and he believes that that viewership wouldn't decrease after the first mission despite NASA's experience with what happened during the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. Initially they claimed they were going to raise capital through private investors. Than it was revealed that they were charging applicants. They were unable to raise $400,000 for concept studies (which is why they resulted to crowdfunding) but they continue to claim that they think they will still be able to raise the billions of dollars they need for actual missions.

&gt;I know that there is a possibility this being a fail or even a scam, but still, I'd rather be supportive until shown it's a failure, rather than bash them, for trying.

For hours, they had traded leads, each one stretching the distance over the other for a few miles until the other found something deep within himself, that primal thing that drives men from the brink of defeat and delivers them the promise of victory. Both men were on pace to shatter the world record, and media outlets that had brushed off the annual race as nothing out of the ordinary found themselves scrambling to proclaim this feat of human excellence as extraordinary. Within the sweat and sinew of these men, there was the possibility that, perhaps, man could place himself outside of his limits, transcend the confines of his own frailness and mortality. The footsteps of the runners were heavy as if carrying the weight of this belief, this hope of every man, woman, and child that they, too, could achieve great and beautiful things. And as the spectators could hear the ragged breathing of the two men who approached the finish line, the world holds its collective breath, waiting to see who would fall and who would be immortalized as the triumph of human will and determination. The two men, sensing the desperation of the other, break into a sprint with neither having an inch on the other. The camera flashes. One man falls. The other embraces him. And somewhere behind them, among the hundreds still running the race, I am thinking to myself, ""This was a big mistake.""

k-dingo,Fitness,1388561770.0,"&gt; Tracking weight loss isn't easy for a beginner- they don't know how to ignore the noise of day to day water weight swings and THD gets in to all that.

As do numerous other texts.  Set up a spreadsheet, create a 7-day or 14-day moving average column, and plot the result.  A big part of the challenge is simply having patience.  And you don't need the rest of Walker's crapfest for that.

Hell, I've just looked through the spreadsheets he's got -- what, a dozen or more?   Total fucking overkill.  [Jeremy Zawodny does it in one](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/006851.html).  I used awk, gnuplot, and a simple textfile.   **It's not that fucking complicated.**

And as I said:  the rest of the book is crap.  Walker doesn't have a background in nutrition, diet, sports physiology, or anything else remotely resembling health and fitness.   It's written at the height of the ""fat is evil, weightlifting is bad for you"" 1980s.  Yes, he managed to lose weight.  But:

* Nowhere in the book do the words ""protein"" or ""carbohydrate"" appear.  You'll find lots of mentions of fat, but few of those pertain to macronutrients.  The references I've given _all_ give ample dietary advice.   Starting with the basics.
* There's no strength training component at all.  The exercises given are, sorry, crap.  Look for the words ""squat"" or ""deadlift"".  Nope.  ""Barbell"".  Nope?  How about ""pull-up"" (in any of its variants).  Nope.  ""Pushups"" makes a single appearance -- but it's not an encouraging one.

Really:  this material has nothing to recommend for itself other than 1) a geek wrote it and 2) it's one of the earlier fitness guides to be freely posted online.  It's like trying to fly to the moon based on Aristotelian physics.  Sure, you might land there, but it's got nothing to do with the value of the information you're getting.

As for what people are concerned about:  the first thing you've got to realize in a _lot_ of areas is that the shit people care about **doesn't matter.**  And you don't solve the problem of crap information by filling them with _more_ crap information.

And sorry:  tracking weight is bog fucking simple.  You get up in the morning.  You weight yourself.  You write it down.  And then you fucking forget about that specific day's weight for two weeks.

If, two weeks on, you're up a couple of pounds, register the fact and forget about for _another_ two weeks.  If you're down a couple of pounds, fucking hallelujah!  A month on (that's your 2nd 2 week period), _then_ you can start getting concerned.

Because you're looking at gaining or losing 1-2 pounds every week.  There's a lot of daily variance.  And the small daily changes _don't fucking matter_.

That's the no-spreadsheet version.  And it works.  Now, if you _do_ want to see how you're trending, figure out how to plot a fucking 7 day moving average and get over yourself.

The shit you _should_ be focusing on is eating healthy (solving 75% of your challenge right there), sane quantities, and following an exercise program that fits your goals (oh yeah:  where in Walker's fucking Shakesperean sonnet of a fitness masterpiece does he ever discuss goals -- _other_ than ""weight loss""?  Turns out there's a lot of the former, including a whole painfully LaTeX-defined table of ""optimum weight goals"" for men and women -- which are complete and total bullshit).

The reason I crap all over the book is because it's a *bad book*.  It's overly complicated, it's incomplete, it's totally suboptimal.  It's got bad (or no) science in it.

Does this mean someone can't lose weight following what's in it?  No, I didn't say that.  But what they _won't_ gain is vastly more complete understanding of overall fitness, including *an understanding of why weight loss in and of itself really isn't a useful fitness goal.*

Fuck.  The /r/fitness FAQ is a vastly superior resource.  And it's free and right here."

mundabit,ChronicPain,1388561810.0,"I'm also in my early 20's and have Fibro, i'm sorry to hear you have so many other issues on top of that, I know fibro is bad enough on its own. I've used a cane most of my life due to a hip deformity, and because I can't drive I use a disability-frienfly recumbent bycle as sort of my version of a wheelchair, I still have very good mobility and as my main condition isn't degenerative I never put much thought into a placard.

I had one a while ago before the system was changed around, My Dad had a ""carers"" placard that allowed him to park in disabled spaces for 15 minutes so he could pick me up or drop me off, But For some reason *I* am personally not entitled to a placard.

I'm in two minds, I don't need one because with my forearm, crutches my mobility is like that of a normal person. However, trying to get out of a car in a normal space is a tight squeeze and it would be nice to have a closer space.

If I bring my crutches, I need a space for the extra width, If I don't bring my crutches, I need a space for the proximity. It made me think that getting a placard 'just in case' might be a good idea, But again, for some reason I don't meet the criteria. Its a bit silly. 

Its a tough one, I *always* get told I'm lazy and fat when I opt for the elevator over the stairs or whatever, and I'm self conscious enough to be bothered by that. But I shouldn't be. Its my body, It will tell me when the stairs are too much.

I think you only really realise that your condition is severe enough to need something after you give it a try. take the elevator, park closer, use a scooter, then reflect on how you feel today after taking those options, vs last time when you toughed it out.

My partner bought me my crutches because he had planned a hike for the holidays and he wanted me to join him. I was in two minds, last hike he planned I could barely go 500m, it took me an hour and I had to go back, which took me 45 minutes. 

After getting the crutches My partner's friend made all sorts of rude comments about how I was ""giving up"", ""getting old"" or ""being pathetic"". But a 8.6km uphill hike and a 9.2km return trip downhill-*during a pain flare* in about 4.5 hours later and I can say with confidence that My disability is better off when I use an aid. *I* am better off when I use aids. I get more out of life from listening to my body and realising that taking the elevator means I can visit an extra shop, parking closer means I can carry a few extra items, Using the scooter means I can take my time and make sure I have everything, and using my crutches means I can go further (and faster) than I ever have.

If you are eligible, even for a temporary one, get it, try it, reflect on how it has changed you. If you are able to get more out of your day because of it then there is nothing wrong with using it."

tyhopkin,CHIBears,1388561858.0,"&gt; Technique: Jay has a tendency to throw off his back leg instead of planting his feet and throwing square. This leads to careless throws and most of Jay's interceptions.

Agreed, but mechanics can be fixed.

&gt; Pocket Presence: Did you notice Josh sensing pressure and running or throwing the ball away but Jay standing there like a deer in headlights and taking the sack?

Josh took more sacks per pass against lesser defenses than Jay did against better defenses.


&gt; Leadership: According to Marshall on every TD Jay says, ""You're welcome,"" instead of ""thank you."" It's the little things like taking responsibility for your interceptions and picking the team up when they are down. Jay made strides in this area this year but has a lot of room for improvement.

Really, do you really think he says this every time he throws a TD?  I listened to Marshall talk about it on the Jay Cutler Show, it was them two joking around.

&gt; Decision Making: Jay tends to favor Marshall over the field and when you have the amount of talent that overshadows Earl Bennett, he should be spreading the rock around more and not just starring down Brandon. The interceptions that aren't technique are most likely from poor decisions.  

Do people fault Stafford for favoring Calvin Johnson?  Up until this year Marshall is all he had last year.  Jeffery, Forte and M Bennet have all had career years in receiving yards and receptions.


&gt; Injury Prone: Jay has been hurt almost every year lately. Yes he is tuff and plays through pain (when he shouldn't) but he also gets hurt a lot.

Injuries happen, he's far from being labeled as injury prone.  

&gt; Who do we replace him with? People try but that answer is so subjective and easy to ridicule. No one has a good answer to that question. The bottom line is with our O-line, receivers, and Forte anyone should look good at QB. Trestman is known for getting the most out of his QBs and with Cutler and McCown they both had their best year yet in 2013. The question I keep avoiding, who do we replace Cutler with? I'm an NIU grad so I wanna say Jordan Lynch or Chandler Harnish as a free agent but in reality I trust Phil and Marc to be able to identify and bring in ""their"" guy. I liked Cutler when we traded for him. I made excuses for him for three years. I stopped making excuses last year and wouldn't mind a 3-4 year below market value contract but if Jay wants more money than that I'd like to see whom Marc Trestman and Phil Emery hand pick. I'd be okay with either Jay, Josh, and draft pick or Josh, Jordan Palmer, and draft pick.

Having the worst O line and squad of receivers, mulitple OCs in as many years...those are pretty good excuses.  No QB thrives in those conditions.

My small setup:
Upper right corner is all [Elementary](http://flyinghyrax.deviantart.com/art/Elementary-Rainmeter-1-5-1-244031084), the clock is somewhat modified.  
Lower right is the alternative [Launcher](http://rainbowhoovez.deviantart.com/art/Launcher-2-1-5-408325917) for [Rainbow Theme 7](http://rainbowhoovez.deviantart.com/art/Rainbow-Theme-7-Clean-With-Wallpaper-327775998), which i changed to match the font of Elementary.

So what do i do about that task bar down there? The thing is, i like having it full of icons and always up when i'm actually doing things, but the desktop looks so much nicer when it's hidden away. What to do what to do?

Deadpool isn't Batman: Arkham Anything, but I loved the quips and one liners, and I had such a good time shooting and chopping people up that I played through the campaign again with all my stats and weapons maxed.

I let the performance slide for a couple years because people like yourself kept leaping to his defense that it takes time to make the transition to 3-4. They had four years and despite adding a couple pro bowlers, the defense continued to get worse.

I don't blame Haslett for our lack of depth at Safety, however, I do blame him when our defense as a whole looks undisciplined and performs among the worst in the league *and continues to get worse*. Even when we had a very good offense, our defense sucked, breaking the franchise's recently history of having a reliable defense.

celiviel,Team_Japanese,1388562147.0,"皆さん、明けましておめでとうございます!

I'm studying Japanese because my in-laws are Japanese and most of them don't speak English! I've been trying to learn for years now and every time I just hit a wall and can't keep going, no matter what method I use. I've done self-study with about four different textbooks (including Genki), I've tried a tutor, and I just haven't been able to stick with it. I'm hoping this will be the kick in the pants I need.

Right now I can read hiragana and katakana, and some Kanji. I can read some Chinese as well, so sometimes I know what the Kanji mean without knowing how it's read in Japanese. I know the basic greetings, some basic sentences, and a bunch of random vocabulary.

I think a good, manageable goal for me this year would be a) establish a consistent, sustainable study routine, and b) to get through Genki I, including the workbook. I think I will also change strategies slightly. Previously I've spent a lot of time copying columns of kana and kanji, but I think I'll skip that this time around. I'll still write as part of the Genki exercises (and writing by hand is the least important skill to me right now anyways).

* **CPU:** Updated Haswell Generation

* **CPU Cooler:** NZXT Respire T40 is a superior alternative to the 212 Evo.

* **Motherboard:** LGA 1150 AsRock Extreme4 is no longer available on deal, so I grabbed the durable, trusty alternative from ASUS.

* **RAM:** Cheaper, alternative equivalent.

* **Storage:** Only need one SSD, two is a waste and inefficient. 2TB mass storage.

* **Video Card:** Arguably the best overal GTX 760 model, how ever the EVGA 760 ACX Superclocked for $255 overclocks better.

* **Case:** Grabbed a slightly more expensive, nicer looking case. Personal preference.

* **OS:** Please, get W8.1 instead. No one here is pretending that W7 is superior when W8 has a few FPS advantage in games. You can use Startisback, or Classic Shell to make your system feel like W7.

**Good luck!**"

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388562386.0,"Here's the thing with me. I'm an ex conservative. I understand conservative mindsets, and even libertarian ones (since i dabbled in that for a little while) fairly well. The thing is, since I myself made a transition from such views to liberalism, I also know everything wrong with such a perspective, and generally see it as misinformed. QUite frankly, the views I criticize most harshly are the ones I used to hold but don't any more. Because I rejected them for a reason. I guess my problem isn't that I don't understand the arguments for the most part, it's that I got dillahunty syndrome in addressing them (in other words, compassion fatigue, or a general short temper and low attention span/tolerance level of hearing the same old arguments and debunking them over and over again). And quite frankly, to an extent, there's just an ideological barrier there. I understand that libertarians, for example, place a high value on things like property rights and liberty, to the point that such views are taken to their extreme logical ends at times. The problem is, I don't do that with such ideas. I think that such ideas need to be balanced with other priorities and consequences that many of them don't see as important at all. If I have a preference for apples and they have a preference for oranges, how am I do actually talk to them on common ground? To an extent, the differences between different views go all the way down to what the other person values, and how much. The problem is, if I'm not in ideological agreement, being able to empathize is pointless. You can understand their argument, you just don't care about what they value and vice versa. You can't have an argument with a libertarian about wealth distribution if they don't think inequality is a problem, for instance. They're not gonna convince me of the evils of taxation if I see it as a necessity in order to reign in the unrestrained problems of capitalism that they don't even recognize. You're just gonna talk past one another.

Just saying, the snarky responses can come from a variety of things, and it's not always ignorance of another person's position. Sometimes it comes from a form of compassion fatigue/burnout, or because there's just no common ground to be had."

NOW YOU'RE REALLY LIVING SHORT STORY

PROLOGUE
Keep walking

A rusted sign creaked in the wind above a street littered with abandoned cars, its faded letters indicating a twenty four hour drive-through restaurant. A lizard sun-baked on the hood of a white Toyota, flicking its tongue out lazily as the man walked by. The sun beat down on their backs. 
He passed boarded up houses and bloodstained lawns, the yellow grass rustling quietly. There was something leant over a swing in a front yard, swaying gently as a soft breeze passed over it. 
A small brick home with blocked up front doors had ""DEAD"" painted crudely on the windows in what appeared to be red paint. A shadow passed across the blinds slowly, cast from within, but he kept walking.
*The world kept walking* Rory thought to himself, *and so do the dead*...

CHAPTER ONE
A sickness



By the time he'd reached the shed, the sun had begun to dip below the horizon and a few dead had gathered at the front gate.

As he neared them, they turned, noticing him, and started shuffling toward him, slowly picking up speed and grunting. Fear crept into his heart, but he steeled himself. He'd done this many times before, but it never got easier. It wasn't hard to forget they were people once.

*You can do this Rory* he danced on his toes.

There was four, their rotted flesh reeking in the afternoon heat. One with a broken ankle started to lag behind the others, but the other three were about five meters away from him.

He began to back away, pulling a hatchet from his belt, wielding it one handedly.

*Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough.* 

Darting right, he closed in on a walker with a missing arm and swung the hatchet at its head, embedding it in its skull, sending gore into the air. The walker fell backwards, ripping the weapon from his hands, leaving him unarmed. 

*Fuck.*

He ran toward the gate, opened it quickly and ducked inside . While he fastened the latch from the other side of the fence, the three walkers slammed against the gate, jerking him back before he got chance to close it properly.

He tripped, fell on his backside  and started scrambling away, yelling for assistance from the large green shed behind him.

""Help! Walkers!"" His heart raced.

He heard the big door open and then suddenly the walkers were on him. They dropped, grabbing at his legs and he kicked one in the face, another one in the chest while the walker with the busted leg was shot in the head by an arrow. 

""Fuck off!"" he yelled, kicking at them as they started grabbing his legs again, trying to bite him. He kneed one in the chin, spurting blood as it bit its own tongue off. The other got its head cleaved on two as John ran up with another hand-axe.
 
""Fucking hell, Rory!"" John exclaimed, shoving the walker off him and burying the axe in the side of the its head. The severed head at Rory's side started to gnash when he stood up and dusted himself off. He walked outside the front gate and retrieved his hatchet. As he walked back, John pulled his arrow out of the walker's skull, and wiped it on the grass. Rory strolled over to the head and stopped its biting with a look of disgust on his face.



The most redneck Australian Rory knew, John Bowron used to live down the road on a sheep farm, keeping small caliber guns and bows. He met him scavenging in town and they struck up a friendship of sorts, ending them up in the then unconverted shearing shed.



As dusk settled, they began to head inside.

""What the hell was that?"" He spat angrily while pulling Rory inside.
 
""What the hell was not having someone at the gate?!"" Rory retorted.
""Kim's in a bad state and we've all been running off our feet trying to look after her and stop Claire and Ella from ripping each other's throats out."" John softened.

""A bad state?"" Rory asked, concern in his voice.

""See for yourself,"" he said, stepping inside the shed.



The shed was about twenty by sixty metres, dark green with two main entrances. On the longer side facing the road, about  four fifths of the wall was large sliding doors. On the shorter side facing the sheep yards was another sliding door, large but not as big, at the top of a ramp that lead into the yards. Out the front was a gravel driveway of sorts, an area about the same width of the shed but longer on the side opposite the yards. It had two gates to the road, one directly parallel the main door, the other at the longer end of the driveway, not parallel to the shed. 
Inside there were two main parts. The board, and the concrete garage. They weren't separated in any way other than height, the board (a term for the platform shearers shear sheep on, it wasn't actually just a piece of wood) was about a metre above the ground and similar to a deck or patio and made of wood. It took up close to one third of the shed, the third closest to the sheep yards. On the board was a series of small pens with regular fences, and then a wall instead of a fence where the actual board began. On the forefront half of the board were two shearing areas, which had a set of swinging doors apiece leading into the catching pens, next to a hole in the deck with a ramp leading down to the ground called a release chute, where the shearers sent the shorn sheep. They led out under the catching pens and into the sheep yards.

The 'garage' half was an open concrete area, housing two large tractors, a wool press (something that compresses lots of sheep wool into a square bail), some scrap and a small corner of very cluttered kitchen.



Rory stepped inside after John, and saw what he meant. Kim was propped up against the far wall in her bed, asleep, with an unhealthy pallor and sweat dripping from her brow. It was hot in the shed. Lucas and Sam were sitting by her, worried looks on their faces. When they saw Rory, they stood up and walked over to him.  Ella and Claire were arguing in hushed tones by the kitchen. John walked over to them to sort it out.
 
""What's going on?"" Rory asked Lucas.

He was wringing his hands nervously. ""She got a bit of a temperature this morning after you left, had a lie down and hasn't got up for anything except the toilet since. She says she's been feeling weak and has been eating and drinking heaps, but her temperature has risen quite a lot, she said she's got a headache but when we gave her a Panadol it didn't affect her, I don't know what's going on.""

""Calm down Lucas, I'm sure it's nothing. Was she bit?""

""No not at all, I don't understand and we're really worried."" He looked at Sam, his nine year old son. Sam looked about as distressed as his father sounded.

""Listen, it'll be fine, let me have a look at her."" Rory walked over to the beds where Kim was lying down.



After Rory and John moved in, they took out the tractors and wool press and parked them in the paddock behind the shed along with all the scrap and useless stuff cluttering up the kitchen, and began to make it liveable. They stole carpets and rugs from abandoned houses and layered the concrete floor with them, making a patchwork quilt ground, stole mattresses and bedding and put them up against the far wall, and did a whole lot of cleaning. They had to clean away all the sheep shit, because it was *everywhere* on the board. Then they took out all the fences and gates and so on until there was nothing but a wooden deck with two holes in it, which they built trapdoors over and used as semi-secret back doors. They also added carpets and rugs over what they now referred to as 'upstairs'. 
"
mundabit,ChronicPain,1388562408.0,"I always like to devide my pain locally and systematically. This burn on my arm hurts maybe a 7-8, But its only hurting my arm. however my back pain is shooting all over my body, so even though its a dull 5-6, its a 5-6 all over and its worse than a local 8 in that regard. 

The location also matters, If I have pain in my elbow that is a 6, that's not as bad as having knee pain that is a 6, because I can sling up my arm and let it rest, My knee tends to get used even if I try to rest it.

Duration of pain is also important, I get chest pains that are a 9, I can't move, I can't breathe, it is the worst pain I have ever experienced, But they have never lasted longer than 15 minutes, so I'm fine with that. My abdominal pain can be as low as a 4 some days, but It is never ending, I always have it, so even at a 4 I am in agony from how unrelenting it is.

I have many types of pain, I learned recently I need to get better at describing it when I was talking to my mother and complained of these annoying ""kneading sensations"" in my gut, she laughed and said ""got period cramps huh?"" and I looked at her funny and said ""no, aren't cramps really sharp stabbing pains across your entire lower abdomen, like Edward scissor hands is kneading you?""  Woops, Turned out for my entire life when I was saying ""this feels like cramps"" I was giving people the wrong idea of what the pain was, they may of thought I had some dull kneading, where in reality I was experiencing a sharp stabbing. I thought that abdominal cramps were as sharp as leg cramps."

""Hey Kim,"" Rory said softly as he crouched down beside her.

""Hey, captain,"" she whispered softly. ""Seems I'm in a bit of strife."" A weak smile played over her lips.

""Nonsense,"" he reassured her. ""You'll be alright. Just keep drinking water and resting up, you'll come good in no time.""

As Lucas closed the big sliding door, Rory heard the argument in the corner grew louder and more heated. He looked around.

""You better go deal with that, cap'n,"" Kim said patting his hand. ""Like you said, I'll be fine.""

He smiled back at her. ""Tell if you need anything.""

""Will do."" She fell asleep almost instantly after taking a drink of some water.

Rory stood up straight and strolled over to the argument. 
They were fighting about Kim.

""-May as well, we all know she's going to die anyway."" Claire.

""That's absurd! We don't even know what she has!"" John. The voice of reason. He'd matured a lot over the years.

""Yeah, Claire, what's the point of - Rory! Tell her she's wrong!"" Ella, most likely siding against Claire just for the point of it. 

""Whoa, whoa, what's going on here?"" 

""We need to kill Kim before she eats everyone!""

""That's a bit extreme Claire!""  Rory exclaimed.
 
""That's what we've been saying!"" John and Ella said in unison.

""She's eating all our food and water,"" Claire harrumphed, clearly outnumbered. 

""Water's not a problem, you know that, and she can't be eating that much, can she?"" Rory turned to John.

""It's true,"" he shrugged. 

Rory frowned. ""Well, here comes Lucas and Sam so you'd better shut up about this killing anyone business."" Rory went to ask Kim about the food situation. 



Water *wasn't* a problem. The house next to the farm the shed was on  belonged to Rory, so he knew it inside out.  There was a tap on the outside of the house at ground level which connected to the water tank and was gravity fed, so every day one of them made a trip and filled up a few buckets of water. The house wasn't on the mains water system so they had a access to all the water in the clouds.

Food was, currently, a small issue, and not just because of Kim's eating habits.

The farm was located between fish creek and sandy point, a small town and a small beach. The population number written on the sign was 276, but houses and farms lay in between the small town and the two beach towns. Most of them were thinly populated and easy to raid for imperishables. The closer to town however, the more walkers. The more walkers, the harder it got to sneak around looking for tins of soup and packets of ramen. 



Rory walked over to the sleeping area and sat down on a mattress. He sighed. Kim was asleep, and all he wanted to do was follow suit. God he was tired. 

*Tomorrow I'll...* was the last thing he thought before he dozed off."

We haven't heard the Uchiha side of the coup at all!  We only heard about it from those who opposed it.

There was a very legitimate reason the Uchiha ran the coup (hopefully not an excuse to keep Sasuke away from Naruto, Kishi wrote himself into moral ability with that one).

With Sasuke's position, I wanted to hear him complain not just about the suffering of his brother, but the suffering of his whole clan.  That was the entire point of part 1; avenging the fallen.  Bringing justice to them.  No one can stand up for their existence then Sasuke and that is what hurts.

Also,  unless you have an awesome resume to back yourself up the Peace Corps isn't going to consider you without a degree. And you don't just ""join the Peace Corps"". You put in an application, maybe 6 months later they call you in for an interview, and then maybe in another 6 months you get an offer. Then you go through legal clearance, medical clearance, etc... And finally you might get posted after that.

Anyway, you're also not bound to a 4-year university right off the bat. You can work for a while, see how that fits you, go to a community college for 2 years and see if that's enough and if it isn't you can transfer to a 4-year university (or go to a trade school if that's more your thing).

As a High School graduate, you're not very competitive when everyone else has a higher degree. If you can find an employer that is willing to take the chance on you, or you're entrepreneurial yourself then that's great, but you have more of a safety net if you have an education. "
Fogest,relationships,1388563056.0,"Personally I would not take it as too big of a deal. He was requested to do a trick at a function he was being paid to entertain at. Sure he could have said no, but he was probably in the moment and was out to entertain and didn't think too much of it. He probably felt a ton of guilt after.

It sounds like he really cares because he came clean with you and told you about it right away. This shows that he cares about you, and he probably feels pretty bad for breaking a promise he made to you. 

Remember, he could just not have told you about what he did. The fact that he did tell you really should mean a lot to you. He cares about you and didn't want to hurt you."

Gertiel,NoStupidQuestions,1388563182.0,"I hate to say this, but a fun vacation rarely happens without a bit of planning beforehand. You can pay someone else to do it for you by purchasing a package tour. Many people are very happy with them. Your other choice is to look into things online and make your own plans. The good thing about your own plans is you can suit yourself. I've helped a lot of friends plan great vacations. It really isn't as hard as you might think with all the great online resources available today.

You mention Orlando. There is a lot to do there and plenty of online sites to help you plan there. If you choose a location in California, you will probably be able to find a lot on that as well. Start with each of you making a list of the things you want to do. Go online and look up when it is open and where it is located. When you have a short list, you can start to pick out what days you will do what. Once you've picked days and where you want to do things during your visit, time to pick a hotel. I usually just go onto google maps, locate the most important things I'm interested in doing. Next center the map between them and search ""hotels"". You can also look on Expedia, Travelocity, and the like to pick out a package deal.

Edit to add: If you'd like to get started and then ask specific questions, I will be happy to help as well as I can. I love travel and love to see others enjoy it as well."

Shacod,dayz,1388563736.0,"I got to play out 2 spawns today. I spawned slightly east of Elektro the first time, gathered up some very basic supplies, only to be gunned down by some bandit proning on the top of a building abusing 3rd person to see the city while no one could see him. He was just unloading his M4 into anyone who came by, the 3 bodies on the ground were what made me curious.

The second spawn I spawned slightly west of Elektro, went into Elektro to get some supplies, then went to Cherno expecting more people there, but it was dead. Cherno didn't yield me many supplies so I went to Balota. No one was there, so I was able to loot the military building furthest from the town of Balota with no issues. Next I went into the satellite/radio tower and got to the top floor, looked around for 5 seconds, then listened to 5 M4s load a magazine below me. I looked down the stairwell as 5 fully geared bandits logged in and shot me down before i had a chance to draw a weapon.

To be honest, nothing much has changed from what I've normally experienced. Usually Cherno and Elektro were mostly dead whenever I went to them, and Balota either had nobody there, a group of people there, or a group of people logging in to be there. I don't know my way around anywhere north because I never played the mod, so I can't tell you what's going up there."

 On the flipside, I grew up in a mobile home with my parents and my sister, and we had this hallway where if you wanted to get to the bathroom, **you had to step-jump over a hole in the floor** (you could see the ground outside through it). In winter, my dad would put a piece of plywood over it ""to keep out the cold."" It didn't work. 


I associate having children with being poor and cold. I already spent part of my life like that, I have zero desire to do it again.

We can just go catch a movie or something.""

Keep it nice and casual. If she has feelings for you she will probably go for it. If she doesn't then she will say no. At this point you can decide to keep talking to her and maintain a friendship, or you can drift away from her and stop texting her as much and let her go. 

I say go out for a date due to your mixed feelings. You want to find out more about her and see what she is like in person. Make sure you like hanging out with her! This is the only way you will really figure out this whole situation. "

tangerinelion,introvert,1388563992.0,"Depends on your commute.  I went to college in the same town I grew up, so it didn't make any sense for me to move out and I have far less debt than most people my age because of that.  

But I find it hard to think that a single dorm room is a better solution.  While you're not sharing it with anyone, you only have a room in a large collection of rooms.  There's still a lot of noisy college shit going on, all you have to do is open your door.  Instead of being disrupted by your parents/brother, you're disrupted by a lot of young, drunk college kids.

I see two different solutions working: 

1) Saying this to your parents.  You want to be autonomous, independent.  You know that living with them saves you a lot of money, which you are very interested in doing so that when you do move out you will be successful.  

2) Moving to an apartment off-campus.  This comes down to money.  An apartment is almost certainly cheaper, and you don't need a meal plan but on the other hand it isn't rolled into your college bill so you may find it more difficult to pay.  Though by that I mean, you can't incur as much debt so you are left with less debt upon graduation.  You're also responsible for feeding yourself, which I assume you don't do the grocery shopping and though you may cook occasionally you're not responsible for making everything you eat.

On the other hand, if your post actually meant ""Reddit, I'm so attractive I would be getting laid constantly but my parent's keep blocking me.  Should I move out to get laid all the time?"" then the answer is obviously yes.  And incur debt to do so."

And I'm certainly not going to even consider changing my opinion after your post. You just came on and trolled me, and told me that I'm wrong.

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1388564453.0,"My family moved to New Hampshire because the public education in California was not doing us any favors. The only thing I think I like about New Hampshire was the education did save us. My siblings and I went to public school out here and it opened a lot more doors for us. 

**HOWEVER**

I'm from the west coast, and actually grew up in Oregon (we did end up in Cali but that is a long story) - I'm used to people being friendly and care-free almost. Here in New England people are almost snooty. 

The rednecks out here are as if Seinfeld and God a had a design committee. 

The weather is schizophrenic. We had a Nor'Easter which dumped 8"" of snow on us then a blizzard which dropped another 6"" within 3 days of one another... the other day it rained heavily icing all that shit over and now we get to expect a foot of snow this Thursday. 

Also, not to mention, the cost of living out here is OBSCENE. In Oregon you paid rent and electric and waste removal. AT least where I was everything in OR shit was inclusive in the rent. Almost unheard of in most of New England. 

In NH we pay rent (which in this part of the country is ridiculously expensive. Where I am a studio apartment averages $900 monthly and that is for a shitty broom closet with tilted floors), trash removal, water, propane for cooking and hot water, heating oil, electric and sewage all separately. Its fucked up. This is part of the reason I haven't moved out yet is because my parents need what little income I have and even when I Was working 2 jobs averaging 70 hours a week I still couldn't afford to live on my own. 

I'm just glad I get to look forward to moving back to Oregon this June.

Why the recent ""scandal""? Well, that's a little more embarassing for the US people, than it is for our government. We, as the people of the US, just forgot. Literally, that's what happened. We forgot that we gave our government our permission to do that. Then people found out again, and got upset. That was the whole process. I wish there was some dark evil conspiracy or something, but the patriot act had a huge backing when it was passed. There was massive public support for it. And then we forgot. Because we have no attention span.

It does take time, though, and at the end of RTK1, you have no practical skills in reading, writing or speaking Japanese apart from an extremely rudimentary idea of the meaning of each kanji. After that, you rote a bunch of readings, and you'll still have no idea when each applies.

Something like, you notice a waiter looks like this dude that did this one thing that's an awesome story yadda yadda yadda? 

ERRR no! Normal people don't do this, normal people shape and tailor what they talk about to what naturally comes up and in the spirit of the conversation at the time.

The only time one plans a conversation to trigger key areas etc is a job interview.

PixelLight,AskWomen,1388564841.0,"Titty fucking or a handjob? If the dick is big enough that's about all you're gonna be able to do. Well, and lick it I guess but sucking it is pretty much off the list, you wouldn't get much in your mouth. I don't see the pleasure in licking it and if you've got smaller tits then titty fucking is out too.

If you do get naked with a guy with a big dick you do have options that can help with penetrative sex. Tons of foreplay, lube and different positions are the most well known. Of course, if he's really that big(very unlikely, probably less than 1 in a thousand) then I guess there's not much you can do but it'd be rare."

TrustMyOpinion,relationships,1388564878.0,"Hey, listen. I'm 22. Have been sober for almost three years. Your therapist is going to suggest AA for him. The whole idea of the program is to get the alcoholic OUTSIDE of him/herself, because the problem isn't the drinking. The drinking was a solution for a little while and then a heavy burden that I could not stop. The drinking was a symptom. The REAL problem is the alcoholic himself.

""Selfishness, self-centeredness. That, we think, is the root of our troubles."" From the big book of Alcoholics Anonymous. 

The steps are a guide to living. The steps are designed to help the alcoholic integrate principles such as honesty, willingness, integrity, humility, etc. into the alcoholics life, which will lead them to a higher power of their own understanding who can solve their problem by a daily reprieve. Different, I know. But it works. My higher power started out as LOVE, and I grew to believe in God. I had to be willing to believe in SOMEthing greater than myself, or else... How could I be rid of the damn selfishness? Some people even use the wisdom of the group as their higher power. To each their own!!

Step nine deals with making amends. ""Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injur them or others."" This includes YOU, OP. And anyone else he has caused harm to along his road. 

It will be a long, hard journey. You must be prepared that your SO may not stay sober. Most alcoholics don't, unfortunately. If he doesn't, his selfishness will probably prove to be too much for you, assuming he as a real alcoholic. Who knows, though? Maybe he will actually do this. But he needs to do it for himself, and YOU need to take care of *you* :) It was the hardest and the BEST thing I ever did for myself. It's also a lifelong process. You don't suddenly ""get"" the program. BUT, I have ""recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body"". I haven't wanted to take a drink in a long time. I maintain healthier relationships today. 

You sound like you love him. Get you BUTT to Al-Anon. :) It's a worldwide fellowship of families and friends who have been affected by alcoholism. It will help you, I promise. 

Good luck. It is worth it. "

Homelessness services aimed at the latter group, such as shelters, are generally funded through a combination of government funding and fundraising by charities running them. They can't meet demand: they fill up rapidly each night and have to turn people away. Demand increases significantly in winter.

Not all panhandlers are sleeping on the streets, and not all are in genuine need. You might be able to help those that are more by directing them to organizations which can assist them, and by supporting not-for-profits which run shelters and provide other forms of support.

Up to a very limited point. The rapid increases in strength that most people experience on linear progression programmes are down to neural adaptations rather than increases in muscular mass. When those peter out, you'll start stalling because your body lacks the nutritional and caloric surplus to build muscle.

My point is, you simpleton, is that whatever the initial treatment may have cost, it is far better than what this idiot has let it become. Where I live, anything to do with the healthcare system is also very expensive, and I know this because I have paid for it before. The reason YOUR healthcare system is expensive and fucked up is because of cases like this.

Well, I was able to quit smoking cold turkey and did just that with the lotto tickets. Also, I'm not very happy with my father (haven't been for a while) and got completely disgusted at the fact *I was slowly turning into him* - So that proved to motivation enough to quit gambling.

tangerinelion,AskReddit,1388565666.0,"As a reserved, generally quiet, but confident guy, it's really not as hard as it sounds.  I've found I have more difficulty getting a first date than I do a third date, but that's a separate story.

Don't be self-deprecating unless you know you can pull this off.  If in doubt, you can't.  On a first date you shouldn't try this as you want to show your good side - first impressions matter after all.

My confidence comes from knowing exactly what I know and what I don't know.  You want to get into quantum mechanics?  OK, I've got a story for you that you wouldn't believe and I can tell it coherently, fluently, off the top of my head like I discovered it.  You want to talk about equine competitions?  I'll tell you I have no clue about the topic, but if you go ahead and talk about it anyway I'll ask you questions about your interest because that's what you do on a date.

Pro-tip: If you're talking about something you think is true, don't bother to qualify it with something like ""In my opinion, most of the time it seems to me that X"" - just state ""X"".  This makes you seem weak.  Very weak.  Remember this is a first date: bringing up abortion and stuff is probably a poor idea - X should not be racist, sexist, etc.  Things which are obviously someone's opinion should not need to be qualified with ""In my opinion.""  My brother gets upset when I don't state my opinions as such, but that's more because I am very convincing in bullshit."

It's not original content and I can see why companies are concerned about it. I guess kind of in between the two would be PewDiePie, where his reactions are the whole point.

If there's any small fraction of the home Saints, it should be a good, exciting game.

If it's the entire home Saints team...yeah, sorry, your defense is fucked. And Foles will be sore in the morning.

NoseFetish,againstmensrights,1388566066.0,"I looked up who it was, because gww is Karen Straughan. 


Karen Smith is the executive director for the group that released the ""Don't be that guy"" anti-rape campaign that got the misters so worked up. 

This is their website, which receives funding from the government and works with some other NPOs. 

https://sace.ab.ca/

They run a 24 hour crisis support line, counselling, community outreach and resources, and a court support program. Sadly enough, they also run what is probably the only counselling available in that area for men who have been sexually assaulted. Which is probably why they're so mad on top of the ""Don't be that guy"" campaign, they're actually doing something for male victims.

So what are they doing? Not partnering with this group to get more support for men, but attacking the executive director with false rape reports. This is the level of maturity I've come to expect from these 'men's rights' groups. Hopefully through her contacts with the police, they partnered with this group to release the ""Don't be that guy"" ads, she can bring some kind of justice against this harassment. I just sent her an email alerting her to what they're doing. "

No, TRP says that the only person keeping that from happening is you.

I'll be honest, I don't give a shit about ""the feminist movement"" because it isn't a movement per se, it's a **supposed** power grab. That doesn't make me a misogynist or a MRA or anything like that.

Let me guess, you are probably someone who doesn't believe in gender roles either?

I will defend TRP to the end because it is what men truly think and feel. Maybe not so much of the extreme stuff, but men have been shamed and told to fit into a mold that they can't adhere to because it doesn't make sense to.  TRP is about breaking out of that mold and being the man you are supposed to be.

Petherton,DeadBedrooms,1388566520.0,"Thanks to everyone who responded here. Some people have put in a great deal of time and thought, and I really appreciate it. Some of the comments and advice look at things from angles I hadn't considered, and although somewhat harsh and poignant, are often appropriate. 

I need to change a few things around. Alcohol is an issue, and I want it to have no place in my life. In the last few days I have read the suggested literature. I think there are other things I need to start changing about me and what I do to regain her respect and attraction. I've already asked if there are ways she can change the household accounting system so I don't have to account for every cent, and she didn't take it very well, but I will persevere.

I think I do need to let go a bit about work and making money. As a child we had days when there was no food and we had to move out in the middle of the night to sleep on the floor at family/friends or restart hundreds of miles away. That was horrible; not being allowed to contact friends in case they told the landlord where we were and so on. I never want that to be part of my children's life-experience, and perhaps to ensure it isn't, I've not focused enough on other important areas of life.

The changes I'm going to make for 2014; quit alcohol; change my investment strategy to income-based rather than capital-gains so I can work less; do more round the house and with the kids; get fit - my oldest boy has asked for fitness gear so we're going to choose equipment together and build a 'gym' in an out-building, make more plans and do stuff with the kids. If things are still the same at the end of 2014 then it's time to move on."

I just watched the secret life of Walter Mitty, and while it seems to be intended as a light hearted movie, it hit me harder than any movie has. I'm a photographer, and an outdoorsman, but also a daydreamer. Sure, I have interesting stories like walking two miles in 8°F on a broken ankle at night while coyotes hunted the valley below and I have a knife that I dropped into three different lakes in the boundary waters canoe area wilderness, but every time I tell stories or show souvenirs I realize I'm living in the past and that my life is functionally on pause, and has been for a long time... I can't have new stories until I live again. 

And just to top it off, I called my ex a few nights ago (no idea why I thought it would be a good idea, but it was) and found out she recently bought a one way ticket to Norway with the vague plans of ""paddle the fiords and take pictures."" Thats just who she is, how she lives, and I'm jealous. The reason I loved her is the reason she left me and the part of her I hope never changes.

At 4.5 months things *might* cool off a little bit from the honeymoon phase, but she should still be actively interested in you, wanting to spend time with you, and caring that you feel neglected.

Anyways, my advice is to just end it and move on.  Honestly, it sounds like you should be looking for friends more than a girlfriend at this point."

Determined to find something of value, he ventures upstairs into the attic. Although it is dark, his eyes quickly adjust with the help of the moonlight seeping through the attic window, and he can barely make out a large chest near the wall. ""Jackpot,"" he mutters to himself as he looks for the lock. Surprisingly, there is none. He shrugs to himself and opens the chest, and reaches inside. His hands come across something heavy and he pulls it out. ""What have we got here..."" he whispers. A camera, one of those instant polaroid cameras. He inspects it, wondering if such an antique was still valuable. He puts the camera to his eye, looks at the chest, and takes a picture. He grabs the picture that rolls out of the camera and takes a look. Oddly enough, he is looking at a picture of himself, pulling out the camera from the chest. ""Weird."" He shrugs and sets the camera down. He reaches into the chest and his hand comes cross something heavy and he pulls it out.

She needs to know that the best thing to do about that is to just break up with him, the sooner the better. And the important thing is, that is the right thing to do regardless of your involvement in the situation.

With that out of the way, you two don't necessarily have to get together right away, but you both like each other, so don't let any awkwardness stop you from spending time together.

RE2 was the best RE by far. SH2 is amazing, though I think SH4 is right behind it. Mainly because it takes something so familiar to most people (their own apartment) and removes the feeling of security from it, especially when the haunting begins. Siren: Blood Curse and Clock Tower (SNES and first Playstation games only) are definitely up there as well. As far as PC-only games, Amnesia, Penumbra, and Outlast (Outlast being on par with Fatal Frame IMO) are excellent, though I haven't played Machine for Pigs. Scratches is another game that makes you incredibly uneasy while playing, but it's well worth picking up.

I follow that up with some witch hazel as a toner, then I moisturize with CeraVe. They have an actual face moisturizing product, but I just use their regular lotion. It's light and doesn't make my skin feel greasy. I rarely break out now. Maybe one or two small ones before my period starts.

Firstly, it lets you send emails at any time in the future - so you can make it look like you're sending work in a 9am one day, as opposed to 3 am like some undisciplined so and so.

Handy to make it look as if you were't working all night on some project, and you had it all in control and you rocked into work the next day and sent it then.

the other thing it lets you do, is boomerang emails back - which is handy if you are doing inbox related task management.

Has someone emailed you saying they will get some files to you within a week?
Just boomerang it with one click (it can actually read the email and suggest a date) and then don't worry about it for a week.

Sometimes it's better not to let stuff get bogged down in your task lists if you can more easily just go ""ok, if I haven't heard from you by then bang that email into  my inbox and I'll chase it up""

Very handy for the price.

Gertiel,veganrecipes,1388567552.0,"My daughter went vegan while still in high school, and asked me to prepare / help her prepare meals for her lunches. Here are some suggestions which resulted from our little trial-and-error year of vegan lunches:

Pick some things kiddo likes that are fairly stable to keep on hand as things can and will come up. We went with nut butters, jelly, and these vegan crackery wafer things from the deli of the local health food store. Since I always had a small array of fresh fruit and veggies in the fridge, these were enough to get us through the day if necessary.

We found a Japanese bento box was the best way for us to ensure variety. We picked one that had two large separate containers which could be split in various ways using removable plastic bits. Especially when we were both having a long, hard week, we found it easier to focus on what to put in each of 3-4 little sections verses looking at a big, empty lunch box and trying to imagine filling that. Another great thing about looking into Japanese bentos was they also had a bunch of mini containers for sauces and dips and recipe books with cute ideas how to make the food look tastier. Many of my daughter's friends assured me of their jealousy over the cute stuff I would do with her food.

Now, on to food variety ideas. My daughter always loved it when I would fill a section with a favorite finger food. Berries, veggie stick bundles tied up in a small piece of seaweed, veggie sushi, and even little veggie sandwiches were always hits. I used to go to the local Asian market for those big, mild white radishes and the really fat carrots. As a bonus, if you slice them really thinly, you can use little cookie cutters to cut out shapes. My daughter was especially fond of raisins and hazelnut cocoa butter (homemade nutella without all the added chemicals) on carrot slices. 

Speaking of the Asian market, great source for all sorts of awesome vegan foods much cheaper than my local health food store. I've been told it is because a lot of Buddhists are vegan. I used to buy soy dogs to make octodogs for my daughter, which she loved. At times they also had cucumbers grown in molds which made for some really easy sandwiches. Just slice and fill!"

TrustMyOpinion,relationships,1388567596.0,"Oh girl... To be honest with you that doesn't sound too good. A part of getting sober is changing people, places, and things. This includes his job (since it has so much drinking associated with it). If he's not willing to let go of it, it doesn't sound like he's willing to really change his life around to stay sober. I still go to five meetings a week (female, by the way). 

Again, who knows? If he goes to AA they will tell him all of this. 

This is about YOU, though. I'm glad you're considering Al-Anon! Try a meeting or two. They'll be speaking your language, I swear to god. Also, maybe try individual therapy for yourself, too? I don't know if you have insurance. I do. It's helping wonders. 

I loved my boyfriend when I was drinking, but I loved the effects of alcohol even more. I HAD to drink. I didn't know how to stop. Once I became willing to change my life around, I started to get better... The kicker is that I had to go through enough pain to have that willingness.

I'll seriously be thinking about you. Your post hit me really hard. I cheated on my boyfriend when I was drinking. He was so good to me. I can't make amends to him, either. He's married and it wouldn't be appropriate. More harm than good to contact him just so I can feel a burden lifted. 

Try looking up Al-Anon meetings in your county (if you live in the US). There are SO many resources. I'm in Georgia, but meetings are EVERYwhere! When I travel the first thing I do is check out a local meeting. 

Like I said... Don't give up hope!!! But if he becomes unwilling to put the bottle down I suggest letting the relationship go. It will cause you way more harm than good. Alcoholism is a love killer. It is a family ruiner. It takes away happiness, and you deserve happiness!!! Its not your fault. 

Please PM me if you need any more support, or just need to talk. I mean it. "

Omega037,relationships,1388567730.0,"&gt; We've broken up a few times

I got about this far and I already knew that it was time to end things.

Breaks should be permanent, end of story.  It should be the last resort when you believe communication can no longer solve the problems in the relationship and it is time to end.

Furthermore, breaks should be followed by a significant period of no contact.  You tell him you aren't happy, the relationship is over, and not to contact you anymore.  Then you don't answer any calls, texts, emails, or even respond to him in person for at least 6-12 months.  In this case, I would say ever.

Anyways, if you don't do this, you will continue this cycle and just become less and less happy.  You aren't resolving any problems, breaking up has become a ""tactic"", and things are going to be increasingly toxic.

So accept that you aren't compatible and take my advice.  What you learned from this relationship will make your next one stronger and healthier.  Most likely, 3 months with the next guy you will be kicking yourself for sticking it out with this guy for so long.

As for the new guy, give yourself some time before you make any moves on him or anyone else."

If you do let him, it will nag at you and you will resent it.  Then he will get mad at you for resenting something you gave him permission for.  That will then cause guilt, which will just add to the negative feelings.  Eventually, the feelings will become toxic, you will both become passive aggressive, and then break up.

If you say no, it is possible that this desire will cause him to eventually want to leave, but in that case there wasn't anything you could do.  Just try to be the best girlfriend you can be and if the boundaries of the relationship aren't acceptable to him, then it wasn't meant to be."

I would have no issue in implementing this plan, simply because i take personal satisfaction in holding people accountable to their own behaviours and standards.

if someone actively exploits and selfishly pursues their own ends at others expense, its not ""Being below the other person"" to engineer a scenario where they are subject to the fruits of their own work.

i would actually argue its really rather pathetic and small to think because you don't you are somehow better or more bigger than someone who does.

Baalke turned over half the roster his first year here, drafting Aldon Smith (8 sacks in 8 games) and Colin Kaepernick along with completely revamping the secondary (cutting Nate Clements, signing Donte Whitner, drafting Eric Reid) and cutting Takeo Spikes to make room for possibly the best defensive player in the league, Navorro Bowman. He traded for Anquan Boldin, and due to his skill we have 13+ draft picks for the third year in a row, something no recent team has come close to. Baalke blows Schneider and most other GMs completely out of the water. You are out of your fucking mind.  
Edit: Don't pretend McLoughan was any good either. He signed *Nate Clements* to what was at the time the largest defensive contract of all time, and pulled the trigger on Alex Smith in the 2005 draft. He repeatedly failed to find suitable quarterback, secondary or wide receiver talent in the draft or free agency, and his tenure can only be considered a complete and utter failure."

I never said they would beat the 1.6m buy that UFC 100 did, i'm just pointing out that its inaccurate to suggest Brock had low or even mediocre (as you've changed it to) drawing power at the time of his last fight.

As for the record, it can't be broken right now. Even if the UFC put together a card full of title fights, i just don't see it happening. Brock was only there for a short while, Anderson and GSP have left suddenly so i don't think their stars are big enough. Jones might get there though."

in hindsight I actually think you do better being raised as a Christian (non extreme) as a child growing up as it can put a premium on certain non obvious behaviours and philosophies while you are fragile and moulding.

Omega037,relationships,1388569601.0,"You handled it correctly so far.  

Unless your fiance seemed shifty/guilty when you presented it, then I wouldn't be too worried.  Your 3 years of trust should outweigh the validity of an anonymous letter.

Furthermore, let us look at the letter.  

1. Why a handwritten letter?  In today's electronic age, it seems like a weird way to communicate this.  More personal.

2. Why was it sent to your parents' place?  Do they not know your current address?

3. Why anonymous?  If they were telling the truth, they should want you to contact them.  Especially since it seemed spiteful.

4. Why speak of ""a lot of evidence"" yet not produce *any* or provide contact for obtaining some?  It sounds a lot like a bluff.

5. Why did they say ""Remember, a leopard never changes its spots""?  That sounds an awful lot like spite rather than someone just trying to honestly inform someone who has been wronged.

6. Why now?  Apparently this has been going on ""the whole time"", yet this person seems only interested in saying something right after you get engaged?

Anyways, none of this is 100% proof of anything.  

If I had to guess, I think this letter was not truthful and was instead written out of spite upon hearing your happy news.  Most likely it is a woman from his past (an ex or jilted lover), though it could potentially be an adversary from your own past (girl you stole a boy from or something) looking to start trouble.

Unless there is some of this ""proof"" forthcoming, I would just trust your boyfriend.  

Right now I wouldn't be worried about your fiance cheating, I would be worried that there is someone out there who is spiteful and trying to hurt one of you."

* Changed the i5 4670 to the i5 4670k, which has an unlocked multiplier and is very easy to overclock.

* Changed the CPU cooler to the best model in its class.

* Chose the ASUS Z87-A which is a great middle-ground motherboard for moderate overclocking, and feature set. Dual SLI capable.

* Changed the RAM to cheaper equivalent model.

* 250gb is a waste of money, especially at this budget. 120gb is all you need. I assume you have an HDD for mass storage you can use. If not, grab a 1tb-2tb Seagate Barracuda, or WD Blue.

* Grabbed a far, far better GTX 770 model.

* Get W8.1 instead of W7. No one here any more is pretending that W7 is better. W8 has a couple fps advantage over W7. Use 'Startisback' or 'Classic Shell' if you miss the W7 experience.

**NOTE:** Two days ago I posted a guide for builds around this budget - **[HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1tzhab/tutorial_1000_usd_gaming_tower_the_simple/)**"

A framework is given -- a sort of tool box of what to expect -- but for the most part, it's all about getting out there and approaching. Nothing beats experience.

ScipiiRye,CanadaPolitics,1388570192.0,"This may be just me, but I don't think that his reaction to the Boston Bombing can really be considered a ""gaffe"", it sounds more like typical Conservative spinning to try to make it seem like one.

&gt; Trudeau said he would offer the American material support “and at the same time, over the coming days, we have to look at the root causes.”

&gt; “Now, we don’t know now if it was terrorism or a single crazy or a domestic issue or a foreign issue,” he said. “But there is no question that this happened because there is someone who feels completely excluded. Completely at war with innocents. At war with a society. And our approach has to be, where do those tensions come from?

&gt; “Yes, there’s a need for security and response,” Trudeau added. “But we also need to make sure that as we go forward, that we don’t emphasize a culture of fear and mistrust. Because that ends up marginalizing even further those who already are feeling like they are enemies of society.”

It seems to me that he's talking about not jumping to conclusions on the motivation behind the attack, and not having an atmosphere of fear and paranoia surrounding Canadian Muslims, which strikes me as a reasonable thing to stress."

ChipSteezy,wiiu,1388570434.0,"It's socio-economics 101 scurvebeard. How can an economy that is packed to the brim with degenerates function?

But before I go researching for evidence, because I have none on hand, because I never thought I'd have to prove this. I would like to give you a more specific definition of a degenerate in a society or an economy.

A degenerate in my mind follows these traits

1. A lack of moral values.
2. A lack of structure in their lives 
3. Little or no interest for helping their society
4. Little or no interest in learning or reading 
5. An alcohol and or drug addiction
6. Excessive sexual activity (I didn't want to add this). But this is degenerate behavior considering the chances of getting an STD.

But again this will only lead to more arguments, which I want. In fact I wish people on reddit argued more. 

I'll search for that scientific proof, but perhaps you could give me a key term that I could google, because growing into a degenerate is very broad. I'll look, but I don't think any article that I find will satisfy you.

i only consider the mention of an ex based on the context and merit of the conversation.

its unrealistic to expect people to wipe clean their hearts and minds of someone completely and actually sometimes people use their ""ex"" to try and compliment you.

i.e i have had girls compliment and try and make me feel special by continually telling me how great i am compared to their ex. i have also had girls ask me about my ex's etc

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1388570492.0,"Okay, so the standard thing to deal with this is foundation. But I'm guessing you're not terribly interested in messing with that?

I'd recommend applying a green tinted primer to the areas that you feel are too red (the green helps cancel out the redness). Physicians Formula and L'oreal both make them, and they're affordable (apply them thinly enough that you don't see a layer of green on your face). You may wish to follow this up with a powder or powder foundation. 

If you want to use a powder, you'll need a brush. Pick one up from Target (something from the elf studio line, which are black). What sort of powder you might like to use depends on the color of your skin and exactly what you'd like the powder to do.

My coworker's stance is that it comes down to the interpretation of certain verses in the scripture.  One of those that I remember is: ""Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit"" - Eph. 5:18.

Which, in context, is clearly metaphorical.  

Another reason he's described to me is that Jesus/God advocated against a drunkard/alcoholic lifestyle, rather than drinking alcohol in itself.  Which makes sense to me, because of the water into wine and the prevalence of wine throughout the Bible in general.  

That's a Christian's second-hand perspective as relayed through an atheist on why Christians against drinking are wrong.  Take from it what you will."

League and dota are the exact opposite. Low mechanics, high knowledge curve. Like in LoL there are 117 champions. Each has 4 spells, so 468 spells. I could tell you what all of the spells do, their rough cooldowns etc. And items too,so many items. I would need to know what all the hero spells in dota do, what all the items do. Hero power spikes, ie what level they become more / less threatening. It's a shit load of information and it takes a lot of time. The mechanics aren't really an issue.

CSGO is fun for me, because I can just jump in and all the people on my team are as bad as I am and from playing the other incarnations of cs I know the guns, I know the maps etc so I have a basic idea of how the game is played. That makes it more appealing to me as my 'fun' game. Not that LoL isn't fun, but yeah. I may try and get in to it if I get bored of Lol though.

I don't know if they've fixed it, but I had some issues with oceanic match making in the beta for dota. It wouldn't find enough games in Australia so it would put me on like Singapore servers with rediculous ping whoch was annoying, too."

It seems like you are in a similar situation to I was when I found out about my mum's stage 4 cancer in May. I think what worked for me was talking to people. Being able to talk about your situation helps a great deal. For your close friends I would tell them so you can vent your emotional stress. I found that to be very helpful for me when I had a friend that I could unload my emotional stress and help diffuse it. Another way is to spend time with your dad. Honestly the situation sucks but the best way to make it better is to have fun. They want to carry on with life normally and avoid the pity party. You'll thank yourself later for having fun with your dad later on. Another advice is that you accept the fact it isn't something your dad could've avoided maybe ir you and that you have no control over it. But you do have control of what you make of the experience. It doesn't have to be a dark period of sadness, it can be a moment to enjoy life and his company. You have to make the best of the worst situation. Im on mobile so im not typing that well!

Those folks typically fill the jobs that aren't really that necessary and could easily be replaced, by other people or machines.

A guaranteed income could keep those people out of the way so they can, hopefully, do better things with themselves or at least not cause problems for others. Provided the amount given is enough to live decently and not in/near poverty, which could in turn prevent crime. Though, I can't see something like this working well in North America but who knows.

[Then again, I weigh half again as much as you do and double your numbers at the very least,](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1u3hna/reminderyour_local_fire_station_is_a_fucking/ceelsfy?context=3) which might go a long way towards explaining the disparity in our standards. You don't know how bloody easy it is to get to an intermediate level of strength just yet. I squatted 308 (140kg) for a triple within a month or two of starting and I'm not an athletically gifted person.

&gt;There are male powerlifters at my gym who squat around and beyond 400lbs, but they don't go around telling the guys who do under 300lb that they're ""unimpressive"" and that ""101lb women can do better"". 

The point of citing an outlier like that was to put the numbers you were citing into perspective. A 300lb squat should be a mere blip in your journey towards strength and athletic prowess, not a milestone with a fucking inn and brothel attached. 

&gt;Sure, it might not be impressive to you, but might be for someone else.

And unless someone was just learning to walk again within the past five years, I maintain my assertion that it's not an impressive lift.

&gt;Under 200lb, a 300lb squat seems to be[1] considered above average[2] , unless you're an NFL star[3] .

300 is well short of the threshold to constitute an advanced level of training in both the sources you linked for an adult male weighing 148 lbs. If anything, they support my assertion that a 300lb squat is unimpressive for the population I described. 

Anyone can attain the ""advanced"" levels of strength on these charts with 1-3 years of semi-consistent training. For fuck's sake, I know people who can front squat these numbers with less training experience."

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_morality

""Critics might propose that science of morality fails to answer the question 'even having defined good, why do it'""

This sums up a lot of my feelings over morality and science. It's a weird concept to comprehend. But there needs to be social, and moral training for a society that wishes to function.

Now regarding desensitization leading to degeneration. You were right. I couldn't find much in terms of scientific proof, but there's plenty of information regarding moral values, the flourishing of morality, and altruist societies verses egoist societies, and yes there isn't much scientific proof, but you could at least see how these theories would be plausible? I think finding the proof in moral debauchery cannot really be explained in science yet. Or maybe it has, but there isn't concrete evidence in hand over a google search.

And it doesn't matter that they were going to do this with or without him. if you are asked by a group of people to mug someone and say no, but that you will not stop them for a portion of what they steal then you are a fucking accomplice. and I understand that this isn't exactly what he did, but he did stand by and profit while others committed a crime, he had plenty of chances to not be a part of all of this.

No shit, but you went from saying that they could be achieved in ""a few months"" of half-arsed training to ""six to nine"" to ""1-3 years"". Bit of a difference.

Using the [same site](http://exrx.net/Testing/WeightLifting/StrengthStandards.htm) as the second source ""intermediate"" is defined as 

&gt; A person who has engaged in regular training for up to two years. The intermediate level indicates some degree of specialization in the exercises and a high level of performance at the recreational level. 

Whereas advanced is,

&gt; An individual with multi-year training experience with definite goals in the higher levels of competitive athletics.

I realize that these are averages but you can't just apply your standards to everyone else, you as an experienced weightrainer should know this. Your point about Mei putting 300lbs into perspective is correct, but that's still at the extreme end of peak physical performance.

300lbs for an average guy under 200lbs is still pretty good, your anecdotal evidence, while valid, doesn't change that.

That's not what I said.

Initially, I claimed that a 300lb squat is a lift that a &gt;150lb male who follows a linear progression programme halfheartedly can achieve in 6-9 months.

In the following comment, I asserted that the ""advanced"" standards listed were easily achievable in 1-3 years of similarly half-arsed training.

These two statements do not contradict each other.

&gt;I realize that these are averages but you can't just apply your standards to everyone else, you as an experienced weightrainer should know this. Your point about Mei putting 300lbs into perspective is correct, but that's still at the extreme end of peak physical performance. 

&gt;300lbs for an average guy under 200lbs is still pretty good, your anecdotal evidence, while valid, doesn't change that.

&gt;And anyway this is stupid argument, it was originally about the semantics of ""impressive.""

Six of one, half dozen of the other.

&gt;Maybe my accusation of dipshitedness was uncalled for, but people with egoes who shit on the progress of others aren't regarded very fondly by others in my experience. It's definitely grounds for getting the boot where I go.

I'm not shitting on progress, I'm pointing out that an unremarkable milestone is not impressive. It's akin to being able to ride a bike without falling off or being able to coordinate your stroke pattern with your breathing in the pool: it's an important step on your journey, but it's not one worthy of acclaim.

Lakers were not good that season (34-48, plagued by injuries including to Kobe, who played only 60 games iirc). Really, the only debatable season where he could have won an MVP was 2003, when Shaq was injured IIRC and he averaged 30-7-6 and had a PER of 26. Of course Duncan was incredible back then 23-13-3 with a PER of 27 as well. But the Spurs won 60 and the Lakers just 50, so Duncan got it instead.

2006-2008 were his other MVP-caliber years, relative to other top performers on the team. Interestingly many people (rightfully?) believed that it was stolen from Chris Paul and it was more of a lifetime achievement award in 2008. (As a Laker fan, I'll always maintain Kobe deserved it in '06 and '07 but whatever.)

More telling about Kobe's performance was that something from like the '00-'01 season to the '12-'13 season, he placed in the top 5 of MVP voting every year except that injured 2004-2005 season."

All the while, they become more polarized because of the tendency to want to one-up each other in edginess.

I can't believe what you did, you disgust me. Every fiber of my being wants you to burn for what you did!

Excuse you? I don't think I will, every scene of that barbaric movie you were in was setting back civil rights movements CENTURIES, if not MILLENNIA!

You think you can just use words for this 'art'? I'm disgusted Mr. Jackson. You don't deserve the praise you get for basically destroying the Black civil rights movement. Even your complacency with letting that disgusting man Tarantino say the n word TO YOUR FACE! This isn't acceptable and you've basically proved your internalized white supremacy with that scene alone! 

Don't get me started on Travolta, who went into some poor woman's life and raped her with drugs and duress, probably because she was dating a POC and he couldn't stand it. Travolta is even allowed to kill an innocent POC with no repercussions! How could you glorify murdering POC's like this?

And Bruce Willis! His family obviously holds deep seated supremacist ideals, especially with that DISGUSTING RANT that Christopher Walken instills in Willis' character at a young age! Willis kills several people, including a POC and two non-cis men, and abuses (and presumably rapes) his poor girlfriend (who in this scenario can be considered a POC because she is French and not a typical cis-hetero-white American.)

You obviously get off on the thought of killing and disenfranchising POC's, trans and gays, and women, while advancing the patriarchy and white supremacy. You should be DISGUSTED. But don't worry, me and my friends on tumblr are going to bring you down. You're going to be NOTHING!

Some things I liked doing to help me through those shorter running intervals : slow down, focus on my breathing (I like counting my breath, for instance : I need approx. 3 seconds for a breath, so I count to 30 breath and know that by then, the run will be over) and focus on the music I'm listening too or the scenery.

Feeling_Of_Knowing,science,1388574599.0,"While you are totally right (schizophrenia is a complex multigenic disorder), I would like to point out that the current definition of schizophrenia will likely ""change"" in a few decade. The main reason is that it is currently categorized and classified from the symptoms. It's a coherent point of view when we observe the historical description of the disease, but right now, with the discoveries and improvement of imagery, this will likely change.

What does that means? There is currently a huge diversity between someone who have ""schizophrenia"" and someone who have ""schizophrenia"". We have some rating scales, but the lack of biological analysis is problematic when we try to define ""what is this disease?"". To answer that question, we do studies. Either animals (where we know what we changed compared to a ""healthy"" animal), or humans (where we include the participant in the group if he was diagnosed *beforehand*). See the issue?

So, while we define it as a complex multigenic disorder, I would say that there *could* be a ""magic-bullet""-type finding concerning a sub-population of schizophrenic patient that would have a particular and defined alteration. 

Yes, it doesn't change anything you have written (like I said, you are right, and it was well-written), but I think this nuance adds an interesting reflection of the definition and study concerning psychiatric disorders."

talldane1,Antiques,1388575266.0,"It's a Parian shoulder head doll, almost certainly made in Germany.  There were a number of doll manufacturers in the Thuringia region and they mass produced these and shipped them all over the world.  ""Parian"" really refers to the finish on the porcelain head - it's a matte finish.  ""China heads"" were made from the same molds in a lot of cases, but had a clear glaze.  Some doll heads have incredibly intricate details, making them expensive and difficult to cast.  Yours is one of the more common ones and was probably available in a number of sizes.  (That's not a bad thing - Parian heads are much more rare than the china heads, and none of them are easy to find nowadays in such nice condition).

It's hard to tell from the photographs, but the dress does not look original.  It's nicely done and the trim looks very old, but you might want to check the fabric content of the dress.  You can do a burn test with one of the loose fabric threads in the seams.  You just remove a bit of the fabric thread (not the stitching thread) and burn it.  If it burns into ash, it's a natural fiber (cotton, silk, etc.) but if it burns down to a plastic-y glob, it's a more modern synthetic.  It's very rare to find original clothing on those early dolls.  If I'm right and it's been re-dressed, whoever did it took a lot of care with it.  I see a lot of hand stitching and they've used some very nice antique trim.  

A great source to learn about the doll is: 
	
*Identifying German Parian Dolls* by Mary Gorham Krombholz

I think the doll is a wonderful survivor.  Those porcelain dolls were so fragile that many were lost (broken, chipped, or cracked) because they were meant to be played with.  "

robhol,LearnJapanese,1388575390.0,"Not sure about any books. I learned the kanji I know by Anki, reading other stuff (manga, games, chat, web), and looking stuff up. That, to me, seems like the most natural way possible (as long as you're aware of the caveats to those media). I used the Core 2000 deck, if that's still around... I also wrote out all the answers containing kanji before checking. The deck doesn't, to my knowledge, target 常用 specifically, but is comparable for your basic *vocab* rather than just the kanji. Which is kind of the point anyway, right? :)

RTK *is* controversial, there's no doubt it's helped many people, but to me, it seems overcomplicated and inefficient. Expensive too, if you were planning to actually buy it. Learning keywords (RTK1) and on'yomi (RTK2) just isn't enough, certainly not to justify working your way through two books when you can just start learning right off the bat.

Stroke order is something you can't really get around 100%, but it IS reasonably logical and you end up surprised fairly rarely once you get used to the ""ground rules"" and develop a feeling for the 'right way' to write things. If you want to be safe, look up the kanji.

The reading for a kanji is determined by the word in which it appears. For example, 用 (よう above) also appears in 用(もち).いる. In this case (after finishing RTK1 and 2), you'd know about ""you"" as a reading and associate the notion of ""use"" with it. But what happens to kanji that have multiple kun- AND on'yomi readings? On the other hand, you could've studied the words 用、常用、用いる and use those in conversation or writing right away.

Kanji aren't intuitive to most people who aren't exposed to them (Japanese, Chinese and to a degree, I think Korean people?), but they're not as mysterious as all that. They're just ideograms that represent some concept (though there may be nuances).

I'd like to add that I'm far from an expert, but I hope I've managed to answer your questions."

- Reading isn't something I consider a hobby.  I'd do it all day every day reasonably happily, but I'm not satisfied with myself if I do.  I feel like a recluse.

- Cooking I've gotten into spending time on, but I'm incredibly sensitive to criticism and love healthy food modifications and vegetables.  I can only cook for myself because I'm living with my mum and step dad at the moment, and he refuses to eat 99% of non-cheese covered veg.

I guess I'm looking for something to look forward to?

- Social connections are:
+ mum + step dad + sister + her fiance + my dad + my ex bf + guy I'm involved with who is married and lives on the other side of the country
I'm burned bridges with the people I used to be friends with, but have never in my life actually felt close to.
I'd love to be able to go have lunch or go do something with someone, and enjoy it, I'm not in a position currently where I can do that.

It was 1 year later that my brothers started getting really into gangs and drugs and everything really fell apart. Well anyway, my dad started getting into drugs and met someone else, (weird thing this other lady always called my dad ""dad"") he left when i was eleven and everything else happened. I really was the rock for my mother during the donestic abuse i remember as far back 7 years old. Once he left and my brothers started their whole thing i became a latchkey kid and kinda stunted my social skills. I became depressed and really apathetic until senior year of high school. Everything's better my dad had 2 daughters, the drug use though led to my first half sister being born with spinal problem.   She will have to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. The second is very healthy and happy. My mom met other people and really became a strong resilient woman. My dad became an even better responsible father and tries his hardest for my half sisters.

Gertiel,raisedbynarcissists,1388576251.0,"My nMomster did a version of that routine. Started when I went to college. I always had to call her. If she called me, it was bad news. Usually meant she felt the need to bitch at someone and hey why not bring up that obscure thing Gertiel said a month ago I didn't like so I can get my bitch out on her?

I got married, and recall in those days long distance phone calls were charged ridiculously high by-the-minute fees. Yup. Still me doing most of the calling. She always had an excuse that almost sounded like a reason. If the financial burden ever came up, she'd just point to the things she'd sometimes buy for us. Mostly stupid crap we didn't need or want, but which she felt we ought to need and want.

Things changed when my grandmother had her brain surgery. After the surgery, grandma had to stay with someone and it fell to nMomster. nMomster will swear until she is blue in the face how she had all of her mother's care and how much the expenses ate up the family finances. Total bullshit. All gran's medical bills were covered by very good insurance. Any remainder she paid out of her own retirement funds and savings. She also contributed heavily to the family cash flow, even though she mostly lived with me. 

That's right. The only time my mother called me in my entire life was to bitch about my grandmother and arrange for me to pick her up to stay at my house an hour away for as long as possible. I'd take her to my mom's usually the first weekend of the month. Grandma would collect her mail so she could handle paying her bills and whatnot. If that was all that was happening, I was expected to bring her on Saturday after work, spend the night, and take her back with me on Sunday afternoon. Of course we'd all go to church so nMomster could show off to all her bitchy friends there how much of a martyr she was caring for her mother and her stupid daughter. I didn't figure that out until much later, though, but I digress. Anyways, some months she'd stay so she could go to her periodic doctor's appointments, which nMomster always made sure to schedule as early in the week as possible. If it had to be Tuesday or Wednesday, there would be a butt load of bitching all weekend over that, and I could always count on a phone call shortly after the doctor's appointment to gripe about Grandma. 

One time she actually called me and said ""She just sits there in the recliner rubbing her leg. She's doing it to drive me crazy. Well, it's working"". Seriously, the woman who just had knee surgery and only just got the apparatus off and allowed to put weight on it is rubbing her knee on the first really chilly, damp day of fall? I don't know what she could be thinking! I felt sorry for poor Grandma and drove an hour each way to pick up that very evening after work. Eventually Grandma got out of her clutches by leaving for a visit back home from which she never returned. It took some time and legal intervention to get my nMomster's greedy fingers out of her finances, but eventually that happened. 

By that time, I was divorced and not doing things nMomster's way, so she wasn't really speaking to me though I didn't really even notice. Looking back, I understand better why the calls at the time of the divorce going down had her full of an air of ""finally!"". She immediately made it clear she was going to send my dad to grab my stuff and move us to her. Within hours of me notifying her of the demise of my marriage, she had a rental house, a job, and a new boyfriend all picked out for me. When I vetoed that idea, her calls stopped coming. Looking back, she must have been thinking about these things previously to have the rest of my life so neatly tied up in a bow so quickly. I was so torn up over the divorce and so busy trying to work at getting on with life at that time, I just did the dutiful daughter calling because by that time I was well-trained. 

Our NC split didn't happen for a while yet after that time, but I wish it had."

I think the best option for an American at the moment is to head to aus/NZ on a working holiday visa.  Once you get that, renting a flat or hiring a car in aus is pretty easy (as long as you have money! Lol).

If you're set on Europe, is travel an option over moving?  And remember what I said in my first post: getting out is not a magical fix for being unhappy.  Starting over in your 20s isn't easy.  Maybe you can take some of those steps to being happier at home while you find an 'out' option?"

You might have heard of some of them. AIDS. Hepatitis C... 

So... Is being gay a 'problem'? Nope. Is being gay and PRETENDING to be straight a problem? Yes... It is. Ask ANY woman married to a straight man if she would have a 'problem' with her man having sex with men on the down low and I think you WOULD find there is a problem. A BIG one.

Dsf192,AskMen,1388577771.0,"It's been a little while so I don't remember where they were (sorry that I can't link them).  At a particularly low time for me the occasional self-improvement TRPer threw out things which are fairly commonplace advice, but just hit me at the right time.

- No matter what anyone tells you, women will never just fall into your lap.  If you don't put yourself out there, then you might as well eat bags of Cheetos in your basement for the rest of your life.

- People will tell you that you're such a great guy and anyone would be glad to have you, and they're right.  But it's sort of a lie of omission.  Everyone needs to change or add something to what they're doing to make themselves more attractive to women.  Keep on what you're doing, but be confident about it and love the shit out of what you're good at and can do well.  It will benefit you in the long run.

Those were the message at the core of one of the comments a person made.  Not exact quotes.  A little common place in terms of ""no shit Sherlock"" but I figured out that at the core of some of their subscribers were people who just wanted to improve themselves.  There was just too much shit going on and I just had to unsubscribe and leave TRP, but a few of those things are there."

You are the victor, because they are dead. What's more is you can't get anything from them anymore (extreme and special situations aside). This isn't for the dead, it's for the living. The dead's family are not necessarily like the dead and what about you? You're better off saying ""he died too soon"" or ""we'll miss him"" than anything else, in your head and with your mouth. Sure, some of our dead deserved death - no questions, but don't harp on it because a corpse will never fail harder or lose an argument with you. He's fucking dead - call it a win and move on.

Now if you're like me and you feed off hate: he was fucking stupid and/or weak for dying. No one deserves anything, he failed to win at life. But I think people that truly enjoy thinking of the Universe with that tone are rare so probably stick to the first paragraph."

SoyBeanExplosion,Metal,1388579055.0,"kaptain_carbon's post is great but if I can suggest to you a *specific* album that would be a good place to start with, it would be Emperor's first album 'In the Nightside Eclipse.' It's got a lot of symphonic elements and a lot of different melodies, and some classic black metal tracks like 'I Am the Black Wizards' and 'Into the Infinity of Thoughts.' If you want something rawer with less orchestration, you could try the classic album Filosofem by Burzum from back in the 90s, or a slightly more recent one like Taake's 'Hordalands Doedskvad' from 2005, or his 2008 self-titled album which takes more influence from crust punk. Darkthrone might not be the best place to start with because they are (in my experience) a particularly challenging listen. Ease yourself in.

Wolves in the Throne Room's 'Two Hunters' is also a highly recommended listen. It's very melancholy in places, with many ambient sections, and there's a tremendous atmosphere to it. Huge amounts of melody.

You might also like Watain's latest album 'The Wild Hunt' which came out this year. It's a bit softer than their previous works, and it's much more influenced by classic heavy metal bands *like* Mercyful Fate, or the artists which more directly influence their work like Bathory. There's some heavier, faster tracks, some slow, Bathory-like ballads, and some mid-tempo ones as well."

* Grabbed a CPU cooler. 8 Core AMD CPU's are hot.

* That motherboard you chose is NOT compatible. I chose one that is compatible &amp; that is overclocking friendly.

* Found cheaper ram (In USD)

* Grabbed you a better GTX 760 model. This model has a custom cooler, which will be quieter and allow for better overclocking.

* Grabbed a cheaper case. (At least in USD)

* Grabbed a slightly larger power supply, so it might last longer.

**NOTE:** Windows 8.1 is a bit better than Windows 7 and performs better. How ever, if your first language is not English, Windows 7 will be simpler to understand."

porpoiseoflife,Animesuggest,1388579234.0,"The trouble with both psychology and psychiatry is that, in the end, it is all just guesswork. They can't exactly crack open a skull and start tinkering with the grey matter to see if something works better this way or that. They can only go by what you report to them, and in some cases what others say as well. If everyone around you insists that you're hearing voices and that's what you got taken into an ER for, then you get labelled as schizophrenic and all the treatments will be associated with that diagnosis. 

When I went to a psychologist's office instead of a psychiatrist's office, the talky-doc immediately figured out that everyone else had screwed up royally and I was actually telling the truth about only having depression. The haloperidol screwed up my neurochemistry badly, however. I can lose time in 90-minute chunks when my stress levels get too high. My record for missing time is still 52 hours. (Don't ask. It is a seriously major story. And I'm not sober enough to give it justice. I'm also not sober enough to care that I publicly admitted that one...) 

So I have a rule: no psychoactive drugs, period. At all. Once burned, twice paranoid. If meds are required, then I damn well better be in bad enough shape to require a commitment."

deviantmoomba,AskMen,1388579464.0,"Yeah, apparently you don't know the difference between aggressiveness and rampant sarcasm. Also you seem to equate empathy with kindness. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in another's shoes; without this, a person is seriously stunted in their social ability, in fact lack of empathy is a diagnostic tool to identity sociopathy. A person who has empathy can be assertive, confident, dominant and 'alpha' (whatever trp shit that is, we're not a pride of lions ffs). If you're going to claim a causative link between empathy and passiveness you'd better provide a citation. 

And yeah, when someone pulls a bullshit move saying the majority of a wide and variable group of people have replaced a major part of human interaction (empathy) with a mental illness (narcissism), you bet your fuckwit arse I'm going to tell you what a bloody fool you sound like.

It is not unheard of people self-medicating by food (not for HRT, different meaning) before they transition so that the food sort of ""soothes"" the pain of the struggle.  If it is the case, look into different stimulation to fulfill that need, either by drinking tons and tons of water, exercising, or eating extremely hot food (when you do).  Just some ideas.  Be aware that if you use the drug or the sleeve and do not address your underlying issue, after you are done, you'll go right back up to your weight you're at now (or worse), in the end."

KosherDill,InfertilityBabies,1388580151.0,"I won't downvote you and I appreciate your perceptive. In your case you were SOL and stuck for a baby sitter, that happens. When that does happen, it's obvious and people understand. There is one adult and one child, it's pretty easy to conclude that a person is stuck for a babysitter and/or is just coming in for a quick visit. 

My issue was that in all the cases I saw there was an adult who was able to supervise but these couples chose not to. Normally I don't mind kids and pregnant people, I'm a teacher and it seems pregnant people are everywhere. My RE is a child-free place because those suffering from infertility are already surrounded by babies, kids, and pregnant people. Why can't they have a break? 

Secondary infertility is an issue and no one is saying it isn't. The issue is couples being inconsiderate in a place that has posted signs saying, ""please leave your children at home"". These couples decided that those rules don't apply to them and didn't seem to consider why such a rule is in place. 

EDIT: I made a few changes because I was on my phone and it's a pain typing there. I just wanted to add my RE is strictly an RE there are no ""regular"" patients and check-ups available. It is strictly a place of infertility specialty. If I were to go to my regular OB/GYN seeing small children with a couple would not upset me, I would expect it. 

EDIT 2: I've been putting WAAAAY too much thought into this since reading your post. Please don't misunderstand I'm not trying to be disrespectful or rude to those suffering or have suffered from secondary infertility.  

I don't usually get upset when a see a child at the specialist because as I said, shit happens. I just can't come up with any good reason why 2 adults would come into the doctors with a child. I was there long enough to see a few couples literally come and go, and the male just sat in the waiting room and never made his way back into the exam room. That left the father sitting in the waiting room with the child, this happened three times. To me, the fact that out of three of the couples sat in the waiting room there where many couples were possibly wondering ""Am I ever going to have children?"", was in really poor taste and I find to be offensive- never in my right mind would I ever do that. It's not a matter of ""toughing up"" because I'm plenty tough but there are good reasons why those rules are in place. 

The office I go to is not kid friendly - not one Highlights magazine and the color scheme is very subdued. There are signs at every reception window and a few tables asking people not to bring in their children unless it's absolutely necessary. They are a ""no kids"" rule office. If one parent is sitting in the waiting room with the child and not going back to the exam room it is probably not absolutely necessary that they are there. My office is in a nice enough building complete with a coffee shop, benches all over the place and plenty of space. 

Once again, I have no issue with secondary infertility or seeing children at my regular OB/GYN, that's obviously inevitable. I just think women going through infertility that are probably surrounded by pregnancy, babies and questions should be able to walk into their infertility specialist and not worry about seeing a little one staring at them.

If anyone had a problem with that they were the enemy of the one true regime and in for some trouble. Same went with voting rights: Russia 1917, Switzerland 1971. Heh. "
Capetorial,AdviceAnimals,1388580907.0,"But your theory relies on the idea that people a: believe they can and b: want to move up.

I'll explain. Do you kinda sort wish you could bench 300 lbs? Do you think you could with exercise? Do you exercise? Maybe you do but that's not the point ;) the point is we don't all want to move up in the same way and some of don't believe we can. Now that is inability through disbelief but I wanna get down to the bare point.

Wal-Mart (which shall represent all of its kind) has 3 choices: Pay more, losing profit. Actually, wait, that's a crime. Did you know that? Did you know that the CEO is legally obligated to maximize profit? Yeah, shit you not and if he doesn't, there'll be another CEO in his place in seconds who *will* maximize profits. Ok, so, second choice: stay the course and continue to maximize profits. This is pretty straightforward but some people believe this, action #2, is evil. Option 3: stop offering people jobs. Now, employment isn't some magical gracious gift, it's a trade and it follows the laws of supply and demand, if not for a few laws (minimum wage) getting in the way but we all understand why those laws are necessary to ensure we can make enough money to put at least half a loaf of bread on the table. ;) Now if Wal-Mart does close, what happens? Jobs die, that's what. Now, realistically, we all know Wal-Mart, in its profit-maximizing skills, consolidates jobs...but then the employers that took its place would have to make the same decision all over again.

You pay as little as you can for every service and item you obtain. Why should businesses be any different? When you start asking stores how much their employees make and then shopping less at the ones that don't pay well, we may see an end to this ""wage slavery"" but as it stands, everyone pays the minimum they can get away with and no one minds. I've seen people bitch about how little fast food employees make...WHILE WAITING TO ORDER FOOD. It's called voting with your dollar. I don't shop at Wal-Mart because I don't like that it consolidates jobs.

Job consolidation is good, smart and economical. These are things CEOs should do. Maybe one day, CEOs won't be forced to do such things, maybe one day we will agree to vote with our dollar against job consolidation and 'wage slavery' (because I won't shop at places that take the tips of their employees either) and this will lead marketing professionals to accomodate, until then, vote with your dollar. The consumer makes the rules, not the CEO, the CEO just follows orders from the consumer."

Evidence for this was they were mostly Catholic, and had way too many babies to take care of, thus continuing the circle of poverty. Sound familiar? A good book to learn about this is anything about the [5 points of New York City.](http://www.amazon.com/Five-Points-Nineteenth-Century-York-Neighborhood-ebook/dp/B007SNU0QG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388581207&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=5+points+of+new+york) 
2. At other points it was the Jewish or Germans or Mexicans or Hispanics, or anyone who didn't speak English.
3. Negative attention was often focused on groups who would work for less than an American, thus taking ""jobs away from true Americans"". You can see how if a person felt their job was threatened they would lash out at a convenient scapegoat. 
4. I'm also part Irish and German. Yes, my German grandparents really yelled a lot, thus contributing to the angry German stereotype. But damn, my German grandpa could make or fix just about anything. 

None of this lashing out was rational, it was just a product of change, and change can be painful. 

As far as discussing race, I think that topic is banned by Reddit, at least I think I read that 2 years ago. Because it always degenerates into personal insults. Even when phrased in terms of ""this is my actual experience"".

Because you just finished your period you wont be ovulating for the next few days anyway, and by that time the depo will of definitely started working, so you are safe to rely on depo as contraception as soon as tonight.

RosesWaterflame,SRSGaming,1388581707.0,"I think the hostility comes from the fact that those of us who thought Bioshock was pretty rad are so tired of the circlejerk of hate about it here. It's ridiculous that you get less shit for liking objectively awful games in this sub than you do Bioshock, BioInfinite especially.

I think Bioshock is significant because it's one of the first series trying to make games About Stuff. Which to me does push the genre forward. Because I care more about story and theme than the sorts of guns that I can shoots mans with. And Thief wasn't a shooter. It did nothing for shooters unless you count ""ability to fire water arrows at torches"" revolutionizing shooters. So don't go all WELL SHOOTING IS THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS EQUATION. It also has a strong stylized aesthetic which might blow your mind but actually matters to people. Bright colours, interesting worlds, impressive scenery, these are all things that matter more to me than ""how seemlessly you can switch between slicing apart demons using directional light and heavy sword swings, 3 special sword attacks, casting 4 different spells, performing side and forward dashes, and throwing shurikens all without pausing, swapping weapons, or straining to reach some far off keys on your keyboard."" Also Shadow Warrior is possibly the most offensive game ever made that people still admit to liking. So also that.

Anyways. Both Bioshocks could have used a lot less combat and a lot more variation in resolving the combat encounters it did have. They also attempt to tackle huge stories which huge themes and in my opinion both pull it off very competantly.

Are we being surly and sulky about this, yes, but it's at a point where it's just exhausting! Every single day, usually multiple times a day, someone here has a word-fart to blow out their ass about Bioshock! Sigh. Not everyone likes the same things about games.

shadow1515,askscience,1388582494.0,"It gets quite complex. The molecules themselves being ""shaped"" somewhat differently can affect their access to and effect on opioid receptors. It's not just an on/off thing all the time, a drug can activate (or even block) a given receptor to different degrees depending on how it interacts with the active site. Various chemical differences in drug molecules can also affect their access to target receptors by affecting their absorption (if taken orally) or their transport once in the bloodstream.

Beyond that, opiates tend to have a variety of metabolites that can have various levels of activity at the same target receptors, which can affect both the duration and degree of effect of the drug.

Feel free to ask for more specifics, but I was brief intentionally because each point I mentioned literally has entire textbooks devoted to it."

Another good pick if you want to counter viper is a razor, since static link forces him out of lane.

That said, against a viper there's no real need to win your learn as long as you survive it. A bottle crowing DK is very popular since he can farm well enough with flame breath etc (viper has trouble pushing so you can get runes as well), but the standard mids that don't die like puck/queen of pain are fine too.

Infamous_Harry,DebateReligion,1388582543.0,"I'll just leave a few of the names of passages that makes christianity quite sympathetic towards communism:

* Luke 1:49-53
* Matthew 19:16–24
* Acts 2:44-45
* Deuteronomy 15:7-8

Now, - if we ignore Matthew 19:16-24, and a lot of Proverbs just as examples - the bible doesn't directly say that being rich is evil. However, it doesn't advocate it either. It states that a christian community should live communally and selflessly.

And, [I don't even think I need to mention it](http://healthland.time.com/2013/06/19/how-money-makes-you-lie-and-cheat/), but wealth makes people turn deceitful.

I see this as a loaded question. Some people, men and women, choose to take the victim role. I don't do that. I choose to fix what I can, and not worry about the rest. So, your question does not even fit into the way I see the world. IMO, to even attempt to answer this question I would have to do ""oppression Olympics"" or encourage the victim role.

bermyWHAT,Parenting,1388582852.0,Most of the advice you're getting is good. Make sure you speak to your child a lot and read to them etc but the most important thing is when they learn to speak back make sure they answer you only in the correct language. No mixing and no half assing it. I've known some kids who can understand a language pretty well but can't speak it or don't want to speak it because they never gained that skill or confidence in the language or their grammar etc might be subpar because they were allowed to get away with half answers because their parent understood both of the languages. It's hard. I taught English to little kids in Spain and sometimes you're getting them to answer quickly and you miss that they actually threw a Spanish word in there but because you both speak both languages it doesn't stop the conversation.

What I find worse is the enemy team unwilling to push and someone on my team going ""ff please""

When it's your team that is winning though, in that situation if you are confident it is best to group up and 5 man to push objectives then you need to let your team know. Don't even need voice or typing really, just ping people and ping the lane you wanna push or draw a giant arrow, usually does the trick. If it doesn't then you're just going to have to cope.

Just know that for the longest time I never had games that finished pre 30 minute mark no matter how stomp they were because people weren't good enough for that yet, including myself.
Towers hurt, and if everyone is playing ""poorly"" you simply cannot ask them to suddenly become twice as good and not die to 4 tower hits.

incogito_ergo,gainit,1388583644.0,"FWIW, I always thought cardio was essential til I really started lifting. I dropped a minute off my mile time (from 4:00 half mile to 3:00, which is not bad for a guy with major knee issues from past injuries), and had a massive drop in heart rate, resting heart rate (from low 60's to low 50's), along with improvements in all health metrics (my doctor said that she had reviewed thousands of blood panels and had never seen anyone with numbers as good as mine), all with 0 cardio. What is amazing is that a second year of minimal cardio and heavy weights has yielded further improvements to all health metrics (including triglycerides and cholesterol levels) even though I was at 19% body fat for my last set of panels. Really goes to show the importance of lean body mass on overall health. 

I think the real secret, as in most things, is balance, and the right thing at the right time (if you want a laugh look at the info that's coming out about the effects of crossfit on systemic inflammation/HS-CRP).  So I guess we are in agreement after all. I would say that as a general rule I have more trouble with people messing themselves up with cardio (HISS is TERRIBLE for anyone on a deficit, especially women, for whom it can destroy thyroid hormone levels). I seriously have more trouble convincing people that they should do resistance training, and that cardio needs to be programmed according to goals, diet, etc. than anything else. 

I can definitely see where you are coming from on this subreddit. My perception is that at least half the sub has serious trouble gaining any sort of weight, so I tend to fall in with the no cardio crowd here. Once you are actually gaining, adding a day or two (or 4) of tabata can be great for conditioning, as long as you make sure to eat/sleep enough to avoid overtraining. 4 minutes a day is really easy from a time management perspective as well.

wwwwolf,explainlikeimfive,1388583677.0,"&gt; When did this start, and how did it escalate to the situation today? Are other parts of Wikipedia (for example the English one) affected in any way?

I'm a long-time Wikipedian but I haven't really looked at the present situation in Croatian Wikipedia that much. But it does seem to follow the pattern of conflicts that other smaller Wikipedias have sometimes had.

Basically, each Wikipedia is a separate project. There are core policies that *all* Wikimedia projects have to follow (like having content available under Creative Commons licence), and there are core policies that *all* Wikipedias have to follow (like core mission of building an encyclopaedia, and having a neutral point of view). But aside of those, the Wikipedias are free to adopt their own policies, though those processes are often adopted and adapted from processes in other wikis.

The problem with the smaller Wikipedias is actually two-fold: First of all, they have a smaller user community, and sometimes smaller communities can be persuaded easily to do controversial things - there may not be enough people to put their foot down. It's also that because the communities are smaller, the folks in other Wikipedias and the folks in the Wikimedia Foundation might not pay as much attention to the projects. Secondly, nationalism often gets out of hand. Wikipedias are supposed to be ""Wikipedias for all people around the world who speak a specific language"", but often end up being ""Wikipedias for the country whose national language is whatever"". In other words, Wikipedias are supposed to cover topics from global perspective, but end up covering local things because that's what the speakers of the languages care most about. There's nothing wrong with covering local things, of course, but local *slant* might be a problem in light that neutrality is a core policy for all Wikipedias. And one-sided political slants end up being extremely problematic, of course.

And I think that's what has happened here. A small group of users with nationalistic slant got a major hold of the project.

As for how will this affect English Wikipedia - it's probably not going to affect other Wikipedia wikis directly (especially ones that already have a large enough community that can stop this sort of banality from happening), but I expect that the Wikimedia Foundation will have to rethink their stuff pretty badly. This sort of issues have been happening for a long time, they should really start developing policies that would stop this sort of stuff. Even if it means that they have to spend more time and energy actively monitoring the smaller wikis."

I'll explain the egg move thing for you.  Tyrogue (and the Hitmon's) are 100% male, so to get egg moves, you need to evolve one of your Tyrogues into the appropriate evolution for what you want then level it up to get them, and breed that with a Ditto.  So in theory, you can have a Hitmontop with Bullet Punch and Mach Punch, even though it can't learn it.

With other Pokemon, you basically (for best results) find a male who can learn a certain move, breed that with a female of the species that you want the Egg Move on, and it will pass the Egg move on - as long as it is a learn-able Egg move for that Pokemon.  Bulbapedia can help with that.  Note: Female Pokemon can learn egg moves, they just have a smaller chance of passing them down when breeding.  A male and female with the same move that is an Egg move for the female species is guaranteed to pass on the move.

So if you took one of those Mach Punch Tyrogues (or Hitmonchans) and bred that with a FEMALE Timburr/Gurdurr/Conkeldurr the baby Timburr would know Mach Punch.

If that was too confusing then you can look on Serebii, Bulbapedia, Nugget Bridge, etc. all have pages that explain breeding a little further."

Point is, there are girls like me that exist. Bad luck is a combination of factors- it could be your height, it could be aspects of your personality, it could be the girls you are meeting. But doubtful that height is the only thing going on."

ernestborgnine2013,AskFeminists,1388584434.0,"Feels like the idea of ""reverse racism"" where white people will find cases where they are being discriminated against. The idea doesn't consider the long history however. Have men not had the economic privileges throughout history? Haven't women generally been the ones to be raped and assaulted by their partners? Not too long ago, women were considered property. I don't think anything else could have destroyed our collective self-worth more than that. In my opinion, even though many rights have been won in the past century, it's still a man's world. I just found out a friend of mine was being abused by her husband, and it shocked me that this sort of thing happens still. Luckily she had the financial resources to leave him. I don't think that would have been the case if she was from a poor family, and that is where I am still hugely concerned about the state of women. One male privilege is knowing you can hurt your wife like that with the comfort of knowing she probably won't leave you.

I am not the most hard line feminist out there, but bottom line, when I see female privilege mentioned, it annoys me as much as I think hearing reverse racism would be to any person of colour."

jpr64,travel,1388584667.0,"China can be notoriously difficult to budget without a little further information.

A 500ml bottle of coke for example will cost as little as $0.50c USD and a meal from a street vendor can also cost similar (and I recommend doing that if possible). A big mac combo will set you back $3.50 but in the likes of Shanghai, you can easily find yourself spending upwards of $100 a day if you get a little carried away with everything *especially* if you're doing the tourist attractions. Most main tourist attractions in China have a ticket/entry fee. For example I climbed up the yellow mountains in Anhui province last month and the ticket price from memory was around $30-40. And that's just for entry to the park to climb the darn thing. Wish I'd taken the cable car now!

Hostels can be pretty cheap in China with some costing as little as $8/night to stay. Keep in mind that when you're a little off the beaten path, some 3 star hotels *won't* accept foreigners. Make use of the overnight trains, they're an experience for sure. Just make sure you book into a hard or soft sleeper (18 hours ""standing"" on a train from Lanzhou to Beijing during national holiday, while a unique experience, was not a fun one!)."

IMHO that's the best choice we have and CoN's.  Going NC with the spermdonor was an easy choice.  Going NC with my slightly less N mother was a bit harder but ultimately the right thing to do.

No family is better than bad family.  Keep in contact with your Mom if possible but if she doesn't respect your NC with your dad then you may have to go at least LC with her as well.

Omnomnomnissiah,sydney,1388585153.0,"My biggest issue with this entire thing is that you never see them pick on someone their own size. It's a giant dick-waving spectacle on the part of the attacker - like the playground bully that just never grew up- and if they had chosen a target that stood half a chance of fighting back, it would be an entirely different story. 

It seriously makes me sick to the stomach to hear about these low acts. Like the report says, you'd think that with all the media coverage lately, people would be more aware of what a single punch to the wrong person can do. All this bullshit about being approached or having too much to drink... He knew exactly what he was doing and all the crowing about being an ""MMA fighter"" just proves my point. What's more, if he has any formal martial arts training, he is fully culpable for is actions. He KNOWS what a hit like that can do to someone unprepared.

 People like this should be forced to meet the families of those they attack and see exactly what kind of damage a thing like this can cause. On top of an actual jail term (because if anyone in lock-up got wind of what they were in for, you can bet your arse that they'll give them a taste of their own medicine, no pun intended), they should also be taken through the trauma wards at RPA.

For instance, it is bad to trade two 2/1 minions for a 4/4, because he used only one card, while you used two, now you're at a disadvantage because he still has the second card you used.

This also counts for buffing, if you're going to buff a creature with a card to kill a stronger creature, it's still the same as using two cards to trade for one.

There are of course exceptions, but that is usually how you need to think when you play. This is why it's bad to have 1 health minions vs. Heroes like Mage, Rogue or Druid, because they can use their Hero Power to destroy your card without investing a card themselves."

wwwwolf,explainlikeimfive,1388585720.0,"Translating something is usually a huge series of asking ""what did the people in country A really meant when they said that, and how would people in country B put this in a situation like this?""

Traslation is a lot about taking the original piece of text in its context and in its cultural meaning, and figuring out what's the proper expression in the other language that works best *in this particular case*.

For example, if you'd translate *""Where's the beef?""* to Finnish, you'd need to first understand what the hell the phrase really means. It's not a less polite enquiry on the location of meat-based food, so you can't just translate that as *""Missä pihvi on?""*. (You could just say that the Finns wouldn't ask where the beef is, because they just assume there *is* a beef in a hamburger. They're actually more concerned if the beef is made of 100% Finnish meat. /obviousjoke) So you'd figure out [where the expression came from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_the_beef%3F) and try to come up with an enquiry on what's the general point. So the more accurate translation would be *""Mikä tämän jutun juoni on?""* (""what's the real plot of this story?"") or you could just skip trying to find a 100% accurate idiom because there's no real one - if the point of the original question was to imply there's *no* beef, then maybe it could be translated *""Onkohan tässäkään ideaa?""* (""is there an idea behind this?"")

And finally, when you make that kind of translation, you also need to take the media and the situation in account. For example, if you're translating a book, you can use long and thoughtful expressions. But if you're making subtitles for a film, you have to condense, because people don't have time to read and comprehend longer passages in subtitles. You'll just have to accept that some witticisms don't necessarily translate well in those situations."

And yes, China can be as cheap or as expensive as you want. From $20 all-you-can-drink in some shitty dive bar to $20 cocktails in the 91st floor of the Shanghai World Financial Center (bottle opener building).

Cities that have metros/subways make it quite cheap/easy to get around. Shanghai you can get to a LOT of places within walking distance of their metro system. Failing that taxis are ridiculously cheap (though there are plenty of drivers who will try and scam a foreigner and set an ""agreed"" price instead of the meter).

Regarding the hotels, the foreigner thing comes down to the political system of the country. Bureaucracy is king over there and some of the shitty sub-par hostels and hotels simply aren't licensed to take foreigners/don't want the hassle. Your bowels will thank you for avoiding these places.

Interestingly, having white skin is a big deal over there. Darker skin has negative connotations implying a poor/rural peasant background.

I prefer to use a gel liner and a very small, pointed eyeliner brush. I like the precision of it. Never do it in one stroke; draw small little lines. My eyes are semi-hooded, so I usually do a thinner line of eyeliner up top, but exaggerate the wing a bit. 

[This tutorial is a similar fashion in which I do my winged liner](http://www.greenscarf.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/winged-eye-liner-how-to.png).

There are many concepts necessary in order to do consequentialism right - including game theory, decision theory, and some philosophy of law - that are barely touched upon or not even mentioned. These may change the results of important moral questions. All this FAQ claims to be useful for is to help get some basic intuitions right; figuring out how to translate those intuitions into action requires more work.

The FAQ is meant as a primer for someone who has never studied consequentialism, or has only been taught a straw-man version.  Obviously someone with more knowledge of philosophy can find flaws at a level that the work was never intended to address."

I've listened to the majority of his albums and hits from time to time and each album has a pertinent theme (like most albums from any artist). Take the Recovery album which has large portions devoted to his 'recovery' after he almost ended his life.

Almost all music is written about things that're important to those writing. But not all of his songs are about his poor family life, his ex wife or people not understanding him.

* [Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) - Sci-fi, supernatural, and horror, with a side of romance. Starts off a little episodic, but gradually gets quite dark and serious. Lots of great character development and strong themes, although not too much actual action.
* [Suisei no Gargantia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16524/Suisei_no_Gargantia) - Sci-fi, adventure. There is a hint of romance between Ledo and Amy, though nothing overt. It's gorgeously animated and shares its writer with Psycho-Pass (Urobuchi Gen), but I didn't find it quite as dark (there are actually a few light-hearted, almost slice-of-life episodes, and it ends on a fairly happy note). The only issue I personally had with it was the pacing. Story-wise, though, I thought it was pretty solid.
* [Dennou Coil](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2164/Dennou_Coil) - Sci-fi, adventure, mystery.

Just sounded like you were being rather unrealistic or unfair based on your initial comment example.

I remember some woman i couldn't stand once, that used to always talk about her boyfriend ( i wasn't interested in her at all), if we were talking about something she would always relate it to her boyfriend despite it being irrelevant or of no value.

.e.g if we were all just chatting about music, she would just say ""Tim can play the piano"" with no follow up or anything interesting

she bored us all to tears

The exploration aspect is *alright* for a little while, but you soon learn that even if you do find a dungeon or settlement, there won't be anything special about it - no notable loot or anything, and the buildings you find are largely copy/pasted, so once you've seen one Avian tower or Floran dungeon, you've seen them all.

Personally, even after playing the fuck out of Terraria, and dabbling in Minecraft a little, Starbound only kept me interested for a couple of weeks.

Yet I can ask friends and family out and not be expected to pay. Even if I ask a female friend I have known for a while, I would still be expected to pay.

If I said ""let's go on a date, I'll pay"" that is offering to pay. Simply asking someone out to get to know them should not incline a man to pay.

robhol,LearnJapanese,1388588281.0,"I have taken a look at RTK1 a while ago and, yes - the way it introduces ""primitives""/radicals/parts is commendable, even if little else is.

&gt;... there's no denying that it breaks down and demystifies what is seen as a very complicated aspect of the Japanese language.

I'm not sure what this means. Breaks down? Demystifies? Are you referring to the ""look at what each kanji is built up of""? Because while that is a good idea, it's not exclusive to RTK, and I don't see that much demystification at work. 

&gt;When I tried to learn the word 病院 before doing RTK, I had forgotten the kanji by the next day. It was overwhelming to learn the kanji, their order, the pronunciation and the meaning all in one go.

Maybe so, but that could just as easily have been a problem with your approach in particular. A kanji doesn't have such a thing as ""*the* pronunciation"" and only barely ""*the* meaning"" (they are ideograms, after all, but they're not always nicely unambiguous), which is why these things are hard to try to study, even if it seems logical at one point.

My beef with RTK and actually the entire notion of ""studying kanji"" is that you shouldn't be focusing on it too much, let alone exclusively. To me, it just seems like going at it from the wrong angle. You will have to learn the word AND kanji either way. Once you have, you'll develop a ""feel"" for the kanji. But that feel in itself (which is what you get from RTK) doesn't help in communication. That's all.

If you've learned words such as 病院、病気 and 病, you'll know what they mean, how to say/write them and use them. If you, on the other hand, have learned all 3 kanji, you're left with ambiguous information. You *will* understand that 病院 roughly carries the kanji's ideas of ""sick"" and ""institution"" and get ""hospital"" from that. You will *probably* understand ""illness"" from the second, and you'll know that the third has something to do with sick, but is it a noun, an adjective, or even an adverb? 

""Post-RTK"", these kanji are just pieces of information floating around - that won't help you read or write. At that point, you'll have to look up the words and only *then* get something you can actually work with. Am I making my point any clearer at all?

Also: words are something you're used to. Kanji are not. The necessity of connecting things to old knowledge while learning has been well established, after all...

&gt;I don't know if you've purposely avoided all discussion on this topic but every bit of advice on RTK explicitly mentions avoiding the second and third books. When people talk about ""RTK"", they mean the first book only.

That doesn't mean it's not (potentially) bad advice. In fact, that just means you have even less information to go on."

poesie,AskWomen,1388588408.0,Break up. I'm not going to participate in a fetish like that.
Nadieestaaqui,AskReddit,1388588413.0,"I disagree. We are animals, sex is our most basic instinct. From the moment we catch each others' eye, it's all we can think about. I want it, you want it, and everything else is just a complicated mating ritual in service of that one need. Until it's met, we aren't ourselves, because we're obsessed with getting in each others' pants. 

Far better, IMO, to get it out of the way immediately, so we can start exploring each other as people, rather than as just a compilation of enticing squishy bits. Once we know we're physically compatible (and once we're a little more clear headed and less ""OMG I WANT TO DO YOU""), we can honestly start examining more important factors in a relationship - emotional compatibility, life goals, spirituality, etc. 

I waited for sex in a number of relationships when I was younger, and it didn't work out for me at all. There's nothing more frustrating than finding someone you connect with emotionally, only to later find that they're incapable of meeting your physical needs, and realizing that you'll eventually come to resent them for that if the relationship continues. 

Thing got a lot easier when I just started being honest and upfront with my dates. If we hadn't had sex by the third date or so, I'd find a way to bring up the topic, throw all my cards on the table (tactfully), and see what happened. Reactions varied, obviously, but regardless of their reaction, it freed us both up to pursue what we were looking for, with or without each other. "

Coalition: Not very exciting, but I suppose it could work.

Masochism: Hmm, interesting. Me likes. Though I'm not sure it's going to trigger as often as you think.

Solidarity: The Dimir and this mechanic have little to do with ""solidarity"".

Instability: Noooooo, no coin flip mechanics for the Izzet, please. Coin flips have a very small niche; you cannot dedicate that much space to  an audience that small. Furthermore, you're pretty much condemning the Izzet to see no tournament play, because competitive players HATE randomness, so coin flip cards have to be terrible. Also, this mechanic has extremely limited design space. 

Advance: No, because of anti-synergy with battalion.

Loan is by fair the most interesting and maybe, maybe masochism (but would need to playtest a lot). Some of the others might be viable, but would need heavy work."

Subjectivity and objectivity just identifies something that is dependent or independent of you mind, respectively.

For example, whether you like a song depends on your own tastes.  However, the notes that make up the song are not subjective, because which notes are being used is irrespective of your (or anyone else's) mind.

Thus in your example of mathematics, even if I cannot give you a perfect proof, whether A == A does not depend on the mind and is therefore objective.  Even if I were to have an opinion on whether it was true, the truth of the equation itself is not conditional on that opinion."

For example in English class at school we read Shakespeare (which is a bunch of shit in my mind even though I did well at it) and in *Romeo and Juliet*, Romeo compares Juliet to a jewel. This one line was analysed intensively and was used to ""prove"" that Shakespeare saw women as objects. 

A character Shakespeare wrote about compares one women he desires to something which is both desired and an object

implies

Shakespeare believes that women are nothing more than objects

This was the leap of logic, then there was some bullshit about this is indicative of a wider trend in Western culture. The problem is that none of this can really be proven or disproved either way. Honestly, in terms of productiveness it's pretty much as bad as playing video games, but this is what it is. If they want to debate don't take them seriously, always ask for proof and sensible conditions which it would take for them to alter their opinion.

I know this is off-topic but the biggest irony is that huge gestures of self-hate is actually a very Western thing; the Christians of Europe were always flogging themselves publically, fasting etc to show how good and ""pure"" they are, and Christianity is totally based on the idea that you are bad and need to be saved by suffering yourself-so in many ways all this over analysis of Europeans culture is actually very European."

Nature never goes into hibernation ;) that's the beauty of it. The beauty of the world doesn't disappear through the seasons, it just changes. Warm rays of sunshine turn into powerful and amazing wind roaring in your ears, it's really quite something. Your setting sounds absolutely fine, it will be beautiful and not sad/evil. But of course if you don't like it, you can always go back inside.


It really depends how strong your tabs are. If you know they are not particularly strong, then just take a whole one because they will probably be somewhere between 100-150ug which will be perfect. If they are strong tabs (over 150ug) then you should take half and see how that goes, then if you are not tripping in 1h30mins then take the other half.

smnytx,AskWomen,1388589129.0,"About a hand's length. Most women can touch the cervical opening with their middle finger. But it's not at the very top end of the vagina - the cervix is near the top, but situated on the front (belly button) side. The vagina itself points toward the small of the woman's back, and the uterus tilts up and forward.  

So if the woman is completely full of a large penis, it is likely sliding past the cervix (not uncomfortable), but with certain penis curvatures, and in certain positions, the cervix gets punched in the face and is generally not happy. 

Incidentally, the most intense pain of childbirth is waiting for the cervix to open to ten centimeters, not pushing out the baby.  For me, going from 4 cm to 7 cm was the most pain I've ever felt, and that's just stage 2. I got drugs after that.  Pushing was a relief (they turn off the drugs at that point because you need to feel it to control it). "

TheLittleGoodWolf,childfree,1388589220.0,"This is an interesting (and IMO valid) opinion however it is also one with a lot of (also valid) controversy.

It is close to eugenics, and whenever something gets close to that reason starts to fly out the window. It's a touchy subject but from a logical and cold standpoint the theory of eugenics is little more than controlled evolution, breeding, at its core. The possible social and political outcomes of it may well be devastating, but as long as the science is sound the biology of it is also sound.

While I have no direct stance on the issue other than it and it's possible outcomes deserve some discussion, I have always been a firm believer in the law of the jungle / survival of the fittest.

We are heavily influenced by nature and biology in who and what we are. The notion that all deserve to live and that the weak should be protected at all costs is in one way an admirable one but is it really for the greater good? We can only muse about how the world would look if plenty of species that were extinct were brought back today. What effect would that have on the ecosystems today? We are constantly evolving and with that our society and the very environments around us also evolve. When medicine became so effective that we didn't need to have a birthrate of 4-5+ children per woman, womens situation and place in society changed, society itself changed. When the industrial revolution came along our entire society changed again, there was less need for a lot of people in the lower classes. People became richer the majority of people moved from the lower income segment upwards. Quality of life improved greatly.

It didn't remove the need for a lower class of manual labor, but it did make it less prominent. This created unemployment. If a robot could do the work of 100 people and it required 20 people to assemble two people to operate and three people to fix and maintain you still have 75 people left without a function. Now an increase in production volume may well make some of there people retain their function but some are still left outside.

This is where our society is today, while the planet could easily sustain twice as many people as there are today we have created a society that has little to no use for a large portion of people.

let's have a thought experiment with crime and police. Crime mostly comes from unemployment and poverty (which in turn also comes from unemployment) so if we created jobs and money to effectively end crime we would have little need for a majority of the police force. Now they are left unemployed and thus poor and thus more prone to crime leading to an increasing need for police. See the oscillation here?

I think I may well have drifted off far from the topic but I don't want to delete what I wrote so I'll leave it as a rant of unfinished thoughts.

The point I was getting to though is that while those people may be a huge cost for society, removing them would create a hole. The people caring for them would be unemployed and in turn cost money. The surplus of people in our society has found ways to be useful that keep people who would have otherwise died, alive. So something that costs money may actually be making money as funny as that sounds.

**TL;DR** society is a complex and rapidly evolving ecosystem."

expaticus,worldnews,1388589346.0,"Like I said, naive. Naive to think that you have any real influence at all over how things are done in the US. What you just described is conforming with the goal of being able to receive a few of the crumbs thrown in your general direction. One percent of the population in the US has over 40% of the wealth - and for them it doesn't make a bit of difference who you or anyone else votes for since they control the entire system anyway. So you can play by their rules and do everything ""correctly"", but just don't expect that by doing so that you will ever make a single bit of difference in how things are run because you will never be a part of their group. 

The American system is not set up to work for you. It is set up to have you work for it, with the alternative being financial ruin and/or incarceration. The only ones who ever ""make it"" and wind up in a position of any real influence are only allowed to be there because they have become integral parts of the system themselves.

And spare me the ridiculous platitudes which implies that the only alternative to the ""greatest country on earth"" are third world shit holes in Africa and the Middle East. There are PLENTY of other countries in the world which have better living standards, better human rights records, and which have governments which are MUCH more open and transparent than the shit show in the US."

V171,AskReddit,1388589379.0,"I was always told that my parents just fell out of love. When I became an adult, I found out more. 


Apparently my dad rushed into a life that he felt he was expected to have rather than what he wanted. He thought he would be happy if he did what he was ""supposed to do"" like marrying, getting an office job, having kids.. That kind of stuff. He literally woke up one day and wanted out. My mom was blindsided and didn't want a divorce. 


As more time went by, I found out how blindsided my mom actually was. They bought a second house together to rent out. After the renovations were completed, my dad woke up one day and said he was moving there. And that was that. 


There is not really any bad blood. Looking back, they're so different and I don't think my mom would have been as happy as she could have been with him. They're still close friends, both remarried and happy, and I'm close to all four of my parents.
