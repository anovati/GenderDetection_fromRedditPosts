Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1390948561.0,"Federalism is the middle ground between confederacy (each state is its own nation, joined to other states for mutual benefit and protection but to have no single body to rule over the states), and a nation where all local and state sovereignty is entirely subsumed by the national government. 

Federalists have a non-extreme favoritism towards states' rights, and hopefully not just in the fair-weather sense that one usually hears it when the Federal government stands opposed to the majorities in some states.  

Fair-weather federalists can appear on both sides of the political spectrum: just as one hears of states' rights defended by pro-lifers in the modern abortion debate, it's not hard to imagine a conservative government that bans abortion nationally, which may induce some pro-choice advocates to suddenly advocate for the states to decide for themselves."

porpoiseoflife,worldbuilding,1390948575.0,"There is one significant problem with your analogy. The fantasy-sports problem only applies when there are non-fantasy-sports players in the conversation. Back when I was a regular player, I was in a group with 9 other people (from other leagues, usually) that would constantly banter back and forth about our teams and players and strategies, plus a bit of scoffing as to who we were benching due to the schedule. 

Would this conversation have had any interest to a random passerby? No. Would people join in? Never. But to us at the time, it was extremely interesting, because **it was a topic that interested all of us**.

Here we have a topic that interests all of us: worldbuilding. If that wasn't true, then why would we all be here? 

(Although I'd have to say there's probably a metric crapton of lurkers, given the subscriber numbers versus comment counts. But that's just inference.) 

(Hi, lurkers!)

&gt;  As it appears worldbuilders find the work of others of limited interest, and their own work as greatly fascinating. 

If you didn't find your own work fascinating, would you even continue writing it? ""Ho hum, this is absolutely boring. I think I'll just make two more nation-states plus flags, unique governing systems, and the minutia of 289 years of history while the hot cereal finishes boiling. \**yawn** God, I can't *wait* for this world to be finished so I can stop this stupid hobby."" Of course, this never happens. If you're bored with your own world, you would have just abandoned it and never touched it again. So naturally you would be greatly fascinated with your own work.

The works of other people... There are times when I agree with you. Sometimes, examples from another person's world are boring as all hell. Is it a problem with their world? Or is it a problem with their writing? Oftentimes, the biggest reason why I don't read an example from another person's world is due to the way it is presented. Typos all over the place. Grammatical errors. Walls of text unbroken for a thousand characters. If someone's typing looks like they would fail 9th grade Composition, I'll pass on reading it.

The other reason? Not enough time to give it justice. I'm not always just typing away as yet another rerun of Law &amp; Order: SVU pours out of the television just to make enough noise to fill the room. (Aaaaand I just noticed which episode it was... Friggin' Stuckey's final episode. I hated that character so damn much that I was happy when he finally got written off. Lesson learned on how to create passion in your audience: a character excellently written is always a good addition, especially if everyone hates his guts and would gladly put a brick through the screen whenever they come on. But I digress.) 

Sometimes, I'll read something and find it exceptionally stupid. Sometimes, I'll read something and find it mildly interesting enough to ponder it for an extra moment. Sometimes, I'll really like what someone came up with. And rarely, someone comes up with something so cool that I immediately try to crib pieces of it for my own work. 

And those moments are why I continue to read other people's worlds: I never know when I get the chance to move my own world further in a highly unexpected direction. 

But even more rarely, I'll find someone's ideas so incredibly fascinating that I can only compliment them and move on. Why? Because I consider that to be the highest compliment. That's how I see it when it happens to me, after all. ([Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1czxf4/state_songs_national_anthems_battle_hymns_what/c9llt4r)) 

So I don't see it as a problem with members of this sub finding the works of others to be of limited interest. Instead, I find the problem to be that there are too many posts about worlds that are, in and of themselves, of limited interest. If people can create more interesting worlds, then it would be even better.

Unfortunately, we're not born with the full knowledge of how to write in an entertaining way. We have to learn that. And then we have to practice it on a regular basis. Writing about our worlds here helps us practice those lessons. And I will never begrudge anyone the opportunity to better themselves, regardless of how useless and foolish I may find the material involved.

tl:dr: Lighten up, Francis. Not everything has to interest you. It just has to interest somebody. Nobody knows what would interest someone until after it is posted, so we might as well post the comments in order to practice. Who knows? Someone might actually like what we're doing..."

carbidegriffen,AskMen,1390948618.0,"As a married man, 37 yrs old, there are a number of issues with hanging out with a woman, let alone a 22 yr old.  

I think a big part of this comes down to ""rules"" or social conventions.  
For example, I've gone out to lunch with 2 or 3 women from my office.  They are all married also.  This is OK because it's during work hours and there are more than 2 people present.  For lack of a better term, witnesses.  
It would also be OK for me to go and have drinks after work with the same group.  
But reduce the numbers to a she and I, and suddenly things get weird.  

Think about how these things look to an outsider.  

Anything that **could** be defined as a date, or **could** look like a date to an outside observer, is where issues will arise.  

I just reread your question, you should know that men don't generally just hang out and chat.  Well we do but we hide it under the guise of ""doing something"".  My closest friends and I will get together to watch a movie, play a game (were geeks), or watch something (sports or a movie).   

Hey lets hang out and chat... Said no guy ever.  

So to hang out with those older guys, you need two things: A group and an activity.

Related to that is accepting that they're becoming whoever *they* are, and they aren't just some little attachment to you. It's fine if they turn out a lot like you, but it's also fine if they don't. Let them be who *they* are. If they have different hobbies than you don't force yours on them. Besides, forcing something on someone like that is awfully likely to backfire.

You can get a 7870 GPU for $175, with a $15 rebate right now. That's at least double or triple the graphics performance of the 650 Ti. A 650 ti will not run modern games at full settings at anywhere near 60 fps, the 7870 will at least get you close in most games or with very few settings turned down. I'd recommend at least the athlon II x4 750K, if not an i3-4130. Total cost increase vs. what you posted is under $200 but will give you 2-3x the performance across the board. Under $600 is where you can't cut any costs without sacrificing huge amounts of performance.

Good start.. if you could capture a similar image where your eyes are open further.. better.   And as /u/royal_antelope said, more photos of you doing different activities.   You've got to have at least one good friend you can hand your phone to and have take pictures.. take at least 4-5 pictures of each pose/activity you want to capture so you can take the best of instead of just having one to pick from.  You live in your home town.. do you have a sibling with a good eye for pictures?

**Self Summary**

Currently this is trying to be all things and not just a self summary.  Exploring new areas of town belongs in another section.. like maybe typical Friday?

This section if for who are you, what are you, what makes you who you are?    You're a nerd looking for nerdettes, it's okay to scare off the mundanes.. let your nerd flag fly.  What nerddoms have had an influence in who you are, what you do and what you want to do with your life?

**What you want to do with your life**

Which segues right into this section.. after discussing who you are, what's made you that way.. where do you want to take it from here. 

What you're doing now to start, then what do you want to do when you go back to college?  What are you studying?  What do you want to be when you grow up?

**first thing**

Not bad.. not much of a hook for someone to start a conversation from but that's not terrible.

**Favorites**

Excellent.. if you're a serious gamer, add an additional block for games.
What games do you want your dream nerdette to play or at least know?

**six things** 

Not bad.

**thinking about**
Good.. got the video game hook in there to avoid being generically thinking about the future.

**Friday**

pull your investigating little know parts of Knoxville down here, maybe give an example or two of cool places you've found?

**You should message me**

You want a nerdette, ask for a nerdette.   If you don't care whether she's a nerd over the same things you are, say so.   Sometimes it's good just to say ""you must be passionate about *something*"" what is your nerddom?"

I tried to dispute the point I disagreed with in my first paragraph, and defend that which I didn't in my second. Sorry if I'm being confusing; I frequently abuse grammar to be ""technically correct."""

Also, often times the opening line is something like ""I think you're cute and wanted to say hello"" so they are pretty much telling you that it's based on physical attraction.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1390949149.0,"&gt;Then you didn't read it. Go back and try again. Mostly the part where I said communism would contain its own contradictions and create its own negation.

Not if it established an iron fisted dictatorship that suppresses all dissent. Also, there is an antithesis to it. It's capitalism, or ideologically, libertarianism/anarcho-capitalism, which has risen partially out of a misguided sense of American patriotism and desire to be as anti-communist as possible. They are the very polar opposite of communism on ideology alone. You're kind of oversimplifying and letting your ideology talk for you, without looking at what has historically happened in countries that actually practice ""communism"" (and yes, I'm aware of the argument that those countries aren't ""true"" communism, but this is the same crap you get from libertarians who claim everything wrong with capitalism is because it isn't a ""true"" free market, you need to look at reality, not abstract textbook ideals). 

&gt; Actually, Cuba has a higher life expectancy and lower infant mortality rate than the US. 

Yes, this is the one area where Cuba surpasses us, but that doesn't justify anything else about cuba. I do agree we need socialized healthcare, but I'd rather not have a fully socialized USA.

&gt;You continue to talk about a strawman definition of Marxists that in no way takes into account modern developments in Marxism.

I'm talking about what's actually happened in countries that practice marxism. Maybe it's modernized a bit, but just like I'm not willing to give anarcho capitalism a test run, I'm not really willing to give marxism a test run. I'm sorry, but you guys own your failures. 

PS, no offense, but everything you've said really just justifies my fact that you're a lot like the ancaps. They say when you criticize their system you don't understand it either. It's not that I don't understand, it's that I'm dealing with real world examples and not the textbook philosophical ideals of the systems at hand.

Look, if you're gonna end capitalism, it's gonna have to be phased out. We're gonna have to GROW out of it, rather than forcing change to happen. And that's if it is possible to phase it out, it might never be phased out, and at best we might end up just having mixed economies. It all depends on what the future holds, what we can produce, social attitudes, etc."

If you want a beautiful, fit, intelligent, well-dressed, kind, funny, talented SO, then you'd better be that sort of person yourself. Most people aren't. So a book that tells people to be realistic in their expectations is a good thing.

I would certainly, certainly be offended if my spouse out of nowhere announced that she 'settled' for me, however.

Would you have the same issue?  

Here's the thing, did you trust him when he left for his trip?  Do you still trust him now?   

I'll assume he has been faithful and intends to stay that way.

What you wrote sounded more like just plain narcissism to me until you got to the part about her freaking out because you were leaving. That does sound like BPD.  

The bad thing is, there is no easy fix for BPD. It's incredibly difficult to treat, and it's incredibly difficult to have people with it in your life. 

Advice? You need to protect yourself and your daughter. If your mother persists in this behavior, it's going to wind up hurting your daughter in the end. I think, after your daughter's bday, you need to have a private chat with your mom and tell her that her behavior cannot continue.

I've tried saying ""I don't know,"" ""They rarely told me,"" or ""We had problems,"" but I always get pressed for more answers. And again, it's not a comfortable subject.

""Well there was T, after three months she said I was too nice then got back together with her drug dealer boyfriend. J made me think it could be long term but was just using me for sex for two weeks. C said she couldn't date me.because her dad was going to jail, then got back with her exboyfriend a week later. B said she missed her exfiance, who she broke up with initially because he beat her. L never gave me a reason. D abruptly ended our date, then posted pictures of her making out with a girl later that night. F started saying that I thought I was smarter than her after I made a reference to How I Met Your Mother. N stopped communicating with me after I said anti-vax people are wrong...""

I could go on. My point is, I really don't want to talk about my exes, I don't know anyone who does, especially on a date, and a lot of what happens leading up to relationships breaking off doesn't sound like what a stable person would do."

Why do you care?  This isn't a big deal.  The fact that you're keeping tabs is weird to me.  They're just facebook statuses.  It's not like he's saying he likes her more than you.

&gt;he never likes anything I post on fb and have my posts blocked from his news feed because he doesn't like what I post.

Depending on what you post, that's understandable.  I know some people that post stuff I don't care about - it's not that I don't like them or think any less of them, they just post stuff that doesn't matter to me, so I either ignore what they post or block the posts.  It's really not a big deal.

As for the not mentioning an SO, I've done that, too, and to guys as well, so what's the difference?  It's not a big deal - if it doesn't come up, then I don't bother.  If there's no reason for me to say ""my girlfriend..."" in conversation, then I won't say it.  The only time I might bring it up when it doesn't come up naturally is when someone shows interest and I need to make things clear *for them.*  But then again, my girlfriend and I trust each other, so this isn't something we'd worry about."

darian66,europe,1390949684.0,"It would be the worlds second in terms of personnel (after China), it would be fourth in number of tanks (after Russia, China and the US.). 

We would have the second largest navy (after the USN). 

On terms of combat air craft we would come in third after Russia and the US.   

We would be third in nuclear weapons and attack helicopters after Russia and the US.

The thing is, the EU lacks logistical capability, most notably air-to-air refueling and air lifting. This severely impacts its power projection.

EDIT: The carrier number is also debatable, Britain's acquisition of a second Queen Elizabeth class is uncertain at best, and France won't be getting a new carrier. Queen Elizabeth also won't be operational until 2020. That brings the number of carriers to 4. Only the French one is nuclear powered and none are super-carriers (this will change when the Elizabeth gets into service). For comparison Russia wants to have 4 nuclear super-carriers by 2023 and China wants to have 3 fleet carriers by then. The US will still have 11 super-carriers, with the Nimitz class being replaced by the Gerald Ford class."

undergroundmonorail,pokemon,1390949776.0,"A while ago I was breeding a Venusaur for a team of mine, and I wanted Hidden Power Fire. Hidden Powers are determined by whether or not each IV is even. The algorithm is pretty easy to use. In fact...

+/u/CompileBot Python

    types = ['Fighting','Flying','Poison','Ground','Rock','Bug','Ghost','Steel',
             'Fire','Water','Grass','Electric','Psychic','Ice','Dragon','Dark']
    ivs = map(lambda x: int(x) % 2, raw_input().split())
    ivs.insert(3, ivs.pop(-1))
    print types[(int(''.join(map(str, ivs))[::-1], 2)*15)/63]

Input:

    31 0 31 30 31 30

...so to get a Venusaur with Hidden Power Fire I wanted a spread of 31/(something even)/31/30/31/30. There's no way to show three possible states (31, 30, something else) with the marking system, so I nicknamed them, for example, ""1x10xx"". 1 represented an IV of 31, 0 represented an IV of 30, and x was anything else.

One of the Venusaurs I bred inherieted everything but Attack from the parents, and generated an IV of 30 for the Attack Stat. As such, its spread was 31/30/31/30/30/30. I tried to name it ""101000"", but I learned that a pokemon's name can have a maximum of 5 numbers in it. That really confused me, because I can't think of a single reason why that would be the case. I ended up naming it ""10100O"" but it was still odd.

I always tip 20% now, because if you think about it many people don't leave tips at all, and I REALLY want to thank that host for letting me come make millions. However, if they made me wait 6 hours and were demanding a tip, I'd still leave at least 15%.


After my second time hosting, I feel like if you leave a 99k tip and you spent over 30 minutes selling in my town, that is more insulting than no tip. Because you just made like at least 5 million and you are basically giving me a penny of what you earned. I would be more happy without a tip at all, if you are that cheap.

SublethalDose,japan,1390950129.0,"I don't have any experiences working with a Japanese boss, but my experience working with an Indian boss was that I went crazy thinking that the abuse meant there was something wrong he wanted me to fix, but eventually I realized I was misinterpreting it through my own cultural assumptions.  I don't know about Australia, but in the U.S., if someone is constantly laying into you with insults and accusations, that means they are going to discipline you or fire you if you don't shape up.  (Either that or they have a personality disorder.)  Accusations of laziness and incompetence are alarming and must be taken seriously, and if the accusations are unjust, you are expected to deny them and speak up for yourself.  I discovered that these assumptions are not culturally universal.  What we would call ""abuse"" is just part of the superior/subordinate relationship in some cultures.  

At another job, a large telecom, I encountered a lot of very aggressive and abrasive behavior from people overseas who tried, as *I* saw it, to bully me into doing them favors.  I don't think they saw it as bullying; I think for them it was just a normal way of trying to get someone to do something:  raising their voice, acting aggrieved and superior, accusing me and my team of being selfish, saying ""this should have been done without our asking,"" warning of horrible consequences, etc.  At first I was alarmed and conciliatory and immediately escalated these issues to my boss.

noc007,raisedbynarcissists,1390950149.0,"I seriously considered getting some security. My n-parents are known to get into screaming matches indoors and occasionally out in full view of the public during and after their marriage. Usually it was my n-mom that escalated things. The wedding was &lt;$3k including the dress and my MIL was kind enough to pitch in for the food (fruit, cheese, and cakes) for a desert reception. Security in case my n-parents decided to act like fools was out of budget, however I took comfort that my groomsmen all had martial arts training, with one of them being a master, and had the skill to remove them without injury if necessary.

I forewarned my wife and future in-laws that my mom can be bat-shit-crazy. Surprisingly she was well behaved. We suspect that she was just out of her element with home and the enabling thousands of miles away. I would be later vindicated when we went to visit my n-mom (one of her manipulations) and my wife got to see the crazy in full force.

I informed my n-dad well ahead and reminded him of the rehearsal. On the day of the rehearsal he and his wife at the time were a no show. At the time I was living in my dad's garage paying rent after being laid off and getting back on my feet with a new job. On the wedding day I went up to my bathroom that was inside the house to get cleaned up for the event and my n-dad promptly got in my face. He started yelling at me, demanding priority seats for his side of the family. Now to put things into context, the church seats 2600 and we had invited &lt;100; prime seats were not going to be a problem. I did try to inform him that he should have brought this up before hand, like at the rehearsal, but he was more interested in hearing himself yell and **ass**ert his authoritay. That was probably the worst part of the day. I was able to later push his crazy off to the side and focus on what the day was really about.

Surprisingly nothing really happened at the wedding. I don't think we had that parents and grandparents for the processional, but I could be wrong. My n-parents sat in different rows and stayed away from each other from what I can tell. My n-dad may have tried to be polite to my n-mom and have some small talk, but he may also have heeded my warning to stay away from her.

My n-parents didn't pay for it and didn't have a say in anything."

3. Spider could *look at the code*, yet he couldn't copy it. THAT IS NOT HOW COMPUTERS FUCKING WORK! ^(To clarify, to look at it, you have to copy it to the computer's working memory.

As for your comment about BBCode, I even stated in my guide that BBCode is not necessary, it's just a tool that makes formatting easy. I realize this can come across in an unintended tone over the internet - but did you read the guide or just see a chapter on BBCoding and make a post here? I don't think you didn't read it, because you quoted material (even if you snipped out the part saying content is the most important), so I just don't understand why you thought I said BBcoding was essential.

The reason BBCode is almost always mentioned in reviews is because it's so easy to be the basic coding, such as italicizing, centering, and listing, and it greatly improves upon presentation. But you should notice that, unless the guide is a horrible mess to look at, the reviews almost always start with the builds, skill explanations, and gameplay."

SecondhandUsername,modelmakers,1390950576.0,"First, I'm in the US, so that is my frame of reference. I don't know what is locally available in the U.K.

My recommendation for a first-time airbrush is a single action. The Badger 200 is equivalent to what I started with 40+ years ago (OUCH! The realization!).  
The Paache single action airbrushes that I have are like [this](http://www.paascheairbrush.com/images/products/h3l.jpg?Action=thumbnail&amp;Width=330&amp;Height=300&amp;algorithm=fill_proportional), the paint control is under the spray tip.

Single action means that you set the amount of paint by (in the Badger's case) the adjustment screw at the rear of the handle. The finger trigger controls the air.  
A double action airbrush means that you control the air by pushing down on the trigger and the paint flow by pulling back on the trigger. It gives better control but is more difficult to master and much easier to make a mistake.

The Badger I mentioned is a siphon feed; it sucks paint up from a jar. You are a little less likely to make a mess. The downside is that you will likely use more paint to load the jar than a gravity feed airbrush.

I caution you to stay away from [these types](http://www.tcpglobal.com/airbrushdepot/images/large/MASE98.jpg), they will never be able to do the detail work you need for modeling. (I was trying to call it an external-mix, but Badger, Paache, Iota, Iwata, Aztek, all make fine external mixes. I am sure there are others.)

The Badger 200 series is right around $60-$70. Add a pancake type compressor for about $100 and you're good to go.  
If you go with the jar/siphon, get extra jars. Don't forget to get eyedroppers, pipe cleaners, etc.

I had a buddy that got a 5 foot CO2 tank for airbrushing. About a year's supply of completely noiseless, clean, dry air."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390950694.0,"I feel like you both may have overreacted a bit (and also, most people in this thread for that matter).

This has been bothering him for a while, and it seems like he took this as a chance to sort of throw it in your face.  It's hard to say without more details, but if he said something like ""Nah, just do that and I'll go home,"" and you responded, ""it'll be really quick, it'll just take a minute""...that would be a little weird to me if he got upset over that.  He's entirely entitled to his alone time, but then why agree to hang out to begin with?  I agree, that's a little weird.

For example, if I'm going over my SO's place and she has something from work that she needs to finish once she gets home, sometimes it'll take her an hour or so to get through it - I don't just blow off the rest of the night, I either watch TV, go on my computer, or screw around on my phone until she's done - we still chat while she's working as well.  No biggie.  Not everyone has to react like that and I don't expect them to, but it's really not a huge deal for her to ask me to still come over, so long as she can accept a ""no"" if I decide I really don't want to come over anymore.  So I guess the circumstances are relevant, too - was it a long period of time?  Just a few minutes?  What was the deal?

If you want a better answer, what were the specifics of what happened?  Did you just half ass agree to get together, or have actual plans?  How much time between classes, or was this the end of the day?  Where were you hanging out?  What was the conversation actually like?  How exactly did you approach your problem with the situation when he said he'd go home?

Because to me, I'd guess that he's feeling a bit smothered, but why?  Have you been doing something to make him feel this way in general?  Maybe he was just waiting for you to do it again to point it out to you, so even though this scenario was a bit weak for how he's been feeling, it was enough to say ""hey, that's not cool.""  "

The mod you need to decide how much you want to learn about vaping, or how oblivious you want to be about the inner workings of ohm's law.  Then the topper has similar requirements. Do you want to build coils, or just install prebuilt coil heads?

keakealani,singing,1390950807.0,"One exercise I know of for men accessing falsetto is to start a descending scale at a pitch level you know will be in a falsetto range (C5 is a good start for that for most guys), and work your way gently down, adjusting your mix as you move into your full voice. 

Another exercise is to practice ""sirens"" or ""yawn-sighs"" (they are basically the same thing but different singers/teachers call them different things). Basically, start at a middle pitch level, slide up to a fairly high pitch level, and then slide down. The emphasis isn't on hitting exact pitches (in fact, it should be a fluid, relaxed motion) but more about getting the breath going throughout your range, even into your falsetto register. 

My understanding is that falsetto actually requires more air (I'm not a dude, so I wouldn't know first-hand), so it's really important to work on exercises that build breath support and increase controlled airflow. 

As others mention, the diaphragm is essentially an involuntary muscle, so you can't really ""feel"" it in action. If you are breathing, you're using it. However, the important part, and the reason diaphragms are brought up, is that you can control the release of air (basically, the speed/pressure at which air is exhaled) by controlling the muscle groups around the diaphragm (including the abdominals, lower back, intercostals, upper leg, etc. muscle groups) in order to release the air more gradually and in a more constant, controlled fashion. 

As for how you know you're using it correctly - honestly, a lot of it ends up being how you sound and whether or not you're able to create a supported tone. If you're using a lot of tension in the jaw or throat in order to ""support"" your singing, then you're not using your breath correctly. If you're supporting the tone on a controlled stream of air that allows for a relaxed jaw and throat, you're probably more or less using it right (it's a bit more complicated, but that's a good rule of thumb). It is definitely something you sort of have to ""feel"", as it can be a slightly different phenomenon for everyone, but usually it is accompanied by other signs of healthy singing. "

If chromosomes (which most people don't know anyway) or body structure was enough to make me not male...well, I wouldn't be trans then.

I get that sometimes cis people are 'just trying to understand' when they ask questions like these.  but why not just try listening to trans people and accepting that maybe we might know what we are talking about?  there's an obvious bias here in your thinking, and it's not going to make understanding any easier."

Trigger23,penguins,1390950982.0,"First, pointing to a team's record as a way of quantifying defensive proficiency is a huge cop-out. That kind of thinking is how a bafflingly large segment of Leafs fans adopted the ""Keep Calm and Corsi's Wrong"" mantra as more than a joke. The better way of looking at it would be GAPG with and without him, which gives us 2.62 GAPG with him and 2.42 without him. The offense takes a commensurate drop of nearly a half-goal a game when he's out, but since we are talking about moving him to a forward role we can safely assume he'll still have a positive impact on offensive output. 

Second, even if if I accept that we are just as good defensively with and without him, then at the very least he isn't contributing to the defense and there's nothing to be lost by moving him up front, while we may have something to gain by doing so. 

Third: where on earth are you getting a 20-6-2 record VS the west? That's over half the number of games we've played this season. Our record against the West is 10-3-1. Further, four of those wins have been against Winnipeg, Edmonton, or Calgary, and four have come in the shootout (2 apiece against Vancouver and Chicago); our only regulation win against an upper-half team in the west was against San Jose on our home ice.

I think if the animals we used were kept in better conditions they would be healthier and it would be healthier for the people who need to eat the meat. I'm definitely for not messing with animals that aren't going to feed anyone or put clothes on anyone's backs. I'm also about producing as little pollution as possible and not tearing up so much of our natural resources.

But there is something about how the top tiers of racial and financial privilege glom onto the ""Green"" movement and animal rights. I would guess that these are the social issues you'd choose if you didn't want to fight against your own supremacy. 

When I think of environmentalism, I think of too many people getting asthma from the air, people who can't afford to move away from the factory that's tainting the water, and tribes in the Amazon who have their homes being sold underneath their feet for lumber/farmland. These are intertwined with race and class issues.

As long as I can remember though, there've been people saying that the main victims are the trees, the fish, and those types of owls that live in ground holes. 

The more extreme end of folks, who compare the mass chicken coops with slave ships, pet ownership to slavery, butchering animals to the holocaust of the Jews, and their movement to the Civil Rights movement are a special bunch.

If I'd guess anything about them, it's that they believe real human rights issues are over with, and they've been intoxicated with the glorious stories of MLK, Malcolm X, Harvey Milk, and oh gosh golly do they want a reason to fervently march in the streets and believe in a cause greater than themselves.

Feminists KNOW that kino works. They KNOW that women need a man to show them what they want. They KNOW that women cannot *explicitly* consent to sex without losing attraction for the man foolish enough to ask.

And they KNOW that the moment a woman has sex with a man, she becomes his slave. Her emotions render her beholden to him. She becomes stupid for him, and loses her one bargaining chip.

MarvinTheAndroid42,nonononoyes,1390951219.0,"Well, after what I'm hearing from occasional reports I'm starting to believe that my car has decided to be an exception to the rule just to embarrass me. Still, I've not had any understeer problems, not at 40kph and not at 110kph and while I most certainly agree that a good Honda handles *very* well, I'm not about to tell someone to buy a Honda over any good AWD car. 

Now, I'm not saying a Ford handles well(it really doesn't) but I recently watched a video of the ST vs WRX and in order to take the Canyon corners Ford needed to loosen the rear suspension a ton, and I even saw a rear wheel lift off. 

I believe that there may be a compromise between the two of our arguments, however. At extremely low speeds or unbelievably tight corners the FWD could have an advantage due to no pushing in the rear(Civic friend brought that up), but at even the tightest a real road could offer I can't say I agree anymore. I've made a habit of never using an ideal situation to explain something's abilities or compare them to something else. It's like saying a muscle car is good in a straight line, I don't care because an STI can do a 4.8s 0-100kph *and* turn a corner afterward. The kind of corners needed for a Civic to significantly out-perform a relatively well handling Subaru are only found on tests built for the Civic itself. 

Granted, those wishbone struts sound like a damn good idea, but even an Integra forum admitted that while double wishbone is fantastic(and it sure sounds like it), that doesn't mean that MacPherson struts can't also be quite good. [Link to that](http://www.team-integra.net/forum/blogs/michaeldelaney/154-double-wishbone-vs-macpherson-strut-ii-compared.html). I'm not saying that somehow a little bit of ""it does fine"" means that we're on an equal playing field here, but the possibility of a *complete* destruction is definitely lowered. "

Likewise: 
&gt; Another point, which is aimed at pre-trans people. While we can learn a lot pre-transition, our experiences and self-awareness are pre-transition. It is very disturbing to read a pre-transition person speaking forcefully on behave of those post-transition as if it was their lived experiences. We should all restrict ourselves to our lived experiences. It's guaranteed to upset people if you speak on their behave and their lived experience when it is not your own. Furthermore, assuming you know an experience you don't is also arrogantly presumptuous.

^ I'm totally confused as to what this refers to. Elsewhere the usual issue with regards to pre vs post is that post-transitioned people are regarded as ""valid"" whilst any pre-transitioned person is regarded as impure or ""less-than"" (hell, only yesterday did my brother call me up for the first time in 2 years and when the topic of SRS came up, responded with ""So you finally get to be an actual woman?"", which is true to how I personally feel about myself, but many people can find solace without having to go nearly as transitioned as me, and this shouldn't detract from their being accepted as their identified gender). I have literally never - and I'm very active in LGBT societies and such - encountered shaming of post-transitional states within the trans community. Transphobic cis people often call it mutilation and such, sure, but I've literally never heard a transperson say that. Am I missing something huge here? Likewise the ""we should restrict ourselves to our lived experiences""... huh?! What on Earth has happened here to warrant that? o.O

But yeah, besides this confusion, I do agree that any TERFs and chasers should be treated first and foremost as ill-informed rather than ill-intented. It shouldn't be attributed to malice that which can be attributed to ignorance. Responding with aggressive hostility will enforce an Us vs Them mentality in their mind, and get us nowhere. Responding with the truth and perhaps calmly and collectively telling them that they're wrong and directly leading to our suffering would be far more effective. That being said, given transfolk have to put up with *literal* othering, insults, threats, hostility, and even violence towards us, it can surely be understood if members among us respond aggressively (especially if this is regarded as a Trans* Safe Zone), right?"

azuretek,news,1390951377.0,"I've had a ton of bad run ins with cops. I had my license suspended in Scottsdale because the cop that pulled me over claimed I didn't stop when taking a right turn onto a main road. The license wasn't suspended because I didn't pay the fine or anything, it's way more ridiculous than that. The officer told me I could either go to traffic school and get it taken off my record (since I'd never had been given a ticket before), or pay the fine on the back of the ticket. I had just started a new job and didn't want to take time off to go to traffic school so I figured I'd just take the hit to my record and pay the fine even though I was adamant I had stopped (the officer had to speed from several blocks down to catch me even though I was going about 20mph after turning onto the empty main road). 

Turns out in Maricopa County if you're given a ticket for running a red light it is mandatory to attend traffic school. I never found this out since they gladly accepted my payment and their automated system made no mention of any additional requirements. So I went along thinking that was taken care of, I moved to Seattle a year or two later and got pulled over for speeding (going down a hill, wasn't paying attention to my speedometer). Turns out my license is suspended and it's a felony to drive in another state on a suspended license (pleasant Washington police let me drive myself home too, just had to make sure to go to the court date).

It's an even longer story to get into how I got my license back but I ended up having to attend a school in Washington, and because I was now a felon Arizona wanted me to go back and go to court. I ended up talking to a judge and literally asking ""How much do I need to pay to avoid having to go down there"", paid in total about $3000 to both Arizona and Seattle to get my license back over a ticket I accepted and paid. Lesson learned, I should have just fought the original ticket. Also never trust what police officers tell you, always call and call again to make sure there are no issues with your legal status."

Unless you have a long connecting flight, or a long layover.  The weather changes, sometimes too rapidly to plan on.

Again, if your home airport is not a hub then there isn't an option to use it to connect to another airport.  It's like a dead end.

tbhoggy,vermont,1390951586.0,"My advice? Stay on 1-2 mountains while you're in Vermont. If you guys don't ski much, the first day or two is just getting you ski legs back and learning the mountain. There is a lot of mountain to explore on Killington (I grew up there and still don't get bored of 5 days of skiing). Killington has a pretty good young night life set up during 'college' weeks. There are (free) drunk cabs (one's called the Barrell Rider) to get you and your buddies from your condo to the various night spots. 

I think the biggest advantage of staying in one area is getting to know some people. Meet some other college student, get drunk with them at night and ski with them during the day.

In addition a lot of your days can get sucked up with traveling. Even going from Killington to Okemo (the nearest 'big' resort) will eat up an extra hour or hour and a half of a day. Staying you'll get cheaper lift tickets and lodging if you stay in one place.

FactualPedanticReply,Seattle,1390951761.0,"The point of pointing out the large population was not to show that it is comparatively more valuable or virtuous - it was only to show how absurdly broad your generalizations are. 

It sounds like a dear friend of yours was killed by a gangster or thug. I'm really sorry to hear that; that stuff shouldn't happen anywhere. You do realize, though, don't you, the economics of crime? If there's a market for illegal goods, criminals will supply it. If no Californians had ever come to your town, criminals from some other place would've. There's nothing uniquely Californian about criminal enterprises establishing stomping grounds and exhibiting a wanton disregard for human life. The small view is that a person with a sick ideology and misplaced values killed your friend. The large view is that your area is being moved by its own economy increasingly toward the mainstream and toward urbanization, with all the negative effects that that brings.

Obviously, it's up to you to choose how you want to deal with your grief. You can blame an entire state's worth of people and whatever small common cultural threads they share for your friend's death. You can make (hopefully hyperbolic) statements advocating gun violence against people from that state. You can externalize blame for violence in your community all you want; you can make California your Great Satan. You can ignore or willfully misinterpret anyone making an argument about why your prejudice is irrational. At the end of the day, grief *is* irrational.

I gotta say, though - person to person - that you have very little courage or character if you let your heart take your head so far down such a dark path. Be well - I hope that you find fortitude and clarity of thought."

&gt; In the second one , specially if the war is unpopular , you want an army that is detached from society , something like a warrior class where there is basically one option to go and fight. It is very important to break association with common folk.

If I wanted to help you find an answer, I might gently push you away from thinking ""Do your homework"" is in any way encroaching on a child's right to self-determination.  A child refusing to do homework is not determining their life for themself because the child is incapable of ""determination"".  A child fundamentally lacks the knowledge/capacity to understand what they're determining in regards to ""self-determination""...just as telling the kid to not have sex with an adult is not a violation.  Why is a child's consent to sex irrelevant?  Because they don't *really* know what they're consenting to. Why is forbidding a child from truancy not a rights violation?  Because a child probably can't understand the full scope of making the choice to drop out of school.



I don't think social workers ""don't care when a child's rights are violated"", its that a child isn't *really* making an informed decision when they make a decision they lack the ability to comprehend. [about how they want to live their life]

I'm not sure why you think the two are at odds with one another.  It's not that girls *shouldn't* be strong, but rather that whether they're strong or weak doesn't matter nearly as much in most situations as how beautiful they are.

And you're exactly right.  It *is* in the best interest of children to be/act straight or, if a racial minority lives in a majority white area, for them to act ""white"".  That doesn't mean there's a problem if they don't turn out this way, simply that it's better for their own sake if they do.

Ozzimo,AskMen,1390951878.0,"I was all the way at 28 when it hit. I had been doing a job that most people think is amazing for about 6 years. It was pretty great at first but doing that job meant working as a contractor and losing my job every 9 months or so. Sometimes I would have a job waiting for me. Other times I had 6 months of unemployment before another came along. As I turned 27, I had a son. This compounded my feelings of being completely stuck in this cycle of almost having a real job. No savings to speak of, no retirement, no job security, and no chance of advancement. 

So just before my 30th birthday I switched job types from the ""fun"" version to the ""safe"" version. I got a full time job doing something similar to what I was doing but with much more stability. Fuck, they even had profit sharing. I saved up some money and bought a scooter and my life has been looking up ever since.

beanfiddler,AdviceAnimals,1390951883.0,"Notice that I'm not saying that reform wouldn't be a good thing too. Like  fixing [food deserts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert) and programs that include co-op food and cooking programs for busier people. But the solutions need to account for the realities of poverty, instead of *punishing* people for being poor.

Requiring poor people to cook their food is ridiculously paternalistic and pretends that poor people don't cook because they're stupid and someone hasn't come around with a big enough stick to force them too. It doesn't fix problems, it *creates* problems.

You're also making the mistake that people who are on the dole stay on the dole. That's not true. And if it is true -- that you can work full-time and make responsible spending decisions and still not make enough to get buy without assistance -- than it's an institutional problem. I was personally raised on food stamps, true, but we weren't on them *continuously*. We used this program or that program as we were eligible. When I was 13-16 years old, we weren't on any assistance other than free school lunches.

Policies need to be made that make sense for the realties of living in poverty. Not how rich people in ivory towers think we ought to live, but how poor people are actually forced to live -- quickly, cheaply, structuring their entire lives around millions of inconveniences in towns and cities built around cars they don't have and time they can't spare."

Or you could look for another 2GB 7850 and put them in Xfire, although unfortunately prices on them have been all over the place and supply is short. Dual 7850s will rock anything at 1080p and should work fine with your mobo. 

you can get this one for $150 after rebate: http://us.ncix.com/products/?usaffiliateid=1000031504&amp;sku=77602&amp;vpn=FX-785A-CNL4&amp;manufacture=XFX&amp;promoid=1347

although I'm not too pleased with a $30 rebate, they should just cut the price by $30. 

Alternatively, try to sell your 7850, you can probably get at least $140 if it's in good condition, and upgrade to a gtx 760 or r9-280x. "

Watertor,gaming,1390951939.0,"Not...really? You said ""Knowledge of Reddit""

Many people are aware of reddit thanks to the AMA - especially due to huge names like Obama doing them. I would say more than half of the people who have heard of the name ""Reddit"" have never actually posted on it or even visited the site for that matter, but merely have *knowledge* of its existence thanks to a second or even third hand site.

A presence on reddit is - the way I'm using it - actually going on the site. Whether it be just to browse and essentially lurk, or actually posting is irrelevant, but the site is actually used and maintains a *presence* to the person.

Someone who actually goes on reddit is likely to be more modern than the usual facebook user. This modernization leads to more fleshed out concepts of modern schools; of which gaming resides. RPGs are a big part of gaming, and most who know about gaming know about them, and the fact that Skyrim is not the first one to come out.

Some of the situations OP point out are (to some extent) inappropriate. 

At the same time imagine yourself in a situation where you meet this 10/10 woman with a great personality. Even if it's a work related situation, these moments don't happen often. If you don't approach, you've missed your chance, I feel like the approacher would generally be inclined and advised to approach here.

7oby,mississippi,1390952021.0,"It's time we had a decent government that actually cared about the state instead of one that says crap like ""poor people need to learn how to use alarm clocks"".

http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/01/27/women-children-mississippi

According to Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative:

&gt;BURNETT: Well, education is important. All of the research shows that the higher level of education you have, the less likely it is that you'll be in poverty. And that is a very important strategy also for moving families out of poverty. I just remember, for example, back when we got our 1996 welfare reform program, we forced welfare recipients into work. My organization was offering an adult literacy program at that point. Those adults were forced out of basic literacy classes into the workforce by that welfare reform change.

&gt;And at that time, **our governor here said that he thought the only thing welfare recipients needed to learn was how to set an alarm clock**. So that kind of attitude that's so punitive and based in the myths about who poor people are and what needs to happen to force them to go to work, that is how you get outcomes that don't take you to a strategy that's really effective, and one that's going to address the needs that people really have.

The governor of MS saying ""stop bashing MS"" is like the government of NC [legislating that there's no such thing as climate change](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/06/01/sea-level-bill-would-allow-north-carolina-to-stick-its-head-in-the-sand)."

I think you need a very structured blazer. Something with defined shoulders and angular seams... like the seams and lapels pointing to the waist. Anything loose or ""relaxed"" will give you less shape, and may look too casual for work anyway. 
You could wear an angled cropped one (longer hem at front, curved upwards around the back), but I think a longer blazer will look more professional.

Incorrect. The landlord has basically no rights as a landlord (including requiring you to pay rent); the tenant always has rights.

I rented a basement, a ground floor of a high ranch, the top of a high-ranch, and a whole house (oddly, in the reverse order). Splitting a house always felt a bit like living with mom, but whole house rentals are possible and I'd suggest highly preferable - but the most expensive, and with the fewest perks in terms of Free internet, cable, heat, etc.

Fortunately I never had any major disputes with landlords - especially in the ""illegal apartment"" situation, they're usually pretty accommodating as they understand the law isn't on their side. As long as everyone plays nice, it can be a workable situation for a few years."

Ten times as cheap? New my car cost ~$31,000, are you telling me that people were selling cars for $3,000 at some point? And currently mine would run about $7000 because of the low mileage but a $700 civic is basically dead, at least past the few hundred dollars of mods stage. "

I was thinking of the line from Mad Men when Peggy is the new girl and is getting lots of attention. Joan says something like ""You're the new girl.. Enjoy it while it lasts"".  

I am NOT saying you should enjoy being harassed, but most day-to-day harassment situations come from both parties escalating something. When harassment becomes a big problem, is when you are getting threats or are being treated very negatively on a repeated basis by the same person or group of people. If there is a sudden change in people's behaviour, it could very well leave just as suddenly. I think your participation in more events is probably helping put you on people's radar. It's unfortunately the way some places work. If you get too involved in social activities, you can be labeled all sorts of things, usually a keener. But it depends on the company.

I would try to wait it out for a bit longer without getting overly excited about what's happening around you, assuming you like working there. Otherwise, I would suggest leaving the company and getting a job elsewhere. I like to go with the idea that people are basically good. Give them a chance to correct their behaviour.

Reddit admins had to impliment it because only a few weeks ago a new subreddit called /r/redditpersonalarmy exploded in popularity. Guys would post phone numbers of their ex's or whoever and everyone would call them and basically harass them. Horrible stuff. It got so bad that one girl called the police.

Anyway I'll type my number in again. See **********! Try it and see for yourself if you don't believe me."

ibbity,TumblrInAction,1390952539.0,"As a person with roughly 12 years of experience in the world of fan fiction, I can tell you right now that ""being written by women and people of color"" is not so much the reason that most non-fandom types look askance at it. It is more because the majority of fanfiction is actually fan-PORN and a goodly chunk of said fan-porn is grosser, creepier, and nastier than even ACTUAL porn generally is. As in, MAINSTREAM fan-porn features things that you'd have to dig really, really deep into fetish websites to unearth. The pedophile-incest-skullfucking section of the Harry Potter fandom is the first example I came up with off the top of my head, but they're far from the most...interesting out there. 

Also, you are never ever allowed to express negative thoughts about any of this in any way or you get dogpiled and screamed at for ""kink-shaming."" I've seen MASSIVE fights about whether it's creepy or not to obsessively seek out pedo-rape fic to whack off to. There's non-icky fanfiction out there---I've written some myself---but there are some really, really good reasons why fanfic writers, hell, fandom in general, tend to get the old side-eye from non-fandom people."

When you can only do one of those things proficiently, I have a hard time swallowing the narrative that he's an elite defenseman without the distinction of ""offensive"" preceding it. He has a negative impact on the team's defense and a positive impact on offense. 

The bottom line is that even if he has a net positive impact, he is replaceable on the defensive side of the puck and would still produce points playing at forward.

DERangEdKiller,Parenting,1390952552.0,"To add to Brainwired's comment, don't see her alone again, but be honest about why. Although it's a lot to ask of a child, I think it would be good if an adult she likes and respects told her that: 



""There are bad things in this world, and to help fight that, people have the power to raise their voice, and others will hear, and try to help.  Unfortunately, there's nothing stopping people from lying, or misunderstanding and when they do, it puts others in danger.  People don't understand our friendship, they think I'm not nice, and if they think I either am or planning to hurt you them telling that to the police could really hurt me.  Don't be mad, just remember to always know there's more than one side to a story, and not everything you here is really the truth.""

ByronicAsian,China,1390952562.0,"&gt;The Qing dynasty did not institutionalize rape for its military. Nor did it engage in weeks-long orgies of rape and massacre as the Japanese did in Nanking.

And during the suppression of the Boxer rebellion, First-Sino Japanese War, and Russo-Japanese war, neither did the Japanese. In comparison to the rest of the forces in the expeditionary army to retake the foreign concessions, there is a consensus that the Japanese were far better behaved, even if said motivations were not out of altruism, but b/c of politics. 

In the Russo-Japanese War, and 1st World War prisoners were given quarter and were very well treated. During the Russian Civil War, the Japanese Expeditionary Force again, conducted its operations in a relatively clean manner. In fact, one company even acted to protect civilians and non-combatants (at its own expense as I believe they were all killed).  

Ogami_ito's point still stands, the 1st Sino-Japanese War was a conflict between a crumbling Imperial Hegemon and a upstart empire. There is little moral high-ground that can be held on either side. 

Showa era Japan and its military, is a different bird. 

I strongly recommend Edward Drea's book on the IJA if I could remember the title. I'll link it later.

cmagnificent,PoliticalDiscussion,1390952836.0,"Who's going to pay for that training? You would need officials and officers to train these rednecks which is time and money that can be spent on things that actually matter like tracking and investigating violent offenders.

Secondly you completely missed the point, what happens when this trained and deputized redneck stops someone who is a contributing seasonal worker who is in the off season and therefore not at this present time working? By your own standards *even though* this person is a contributor, they would be deported.

You're right a lot of illegal immigrants would be happy to be in the system and allowed to legally work in the US, the problem is that's called 'amnesty'* and no conservative group would be caught dead supporting it which already bites back into my point that this plan would *never* be passed by any legislative body at any level of government.

And once again, what do you think these criminal background checks are going to show? If they're an illegal alien and they had committed a crime and been arrested for it (the only way that something can show up on a criminal record), *they would have been deported for being an illegal immigrant then*. Are you proposing we start sending out background check requests to their nations of origin, wasting the law enforcement resources of those countries as well?

And while I'm here I'll add a new problem that I really should have included before - How, in any real world scenario could this proposal possibly not lead to racial profiling and discrimination? All of a sudden people that are third or fourth generation Hispanic immigrants (and US citizens by birthright) are being stopped by jackasses wearing trucker hats with a confederate flag for no other reason than they're Hispanic. How would could you possibly prevent that?

&gt;  The Daily Beast describes it as ""a spin-off of the Hudson Institute where right-wingers (along with Alan Dershowitz) champion hawkish, often ""pro-Israel"" policies and, not infrequently, rattle off Islamophobic blogposts.

As for the second source- it is not news, it is an opinion piece, albeit it, based on possible facts. The final 2 sentences destroy any semblance of impartiality.

&gt; Yet Kerry does not seem to care whether Abbas is a ""rightful"" president or not. He is so desperate for a diplomatic achievement that he is prepared to ignore fundamental facts.
&gt; 
&gt; How can Kerry expect Abbas to sign any document declaring the end of the conflict with Israel when many Palestinians are already pointing out that their president does not even have a mandate to act or speak on their behalf?

MaximilianKohler,AskReddit,1390952985.0,"&gt; there are plenty of people with disabilities who say that their biggest problems stem not from their disabilities but from the discrimination they face from able-bodied society

That's not the same thing as choosing to be born with a disability. Obviously no one who's already a cognizant human being wants to be discriminated against by the rest of society.

The deaf community is not a valid argument/comparison. First of all, that's not disabled. Secondly, that kind of thing happens because they feel like they are part of a tight knit community. It's a very common human reaction to think of someone who leaves your community as turncoat. And I'm sure you've probably seen those viral videos of deaf people being able to hear for the first time. Those aren't negative reactions.

&gt;My argument is merely that many people with disabilities are glad they were given the ability to exist in the world.

That's not the argument. It's human instinct to want to live. Cases where people are miserable enough to kill themselves are very extreme.

Your statement sounds like an idiotic anti-abortion argument along the lines of ""every time you don't ejaculate into a woman and make her pregnant you're preventing a new person from being able to experience life"". Just because someone who's already alive doesn't want to die doesn't mean it's right to boundlessly create people.

&gt;Able-bodied people tend to imagine disabilities as more debilitating than they actually are, as they imagine only the initial despair.

That's ridiculous. From my experience it's the complete opposite. You're living proof of that. Many people seem unable to put themselves in the place of someone with a major disability.

Do yourself a favor and establish the habit of doing your taxes ASAP; your employer has to give you your W-2 by the 31st, and assuming you've got no other forms of income, you can do your taxes next week and probably have a refund, if any, in 3 weeks. If you owe money, you'll have 10 weeks to accumulate money towards the taxes before penalties kick in. 

Other advice: avoid H&amp;R Block, and really avoid their ""refund advance"" loans-- the fees are horrifying. You can probably file for free online (Federal taxes), and maybe your state offers something like that as well."

""Just so we’re clear on this: I still love football. I love the grace and the poise of the athletes. I love the tension between the ornate structure of the game and its improvisatory chaos, and I love the way great players find opportunity, even a mystical kind of order, in the midst of that chaos.

The problem is that I can no longer indulge these pleasures without feeling complicit. It was easier years ago, when injuries like Stingley’s could be filed away as freakish accidents. TV coverage was relatively primitive, the players hidden under helmets and pads, obscured by fuzzy reception, more superheroes than men. Today we see the cruelty of the game in high definition. Slow-motion replays show us the precise angle of a grotesquely twisted ankle and a quarterback’s contorted face at the exact moment he is concussed."""

Anyways, a while back, I was in Venturing (boy scouts and girl scouts troop, co-ed). Anywho, we were in North Carolina open sea kayaking for nine days. Somehow, I don't know if this was sudden (which they rarely are) or if the leaders somehow missed this detail, but there was a hurricane coming our way. Now we're from Miami, so we were like hm, oh well, let's keep going! 

It started storming, so we decided to stop by on a fishers island, I think that's what it was called? The rain stopped, so we decided to all hang out on the beach. No biggie, rght? My best friend at the time and I decided to see how far out we can swim. Tide started taking us farther and we couldn't see our parents anymore. It had been a while since we were able to touch the sea floor, and we had been trying to paddle for what felt like forever! 

We started saying our goodbyes... yes, that's how dramatic we were.. We were crying and saying how much we loved each other. She was training to be a lifeguard, and my swimming skills were limited, so she was trying to swim while holding on to me, and I was doing my doggie paddle. After a while, my exhausted legs kind of went limp.. and I could walk..... on the ocean floor... what? We stared at each other for a while, and vowed never to speak of it again"

It feels pretty good, but you need special water based lube or it gets wrecked, you have to heat it up by soaking it in hot water for 15 minutes which usually results in it being part cold and part scalding like poorly microwaved food (you may burn your dick), you have to wash it out THOROUGHLY every use. The whole process takes like an hour and a half. And it makes *noise*. Like, a lot of noise. Squelches and queefs and poofs of air... you may as well be watching porn without headphones. If you're going to get a fleshlight, live alone, buy one fancier than the cheapest one, and be prepared to buy expensive water based lube to use, as well as do the dishes every time you masturbate.

My parents' denial regarding my medical issues is quite possibly the worst thing to happen to me ever, other than perhaps having those medical issues in the first place.

I'd also probably try and talk my parents into letting me go to the high school from which I graduated in the first place, instead of two years of hell and *then* transferring to the good school.

NONE are as thorough but they present nicer. They compel better to the new gamer.


&gt;but when a heated debate broke out about some obscure anime show I wasn’t familiar with I realized this wasn’t my scene

I've sorta been there. My first night out there was a heated debate during The Resistance but ... I didn't follow basically. It was like greek.

&gt;And boardgames are about the people. About the culture.

They don't have to be they can just be about your people and not necessarily the culture. Some games are about the culture. But there are games that work outside of it, they can be about YOUR culture whatever that is. With a good group the game IS the fun. What you really need are *light light* games. Games that can get people to the fun as fast as possible.

I'm sorry TTR fans but I'm not sure that game is it. I'd start with some of the speed games like [Anomia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwCvFS1wg0I). or something that looks less impressive like [Bohnanza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-uVeuEtozM) or [Snake Oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70xnYC9G9EQ) or [Love Letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COtLDPeLG_o). Things that you can sculpt to your group like [Dixit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6UlbxeDE0w) rather than games that ask you to sculpt yourself to the culture. Then you can use your existing social circle they can have fun with these games. You can make your own jokes. Heck that's half the fun of Dixit and part of the joy of Snake Oil. Using interconnected references. They don't have to be nerdy references.

Eventually you get to a point where you have a starting gamer knowledge under your belt. Even if you aren't into [Attack on Titan](http://kotaku.com/japans-latest-meme-photos-of-human-eating-giants-504239134) or [BBC's Sherlock](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2014/01/sherlock-fandom/) you can still talk about Pick the Winner games or share a love of Love Letter, from there you can grow. You may never have anything in common with the greater board gaming community, but that doesn't mean you can't partake in it. There are gamers out there who will play for playing's sake. Who are able to suspend the high level nerdiness. You'll just have to find them. "

What do you want to say? Besides the fact that you find yourself pathetic (toxic, apathetic, gross, ugly). What do you want us to say?

You want us to insult you? We don't care. You want us to wonder why a sub dedicated to masculinity is not some ugly place where no respect is shown to anyone? Maybe because you are deluding yourself when you think that every group of guys is as ugly as yours.

You said in another post that you were self-aware. Insulting and demeaning yourself is not being self-aware. Being offensive is not being right. You can't claim the moral high ground - and really, by moral high ground I certainly do not talk about PC compliance - simply because you never judged yourself.

And insulting yourself freely is absolutely not the same as judging yourself."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390953658.0,"First off, if you feel like he's hiding you, then either you must have some sort of indication that he doesn't outside of speculating, or you don't really trust him anymore.

But anyway, it's very possible that it really didn't come up.  I don't always bring my girlfriend up not because I don't want people to know, but because they don't necessarily want to hear it.  If I were studying abroad, would I want to be that guy that has to mention his SO all the time?  Plus, what if they're mostly talking about what's going on where they are, the sites, the food, etc., or maybe what the typical life is like where they themselves are from (sharing what it's like to be from their country or their state, whatever).  

I mean, there are a million reasons why he might not have brought you up, especially considering these circumstances - for example, at work, not everyone knows I have an SO, because I don't feel the need to tell everyone.  We talk about other stuff, and unless she comes up naturally, I don't mention her because it doesn't need to be their business so badly that I have to fit it in somehow.  

The only reason you should be worried is if you don't trust him anymore, honestly.  I've questions SOs in the past for things along these lines, but only because I didn't really trust them.  Now, if my SO didn't feel the need to tell someone about me or it just didn't come up, I would trust that she wasn't avoiding it, and that it either didn't come up or she had a good reason not to bring it up.  Also, I read your other post, so might as well mention some of that as well:

&gt;And now since he has gone over there he has done a complete flip flop and says that he thinks men and women can be friends now. I just feel that it's a bit hypocritical that he's doing the very thing he asked me not to do when we first started dating. He also doesn't care that I hang out with men now because he ""trusts"" me. It just seems weird considering it's a big change.

Why can't you look at this as a good thing?  Why do you need to accuse him of ""flip flopping"" and being ""hypocritical""?  I don't know him, but it's very possible that he's not flip flopping *or* being hypocritical.

First off, it was a little controlling of him to ask that of you in the first place, but you agreed, so that's not really relevant at this point.  What *is* relevant is that he saw the error of his ways and decided to change his mind.  He realized ""oh shit, people of the opposite sex really *can* be just friends because this girl is like a sister to me.  What was I thinking?""  Isn't that a *good* thing?  Would you rather he never change his mind ever and that he stuck to his guns on everything ever, no matter how irrational he was being?

And plus, hypocritical?  He told you that he's totally cool if you have guy friends now because he realizes that he was being stupid.  That's awesome of him and should make you happy.  Sounds like he's becoming more mature and less insecure, assuming you trust him.  This *should* be a good thing, but again, if you have reason not to trust him, then I could see where you're coming from.


What?  Why is ""trusts"" in quotes?  Do you think it's so bizarre that he could trust you now?  Isn't this a good thing?  I feel like there's something more.  You're making him out to be the bad guy in every decision he's made, when it seems like he's making progress by becoming more mature and open-minded...these are all benefits, not drawbacks.  Don't you think it's a little wrong to think about him this way (*again* assuming he hasn't done anything to betray your trust)?

And finally, it may be a big change, but so is studying abroad.  The fact that it opened up his eyes to some things really isn't crazy.  You should be thanking him for being so awesome, not condemning him.  "

mildjeffers,sex,1390953680.0,"I experienced the difficulty orgasm (ejaculating) on Cymbalta. The way my psychiatrist put it is that the SSRI has a blunting effect on emotion. It helps to calm the stormy waters. So, your lows aren't so low.  But, on the flip side, it reduces the ability to achieve your peak emotional highs. Orgasms are peak emotional responses. 

I didn't experience the SSRI as a drastic reduction in my libido. If anything, it allowed me to crawl out of the depression that was sapping my life of interest in anything (sex, eating, enjoying a tv show). My wife and I actually tried to get pregnant for a year while I was on Cymbalta so we had regular (to say the least) sex. I rarely had arousal issues. Sex did go on a bit long though and sometimes I would get really worried about not climaxing (an important thing when trying to get pregnant)

I went off Cymbalta a year ago and my libido shot through the roof for a couple of months. It has since come back to earth. I am taking Welbutrin now which doesn't have any effect that I can tell on my libido.  It's a different mechanism. It gives a little shot of dopamine which increases energy and motivation. It's not great for really depressed people though as it can increase anxiety and give depressed people the energy they need to follow through with suicide plans.  "

beanfiddler,AdviceAnimals,1390953705.0,"I'm not exactly okay with poor people eating fast food. I'm saying they do it because it has the biggest caloric bang for your buck. And when you're poor enough that meals don't come regularly *and* you don't have much time to spare for preparing food (and that's even if you can be home during meal times), that's very important.

What I'd really like to see is an institutional way to solve how much American people, even middle class and upper class, rely on fast food. But until that happens, yes, prohibiting poor people from food options that other people have access to is a negative impact on their life.

And you're also missing that in a lot of urban and rural areas, fast food is pretty much the only food around, besides gas stations.

Drunken_Black_Belt,AskReddit,1390953789.0,"Ok so as for your first part, you're talking about a paradox of how the rainmaker can exist to send Joe back in time if his mother never died.  

The problem is that Joe's timelines always crossed. Old joe always went back to stop events, and that is what sets off the events in the first place.  It's a loop in the timeline, but it's not a singular loop. It's a double loop that meets at a singular point ( the field at the end).

Look at it like this: Bruce Willis is young, kills his future self, lives life, wife gets killed and goes back in time,  escapes JGL, kills mother, creates rainmaker.  JGL gets old,  still is sent back, and that is the Old Joe that is killed by Bruce Willis, starting these events.  We already established in the film that killing a looper at any other point besides their designated time, can cause a rift in space/time.  We saw this with his fellow looper whose past self was tortured till he gave himsf up.  If they die at any other time, the loop is broken.  That's why JGL sacrifices himself at the end, because it was the only way to destroy the loop without tearing it apart. "

canadianredditor17,Eve,1390954008.0,"&gt;Normal people DO hate capsuleers, which is a very interesting idea, to play someone who is hated and feared because they have no concept of life's value.

This article on [baselining](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Baselining) (capsuleers interacting with non-capsuleers) gives an idea of how some people are supposed to feel about them. The Gallente and Minmatar sections mention how people can be outright violent, or authorities may be more likely to ignore crimes against capsuleers.

Also, I think there's a mission where you're supposed to rescue the crew of a ship, or something, and when it's done you're told they're glad to be alive, since near death experiences are traumatic. At least for normal people. Capsuleers probably don't understand it.

It supports your point that the average non-capsuleer in the Eve universe, or maybe just people who regularly interact with them, would believe that capsuleers don't have any idea how people feel regarding life and death, since death to them can be just an inconvenience, or even a quick way to get around."

Perhaps an onboard lithium pack that will power both the electronics and some steering servos?

As for what a gearbox does, well, it's a box of gears. Typically, electric or even gas motors don't have enough torque on their own, so we run their power through a gear reduction to get usable torque. Say a gearbox has a 2.72 ratio, that would mean that for every 2.72 turns of the input shaft (the motor), you would get 1 turn of the output shaft. "

Fair enough, are they at all common or...?

&gt; Again I'm speaking over a period of years being here and having read 10s of thousands of comments. It happens. ""Stealth"" shaming is often one of those things

Ohhhh I seeeeee! People saying ""You should try and present even before taking steps""? If so, ahhh. I hope I never meet any of these stealth-shaming people - I spent years of meticulous planning and then hiding under the radar whilst I got myself silently on hormones and speech therapy, before disappearing to university far away and starting to present as female there, where I had a lead in passing with the hormones and such. I would honestly not have done it any differently, and it saved me risking almost certain danger - it still wasn't at all smooth but hey, all good to those who wait, right?

&gt;I personally disagree. And I've put up with the gamut of bad things, including even being fired for transitioning. You said so yourself just above that:

&gt;&gt;Responding with aggressive hostility will enforce an Us vs Them mentality in their mind, and get us nowhere.

&gt;That is why I disagree with us being nasty to cis people or condoning the ""occasional"" aggressive response. If one of us is in that state where we're going to be aggressive with a cis person, my advice would be to walk away, and realize they're going to do more harm than good for our causes by responding aggressively to someone's ignorance.

Oh, I didn't mean that I at all endorse or otherwise condone it, more meant that it's *understandable*. If someone breaks, it's important to understand that their mental state is likely compromised, and shouting them down or denigrating them en mass would be a terrible idea. They should be calmly called out and corrected (or just downvoted to oblivion if the context calls for such), rather than actively put down as bringing the movement down. Of course, this is all contextual."

As a new grad I had basically no chance of getting that straight out of school but recently an old friend from high school contacted me and said she worked on a coronary ICU at a hospital I really want to work at and positions had opened up. She mentioned me to her manager and the manager said definitely apply. 

So my problem now is how to handle the situation with my current employer and applying to this new job. I have been told by trusted employees who know I've been looking at this new job that I should absolutely keep quiet until I've been hired by a new place- in other words, keep it a secret. I've been told I'll be treated differently if management knows I've been looking elsewhere- even though I made it clear when hired my long term career goal was to work in the ICU. I feel guilty applying to a new job even though I should be happy about the opportunity. I'm also very anxious about the outcome if I were not offered the ICU job- am I going to screw myself over at my current job then?

It shouldn't be like this. I feel like we are taught that a big part of nursing is continuing education and bettering yourself, but then stuff like this happens? I thought it was just where I work so it's nice to be able to talk about it. I've also been told we are required to give at least a 4 week notice (which I've never heard of before and have had many jobs) so I don't know what's up with that either."

thro_way,changemyview,1390954226.0,"Effeminate guys have no worth as an absolute rule?  Of course not. They can provide worth if there are other things about them that provide more of a benefit than the feminine qualities detract.  Even the most macho group of guys, for instance, would welcome an effeminate man with open arms if that effeminate man happened to be an NFL player.  It's the *qualities* that inherently provide no value; people as a whole can provide value in spite of these traits.  In the case of an average guy who isn't a professional football player or brilliant investor or anything else that would provide tremendous value, however, effeminate behavior is usually a cost that his positive traits don't outweigh, and so his net value to a group is negative.


Unless you consider feminine gender roles to be inherent to women, I don't see why you would consider disliking them to be misogyny.  And you're correct, there are groups that hold their members to a lower standard of masculinity than others.  If those are the groups that a man wants to be a part of, then acting effeminately is certainly less of a hinderance."
MikeyDeez,socialwork,1390954236.0,"&gt;But children are constantly held to consequences without regard to their ability to understand those consequences ahead of time.

...**not by social workers**! The NASW guidelines aren't universal,  they're to guide social workers and to let anyone who's going to hire/interface with a social worker exactly what makes social workers tick. 

No social worker would say a ""less than ideal"" (Who's ideal? Who's values? Social Workers don't impose values; they act according to their ethics) life is not worth living. I might tell a child client to focus on school, not because I think they ""should"" or ""ought to""...its because I know that a child isn't *reeeaaally* choosing for themselves between a blue or white collar future if they say they don't wanna study. They're acting on impulse because biologically they are incapable of rationality; if I can empower them and help them learn and make an informed decision,  then its up to them to choose how they want to live. It'd be unfair to my client to allow my client to make a choice when they don't have the ability or capacity to choose.


I think its less than your opinion is ""unpopular""; every social workers I know would agree that you shouldn't violate a child's rights. I think the opinion that ""children are capable of making adult decisions"" or ""a child can comprehend the full scope of theor actions and should be allowed to govern themselves accordingly without guidance"" *would* be unpopular. 


Even with an adult, if you think social work is letting a client stop taking psych meds ""just because they chose"" is ethical...you're gonna get fired :P Its up to you to be sure your client is **informed** in their decision making before you do anything that respects or negates their right to self-determination. 


 A teenager choosing community college or Harvard is one thing,  but how could I stand by and watch my child client suffer the consequences of choices when they didn't understand the ramifications of that choice?  (And a child parroting ""I should study"" doesn't mean they understand the ramifications anymore than letting an a client with Alzheimer's take a reverse-mortgage out because they remember what a dollar is.) 


These are tricky fields to navigate, which is why people study and work **a lot** to become social workers. Answers are rarely as black or white as ""respecting a kids right to not do homework"""

NotAPimecone,Christianity,1390954435.0,"&gt; me and my family were kind of despised in the neighborhood but my parents told me they were delusional and stupid and that we were smarter. 

I don't believe in God (not the Christian one, nor any other god) but I don't think Christians (in general) are delusional or stupid. Perhaps your parents were hurt by being despised for not believing in something they didn't believe in, and responded bitterly? 

&gt; Nowadays, Atheism is more common, it's beginning to become a sort of movement. 

Atheism as a ""movement"" is an unfortunate consequence of living in societies where Christianity permeates so deeply into so many aspects of everyday life and even law and politics. Christians wouldn't want to be held to the laws of another religion, would they? Neither to atheists and non-Christians wish to be held to laws based on Christianity. 

The logical answer to the conundrum is to base laws on what can be shown to be beneficial to individuals and society as a whole *regardless of religious beliefs*, in order to make society work as well as it can for atheists *and* people of all different religions. The consequence is that some things that various religions define as sins end up being legal, because objectively (outside the framework of religious doctrine) many things that are sins to one religion or another can't be shown to be harmful. 

Let's take Jewish Kosher dietary law as an example. If a country's laws were based on Judaism, it would be illegal to consume pork and shellfish. But obviously there is no harm in doing so, so it should not be illegal. My ability to eat pork and shellfish does not impact a Jew's freedom to not eat it; they are free to adhere to their own laws in addition to society's, but I am free to adhere only to the laws of my country/province/municipality. It sounds silly when I apply it to a law that is based on a non-Christian religion, but to non-Christians, laws based solely on Christian principles without any secular reason behind them make just as little sense. 

&gt; Still, I've been having doubts recently about Atheism. My parents were always kind of cynical, and I don't know if that's the path I should follow. 

My situation is the opposite of yours, I was raised in a Christian family but when I started thinking critically about my beliefs, I found I never really believed, it was just sort of the default position in my family and the culture I'd been brought up in. I bear no animosity towards my parents, we see each other regularly and are on good terms. 

To me, it boils down to interpretation of what happens in one's life. A Christian sees God everywhere, and hears God's voice, feels His presence guiding them etc. People of other religions feel the same way about their gods. An atheist sees natural processes at work, hears aspects of his own mind, etc. Who is right? And should it matter in society here on earth? I don't think it's my place to tell someone they're wrong about their religion, just like I don't think it's anyone else's place to tell me I'm wrong for not believing in any of them. 

The good ones (on all sides) are the ones who can look at the world objectively as well as through the lens of their own personal belief system, recognizing that others have different beliefs.

However you choose to believe, I urge you to be sure you do actually believe, instead of believing ""by default"", and to recognize that other people's beliefs, even if they do not match yours, are still valid and should be respected. Don't be like your parents' neighbours, and despise people for believing differently, and don't become bitter and cynical like your parents. "
jon909,videos,1390954437.0,"You shouldn't be afraid but definitely be informed and know your surroundings. Usually highrise buildings hold safety Q&amp;A meetings for the tenants every so often and firemen/police may show up. You can ask the marshal questions and learn a lot about their response times and what they generally deal with on a day to day basis. Your building should also be holding fire drills at least annually preferably more than that. Know the egress routes, exits, fire extinguisher locations, area of rescue vestibules/rescue phones, etc. You should know these routes by heart and be able to navigate them in the dark. Keep a flashlight in your desk. Useful in a variety of emergencies. Also, if an alarm goes off? Always believe it's real. Even in real emergencies a lot of people just sit at their desks not realizing they should've evacuated until it's too late.Number one thing is to not panic. This is what freezes people up and stops them from making rational decisions. I generally never panic and it has served me well. However one day at our highrise condo my two year old got her hand sucked in with the elevator door into the opening. I completely panicked and started doing really dumb stuff. I bent the freight elevator door back. Then I started banging on every door on the floor screaming for help. All the while my daughter's screams incited more and more panic in me.If I had just calmed down and thought rationally I'd of realized all I had to do was close the elevator door which would spit her hand out. Her mother realized this and that's exactly what she did and she was fine. But my panic clouding my judgment still bothers me to that day. I've never been that out of control before. Don't panic!"

wagerhope,ThriftStoreHauls,1390954527.0,"So there's a State Surplus store not far from my house, where all of the state agencies send their retired gear- desks, chairs, filing cabinets, printers, keyboards, etc. Anything that'd be in an office, will eventually make its way here. I went in to look for a new office chair since we've been using a folding chair at our desk.

This thing caught my eye. It looked nicer than the rest of them, but the cylinder didn't work. It wouldn't move up and down, which was a bit of a bummer. But for 50% off of $10, I figured it was worth a gamble to try to fix it myself.

I buy the thing, get it home, and start doing some research on the brand. Turns out it's an [$889 chair](http://store.steelcase.com/products/leap-chair-fabric/) with a lifetime warranty! I contact the company, who put me in touch with a tech at the warehouse. The warehouse happens to be about 7 minutes from where I live, so I run over and he replaces the cylinder. Good as new.

So I got an $889 office chair for $5, and it's practically new. It has all sorts of adjustments, and the armrests slide out of the way so you can see what the levers and knobs below you do without leaning over. It's an insanely comfortable chair, and easily my best haul on a cost to value ratio.

2) I don't see any reason to adding a wythe of brick to an already brick building, unless the veneer was falling down, but in that case I would take it down and rebuild it. Old brick is highly in demand now, and many people like the old brick look with weathered corners and smooth faces. A simple cleaning and possibly replacing some mortar joints would do nicely.

I had to watch how I said things on this sub and now that he's finally gone from the long term plans of the team...I don't have a lot of patience to listen to people talking about he is some missed talent. So maybe I came off I little strong but I'm fine with that. I can take some downvotes now and then. 


The annoying part is being either downvoted to zero or ignored for expressing valid takes about Ponder, Cassel and our teams regression and then watching it all happen and the same people still want to solely blame the coaching.

Trigger23,penguins,1390954715.0,"Now who's replacing facts with opinion? I didn't use the term below average at all in the comment you replied to. I simply observed that over the course of his career when he is replaced by another defenseman in the lineup, the team allows fewer goals. That's not up for debate, it's simply how the numbers come out. He's had several seasons to work out his defensive issues with no significant improvement having taken place in the past 2 seasons and with his defensive liabilities having been particularly costly in the playoffs last spring. 

Bringing Mile Green up is irrelevant. He's a shit defenseman on a crap team. No matter how you slice it, we have sufficient depth to pull Letang from the lineup and not only will we not miss a step defensively, we actually prevent more goals when he is in street clothes. 

The only argument you can make in favor of keeping Letang on D is that his offensive contributions outweigh his liabilities (which is true) and that putting him at forward would diminish his offensive impact by a margin which exceeds the net gain created by the team allowing fewer goals when he's out (which is debatable and completely subjective because we don't have data to bear out whether or not that's the case. 

As it stands right now his GF/GA differential stands at +0.32 per game. If he moves to forward and we dress someone else at D, it ends up being +0.5 per game, assuming he still generates offense at the same pace. His contributions to the team's offense would have to drop to almost half of their current level to make his net impact any worse than it is right now, and it's arguable that he would produce MORE offense if he were playing up front.

Full disclosure: I'm really short and always have been.  By the time I got to HS, I basically wasn't allowed to play, even though I was a much better player than some of the kids on the team (got a shot at them in other venues).  I tried out for my college club team.  They basically wouldn't let me on the field.  I got on the field for a few minutes, scored a goal, and was taken off, never to get on again.  I was never judged on my skill or ability.  People would take one look at me, decide I obviously couldn't be good, and never got a chance.  Watching the US Soccer team and MLS develop has made it abundantly clear that the US prefers TOOLS and YOU CAN'T TEACH HEIGHT to actual soccer skills.  Until the US judges the skills instead of the tools, there will be a bias to the detriment of American soccer."

I mean, we don't begrudge middle and upper class people all their faults and poor spending habits. But a lot of people think it's perfectly okay to demand poor people keep incredibly detailed checkbooks, audited daily by someone that ""knows better"" than them. You can't have any vices when you're poor, or someone's going to judge you extremely harshly for them. And even if you don't have vices, and you're the absolute perfect victim of circumstance, you still have to jump through a billion hoops to prove you aren't like those people that are ""bad poor people"" to get a really piss-poor handout that maybe is going to see you through to next month. *Maybe*.

People are going to be people. Assholes come in all shapes and income levels. But fuck me because I think that it's inhumane to let people and their kids starve while I audit their every fucking decision like I'm goddamn Jesus himself.

I guess that's another thing that chaffs my hide: so the people who judge others like this would get super uppity about someone trampling their ""freedoms"" and taking their ""tax dollars,"" but they think it's perfectly okay to micromanage every decision a poor person makes, even though research shows such restrictions are incredibly expensive and do nothing to prevent welfare abuse.

I think this should depend on what their agreement was prior to the pregnancy, if they both used birth control or just one did and it failed, was it never discussed and wasn't used? If the latter then to me that would be implied consent to a pregnancy on for both parties.  If one said they were on birth control or had a vasectomy and it turned out to be untrue then these are different circumstances and should be left up to a court to decide.  As it is now our laws and standards are not up to par with science and technology.  Everyone (heterosexuals) that has sex should have a discussion beforehand concerning BC and pregnancy and how it should be handled.

&gt; Furthermore, just because there are more times when beauty might come into play, it doesn't mean that the times when strength matters are less important.

Yes, that's exactly what it means.  Beauty comes into play so much more than strength for girls, so it's more advantageous for them to be beautiful than it is for them to be strong.

I was looking for 40mm and less than 11mm thick, minimum of 100m WR, sapphire, highly legable, and preferably manual wind. I'm not sure I could have hit the nail more squarely on the head than I did with the Hamilton Khaki Field H695150. The only thing I could wish for is a screw down crown, but I will manage without. This model has been out of production for a couple of years now and I never even knew it existed until I saw one pop up on WatchRecon. I had always loved the current Khaki Field manual wind, but the 38mm size was just too small for me. When I saw this one listed I jumped on it immediately. 

The watch is great! Fits perfectly, winds smoothly, and looks to be in great shape for being at least a couple of years old. I put it on a Di-Modell Rallye and I love the combo. The strap matches the watch with 100m WR and the gray stitching also matches the bead blasted case perfectly. Plus it's perforated for those humid Iowa summers. It would have been flawless if the Hamilton buckle would have fit (since it's a double-tang also), but I didn't get quite that lucky.

Eventually it will probably be in rotation with a Stowa Flieger 2801, but I can only hold my breath until one of those comes up for sale, so I am perfectly content with my Hammy for now. "

Every time I see a discussion featuring a Star Destroyer EU fans can't stop talking about how powerful Star Destroyers are. Like, 1 can glass multiple planets and make them inhabitable forever and ever and has impenetrable shields that the energy weapons of other universes could never touch.

Frankly, the EVE titans are way bigger than Star Destroyers, but everything in the Star Wars EU is turned up way past 11 in terms of power for a given size, so if we are going with EU lore here, then the Empire will stomp.

for example, [this site](http://www.stardestroyer.net/tlc/Power/) lists the power of a medium turbolaser is 3750 TW (terawatts), listed as 4 times the power of the hiroshima bomb concentrated over a tiny area. There's like a hundred of these on each SD and they can fire every 2 seconds. So not only do they have this power output, but even a lowly corvette can take quite a few shots before being stopped and boarded, meaning their ships are also ridiculously durable.

I personally think it's all absurd, but that doesn't mean it's not there, and if we are to go using EU definitions(which again, I believe are more powerful than the stats listed above) then there's no way EVE can win unless they can pull equally ridiculous numbers out of their ass."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390955327.0,"&gt; I'll assume that we are a social species that will generally act positively towards each other. So we will favour sharing over stealing, helping over not doing so, etc. I believe the evolutionary reasons for this have to do with reputation and group cohesion. So, let me ask you. Do you think humans average out to kindness, reciprocity, charitableness and helping each other, or do you more fall in the humans are greedy, cut-throat, will do anything to screw each another in the non-fun way, category?

A bit of both. I definitely think there is a greedy, cut throat side, and there needed to be for evolutionary reasons as well. Otherwise, we would've never needed states, never had wars, etc. 

Humans, from my perspective, are self interested. This self interest can apply to a group, but it can also apply to individuals screwing over other individuals. I think that we also establish in groups we behave one way to, but out groups we may behave another way to. We might share with some, and plunder others. 

&gt;Whatever your position on this, let me ask you another question you may find annoying. Given your prior answer, what do you think this view means towards the notion of having or not having a government (since this subreddit is kinda bent on having none, I figured this would be a fun question to ask you :)?

I think that because despite the fact that we CAN act in positive ways toward others, we often don't, and therefore we need some forms of coercion as far as behavior goes. Otherwise, society would not function.

&gt;Thirdly, if you'll allow me, is it in your view possible to derive a universally logically consistent theory just from making observations from reality alone? Or would you more take a less absolutist position and say that 2 + 2 is tentatively 4, until we find evidence to the contrary?

Reality is too complex to be able to determine one single narrative for reality. I would go so far that even the fact that we accept reality is not one big illusion is something based on assumptions, rather than facts. 

I just believe we should allow facts gathered about this reality to guide our policy decisions, rather than trying to force reality to conform to an ideology."

Omega037,changemyview,1390955584.0,"1. Unlike trade schools, going to college isn't only about getting a job, it is about getting an education.  Many of the areas of study at a university obviously have little practical applications and they aren't meant to have one.  

2.  Many of the potential areas of study are ones that they would likely *only* be exposed to in a college setting.  How many people truly head to college already having been heavily exposed to areas like linguistics, actuarial science, or anthropology?  Now there could be an argument that someone should first attend a college as a non-matriculated student and explore a range of courses, but they still would need to go to college for this.

3. The average college student debt in the US is $29,400.  Certainly not great, but also not that insane considering the lifetime increase in pay is usually an order of magnitude higher.

4. While many jobs don't require a specific degree, graduating from college is one of the biggest factors employers can use for hiring people.  Even at the higher levels this is true, as my company only interviews and hires people with PhDs for my team as a way to weed out candidates.  In other words, a person with a Master's Degree *might* be able to do the job, but a person with a PhD is far more likely to be successful.

5. Programming is actually more like a skill from a trade school such as being an electrician, musician, or welding.  Thus, applying your experience from that area is a bit like comparing apples and oranges."

PatHeist,litecoinmining,1390955707.0,"Mechanical failiure happens on what we call a bathtub curve. This is slightly different from transistor wear innefectiveness, which decreases the performance of a functiononing GPU over time in the same way that an LED will dim over time. LEDs are generally produced to a standard of quality where they will dim to 70% of their initial brightness over 50,000 hours. Fans, meanwhile, are generally rated to, at the very least, function without relubrication, at 90% maximum possible load (well above designed maximum load) at 60c (typical industrial use temperature) in a moderate resistance enviroment (poor airflow). That would mean that running it for 50,000 hours in a very hot room, turning it on and off at times, letting the mechanical components cool, letting the lubrication flow when the fan is off, etc. would put it on the dotted line on the right in [this graph.](http://i.imgur.com/J0in3i7.png) Running it constantly would push back the line a fair bit. 50,000 hours is 5.7 years, by the way."

Actually, that is a myth. 

By household income, Asian Americans make more than whites. That much is true. But this is because Asian are usually sardined into one household, like non-white Hispanic Americans.

By personal income, Asian Americans are around the same. Slightly less in many cases actually (when we stratify by education level, industry, age, etc).

Well, as I already stated in my opening post, I don't take things to the extreme, and therefore believe the government has a right to collect taxes and property from people as it sees fit provided that the funds collected are used to advance some sort of public good. This can be defense, infrastructure, and in some cases, even wealth redistribution. 

After all, at least as far as western government is concerned, I believe that the government is ultimately responsible to the people, and if we don't like who is in charge of policy, we can vote them out of office and vote for people who we like more. The system isn't perfect, but eh, I think it's fine. 

Moreover, considering how I would say we wouldn't have the concept of property without some form of social recognition backed up by force if force is needed, I still think the net result is positive for society."

The error was realized immediately. The ""glue"" that is injected is essentially superglue, so there is no ""suck that back out right now!"" moment. It is also radioopaque like the dye, but would not flush through in the way expected.

WeaklyDominant,TrueReddit,1390956026.0,"I think the argument is that the reason they seek out glory and greatness through this means is because we as consumers are willing to accept that violence. The NFL isn't inherently high-paying; it is high-paying because we demand a certain product, and that's where the complicity comes in.

I agree with you that there are some holes in the argument. But I don't think the entire problem can be written off by saying players are rational and fully accept the harms, especially when the NFL has been covering up for *years* the extent of brain damage that NFL-play can cause. Lots of players didn't know, lots of players *still* don't know, and I think it's pretty clear that at least some of the players don't have the same analytical ability as you or me to sit down and investigate these results.

Are we the only complicit party? Absolutely not. Should this mean the NFL halts action? Probably not. But it *is* interesting to consider our role as consumers in all of this."

TryUsingScience,modnews,1390956042.0,"&gt; If you're not comfortable being easily associated with a particular subreddit, you should not keep a moderator position in it.

I think some people are more worried about the impact on the subreddits rather than on themselves. If you mod big popular sub A and small niche subs B, C and D, no one wants to have to deal with immature pissed off users from sub A deciding to mess with B, C and D over some moderation decision in A.

Before, it would first have to occur to them that you might mod other subs, and then they would have to go through your post history to find the subreddits and check if you're on the mod list. Now it might as well be a glowing neon sign saying ""screw with these places to screw with this user.""

&gt; 
&gt; But, not all websites are created by Google employees. The rest of us will keep using Javascript since it hasn't outgrown its usefulness. Javascript isn't going anywhere.

See, step one of Dart will be, a few people will start to use it here and there. The problem at this point is that dart will, *at first,* be fastest in Chrome. So every user who uses something written in Dart will just grow one twinge of attachment to chrome. This effect snowballs. If something is faster in chrome, and things in chrome are fastest when they're in dart, and Google keeps throwing money at it, they'll at least kill JS's killer feature: being the only damn client-side scripting language. This will give Google the foothold it needs to slowly (and that's one of two problems: slowly) kill Javascript.

The other problem, of course, is that the thing they're replacing Javascript with is not driven by a nonprofit aiming to be impartial and make the web as good as it can be, but by Google, which is aiming to make Google as much money as possible."

I chose B and popped off yelling in pain. Five seconds later I was surrounded by friends pulling thorns out of my arms and legs. One genius ran to the campus bookstore and bought elmers glue (an Arizona trick, let the glue dry and peel it off, it takes the thorns with it). I ended up pulling a 3-inch thorn from the soft spot between my thumb and pointer finger in absolute horror. Eventually I got about 90% of them out and was able to get home.

TL;DR: Cactus. Ow.

what_a_cat_astrophe,MakeupAddiction,1390956239.0,"If there's anything I learned about girls at school who pull crap like this, it's that most of them either find out that life outside of schoolgirl gossip doesn't take kindly to their attitudes and they clean up their act with age, or they don't and a lot of times end up living a pretty bummer lifestyle.  In fact, I really, really pity people who think it's cool to be mean.

If you had any idea how many people made fun of me for my photography because it was ""geeky"" and ""hipster"".  But I kept it up.  And a lot of the people who bullied me coincidentally didn't get very far in life.  The one who undermined me for wanting to get into art (she was going to go to Harvard) is working at a freaking bread store right now.

This goes without saying, but don't be embarrassed to do something you're passionate about just because a few people you don't value have opposing opinions.  If you enjoy doing your makeup, fuck what those girls say.  Soon, they'll be irrelevant and you'll wish you never let them get to you in the first place."

arinot,TheRedPill,1390956244.0,"&gt;If you ever want to have a relationship, to make a connection with someone, TRP's advice is toxic

Ehhhh... They're not exactly wrong. Often times when a person here expresses interest in things other than plate spinning (eg: LTRs and what not), there's always a number of people stating that it's stupid to be doing so, (let alone with some mention marriage)

Then again, if you think some people's perspective with this information represents the perspectives of all of us, then he didn't really get it. You know, considering that the Red Pill is only information and it's up to the swallower to determine what to do with it...

Then again, this TOO is an opinion.

&gt; It is not healthy to be the man who torments her, but nor is it healthy to be the shoulder to cry on in the hopes that she'll pick you.

While such tormenting does appear to work in some cases (eg: number of abused women who stick with their abuser), I don't really think the things here are abuse. At worst, I guess the popular opinion is to keep women at arms length due to 'untrustworthiness' that come from hypergamy (which is often repeatedly stated to not be bad)."

Our idea was to play on the player's expectations about games. The only way to end the game is to avoid the only point of reference and possible goal in the game. As you move away from it, the screen darkens, the music gets more tense and the camera physically tries to push you back towards the goal.

I am a believer in democracy, I believe that the government should ultimately be for the people, by the people, and I believe that if government is allowed by the majority of citizens, then it is legitimate. If you have a problem with it, it's up to you to change our minds, in order to give more legitimacy to your worldview, or to leave.

We live in a reality that is shared among many different kinds of people with different ideas of how things should work. You need to compromise a little. No one is ever gonna live in a society that is exactly what THEY want. This is because there are other people in society who have different needs and tastes than yours. And with all due respect, anarcho-capitalism is NOT a popular movement, and therefore, if we were to disintegrate the United States right this second, you would actually be imposing your views on the rest of us. Quite frankly, if you want anarcho capitalism to become a reality, it's up to you to change minds."

Drills (weekend duty) and AT (2 week annual training) doesn't count, although reservists can still qualify for the Reserve GI Bill. Not sure if that helps someone who already has a bachelor's, though (reservist LCpl halfway to my bachelor's, here).

I don't know the answers to your other questions, really.  I haven't had an actual officer as a platoon commander in over a year (we have a Captain and a 1st LT as CO and XO, but no PL's.) I do know that any billet higher than Squad Leader takes a decent amount of time outside drill.

As far as recommendations for promotion, most of it isn't really within the scope of a junior officer's work.  Promotions up to E-3 happen based on time in grade, and promotions to E-4 and E-5 happen based on attaining a cutting score. I don't know a ton about how it happens higher than that, but I think it happens at the BN level (maybe). That's assuming there's no meritorious promotions, which are given to the most qualified Marine on paper (I haven't heard of a Marine going on a board for a meritorious promotion in the reserves, but I could be wrong. Not sure about other units, since nobody in my unit really even gets meritorious promotions because nobody can get MCMAP training).

The real moral problems with it are issues of coercion, which are best solved by shedding light on the activity rather than forcing it underground.

On a personal level, though, I find prostitution disgusting, and would never participate, in spite of being a sex-positive person. To me it's very disrespectful, not to the providers but to the customers. It's saying to them: ""Your sexuality is worth so little that you literally have to pay someone to take it from you.""

screenmagnet,sex,1390956819.0,"No, what I said is true for ALL combined oral contraceptive pills where the regimen includes a placebo week. Doesn't matter if they are low or high dose, monophasic or triphasic. The reason for this is the presence of the placebo week. The most dangerous time to miss pills is either before or after the placebo week, because the hormone level can drop low enough to trigger ovulation. On the other hand, you can miss several pills during your second week and be safe, because you have already had 7+ days of active pills at that point and ovulation is well suppressed. You would need to miss at least 5 pills in a row that week to get close to ovulating. This is why you technically do not need to use a back up method for missed pills during the second week of the pack. Despite what the instructions say. And this is why if you miss pills during the third week, you need to either skip your placebo week (starting your new pack one week early), or you need to use a back up methods for TWO weeks.

Lose the accent or adopt one that might suit what you want to narrate (think about capitals, use capital city accent, Washington, London, etc). Finally, and this one is the hardest: read. not like, reddit and stuff, read good books, related to what you want to narrate. Read out loud and practice so you don't make mistakes while doing it.

2) Yes, but, as you know, most land in the world has been claimed, so it's not like anyone can just start a new country, since that would require taking land from an already existent country, or moving to antarctica. So at this point, you kinda gotta choose among countries that already exist, and that's if they even accept you into them, which many won't because they're very picky. So at this point, you gotta deal with whatever laws are in the country you live in, or move if possible. If you're dissatisfied with your laws, and can't move, then it's up to you to raise awareness of what you deem to be the problem, and convince others to think similarly so that you may enact social change.

3) Be my guest, it's probably your only viable option at this point.

thro_way,changemyview,1390957076.0,"&gt;Physical capabilities don't matter for women?

Of course not, this is 2014.  Physical strength is only useful to guys as a means to command a more dominating presence in bars, and as a means of attracting women.  Neither of these apply to women.

If your goal is to attract a conventionally attractive partner, valuing physical strength over beauty as a woman is a terrible decision.  If you have no desire for an attractive male partner and really value your career as a lumberjack or something, sure it would be more rational to prioritize physical strength, but realize that that doesn't apply to most women.

&gt;No, but the endorsing and willing replication of those values in a totally unquestioning way is.

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390957077.0,"I think there is one other point beyond cost of school, specificity of program and competitiveness for grad schools etc.

We are talking about 17 year olds applying to schools and making that decision before they are even legally adults, in many cases.  Or at least when they are just 18.

This is a very big decision.

We don't trust 18 year old to be able to drink responsibly, but we expect them to be able to weigh costs and benefits of schools. The kids applying have little world experience. *(in most cases, some students have exceptional world experience, but they are NOT the norm)*  They don't know what these different degrees actually mean. They only know what they are told by their parents, high schools, the universities themselves, etc.

It is very possible for a otherwise smart, but trusting person, to believe all these adults telling them they need *this* particular degree. That the debt is worth it. That they'll get ""assistance."" 

This is a lot to expect a 17 or 18 year old to truly understand.

This is especially a lot to ask a 17 or 18 year old to decide.

They don't have time to wait. They are told that applying later makes it more difficult to get admitted, they have to ACT NOW.

It doesn't have to be a stupid kid that ""decides"" to go to a more expensive state school, or an ivy league school when they don't get a scholarship, or to an out-of-state state school.

Just a kid that trusts the adults around them.

Or they might know that something doesn't feel right, but not be practiced and sure of themselves enough to stand up to their parents in such a big way.  They have no experience in that.

That doesn't make it a good decision. But I can't say I think they ""deserve the debt"" for being naive, or not yet confident enough to stand up to adults.

They're kids."

killerkonnat,dogecoin,1390957220.0,"Oh I thought you were talking about the mining power. Which made me thought you were comparing the Titan with a less powerful ATI card.

The 290X is a newer generation gpu than the Titan. It was released 8 months after the Titan to be a direct competitor to that, it used newer technology which makes it cheaper to manufacture, and Nvidia still hasn't lowered the price of their Titans a single cent which makes the 290X relatively cheaper. A normal card would've lowered in price at least some in (almost) a year.

Basically the 290X was specifically designed to be a Titan-killer using newer technology and ATI succeeded in exactly what they were trying to achieve.

But if you look at ""regular"" high-end gpu:s, (Except the 690 vs 5970, which was designed for the explicit purpose of beating the 690... Ati really seems to go all out tackling the MOST powerful supercard from the competitor) the Nvidia cards consistently have a bit more performance on games and applications. (Excluding new releases with ATI-optimized drivers on release date. The AAA games that get sponsored by one of the companies gives that company an edge in performance on release because they get access to the game before release and can start preparing optimized drivers weeks before release, making the competitor catch up for a few weeks after release.) 
Having just slightly less performance doesn't mean ATI cards are bad, it just means that... well... they get slightly less fps."

Right, so it's impossible for you to force sexual desire - so don't do that. It will look faked and be super obvious. What you do is focus on and even emphasize your personal satisfaction as you understand it. Do it often, do it vocally, and most important, *do it while you're engaging in sexual activity with her*. 

Compare these two situations:

Guy is low libido. He tells Girl that he likes getting her off and he's happy to help her, but he never initiates. She always has to make herself vulnerable by asking for sexual release and risking rejection. He agrees and helps her, but during the act he's generally quiet, his body language is open but not enthusiastic, and afterward he's happy to clean up and move on with his life until the next time. It's a job well done because he got her off, just like the dishes.

Guy is low libido. He tells Girl he *loves* getting her off. She initiates most of the time, but once in awhile he walks up to her, looks her in the eye, and tells her sincerely that right now he wants nothing more than to watch her come until she can't walk. During the act, he reassures her how beautiful she is, how much he enjoys watching her be sexy and how much he likes participating in her pleasure. He touches her more than he needs to (caressing, not just getting her off as efficiently as possible). Afterward he cuddles her - it's a job well done, because it built intimacy and helped strengthen the bond between the two of them as well as getting her off.

See the difference? Both are honest to your own lack of sexual desire, but one makes her feel like she's desired and loved while the other makes her feel like a ""job""."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390957510.0,"I think that crony capitalism is a problem, and I think it's becoming an increasingly problematic flaw with our political system. Our constitution was created with a lot of foresight and skepticism of power. I think that the idea of controlling factions by compartmentalizing them has been an extremely beneficial way of approaching things, and while not always perfect, has produced good results.

However, seeing how our constitution is over 200 years old, in some ways it does not reflect the modern times. I don't think the founding fathers anticipated elites using their free speech rights to buy out politicians and drown out everyone else. This is a problem that I feel needs to be fixed. However, I feel like we would disagree on how to fix it. I think that if we threw out the government, something worse would come along and replace it, something not bound by our constitution and the rights and separation of powers within. So my solution would be reform via constitutional amendments and the like."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390958003.0,"&gt; Like individual communities, organizations, and companies

Or the large corporations. Wal-Mart owns more wealth than entire countries, for example. What's to stop them from arming themselves?

What's to stop another country from coming in and taking over? 

How would individual communities respect rights? I feel like state and local governments have a problematic history as far as their abilities to respect rights. Slavery was a ""state's rights"" issue, for example. As was desegregation. In a lot of history, if you ask me, the federal government often comes off as the good guy. 

What's to stop these small groups from going to war with one another? What's to stop them from being coercive?

The idea you present sounds nice on the surface, but I just think there are too many things that can go wrong with it if implemented.

&gt;We have never seen free market capitalism. You may have a good idea of what it looks like with regard to say the internet but everything that you see as 'capitalism' has huge distortions as a result of the coercive monopoly power of government.

I'd also say we can't have capitalism without that coercive monopoly of power. We wouldn't have a safe environment in which to practice capitalism. We'd need force somewhere, and if I were to guess, the elites would be the most likely to acquire a significant amount of force since they have the most wealth and are likely the most adept at maintaining order, and then they would become a coercive monopoly. Either that or you'd have a bunch of poor people torching your factories, followed by other chaos, or a marxist style dictatorship.

Even if I accept that at face value (I don't), you have to acknowledge the key difference: the *location* of the turnovers would change, and that absolutely means a reduction in their negative impact on goals against per game. How often does Malkin commit a critical D-zone turnover? Not often. He tends to rack up takeaways in the defensive zone these days. Most of his turnovers happen in the attacking zone. It is irrefutably preferable to turn the puck over 150 feet from your own goal as opposed to doing so 30 feet from your goal, because it's far less likely that the former results in a goal against. So if we assume Letang turns the puck over at the same rate, we can also assume those turnovers won't cost the team anywhere near as much in terms of surrendering goals. 

&gt;How many D can put up those numbers? Probably less than 10. At forward what kind of numbers does he put up? You said 30G, so let's use that. That would make him close to a 75-80PTS player. How many players put up those numbers? Probably 25-30 players. So at defense he already is one of the best in the league at a more valuable position

Again, you ignore *why* offense is valuable coming from the defense. The crux of an offensive defenseman's value is not only how much scoring they produce, but also how well they play without the puck. Letang is top-3 in the offensive category, but isn't remotely that highly-ranked on the defensive side of the puck. He's defensively pedestrian at best when his shortcomings result in a significant rise in goals allowed when compared with that same d corps without him. 

Just because a defenseman provides offense doesn't automatically make them some wonderfully rare unicorn (see your example of Mike Green as proof of that, since he produces more offense than most defensemen in the league). The value in an offensive defenseman is similar to that of an excellent two-way forward like Datsyuk, Toews, or Bergeron, and both are equally rare.  Until you decide to apportion more value to the **Defense** portion of a defenseman's value, you'll always have a skewed perception of their value (in my opinion). 

Anyway, I really am done with this conversation. I've laid out ample data to support my opinion and at this point there's nothing to be gained by continuing. Have a good night, and if you really feel like you simply MUST get the last word in, be my guest by all means. "

that's the first step. if you can't get that done, you can't even install osx on anything. (the vmware methods work, i just did it on my pc, but every video has a slightly different method.)

We met after she had moved from a different state and I found that she had been promising him that she couldn't wait to move back (with *our fucking dog* too, which really pissed me off) and live with him again.  How I was this and that and the other thing - you know, all the things that women say about their ""jerk"" boyfriends to their orbiters, all totally untrue or greatly exaggerated of course.  Pretty much the same things she was telling me about *him*.  I would never have known she was doing this until she packed up and left.  

Don't you know that women are like monkeys?  They never let go of one branch until they have a firm hold on the next.

Just about every woman I've been with has kept back ups, whether in the form of a beta orbiter (""He's my *friend*! Why can't I have any *friends* you are soooo controlling OMG!""), or with an emotional or physical affair.  All these women were absolutely terrified of being alone for one fucking second of their existence.  One of them would create a fight with me and then go fuck another man while we were ""broken up"", then come back apologizing a few days later.  She was convinced she did nothing wrong.  ""But we weren't together!""  Whether or not we were officially together for a few days, the fact that she knew it would hurt me regardless was of no concern I guess.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390958120.0,"&gt;Whenever I hang out with guy friends I have a lot of temptation. He says that it's not the same for him because over there he has no intentions since he's never going to see these people again once he comes back.

To me, these are both problematic and need to be worked on.  It's one thing to fantasize, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but there shouldn't really be any temptation.  It shouldn't matter if you're going to see that person frequently or never again, you shouldn't be tempted to be/sleep with them - you're in a relationship!

&gt; I also think it bothers me because it makes my relationship seem more casual.

How?  Is it because of this?...

&gt; I don't really get why he needs to hang out with other women if he's dating someone.

Because that's crazy talk.  Are you trying to say that if you're a guy, the only thing girls are good for are relationships and sex, and that's it?  Some of my absolute best friends are women, and I couldn't ever be with someone that couldn't understand that.  I'm not friends with them because they have breasts and a vagina, I'm friends with them because they're awesome people and I like surrounding myself with awesome people.  I really think you need to get that through your head - you should be able to be friends with either gender.  If you can't handle that, then something is wrong.

Plus think about it - you came here because you wanted a male opinion, correct?  Wouldn't it be cool to be able to do that off the internet as well?  

&gt;back in Nov he hung out with a female suitemate and didn't tell me about it, though when I asked he did say that he went. I just don't like all of this secretive stuff.

This is what I'm talking about.  First off, he doesn't have to tell you ever single thing that he does.  He obviously didn't think hanging out with her was a big deal, and neither should you.  I don't tell my girlfriend what I have for lunch every day, but that doesn't mean I love her any less.  And on top of that, you asked him about it and he answered you, presumably no questions asked.  He's not hiding shit.  He just doesn't seem like the type of person that feels the need to word vomit everything about his life to everyone.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that."

They like to deny the fact that STEM majors are getting jobs, making money and doing shit that the world really needs, while they make art that looks like everything else. When in general, art is not something that the average working on middle class people living pay check to pay check really cares about. The art world is filled with great artists, and it's also filled with dickhead artsy-fartsy losers who thought they were going to make money by making sculptures of vaginas or some shit. So they try to paint people in STEM and other majors that result in jobs as robotic devils or some shit.

Will_Im_Not,Seattle,1390958308.0,"If we were looking purely for economic growth then we should cut all business taxes, abolish all environmental regulations, and lower the salary of all public workers to the minimum wage (around $19,000 a year). But the role of the city government is more than just economic, it's to look out for its citizens.

We're talking about a group of 800 people who work for this city. Seattle is one of the more expensive places to live in this country. It's no NYC or San Francisco, but Seattle is [16% more expensive than the average urban area](http://blogs.seattletimes.com/fyi-guy/2012/11/12/is-seattle-one-of-the-most-expensive-cities-in-the-u-s/) and our rents are 61% higher than the national average. 

The minimum wage has not kept up with inflation. Even though Washington has the highest state minimum wage in the country it's still not enough for many hard-working families to live on. Increasing the city's minimum wage is a drop in the bucket compared to the overall budget and will provide hundreds of working people with decent salaries. So yes, we're technically ""taking money from one group and giving it to another"". But considering how large the income gap is I don't think it's that ridiculous to pay minimum wage workers a bit more."

A word or two of advice: Don't let her consume you. Don't drive by her house, don't wonder what she's doing. Spend time focusing on staying busy. Find a new hobby, go out with friends, meet new people, do anything to keep her out of your mind (that's the really hard part). Eventually, she will become an occasional thought and you're on your way.

In modern international units, he was just shy of 5 feet 7 inches.   Now I know you are saying “well that is still pretty short”.  That is true by modern day standards in certain places in the world, such as the United States.

Exactly! Let's double the minimum wage! I'm sure that will have absolutely no effect on everyone elses wages. Or on prices. 

Seriously, this is the dumbest line of reasoning i've ever heard. ""We deserve $15!"" Okay genius, then what about people who currently make $15? Are you going to double their wages too?

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390958646.0,"1) Yes, I notice corporations often try to use government to advance their own interests, and I believe this is a problem. However, I also don't believe the solution to this is to not regulate at all. Some regulations are put in place, IMO, legitimately, for the good of all. I don't believe ALL regulations advance corporate interests, heck, I think some run counter to them. For example, in grad school I spent a semester working on an ordinance for my local city government to prevent construction on steep slopes/mountains. This was done to stop private interests to run counter to the public good. So I believe society is a bit multifaceted as far as regulations go. Sometimes when they make problems worse they're sloppily made, but sometimes they do advance corporate interests. I say we keep the ones there for a valid reason for the good of the community, and get rid of ones that favor corporate interests. 

2) I'm actually a moderate on gun control. I'm for stuff like background checks to screen out people who have mental problems, but the ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, no. 

While gun control seems to work in some other countries, they do not face the problems that the US faces, ie, thousands of miles of open border, smuggling routes, etc. The war on drugs is a failure, and a war on guns would just lead to similar results. People who want them would get them anyway, and law abiders would end up punished. 

I do believe in SOME level of gun control tho, I don't think everyone should have access ro RPGs or something like that, but things that fire bullets? I think those should mostly be legal. 

I'd say I'm for roughly the status quo, but with more background checks, that's all."

Furthermore, the existence of the ISS, something that would very much have been in doubt without regular shuttle missions (especially considering the shuttle's ability to transport and return large amounts of people and cargo), has provided the need/goal for recent private enterprises to get involved.

In other words, had the shuttle program not ended when it did, it is very unlikely that companies like SpaceX would have developed as they recently have.  In many ways, these companies represent the future of space exploration and travel, and simply would not (and could not) have formed in 1986 to fill the gap left by the shuttle.  Nor would they have had a reason to do so."

Sweep the EQ for problem frequencies, take them out. Do this by doing a really big Q (100) for a needle-point in your EQ and sweep around listening for a hollow sound, then duck it like 3-4db usually. He would use several compressors - usually compress going in, use 1-2 more on the track (getting this right without it sounding crushed is really tough.) Then he would usually use a convolution reverb to imitate a hall and mix to taste.


Honestly mostly what I got out of learning from him was the biggest thing you can do to make your vocal tracks sound great is get a great performance. "

But OK. Orthopedists are the biggest group of opinionated surgeons out there. One does it this way, another does it that way, and they all disagree and badmouth one another. The fact is that the first surgeons you saw agreed that non-op treatment was best. Now things have changed, and your fracture isn't healing. Clearly, someone thought it would, but it hasn't. That happens, unfortunately. 

There isn't always one solution to an orthopedic issue, and it's not as if there's one solution to all problems that they all agree on. I certainly wouldn't go with the surgeon who's butthurt that you didn't choose him to do surgery a while back.

Art is much more about the popularity of the artist. So if the artist wants to sell a painting for $1,000, it's only worth that if someone is willing to pay it. Once you bring in a government subsidy (which I assume these programs are), it gets much more complicated.

Zooky_the_Bear,martialarts,1390959035.0,"Competency in martial arts is the ability to effectively use what you learn in a fight or combat scenario, since martial relates to warfare.

That said, I believe someone is competent when they have the skill to defeat the majority of untrained people, and when they start giving skilled martial artists some trouble.

With BJJ, general competency is usually achieved at blue belt.  The average blue belt should be able to subdue just about any untrained person, but they won't do as well against higher levels in BJJ.  This usually takes between 1 and 2 years of regular training (3-5 times a week).

In Krav Maga, you generally start seeing results about a year in with good and dedicated training.  The main problem I found with Krav is that many  of its practitioners aren't tested in live training as often as they should be, which leads people to stagnate in their skill level.  There's no better training than a live opponent.

In boxing, you can gain skills of competency relatively quickly.  You work a lot of combos on the pads and bags, then get to apply them against opponents in the ring.  You really learn to hit and take a hit, so within 6 months of hard training (3-5x/week), you should be competent enough to hit combos off and move without tiring as much.  The average untrained person tries to punch in an altercation, so boxers have a definite edge in that regard.

Judo takes a while longer to learn and competency relies on knowledge of the throws.  Some throws are easier to learn and apply than others.  An Osoto gari is relatively easy to pull off on someone untrained, especially since they don't expect it.  A Kata guruma, on the other hand, would be much more difficult to pull off, even against someone untrained.  Generally, I would say competency is solely dependent upon how well the practitioner can close the distance without getting hit, and how well he/she is able to off balance the other guy, and yes, weight makes a pretty big difference (see Ronda Rousey vs Gegard Mousasi on youtube)."

Government has the ability to back its commands up with force, but honestly, without the consent of the people, you just have tyranny. Even if people obey such a government's commands, it's only because they fear what happens when they don't. Ultimately, for a government to have legitimacy, a sufficient number of people need to consent to be governed by it. Obviously, not everyone will as this is unrealistic, but those who don't will just need to either follow the rules of the government that rules for the people, or leave.

Plus, if you allow any outside people to access your Plex server, I can tell you that you are going to see transcoding.

I finally gave up on conversion because it wasn't worth the hassle when I'd see transcoding from external clients at least 60-70% of the time anyway."

screenmagnet,sex,1390959109.0,"This is what my bf and I are doing. He used to pull out every time, but now that I am tracking my cycles, he only pulls out when I am fertile. If you want to do this properly, she needs to use the sympto-thermal method (check her cervical mucous and body temperature every day). Also, she needs to be having regular cycles for this method to be reliable. Finally, I highly recommend that she use a smartphone app to keep track of her cycle (the app will automatically calculate her fertile days). And you both should read the book ""taking charge of your fertility"". Finally, it's a good idea to have some plan b at home in case of an emergency, and a solid plan for what you guys will do if she does get pregnant.

Good luck. There is definitely a responsible way to do what you are doing. And if you do it right, it will be almost as effective as condoms.

Edit: Btw, I'm a med student too. There are quite a few of us that use pull out and/or fertility awareness methods with high success. Feel free to ask me any questions."

We both managed to get it all straightened out without having to pay outrageous bills, but it took several hours a day for a week or two to get it all straightened out.

Some other things I've learned the hard way:

* Do not trust that just because you have been somewhere (a facility for procedure or specific doctor) they still are in network for you. Contracts are renewed *(twice a yr I think)*, and sometimes they don't renew. Or forget to renew. Or just don't process the paperwork correctly. But it is in the FREAKING FINE PRINT on your insurance contract that you are supposed to call and check with them BEFORE EVERY SINGLE APPOINTMENT, PROCEDURE and LAB TEST to confirm that **the doctor,** **the facility** and/or **that specific test** are covered and/or in network.  Every time. If you don't, and someone didn't renew, or your insurance stopped covering that blood work, it is ON YOU TO PAY.

* Get both a name and confirmation number of the person at your insurance you speak to. Write these down, along with the date and time you speak to them. Keep this in a notebook and do not lose it. DO NOT just look things up on their website. They will explain that you simply screwed up. If you do not SPEAK TO A PERSON and have record of speaking to them, YOU will on the hook for whatever bill is suddenly not in network or covered."

Anyway, you should ask her out again and be clear about your intentions. Tell her you like her, that she's pretty, etc. (Things that friends don't say.) Ask her to dinner at a place that sounds romantic when you ask her so that she gets that it is a date--eg, a fancy restaurant. Girls don't just go to fancy restaurants with male friends they don't want to date unless they are super naive or leading them on. She should be able to tell you are asking her out for real. And then if she says yes, dress up nicely and pay the cheque. I don't believe that a man should always pay or that dates need to be at fancy restaurants, but I think doing this will make it clear that you see it as a date. If I go out with an acquaintance and nothing overtly romantic happens and we split the bill, I just assume it's not a date. 

If you don't have the money to take her to dinner, ask her out to do some sort of activity, like ice skating. It's an activity that invites you to be touchy-feely/flirty with each other. Hopefully you'll get some clear signals from that. "

And I'd argue such is the realities of life. Even if the US government were dissolved tomorrow, something would take its place.

I don't use that statistic to claim anything about women.  I just use it to point out that the odds of a successful marriage aren't completely in your hands.  No matter how alpha you are, you can't control another person's decisions.  So on that point we seem to be in agreement.  

You overlook a rather large psychological reason for getting married:  men like the idea of ""happily forever after"" and willfully ignore the very large gamble they're making with their future."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390959474.0,"Let's use healthcare as an example. if I'm not mistaken, a major reason certain other countries do not allow for private insurance, for example, is because it leads to inefficiencies which inflate the costs of the entire system. You have a public system that pumps money into the private system, which is built on markets and often is there to maximize profits. The fact that we have expensive healthcare, if I'm not mistaken, is because we have the existence of both a public and private system. Seeing how an all private system would obviously exclude people from a vital service needed to live, if it can be argued that an all public system with no competition would significantly reduce costs while providing for everyone, I would be for it. 

That's just one example. Obviously it doesn't apply everywhere. And I don't think it applies with the post service."

LXXXVI,linguistics,1390959497.0,"This is speculation and anecdotal, but I have noticed that the usage of ""I feel..."" is suggested by many personal growth and communication books. In there it is presented as a way towards compromise, since by prefacing whatever with ""I feel"", one supposedly let's the other party know that this is not a claim of truth but rather a personal opinion.

Personally, I *think* it's because people are less and less willing to take responsibility for whatever comes out of their mouths, and by saying ""I feel"" they effectively dodge the obligation of what they're saying making logical sense, since feelings don't have to make sense (as opposed to thoughts).

She was funny, laughed at most things I said, liked my friends, was cute (definitely not hot stuff), etc. Not the best catch when seen from afar, but there was a connection being made. Long story short, after three months of her continuing the flirting and me flirting back but not doing anything about it, I decided ""fuck it"" and asked her out by the soda machine at a Taco Bell.

We lasted over 5 years and had some of the most amazing times together. For a good while, I was thinking that i could do better, but.... why not give this a chance? I ended up loving her more than anything and I can honestly say that i will never regret having ""settled"" for her.

Don't focus the hate on the health aspect of it, that's totally useless.

**Edit**: Whoa, I clearly did not explain myself, so let me do that. I said ""don't focus on the health aspect of it"" with ""health"" meaning ""nutrition"". Supplements like fermented cod liver oil and real, healthy fish oil are great for you (I take mine in the form of eating fish, personally) and I didn't want that to be smeared.  If you take any kind of supplement (or eat any kind of food, or wear anything, or drink anything, etc), especially something that has a large environmental impact, you should KNOW exactly where it comes from and have a reputable, trustworthy source. It's not the ""health craze"", it's uneducated people going for what is probably the cheapest and most convenient option. We should support businesses that are transparent.

I do agree that tons of people not doing that would definitely support a black market for the stuff and be a cause. I just want people to look at the right culprits (including the people doing the fishing)."

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1390959829.0,"You need to keep two main things in mind: there's going to be a lot of flash photography, and it's an emotional time. 

You want to make sure that your foundation, concealer, and powder are flash photography friendly. I solved that problem by ordering foundation geared towards that (Graftobian cream), but the most important thing is to just not have spf, and to not use a finishing powder as a setting powder. It's okay to go heavy on the foundation. 

You need water proof mascara, and you need to make sure it will actually work for you. I've fallen in love with Maybelline The Falsies. I'm considering also wearing actual falsies for mine (Ardell 110 is surprisingly natural looking). 

I might recommend a bit more obvious eyeliner and not so much in the way of tightlining, unless you've found something that will stay put when you're crying. 

To be certain everything will work well, take some photos of yourself in the makeup using flash, from a bit of a distance. That will help you get a better sense of what you'll actually look like. "

If I can get milk for free why would I want to keep a cow? I have no room for a cow and no means to take care of one either. It would be taken by animal protection really soon and I would be slapped with a fine (best case scenario). 

I have had sex pretty much the first week of meeting most of my LTRs, it wasn't a requirement though. Delaying sex for a ""just because"" reason when you both really want it is just stupid. A man who is just after sex would leave either way, it won't change the outcome.

The view of sex as some sort of currency is a big red flag for me. Given the effort I usually put into coital activities I find it insulting when a girl considers it a special kind of favor that's all done for me. If it's not fun and great for both parties what's the point of doing it at all? Unless of course she gets off on the idea of using sex as some kind of currency.

I mean is there a choice that has to be made? Principal or relationship? Does it not matter that I don't think something was offensive if someone else did? That just loops it back though.

I don't think playing *Morrowind* has anything significantly to do with understanding the Lessons properly, because I like to think I have a pretty good handle on them, and my roommate who has played *Morrowind* has no clue about the metaphysical stuff and isn't much interested in them.

And then you have people like /u/RottenDeadite who know so much Earth philosophy and religion and symbolism and can find stuff in there that most people would never think to see.

____

I think you'll need a couple read-throughs and maybe some idle browses through philosophical works (Jorge Luis Borges is a big one), but playing *Morrowind* or not will just affect how you see the Lessons tying into Dunmeris culture, and probably not be a big effect on the Aurbical significance either way. That said, you probably **should** play *Morrowind* at some point (and I can only say that without hypocrisy because I'm starting it myself) because TES is a game series and the games provide more than the sum of their parts.

So is it critical? I don't think so. Is it a good idea? Yeah, definitely."

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1390959993.0,"My brother a few years back was stationed in South Carolina. Well, there was a shack that sold hot wings and the like and they touted to have the worlds hottest hot wings. They were made with ghost chilies and one other one I cannot think about.

He had to eat something like 10 of them in 15 minutes or less and his meal would be comped, he'd get a t-shirt and his name on this wall. 

He says, ""Fuck yeah!"" Ok, so my idiot brother should have known it was a bad idea because 1) He had to sign a *waiver* saying he wouldn't sue the joint or anything to that effect if anything went wrong and 2) the poor waitress had to wear *rubber gloves* when bringing out the plate of wings. 

Well, the clock starts, and my brother gets ""smart"" - shreds all the meat off the bones and shovels all the shit into his face. He completed the challenge in 7 minutes. Well, he gets his name put on the wall, his shirt, and his meal comped and he walks out of there all high and mighty. 

Well, he and friends decide to go and he starts to not feel so good and asks his friend to drive. In about 5 minutes and as soon as they get onto the interstate my brother hangs out the window and projectile vomits down the freeway. 

Needless to say, he couldn't feel his mouth for close to a week, and it took his insides about that long to start feeling normal.

Leave it be for a good while. If he;s been in a relationship for 6 months, I'd say give it another bit before talking to him.

And use the sandwich method: compliment, criticism, compliment.

Make sure he knows first and foremost that you don't dislike his girlfriend or have a problem with her, even if you do, because he'll likely go on the defensive, whether right there or in the future. I'm sure if she was a bitch or something you would have stated that in the OPost.

Let him know how you see things and ask him if he's noticed the same things.

Also, realize that sometimes this stuff happens and it might be for the better. Gladly, you're happy for your friend, and if he sees that, he will hopefully start to make more room to see you guys (if he also wants that). 

Sometimes people in new relationships just need time to absorb the love and go through those new emotions before settling into a relationship that has a good balance between relationship-time and friend/bro-time!"

aquanautic,AskWomen,1390960074.0,"I agree, it's bad form to bring up exes on a date (*especially* on a first date), but current SO's do eventually get a little curious. It does sound like your taste is a little off (unless those are all fabricated for an example), but after a certain amount of time you are allowed to basically say, ""I was young, we were completely different people with completely different goals/perspectives/fill in the blank and it just didn't work out."" Because no matter what, those relationships didn't just get thrown upon you--you choose to be in them at some point and you have to have a bit of ownership over that. 

I dated someone very abusive for about a year. It was absolutely explosive the entire time. Today, unless I'm asked for details, the story is something like: I was really insecure and in a new place. I knew I shouldn't have been with him after a few months in, but I was lacking the tools and mindset to get out of there safely. Bad things happen--like police involvement level bad. It was scary, but eventually I just stopped talking to him one day and filed for a PPO. Some things that remind me of him make me nervous. He still tries to contact me and that's upsetting too.

Obviously that's a little better for someone who knows me as at least a friend. Not a first date. First date would be: It was abusive, it got really bad, but I got myself out of that situation and I'm really glad it didn't last any longer. 

The truth of it gets a lot more complicated, to things I don't really tell much of anybody. That I made a spam filter on all my email accounts to block all of his email accounts. That he broke into my dorm, hit me, shoved me, deleted several things from my phone and computer by force while I screamed bloody murder and hoped someone would come and check on me. 

To sum things up, there's certainly a way to spare someone the gory details of things like that while still being honest about yourself and your experiences. It doesn't have to be these horrible relationships, either; applies to relationships that just fizzle out. "

ProRustler,malefashionadvice,1390960094.0,"Good rule of thumb: unless you're wearing a tie and it is completely cinched up against your neck, **never** button the top button of your shirt. This is normally reserved for a very formal look; business suit, tuxedo, etc. For a more casual outfit like the one you're going for, loosen the tie a bit and undo that top button. Fun fact, the tie was originally used to keep the neck of your shirt closed before buttons were invented. 

It's difficult to tell from your pic if you're actually wearing a tie. If you are, it's a bad choice because there's no contrast between the color of your tie and your sweater. Think of ties like socks and pocket squares. They are accent pieces, and should stand out from the other items you are wearing, not match (unless you're P-Diddy circa 1998). This is why black ties go with white shirts, plaid ties pair well with stripes, etc.

If that is indeed a tie you're wearing, look into a [half](http://www.animatedknots.com/tiehalfwindsor/index.php?Reflection=UR&amp;Categ=household) or even full windsor knot. They're bigger knots, which will look much fuller than the standard four in hand knot. The full windsor uses a lot of tie material, making it short in length, but if you're hiding the tie under a sweater, who cares?

As others have noted, don't cuff the sweater's sleeves. I'll usually try to make the dress shirt cuffs poke out a couple inches from my sweater/jacket sleeves to give a more layered appearance.

While we're at it, I've always found items carried in a pouch on your belt to be very unfashionable. Stow that leatherman/cellphone in your pocket.

Hope that helps you, wish my dad told me this shit in my 20's."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390960113.0,"&gt; and yet you don't follow that requirement. Why do I need to change your minds in order to be free, when you feel that you're entitled to simply impose your system without changing our minds. Why don't YOU change our minds so that we go along with Democracy? If your way is so great, surely you could persuade us of that fact. 

The state is the status quo, you're promoting a radical change to it. I propose changes too, and that's ultimately up to me to convince people of them.

Beyond that, why should the minority rule over the majority. I understand tyranny by majority has its problems, but tyranny by minority seems much worse. We have to live according to some set of rules if we want order and this means we have to compromise and we're not gonna get everything we want. Human existence, is a compromise. We're never gonna have rules that make everyone happy. But the theory is, if you don't like the rules you can leave (although I recognize this is a bit eaiser said than done given the fact that there's government everywhere).

&gt;That's precisely the contradiction I do not get. ""We can force our system on you, but if you fight back, that's bad."" What principle justifies this sort of approach?

The fact that if the system is for the majority of people, that you're trying to force us to live the way you want us to live. "

Also, while I know fan write-ups as a higher tier reward are popular, but the backgrounds need serious copyediting.

EDIT: Been thinking, it'll make more sense to have one launch/drop down building and have things get moved to it when you want to sell them.

You're typical pilot, if he's not just using his ESF to get from A to B, can't be brought down with a single lock on rocket, and lets say he pops his flares, sees where the missile came from and wastes you without so much as a second though. Or he can just afterburn away get out of line of sight and come back when his flares recharge and turn you into a burnt crater or cut you into ribbons with his nose gun.

Well why not use bursters you might say. Sure why not? Unless he's sitting there without composite armor, sure you can easily do significant damage to it, but he or she can still just fly away and repair and go somewhere else.

You honestly cannot compare the two. Besides, what the fuck do you know about ground combat, I've looked at your stats, and you do almost nothing but fly.

&gt;If the ""best shot at a happy life"" is immoral

There's nothing immoral about giving your son trucks to play with instead of dolls.  I think you're overestimating how biologically predetermined people's personalities are; the environment in which kids are raised has a tremendous influence on shaping what they value.  They have no idea what to value starting off, and if we can increase the odds that they'll value the same things that are most valued in them by others, that's of benefit for them.  I'm not sure how you could consider lessening their risk of suicide, mental illness, assault, social ostracism, etc immoral, but calling it mindless Nazi hedonism is undoubtedly a stretch.

&gt;How many people make attracting a conventionally attractive partner the main goal in their lives? 

Maybe not their *main* goal, but it's definitely up there for most people.  Regardless of what your goals are, having behaviors and values that are in line with gender norms tends to make things tremendously easier."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390960387.0,"&gt;Why would it?

Because the system is based on profit, not helping people. It'll only help people who have the sufficient funds.

&gt;How would a forced monopoly be more efficient than a number of businesses competing against each other? 

We spend 16% of our GDP in healthcare, countries with various forms of universal healthcare spend 10% or so. 

&gt;Are you in favor of allowing free market monopolies? 

Free market monopolies should be avoided, but are sometimes impossible to avoid due to stuff like zoning and property laws (looking at you, ISPs).

&gt;Do some markets operate on different principles than others? If so, what are the differences and how do you sufficiently categorize them?

I think some markets are just different, and we should evaluate what makes them different and plan our policies accordingly. I believe all have a profit making motive, but I believe some have higher levels of competition than one another, I believe some are necessarily granted monopolies due to whatever reason, and I believe some services are more vital than others. I don't think there's a one size fits all solution. I'm for ""whatever works the best."""

julesandthebigun,Anxiety,1390960392.0,"As far as feeling like you wasted money if you don't take them, maybe try to look at it as you spent the money to learn that this type of birth control pill doesn't work for you. You've learn the lesson, no use punishing yourself about it. 

I've tried at least six or seven types of birth control and none of them worked, I tried the depo shot and that didn't work either. So now I just use condoms and I mean, it's not the best but at least my anxiety isn't so bad and I'm not an emotional rollercoaster all the time.

My advice is shop around, talk to your doctor that it didn't work and you'd like to try others, they have low dose ones, ones with only a single hormone. Pills you take three weeks on one week off, ones you take back to back with no periods. There's LOADS of different kinds. Maybe ask if they have samples of some too, just so you can try them without it costing you money, and if they don't work out, no guilt. I've had the doctor give me three months of pills for free. And of course if you try more and they all make you more anxious, you can try the shot, or there's an implant thing, (I think it's call implanon) or an IUD (hormonal, or copper, if the hormones is what is doing it). It's more initial cost upfront but it lasts for a long time and is cheaper in the long run.

But yeah, your blood pressure isn't dangerously high, and it could also be raised because your anxiety is heightened. If you are really worried you could try taking it when you know your family/partner will be home, or you could ask a friend to spend time with you so that if anything happened (rare, but still) someone would be there.

MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE,badhistory,1390960724.0,"&gt; because of the Chinese famine and the killings by Soviet leadership, no one could say anything about US soldiers killing civilians since we were ""protecting them from communism. "" All of my what. How can you even argue that?

This isn't bad history.  It might deserve a post in /r/badethics, but even then it's arguable.  Your position is a deontological ""ethic of ultimate ends"" whereas the caller's position represents (however crudely) the ""ethic of responsibility.""  (These two contrasting ethical standards taken, of course, from Max Weber's *Politics as a Vocation*.)

If the United States were successful and South Vietnam remained free, it might look a lot more like South Korea and Taiwan, and would not have had to go through collectivization, re-education camps, mass execution of class enemies, an international refugee crisis, and a disastrous centrally planned economy, all resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and widespread deprivation.

Your position is that the ends don't justify the means, and that you are ethically culpable for the decisions you make regardless of the possible upside.  A famous ethical dilemma is the [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem), in which you are confronted by a train headed toward a split in the track.  There are four people tied to the track the train is set to go on, but only one person tied to the track the train could be switched to.  If you do nothing, four people die instead of one, but you are not culpable for their deaths.  If you switch the train to the other track, only one person dies and four are saved, but you are morally culpable for having made the decision to kill the one person to save the four.

In the Trolley Problem most people (~90%) don't have a problem switching the train to kill the one person and save the four.  You take the other position: let the four people die so that you don't have to get your hands dirty.  And you would rather the United States not attempt to save the South Vietnamese from the predictable horrors communism, because in attempting to do so it also did horrendous acts.

[Isaiah Berlin, in his famous article on Machiavelli](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1971/nov/04/a-special-supplement-the-question-of-machiavelli/?pagination=false), wrote:

&gt; If you object to the political methods recommended because they seem to you morally detestable, if you refuse to embark upon them because they are, to use Ritter’s word, “*erschreckend*,” too frightening, Machiavelli has no answer, no argument. In that case you are perfectly entitled to lead a morally good life, be a private citizen (or a monk), seek some corner of your own. But, in that event, you must not make yourself responsible for the lives of others or expect good fortune; in a material sense you must expect to be ignored or destroyed.

&gt; To be a physician is to be a professional, ready to burn, to cauterize, to amputate; if that is what the disease requires, then to stop halfway because of personal qualms, or some rule unrelated to your art and its technique, is a sign of muddle and weakness, and will always give you the worst of both worlds. And there are at least two worlds: each of them has much, indeed everything, to be said for it; but they are two and not one. One must learn to choose between them and, having chosen, not look back.

&gt; There is more than one world, and more than one set of virtues: confusion between them is disastrous. One of the chief illusions caused by ignoring this is the Platonic-Hebraic-Christian view that virtuous rulers create virtuous men. This, according to Machiavelli, is not true. Generosity is a virtue, but not in princes. A generous prince will ruin the citizens by taxing them too heavily, a mean prince (and Machiavelli does not say that meanness is a good quality in private men) will save the purses of the citizens and so add to public welfare. A kind ruler—and kindness is a virtue—may let intriguers and stronger characters dominate him, and so cause chaos and corruption.

And Max Weber, in ""Politics as a Vocation"", wrote:

&gt; ""It follows that as far as a person's actions are concerned, it is not true that nothing but good comes from good and nothing but evil from evil, but rather quite frequently the opposite is the case. Anyone who does not realize this is in fact a mere child in political matters.""

Again, you might have a case in /r/badethics but it's arguable, and the NPR callers don't really deserve to be featured on /r/badhistory either."

In school you're around a large number of people, every day, so it's easier to find people with similar interests.  Those people still exist when you get older, but everyone gets wrapped up in their families and own lives.  

I've found rec sports to be a help in meeting new people, as well as spending time with friends of friends.  Networking is pretty key, but the odds of finding someone with similar interests AND similar free time is a lot tougher to get.

It works well enough though.  I've got friends I've grown up with and friends I've known less than a year."

Sounds like lots of ups and downs with this girl but it could be any number of things, maybe something is going on with her and she's having a hard time with something? Maybe she didn't think you guys clicked, and I know that really hurts, but I mean, you wouldn't want to be with someone who wasn't as crazy about you as you are about them, right? You want someone chomping at the bit to be with you. You deserve that, and I assure you that it'll come along one day. 

Also, even though relationships can be a distraction from anxiety, that is a lot of responsibility for the other person. I know that my anxiety got on my partners nerves. Especially if they don't really understand what you are going through. It's hard for them to be the source of your happiness.

I think everything will be okay though. When you are lonely, talk to some friends, or family or even people here on the internet. I've been dealing a lot with loneliness too and the internet is a good escape from all of that. :)

FactualPedanticReply,worldnews,1390960966.0,"As a number of other people on this thread have pointed out, it's not just a matter of Omega-3 content - it's also a matter of bioavailability.

In this case, though there are a lot of plants that have Omega-3's in them, our guts are significantly less good at takin' 'em out and doing good stuff with 'em. 

Vegetarians generally get interested in Omega-3's because a vegetarian diet doesn't have a lot of good sources of Omega-3's in it. I'm not gonna pass judgement too strongly here on people's motivations for vegetarianism because I like the idea that this is more informational than philosophical, but I will say that getting bioavailable Omega-3's into your diet is sufficiently problematic for vegetarians that those with more flexible diet justifications should consider just working in fish."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390960997.0,"&gt; Some people choose to suffer (in my opinion nobly) for what they believe is right (justice). 

WHich involves forgoing pleasure or experiencing pain to recieve even more pleasure in the long term.

&gt; Some take pleasure in committing injustice.

These people should be fought against. 

&gt;Justice: every person gets what they deserve and does what they ought. What do we deserve? The right to live as we choose, own the fruit of our labor, and to be safe from aggression. This is the realm of legality (not necessarily enforced by a government) What ought we do? We ought to respect each other and ourselves and be the best people that we can. This is the realm of morality, which only each person as an individual should enforce upon his/herself.

Question. Say one person came to acquire all the land ""legally"", and therefore owns all the means of production and owns all the fruits of the labor. Everyone else is excluded or starves. Is this moral?

Say that the owner of all the land decides to allow some people to work on it, for minimum pay. They face very adverse working conditions, and are treated as slaves, except they can technically leave. However, if they leave, they starve. The transactions are seen as voluntary because they're not being forced to work per se, although it's clearly their only option other than starvation. Is this moral?

Say we have a group of elites who own all the land, and it's split up among them. So there's some competition, but at the same time, there's no incentive for them to truly compete, because if they do so they would give their workers too much bargaining power, so they wish to maintain their position. That being said, they're still given the choice to work in adverse conditions for very little or starve, is this moral?

THis is how I see unregulated capitalism. The whole property rights thing sounds great in theory, but in practice, it's VERY problematic at times. It leads to some having a ridiculous amount, while others being on mere subsistence level if not worse, and having few to no opportunities for advancement. I'm sorry, but this is not utilitarian, and in my opinion is not moral. I believe to achieve the best results, interactions need to be regulated. Government should act as a referee of sorts who says stuff like, you have to pay people a certain amount so that they can live well. You need to give so much vacation time, you can't work them more than so many hours, and if you do, you have to pay them extra, etc.

Property rights are a doubled edged sword to me. I don't place them on the same level as life or liberty at all."

There's not 32 guys capable of presently playing QB in the NFL at a high level on the planet IMO. A good handful of teams are always going to be on the outside looking in, in that regard. So my point is that I don't think finding a QB should be a priority when we have a young QB, who has proven ability to play at a high level, has avoided injury, and is only 1.5 seasons in"

I work at the large regional hospital, but they do have several doctors offices, other hospitals, etc. That being said I don't really like how they run their hospitals in general so I don't know if I would be all that sad to burn that bridge.

neekz0r,AskMen,1390961173.0,"&gt; You realize this type of illogical thinking is a shaming tactic we think is pathetically unoriginal? So much so, it is in the sidebar:

**Bitter** *(of people or their feelings or behavior) angry, hurt, or resentful because of one's bad experiences or a sense of unjust treatment.* [source](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=define%3A+bitter&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8)

I defined my source. Please state my logical fallacy. Let me guess, *ad homimem*? Nope. As I said, I agreed with a lot of what the redpill says. To paraphrase our conversation: 

I said: ""I like some types of pizza, but Pizza Huts marketing sucks""
You said: ""That's pathetic and illogical.""


According to your post:

*Response: Anger is a legitimate emotion in the face of injustice.   It is important to remember that passive acceptance of evil is not a virtue.*

The fallacy with that whole argument is that it assumes it's an injustice. It's an injustice.. how? That women are programed differently than men? What would you prefer, that men have the same sexual and emotional needs as women or that women have the same sexual and emotional needs as men? Either way sucks. You have men behaving like women and vice versa. There is no injustice that each sex has different needs and wants. It's just the way it is. Blame evolution. I mean, fuck, at least we aren't fucking [angler fish](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/angler). Now **that** is an injustice!

No, my friend, it is in the presentation that makes the red pillar look bitter, **not** the content. There is a big difference between these two sentences:

""Some men like to have sex, women like to have sex and then relationships after they've had a plentiful amount of sex.""

and 

""Alpha men like to have sex beta men like to please sluts with relationships, while the whores cheat on them; bitches who hit the wall like to have relationships after they've ridden the cock carousel""

As a bit of perspective, I feel that your parents are just making plans about their life. They've had a lot of experiences where things just happened whether they were ready or not and this time they want to be ready for getting older.

I feel like in general as people get older they get more okay with aging and stuff. The idea of death for me is one that brings up a lot of anxiety too. Sometimes I don't understand how people can just be normal and boring and not freak out that they only get one life and they are spending it complaining or something else.

Maybe your parents are nervous but they are using their nervous energy into planning things so they aren't so scared. That could be it too. When I'm nervous about something, like a speech, having a plan makes me not quite so nervous.

I can assure you though that your parents are going to be around for a long time and if you think you are able, you could talk to them about how you are feeling and maybe they could reassure you a bit too.

Pretty much everyone, man.  It's not like our genes somehow know what facial hair patterns are more attractive, the hair just grows where it grows.  And yeah, it's really common (I'd say nearly universal) for the neckbeard to come in first.

Unfortunately, puberty takes years :(  We're not on a fast track just because we start the right puberty when we're older, and think about how many cis guys 2 years after starting puberty who have kickass facial hair.

&gt; How long has it taken you to grow out of it and get something approaching hair that you don't just want to shave right off?

It's been a while, but I think I had decent sideburns by about 6 months and a chin scruff by about a year.  I tried growing the rest out here and there, but it didn't look presentable as a full beard until maybe 7 years?

For context, the men in my family all have full thick beards, and even with those genes it took that long to come in fully.  And, to be honest, it's still growing and filling in.  It's an ongoing thing."

  As for creating Hell/ being the ruler of it, I would like to see your proof of this. Nothing in the bible says this. I can tell you what it *does* say, though.  Jer 7:31 says He's never commanded burning anyone, and the idea hadn't even entered his heart. Gen 2:16, 17 says, when God is talking to Adam about what he can and can't do, and the punishment for breaking that one law, that he would die, not die and then go burn up in a lake of fire for all eternity. Gen 3:17-19 reiterates this (once hes broken the rule.) Eze18:20 says the soul that is sinning will die. Eccl 9:5-10 says the dead are conscious of nothing at all. Ps 146:4 says when a man dies, his thoughts perish. To me this says there is no suffering after death for being a sinner. Ergo, no hell.

codergamergeekyguy,ruby,1390961395.0,"&gt; What idioms do blocks permit that the above Python features would not?

The difference between Ruby and Python isn't about *can* I write code that does the same thing. It is about *how easily* can I write code that does X? It is about *how readable* is the code that does X? With that said ...

The fact that every function has an implicit or explicit block parameter means that the use of blocks permeates the language. From the auto-close idiom:

    # PWD == ""/foo""
    FileUtils.cd(somedir) do
      # PWD == somedir
      # Do something in somedir
    end
    # PWD == ""/foo""

To the simple use of high-level algorithms:

    # Get all the objects from `collection` whose `answer` member equals 42
    answers = collection.select { |item| item.answer == 42 }

To the construction of DSLs:

    task :complete do
      puts 'Build complete!'
    end

Can you do all of the above (with perhaps the exception of simple DSLs) with function pointers/objects? Sure. Would it be as easy to code and as readable as using blocks? Not in my experience.

Now, if you're talking about lambdas, that might be different. But I've generally found that they don't get much use in languages that support lambdas but do not encourage their promiscuous use like Ruby does blocks. (Ruby has both blocks and lambdas and there are subtle differences between them.) What this means is that the intermediate programmer in that language probably doesn't use them. This further relegates lambdas to an interesting and perhaps useful, but for the most part unused construct."

&gt;Ftm transition isn't enough for me, it's a long process I dont have time for right now 

I'm guessing that you're in your twenties. If you aren't living as the right gender now, it is indeed worth spending the time and energy to transition, because you have *decades* of life left. Also, note that it isn't something where you can't do anything else during the time of transition. Life goes on, you still have to pay rent, you still need a job, you still have to do life. Saying, ""I don't have time for this shit,"" is an excuse you are telling yourself.

&gt;part of me feels deep down that anything less than 100% natural wouldnt make me really happy.

Maybe it would make you happier than you are right now? You'd still get treated as a man by everyone in your life, you'd be able to be in a straight relationship with a woman, and you would like your body more than you do now. The fact that you weren't born a male doesn't change any of that. Are you ever going to be a cis man and have a body just like one? No, but it's possible for you to be closer to who you want to be.

&gt;every day I wake up at 'square one' I have to collect myself and become content with my female anatomy on a daily basis.

Cis women don't typically do this, you know.

Speaking from personal experience (I went the other way in transition), those feelings won't go away, no matter how much you try to ignore them.

Therapy (with someone experienced with trans people) is a good idea, as is subscribing to /r/asktransgender and /r/ftm. See if you notice other people's stories that resonate with you. Good luck!"
JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390961419.0,"&gt; It does not necessarily follow that because people can be bad we must have a monopoly on force. That is just a predetermined conclusion you jump to.

So we should go back to the state of nature instead?

&gt;Might be worse actually because you'd be stating the majority can be wrong and it doesn't really matter at all, society must follow along 

But at the same time, what's the better solution? To govern by minority? And as far as principles, what about the problems that arise because of those principles? I believe the libertarian absolutism as far as property rights go become rather tyrannical and oppressive in themselves.

And what are the principles even based on? If you ask me, they're as subjective as anything else is.

I will grant you the idea that the majority can be wrong, I just don't see any superior alternative. 

Quite frankly, there's no one good way to deal with this, and we can keep going around in circles, but I will ultimately stand by the concept that the majority is the best option. We can either choose monarchy (rule by one), oligarchy (rule by few), or democracy (rule by many). I'll take rule by many. 

&gt;What gives the majority the right to rule over the minority? 

The fact that I can't think of a better way to do things. Rule by minority is even more impressive, and I don't really think the concept of universal principles is all its cracked up to be.

&gt;What constitutes the majority and minority in each region? The entire planet? Local municipality? State? Household?

Whole class had to make on short together, and it was a terrible idea to begin with, with about five minutes worth of planning. I was working on it as the editor and knew how bad everything was going, even though I was doing as much as I could to make lemonade.

During class one day, the 'director' says ""I don't feel like it's going that great.""

And I said ""It's fine, everyone knows your first movie sucks.""

The whole room stared at me like I just kicked everyone's puppies. Except for the teacher who says ""Yep, but we keep going until we're done.""

I want a government that governs the people, but are also ultimately responsible to it. If that makes sense.

&gt;This is not exclusive to government.

Western government at least generally outlines a number of rights, and has relatively decentralized power though, so I would say it can use its force in the fairest way possible.

&gt;So a government only has authority in theory? I do agree, though, if everyone agreed to be governed, then there's no problem.

It sounds like the legal assistant job is stressing you out, do you think that being a paralegal would be different? It would be some significant time and money so you would want it to be worth it. My opinion is that you aren't super certain about it, so maybe it would be a good idea to just take some time and think about it, talk with the paralegals at your office about job stress, talk to your friends and family who know you and ask them if they think you could do it, they know you well.

If not, you could just look for other jobs while staying employed there. Take a look at your options in your city and see if you find anything interesting. It's been a few years since you were looking for a job in the film industry so maybe you could even try looking into that again?

Sabu113,worldnews,1390961968.0,"Not really. Science is a method of establishing the causality of natural events. It doesn't deal with the tradeoffs of taking into account those events. Economics is the study of trade offs and incentives. At the end of the day you need to decide how much growth and poverty to trade for nature and a healthy eco-system. Both disciplines can only give you the consequences of certain decision paths (with varying degrees of certainty)- not the rationales to choose one bundle or the other. But at least that would be a start rather than bumbling around when we *know* better.

Kells77,solotravel,1390961981.0,"Well hey, even if the experience hasn't been the best, you have come away with a lesson learned, right?  It hasn't been a total waste.  The next time you travel by yourself, you will be better prepared and have a better understanding of what to expect.  That's worth more than any money you might have ""wasted"".  

I have had to spend 19 hours in an airport before for the same reason you are going to be doing so.  It's not ideal, but you know what?  Ever since that experience, I have made better planning decisions, and haven't had it happen again (at least not due to poor planning...delayed flights, yes).

Keep your chin up and don't give up on solo travel...just take what you learn from this experience and use it to make your next trip better!"

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390962279.0,"&gt; If you believe that morality is largely subjective, how can you not be an individualist?

Because it doesn't produce optimal outcomes for ALL members of society. I'm neither individualist nor collectivist. I'm utilitarian.

&gt;Who is better suited to applying a ""muddle through"" ""problem-solving"" process to determining the optimum choices for one's life - the individual actually living that life or some authority who is, at best, working off of a statistical model?

The latter. One person's experiences do not give you adequate ability to govern for all. Statistical models give a more general overview of all of society.

&gt;And more directly, how can you reject philosophical models but then support a system of governance that's predicated on statistical models? I can't imagine that you can't see that they suffer the exact same shortcomings, and thus the exact same dangers, and at least a philosopher can't throw you in jail for not fitting in with the dictates of his model.

Philosophical is not statistical. I just used statistics as an example, I believe decisions should be made based on real world data. I don't believe decisions should be made to conform to this abstract idea of how things should be.

&gt;Is human well being, not to mention pleasure, necessarily subjective? Presuming that you'll say yes, how can any third party possibly be legitimately given control over nominally delivering it?

Nerve endings experiencing things are objective I guess, but it's mostly subjective to a large degree. We can try to figure out how others feel via empathy, which I guess is an important part in trying to figure things out too.

&gt;So would I. That's exactly why I'm an anarchist.

In other words: yes, Doug Baldwin would have been better than Ronald Johnson.  But there were probably 50 other undrafted receivers that weren't.  And if you can figure out how to reliably determine which of the 50 is this year's Doug Baldwin, there's a *lot* of money awaiting you in an NFL scouting department.

ctesibius,FutureWhatIf,1390962391.0,"I agree with /u/74159637895123. Some minor comments:

Don't get diverted by the idea of a ""missing"" constitution - this is a characteristic USAian prediliction that manifests every week or so here. The constitution is there, and it works. It happens to have a different form to the one you are used to. Constitutions have been around for about 2500 years, and this fashion for writing them down in a single document is very recent. It has advantages when a country has been formed from a traumatic event such as a secession or a revolution where there are different groups trying to pull it in different directions. We don't have that problem, so evolving constitutional law through different acts of parliament and customs as worked as well for us as your ""big bang"" approach worked for you.

&gt; Denying permission to a party form a government

A party doesn't form a government. One person is asked to form a government. Normally that is the leader of a party with an absolute majority, but coalition governments have happened on several occasions in the last century, and also in one case the Conservative party had a majority but no leader, so that the Queen (after appropriate consultation) chose the PM. In all cases, the criterion is that the person is able to command a majority in the House of Commons. Because of this, there would be *no point* in the monarch choosing someone else: they wouldn't have the votes to do anything.

&gt; Or even, by himself, dissolve Parliament and call new election?

Yes, that could happen (and did in Australia, although the decision was that of the High Commissioner acting in the Queen's name). That is a feature of the constitution, and in theory it avoids the sort of deadlocks that the USA has faced over budgets recently. In practice the threat of dissolution avoids the practical need for it. You may know that ""snap"" elections called at 3w notice (normally by the sitting govt) are a feature of UK politics, and result from us having maximum parliamentary terms rather than fixed terms.

Now a question for you - why did Bush II's use of ""signing statements"" to change the purpose or interpretation of acts of congress not have any major opposition? "

The Earth is *huge*.  Almost unimaginably huge, really.  Have you been skydiving?  Imagine freefalling at that speed for nearly three days-- that's how long it would take to fall through the Earth (if you assumed surface g and 1atm pressure throughout).  So to compress that down to the size of a BB is quite a transformation.  

In this scaled-down universe, Voyager 1, the farthest man-made object, is just over two miles away.  So about from my house to the local grocery store.  Keep in mind that Voyager 1 has been travelling faster than a bullet for over three decades, which would be prohibitively long for a manned mission.  And no, generation ships aren't feasible.

I've walked to the grocery store, but I've never walked to Kenya.  You might be thinking, *but wait a minute, rocket technology has advanced!*.  Yes and no.  Chemical rocket Isp's have stagnated over the past few decades and show absolutely no sign of improvement. 

Our generation is spoiled in that we think that technology advances exponentially, when really it doesn't.  Computers are the exception to the rule, and will only continue to be until transistors hit the atomic scale.  3D chips get too hot, quantum computers are limited in complexity by decoherence, etc.  Point is, after a while, any new technology will level out and stagnate, and rockets have already reached this point in terms of Isp, which is ultimately what you'll need a metric fuckton of if you want to improve the range of manned missions.

And all of this completely ignores EDL, which makes things even worse.

tl;dr: Interstellar travel is impossible.

codayus,AskMen,1390962662.0,"&gt; Would you be offended if your wife admitted that she ""settled"" for you?

No.  I mean, the wording could use some work, but what she's saying is ""I picked you because you were the best potential partner I could find"".  Which seems, well...sane?  Normal?  Unavoidable?

What are the alternatives here?  ""I picked you because, although I could have done much better, I love abusive drug addicts""?  ""I picked you because you are the imaginary love child of Robert Downey Jr., James Deen, and Bill Gates, can fly, and your semen tastes like cherry poptart filling?""

The whole book is basically aimed at this idea that Twue Love is this magical thing where the Lonely Princess gets swept off her feet by a Dashing Hero who is perfect in every way, and not, in fact, this difficult, sometimes messy process where happy ending are not guaranteed, but instead are the result of two imperfect people working hard to forge a life together.  And this misconception leads to a couple major issues.

On the female side, you see a few women rejecting everyone who isn't 100% perfect + glitters in the sun, because obviously their Edward Cullen is out there if they just wait long enough!  (Or more commonly, being serially monogamous as they break up with boyfriend after boyfriend once they realise he's not the male lead from a Hollywood rom-com.)

And on the male side you get some very warped ideas about how dating should work; this drives a lot of ideas about the friendzone.  But you also see a violent reaction to the idea that they're *not* perfect.

So basically, there's this whole ""you're not Prince Charming; therefore we can't really be in love"" and ""we're in love; therefore I must be Prince Charming"" thing going on.  Gottlieb's book is aimed squarely at this, but it tends to get received as ""you're telling me I'm not a princess/not Prince Charming?!"", and gets the reaction you'd expect.

But while I have many flaws, wildly implausible ideas about the nature of romantic love are not one of them.  The whole notion of settling doesn't offend me, because it doesn't impact my conception of who I am, or how my SO and I feel about each other.

&gt; What if your wife one day revealed that she married you because you were ""okay"" - that she made a calculating decision to marry you because she felt she couldn't do better at this point in time? That you weren't anything special but she felt that it was time to place roots down in one place and start raising a family, and you were good enough?

""Yep, I knew you had a good head on your shoulder.""

I mean, seriously:  I'm not Edward Cullen, or Tony Stark.  I'm not a billionaire, I don't have movie star good looks, I can't fly, nor can I cause spontaneous orgasms in women by wiggling my eyebrows.  And that's okay.  If my SO had felt she could have done better than me, she would have given it a shot; she's not stupid or a masochist.  (...well, not a masochist in that way.  \*cough\*)  So she picked me.  Not because I'm perfect (nobody is...not even Hollywood stars, given their divorce rate), but because I'm pretty damn good.  Just like I picked her.  Because that's how relationships work, if you want them to work.

Offended?  **Why on earth would I be?**  (Note:  Nothing in this hypothetical assumes my SO isn't wildly devoted to me, doesn't love me, or isn't attracted to me.  My SO not loving me would be a huge relationship-ending disaster.  My SO noting, correctly, that she has settled for me like every other human being on the face of the planet...would not be.)

&gt; What do you think of the idea that Gottlieb is promoting here?

Broadly speaking, I agree with her.  With some caveats.  She's attacking a very prominent idea; like anyone trying to tear down a shibboleth, she can go too far.  Relationships are not the magical things Hollywood might want you to believe; they're also not the strictly cold, transactional things you might guess based on Gottlieb's book.  And it's a big book; it's easy to go through it (and many reviewers have done just that) and pull out lines which are flat out wrong or harmful.

But the core idea is that if you wait for the perfect guy with great looks, a stable job, excellent finances, no bad habits, great cooking skills, will make a wonderful dad, whom you feel an intense passion for, and a close emotional bond, and have a compatible sex drive, and who shares your taste in music, movies, politics and religion, and who loves doing housework and cooking, and who wants the same number of kids as you, and who will support your career goals...

...you might be waiting the rest of your life.  And while you can overemphasise this, the female biological clock is finite in duration.  Just as with every single aspect of your life, you can generally get **any**thing you want, but you can't get **every**thing you want.  You need to prioritise (although not, obviously, the exact way Gottlieb recommends).  That's life, like it or not.  And so you need to start going through your checklist and thinking about what you really, *really* want.  And ""everything"" is not a good answer if you want to die happy and fulfilled.

Edit:  But maybe there are better ways of saying that you ""settled"".  For example, you could also say ""you're the best SO I've ever had!"", which is generally true too.  And Gottlieb could have phrased her message not as telling women to settle, but warning them of the pain of regret when you think back on that guy you dumped who was *amazing*, but you were too immature at the time to see it, and now you'll never win him back. Sounds more romantic that way, no?  But it wouldn't cause as much controversy...or sell as many books."

dublos,OkCupid,1390962701.0,"**photos** 

None of them are quite in focus and the thumbnail of your main photo is not recognizable as you because you're such a small part of the image.  The full sized version is much better, but still blurry.  My basic criteria is whether or not I would recognize the person coming through the door for a first meeting.. the picture of you in the jacket with the purple ribbon is really the best bet for that.. I would suggest at least one new picture.   If the original of your current profile picture is much bigger, crop it down to just you and then shrink it to fit on a reasonable screen size.. see if that produces a  result with better clarity?

**self summary**

Relative time is bad.. last November was certainly November 2013, but if you don't update that portion of your profile until next December.  If you're sure you are going to revise it pretty frequently, great, but if there is any chance you're going to leave it, update it to say November 2013 instead of last November. 

Your pictures show you having completed a sporting event, but there's no caption, so was that the half marathon, and is this actually a year old and you got to Wisconsin November 2012?

**what I'm doing with my life**

Excellent, discussing what you're passionate about as well as what you're doing and leaving a hook for social interaction being desired.

**What I'm good at**

Brief, but good, being good with children says a lot about a person, and the added humor of the other pieces prevents it from sounding like ""I'm good with kids, lets have some"".   

**favorites**

Excellent.. good lists in each category with at least one concrete example of a favorite except for music.   Try adding a current favorite song/recording or two, even if you need to say that it's subject to change.

Good hook in food, you're bound to be asked ""why without the pasta?""

A non-smoker having a pack of cigarettes in the house is a temptation even if they will never smoke them.  It depends on how you look at it - if you're attracted to them, that's one thing.  If you want to do something with them even though you never will, that's a different story.

My suggestion is try to be open.  He just had a mind opening experience, and you should be happy for him and support that. I can tell you that after a move across the country, I became a bit of a different person, and I would hate if people rejected that part of me (it was all for the better).  

Realize that not trusting a person in a relationship never gets you anywhere.  It really doesn't - you think it might prepare you, but all it does is allow you to become bitter about the other person while still having the same shock if something happens to go wrong.  Try trusting him and accepting the new values that he has learned while he's been away.  I can almost guarantee you that things will go incredibly well if you're willing/able to do that."

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But this has nothing to do with 'state's' rights since states themselves are government that further upheld segregation and some of the above.

Fair enough.

&gt;What's to stop government from going to war with each other? Let's call for a one-world government.

We would have more war if we dissolved the government. One world government would have problems of its own tho. If such a thing is in our future, it's hundreds of years away. No way people would consent to it to begin with.

&gt;however, we do see a pretty successful global market where no one individual or entity is responsible for enforcement. You have voluntary arbitration and ostracism as the primary means of enforcing contracts.

Not really, what you seem to get is multinationals giving countries ultimatums that they either allow exploitation of citizens or be left in poverty. You get pressure in first world countries to lower living standards because another country is willing to allow more exploitation, it's a race to the bottom.

Capitalism isn't ""coercive"" per se, it doesn't threaten violence for not participating it, but it does threaten starvation, which is pretty much almost, if not just as bad. 

&gt;You cannot impose a certain economic dynamic on any given population. There will be, by necessity, many different systems working beside, between, and among others. You won't have this type of hostility because no one will be forced into any one system.

Not necessarily, I already explained the race to the bottom to you."

I think it's a pretty easy sort of answer to this but I'm not convinced. As someone mentioned above, 80% of rapes are committed by someone known to the victim. I'm very willing to bet that a sadly large portion of those men(women of course can rape, but allow me the simplicity of such gendered language) don't believe they committed rape.

codergamergeekyguy,ruby,1390963035.0,"I wrote a blog post last year about [why I think Ruby is awesome](http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/05/05/thoughts-on-why-ruby-is-awesome.html). Those are probably the biggest, high-level reasons why Ruby is my current favorite programming language.

I used Python for a good, solid 3 years and really enjoyed it. Since switching to Ruby, I find some things about Python annoying. For instance:

* The explicit `self` parameter on methods
* Requiring `self.` on every method call
* Everything is public (Yes, I know in Ruby you can get to everything if you want, but at least the concept of privacy *exists*.)
* The horrible documentation of the standard library
* The poor organization of the standard library
* among others

I also find that, almost invariably, Ruby just requires fewer characters to convey the same ideas as in other languages. And before switching to Ruby I thought that was a stupid reason for liking a language. (Perl takes fewer characters and code there is impossible to read and understand. Ruby is much better because it was shooting for compact ... not terse.) But now I look at Java or C# and cringe. So much screen space wasted. So much time scanning so much extra text in code reviews. (Every character in the file could be a bug ... which would you rather look at or type? 500 characters or 5000 characters?)

As I said in my other comment, the thing to remember in evaluating languages is not *can* something be done ... but *how easily* can it be done. And, for myself, Python has a few more speed bumps than Ruby does. So ... until something better comes along, I'm choosing Ruby."

There's nothing ""extreme"" about what anyone here is saying. If aggression against people is wrong, then rape is wrong, assault is wrong, and theft and taxation are wrong. If any of those things are not wrong, then you aren't opposed to aggression against people. 

I don't necessarily agree. I would say, if X is wrong, then it;s wrong unless you can give a compelling reason to the contrary. 

&gt;So if a thief stabs me in the stomach and takes my wallet to do with whatever they please, they are justified as long as they leave me some change or use my money to ""help the economy""? Because the thief is A - using violence to obtain that money and B - spending a good portion of that money on horrible, violent things even if they toss me a pittance of some shitty, non-innovative product. 

The government is right in taking a portion of your money in order to provide services for you that would not be well implemented in a free market system. There's kind of a greater good involved here.

&gt;The reality that meme omits though is that the government also uses that money to violate any rights it pleases therefor nullifying any sort of invisible contract.

mfranko88,Rockband,1390963341.0,"Im glad someone took the initiative to do this. I appreciate you doing the work ahead of you! Ill have to hop on this weekend.

A few questions and comments.

1. 3 songs is probably the upper limit. 2 or 3 a week is probably good.

2. I would recommend doing only one disc song per week, to help extend how much we get out of it before having to recycle disc songs. Id fill out the other one or two songs with popular DLC and imported songs. This gives the added benefit that you can add Blitz scores to the challenges.

3. This is irrelevant now since these are all disc songs. But all future challenges will be for RB3 right? Not RB1/2/Lego? It might be fun to occasionally throw in some Beatles.

4. Does anyone know if scores are the same across systems? If I did a two identical runs on 360 and PS3, would I have two identical scores? That way people are comparing apples to apples.

4. I just realized a way to determine future song selections. IIRC, rockbandaide (or one of the other RB fan sites) has a weekly flashback/recap of dlc  songs released week over the past six years. We could use that list to ensure were constantly moving around the list."

You would think there would be a much greater public interest in the quality of new housing that is built, considering that it's where our children are going to end up living.

Cramped, ugly, expensive and poorly constructed houses are going to retard this country and it's economy. Everybody knows what a difference it makes living in nice surroundings. If you live in a nice house, you want to keep it nice, you spend money on it. You fill it with nice things. How is our economy going to thrive if the population can only consume foodstuffs because their distended stomachs are the greatest storage asset they possess! How will we encourage healthy eating and home-cooking when so many kitchens are cramped and ill-equipped? How will our children grow up to be healthy, happy adults if they have no garden to play in, or space for toys and books and friends and the prospect of an adulthood doomed to sitting in more cramped, ugly little boxes, hunched over their smart-phones feeling depressed. We have a strong, growing Western economy. We are quite capable of building architecturally attractive, spacious buildings with character and flair, habitats fit for the next generation, houses that we can be proud of as a nation. I have to avert my eyes and resist the urge to rage everytime I drive past half a dozen new build estates in the middle of fields near where I live. The sight of them makes me despair for the future.

I double checked with the bus driver before getting off at the bus stop that it was the right one, and he kept telling me yes. I get off, and I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere. The place does not look like the place I google mapped, and there is no bus stop to be found. 

That's okay, I will google it. Nope, my data maxed on the way there.

I call my friend to help me. We find out that I am indeed at the wrong place, and move onto finding my bus stop. My phone dies. My parents are probably scared shitless.

I go to a residential road to ask people where the bus stop is. No one opens. On the seventh house I try, a family helps me out. 

I get on the bus stop and make it to a mall near me. I go to the bus stop at 4:30 to go home. The bus is supposed to come at 4:45. The bus doesn't come, and I have to wait until 5:20.

When I saw him again (we used to go to the same school) I realized that definitely I made the right choice, I had no attraction to him whatsoever.

Background: Living with woman for 4+ years, she has 3 kids (all teenagers) from previous marriage, I have 1 (10 yrs old), all boys. Their dad is out of the picture except for her middle kid, my ex sees my son in the summer more or less (long distance custody, I have primary).

I treat each kid differently because they all have different needs. For instance, her oldest is in community college, he needs help with writing papers. I help him. Her youngest is all about sports, I try to help him with sports, even if it's giving him a ride to practice or a game. 

My kid is a little different. He's an aspiring computer nerd and is brilliant at math. He's also got an autism spectrum disorder (Aspergers). I try to do activities with him that he enjoys, but I also invite the other kids who always decline due to the subject matter (eg: they don't want to go see ZOMG SUPERHERO RETURNS 27 IN SPACE in Imax3d, so they don't go.

Discipline has and always will be handled by the bio parent until we get married. However, I do have talks with her kids about doing the right thing, not being douchebags, etc. Not lecture, talk.

They get mad and are disrespectful and I get a lot of it. It does get under my skin, especially when they are disrespectful to their mom.

TL;DR - It sucks, they throw the ""you're not my dad!"" crap at me. I try to treat them all differently because they have different needs, not because they are not mine. They are disrespectful asshole teenagers."

We happen to agree with the Apostle's and Nicence creeds, but that implies nothing about ""authority"" and other creeds could be written which we might consider sound.

Iwannaliveonthemoon,whowouldwin,1390964043.0,"I'm not going to argue with you there, one of the things I really don't like about Star Wars is the over the top-ness of the EU. I miss the force being something the death star paled in comparison to because it was this pervasive thing that the Jedi/Sith were essentially letting flow through them and guide them, like some real Tao te Ching type water shit, and then we got the literal translation where Palpatine could destroy a fleet with his mind, being so OP his force power was actually greater than the death star itself. But I'm ranting again.

Point being, Star Wars may be inconsistent, but hardcore fans seem to take the greatest feats as canon, and the movies are nothing but an inadequate representation of the EU, and the movie scenes are retconned at every turn. Take Boba Fett in the movies as compared to the EU. Dude got hit by a metal pole which fired his jetpack, which subsequently failed, and dumped his ass into the Sarlacc pit. In the EU he is the equivalent of space batman and his incompetent ""death"" in the movie is basically ignored as space batman would never be caught so unaware and be disabled so easily.

So if Boba becomes space batman, apply the same to the ships and tech, and you get an unbeatable Navy that other universes will never be able to beat since many other universes have a bit of restraint and don't develop their characters like animes. ie. no one in EVE can pull a 5000m long ship out of the sky using their mind."

Basically it comes down to this. There is lots of water all over the place. We have a lot of water up north, a LOT. The problem is its prohibitively expensive to get it down south. If people did it for free, we'd have tons of water.

This is the kicker. There is water everywhere, its just not naturally in places that people need it, and because its so expensive to move, people don't do it (or they don't do much of it). If money wasn't an option, shifting water from one place to another would mean that everyone could have all the water they wanted."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390964224.0,"&gt; Saying that it is based on profit doesn't actually explain why it couldn't serve everyone. 

Because it will naturally exclude those unable to pay.

&gt;Without the government providing handouts, would people starve on the streets?

Yes, I think they would.

&gt;Do you agree that everyone acts in their own self-interest? We all want to maximize our own profits, so why doesn't that extend to those who work in the government? Remember, the government is made up of people just like you and me.

I think reality is a little more nuanced. I think some are willing to work for the good of others in government. Are you familiar with the concept of servant leadership? That is my ideal for how government officials should act.

Let's face it though, private sector is largely dominated by maximizing profits though. Government and nonprofits and the like tend to have a more diverse set of goals.

&gt;Why are you assuming that the extra costs are because of the market?

Other countries have socialized systems, other countries are cheaper. High administrative costs, the fact that the system is required to serve everyone, but at the same time can only collect money from those who have it (which, btw is the logic behind the individual mandate), and the fact that its for profit are all reasons contributing to higher prices. Under a socialized system, everyone is covered, no one is excluded, there is no profit motive, and we can cut back on administrative costs. We can make things a lot simpler and produce better results.

&gt;Zoning laws and such are the results of government intervention, not the free market. ISPs chartered by the government are also not free market enterprises.

I agree, but there are other priorities at work other than the free market here.

Of course, the louder and more aggressive they are, the more likely they are to be one of the delusional ones. If you just want idle chit-chat about philosophy you can talk to most heady folks, but the chances of finding one who isn't just trying to sound cool (mostly to themselves) is the same as finding a typical intelligent person in the general population--there's just a very big chance they care about the basic nature of the human experience if you do find an intelligent druggie.

I am attracted to her and want to take her out again, so I ask her on another date. Let's say on her side of things, she just wasn't attracted to me. She gets my call or text asking her out again. Here is where the breakdown in communication usually happens in my experience. If she doesn't want to go out again she will either:

-Ignore my calls or texts thinking ""He'll get the hint""
-Say she is busy that night and offer no other night in which would work to go out, once again thinking ""He'll get the hint""
-Politely decline, saying she just isn't interested

Does getting turned down suck? Sure. No one likes having their affections rebuffed. However, I ***much prefer*** to have her politely decline, than go radio silent or some other form of ""He'll get the hint"". It's up to me to then respect her decision and move on.

First, I built a desk. It's pretty simple. It has a file cabinet supporting one side, a shelf above it, and a pullout for book work and sometimes food.

When I moved into this apartment, I learned that there was absolutely no counter space in the bathroom. So, I put in a shelf. It has a couple hooks for a hand towel and a spare roll of toilet paper. 

After that, I built a pullup bar and hangboard mount. This is for climbing training, and it is screwed into the floor joists for the balcony above mine.

Finally, there is a nice rough-hewn oak shelf in the living room to showcase some of my climbing gear, a nice print of the Appalachian Mountains, and my roommate's geology samples.

None of it really relates to my major, but I designed it all myself, and I believe some of the general engineering principles I learned gave me the confidence to execute on these designs."

It is a justification. I kind of think modern democracy is the best we can do and any attempt to change it would likely end with something worse. Doesn't mean I think that things are perfect, it's just what I think is best.

I've seen the following aplications of zoom in videogames:

1. Like BF, whole screen zooms in, but only half the screen is the scope

2. The screen changes for another screen with the zoom and this is the only zoom seen in game (think sniper rifles in halo), long story short, the whole screen is the scope

3. The game actually has a functional scope that can either be observed whether you are aiming through it or not or it can be imposible to actually see through until you aim through it, think war thunder's biplane scopes and scopes in more realistic games like *red orchestra*

Now, there are many reasons why the third most realistic option is not implemented in games, not only ""dual rendering"":

1. Believe it or not, these scopes are actually much, much harder to aim through, in the case of the ""full screen zoom""  it's easier to aim when you know that if something in your field of view goes through your scope, it will move at the same speed that it moves outside of your scope. In a realistic scope, that is not the case, if something is moving 1 pixel per second in your screen, and you got a scope with a x level of zoom, when this object goes through your scope, it will go much faster.

2. This feature may not be strictly necessary for the game and it might not be even considered important by developers because it just takes extra work, money, and time to implement and isn't even something players (especially in the kind of fps you seem to be taking into account for this survey) enjoy, but something that actually gives them a harder time aiming

3. That double rendering issue has been talked about before, it is absolutely a possibility, but this must definitely not be the only reason for this feature not to be implemented, first of all, because developers in the nineties with nineties computers could **already** do ""dual rendering"" how do you think mirrors were made in games back them? with magic?. But that's not all, mirrors and realistic scopes don't even require ""double rendering"" when you say double rendering, you're sayin the game has to be rendered twice, and that is not the case, programmers and designers found ways to do this without having to actually render the game completely two times. Things like these have been done before, the graphics nowadays make it much more difficult, but there are ways in which these features can be applied

There is a very good report/article on how ""double rendering"" and mirrors were done back in the nineties (Maybe even back to the eighties, I might have my facts a bit off) It surfaced on /r/Games last year, maybe someone in this thread still knows of it?"

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390964797.0,"&gt; As I recall, the US just signaled 20 more years in Afghanistan atop the attack on Libya and the present Africom adventures. I guess you could say they scaled down on Iraq, but I believe that was due to the fact that the Iraqi government was threatening to charge US soldiers with crimes in their court system.

Obama also ran on withdrawing troops from Iraq.

&gt;hat would you describe as the compromise on gitmo? 

Maybe they figured out the world isn;'t black and white and they really need to hold these guys and waterboard them and stuff?

&gt;would it be logical to apply the same treatment to people accused of heinous crimes in the US?

Not really, while I can see the point you're trying to raise with gitmo, they might have reasons we don't know of. I realize this is a horrible defense, and it's a reason I actually maintain being for closing it down, but honestly, at the same time, I really don't know all the facts, and I'm basically speculating that Obama might've been persuaded to keep it open.

Quite frankly, I;'m actually against this stuff considering my current knowledge level, I'm just open to evidence to convince me that it's necessary, and am speculating that perhaps that is why Obama went back on his campaign promises. I can't say for sure, I'm not in the know, but the president does know more than we do on this matter.

MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE,badhistory,1390964900.0,"It's not clear to me from your original post that the callers were comparing U.S. war crimes in Vietnam to the PRC's Great Leap Forward and Stalin's crimes as an exculpatory strategy, i.e. commies did worse stuff in the past, so the stuff we did isn't all that bad.

Of course, I didn't hear the callers, so I may be wrong.  But it seems to me that saving South Vietnam from communism is an ""ends justify means"" or ""to make an omelet, you have to crack a few eggs"" argument.  That is to say, U.S. actions were on balance excusable because the horrendous outcome of a Vietminh victory in South Vietnam was easily foreseeable from the existing track record of communist states/parties (USSR, PRC, North Korea, and the DRV / Pathet Lao).

It's not a relativist argument and it's not genocide olympics.  It's the opposite of a relativist argument—the relativist argument is that ""both sides committed atrocities, therefore the good guy isn't really good, and the bad guy isn't so bad.""  The NPR caller argument is, ""the good guys (U.S.) did war crimes, but did those war crimes in an attempt to prevent even worse atrocities.""  The atrocities aren't given a false equivalence.

Your position is much closer to the relativist argument.  You say ""atrocities are atrocities, and just because communists committed atrocities doesn't mean that the U.S. atrocities should be excused.""  That's a false equivalence between U.S. war crimes and the utterly predictable mass crimes against humanity perpetrated by the DRV—utterly predictable based on the existing track record of the DRV, Pathet Lao, DPRK, PRC, and USSR."

...and they get to that salary almost 100% from tinkering and learning on their own, with a few cheap certifications, and primarily on the job work.  

Tinkering at home separates the goods from the greats in IT.  Anyone can make good money, and it blows my mind all the time how valuable a good IT person is, and how hard they can be to find.

If you have the management skills (which are surprisingly hard to find in IT) you can make big big bucks, like over 2-300k.

If you do go into IT and want the big money, be sure to try and get enterprise level skills in networking, Microsoft Server, AD, etc. or skills in programming, to work on specialized products coding for SQL, Python, or whatever the company you want to work for uses to build their product(s)."

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1390965049.0,"I got an ingrown toenail when I was living in California. Well, a few years back when I was in Oregon it was a relatively easy fix for my other foot: doctors removed the sides of my nails, killed part of the matrix (that is what grows your nails) and I never had another ingrown toenail in that foot since. 

Well, my mother books me an appointment to see a doctor and he takes a looks and decides the best course of action is to remove the sides, but no killing the matrix. ""Oh no, I've been doing this for years!"" he said. Yeah, within a month my nail is back to the way it was and so I am taken to see yet another doctor. 

Same thing, remove parts of the nails but no killing the matrix and because I was around 13 and demanding they kill the matrix I got laughed at because I was a child, how did I know what was good for me? My mother demanded they do something and she got told to not give into my demands and she wasn't a foot doctor, what did she now? 

Well, as luck would have it: my foot became infected again. This time my father takes me to an office in Palm Springs where this fuck-twat decides he knows whats good for me. He ended up coming at me PLIERS and no numbing agents or anything, *rips off the corners of my nail.* I ended up gripping the vinyl bed cushion so hard, some of my fingers pierced through it. My father being my father didn't fight for me like my mother would have so I was let go after 5 minutes with my toe wrapped in bloody gauze. I had never felt pain like that before in my life and decided I didn't want to again. 

I ended up suffering with this worsening toenail for close to two years, telling my parents I was fine, when it wasn't. I could only wear flip flops of moccasins because they didn't hurt. 

When my family finally moved to New Hampshire the first thing my mother did was take me to a foot doctor, and when she finally saw my toe she looked shocked at terrified. She looked at it with her jaw on the floor and I remember her saying ""Oh my *GOD*!"" 

It was massively infected and she said she'd never seen or smelt anything as bad as my toe before, at least nothing that didn't have gang green. She looked it over and told me, ""It is a miracle it's not gangrenous. It does however, have a massive infection and has a ton of granuloma(?) which isn't good."" (I think it was granuloma, I remember her saying due to the inflammation and infection some of the tissue crystallized, and I won't forget her having to scrape it all out the *crunching* sound it made.) 

My mother told her how doctors in Cali refused to do anything right, and would only remove the corners of the nails. Again, she was shocked and ended up taking me in immediately to remove the nail, the crystallized tissue, and infection. 

It's been a few years now, [and my toe is now permanently disfigured](http://imgur.com/Bj6pUTQ) - But I'm thankful I am now able to walk around without pain anymore. "

Agreed, that is obscene.  There is no way that something like that is ok.

&gt; You need to have something on your resume, or do something when reaching out to the company, to make an impression. I'm sure wherever you apply gets dozens of resumes, and 99% of the same are going to look the exact same - Make yours the one that's different.

Its true you have to do something to stand out, but you often don't have to do much.  Finding experienced, qualified, and quality individuals here is usually easier said than done.  To stand out you just have to be above average.  Doing work on your own as a ""hobby"" to show off is usually enough.  And for many people it can even earn them passive income on the side, or even become a new business venture and make decent money on its own.

Beyond that, you'd be surprised how important it is to follow up on an interview.  I sometimes interview 20 people a week, and have even considered/hired second tier people simply because they bothered to follow up, informed me of updated skills on their resume that we might have been looking for, while others did not."

flashmedallion,metalgearsolid,1390965105.0,"&gt; evidenced by the Boss' betrayal in MGS3

The Boss didn't betray anybody in MGS3?

Anyway it's a nice line of thought, although I'm not quite sure we need such specific reasons why Olga was chosen to be part of the project.  As you mentioned early on - she was in the perfect situation to be manipulated due to her child.  That's kind of all there is.

&gt;both were pregnant on a battlefield and had their children taken by either the Philosophers or the Patriots

I don't see how this really ""unites"" them - it seems that using children is just par for the course for the Patriots, who probably borrowed that extremely successful tactic from the Philosophers.  Meryl being used to manipulate Campbell in MGS1 (and most likely in MGS4) is another example.

&gt;Both were born to men deeply involved in the Philosophers'/Patriots' conspiracies.

Sergei?  He was nobody - a tool at best.  He had nothing to do with the Patriots in MGS1; he was just someone Liquid had gotten in cahoots with for support.  On the tanker he was just the source of a whole bunch of bodies.  Yes, both of those things probably came from his connection with Ocelot, but this has nothing to do with being ""deeply involved"" in a conspiracy; he just happened to be ""friends"" with a Patriot agent, making him the easiest person to use.

In terms of her formal ""role"" as the Ninja, it makes more sense that she was some random who meant nothing to Raiden.  In MGS1, the Ninja was a trusted friend and former ally of Snake with some deeply meaningful shared history, and if MGS1 wasn't so naturalistic the Ninja would have literally been a ghost, from Snakes past.  MGS2 is all about the deconstruction of forcing someone to play as Snake.  What is supposed to be a formal recollection of Frank Jaeger turns out to be utterly hollow on examination - a woman instead of a man; a bearer of life fighting for her family instead of a murderer of a family fighting out of guilt; someone completely incidental to Raidens life instead of a ghost from his past.

So... yeah.  I don't think Olga is particularly special, she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and happened to be useful.

Also, make sure you're drinking enough water. I know that when I'm getting dehydrated, one of the very first symptoms is that my lips start to get all shitty.

Perhaps you could begin your forays into lip color with something easy and balm-y, like Clinique Chubby Sticks or the like. The Chubby Stick Intense ones have pretty good color payoff, and application is super easy, so you don't have to be a lip color expert to handle them. Then, once you've got your lip care routine down enough that you've got those looking good most of the time, you can move on to traditional lipsticks, lip pencils, or whatever.

teehawk,AskWomen,1390965165.0,"I can only speak for myself, I'm in my mid-20's and I don't think I've ever blamed a girl if she rejects me. If anything I internalize it with thoughts that usually boil down to ""I'm not attractive enough"". I mean I am an intelligent, moderately attractive guy, with good social skills, and I get (in my head) that you don't really control who you're attracted to, but rejection still sucks. 

One thing that I *really* don't understand is how two people can share an experience, and then walk away having experienced two totally different things. Like I will be out on a date and think ""Wow, we are really clicking! This chemistry is palpable"" but then turns out she didn't feel anything like that. Totally blows my mind that can even happen."

Today you might be head over heels for her and in a year you might not want to be around her anymore.

He ended up passing out, obviously preventing him from using the brakes. The end of track in Calgary is longer than the final stretch in the video, and bobsleds never made it to the end, so people stood on the track for whatever reason. Well, without brakes, they were hauling ass down through the braking area. My buddy tried to bleed off speed by slamming the sled back and forth against the walls, but it didn't help much. An Olympic hopeful was unable to get out of the way, and they hit her. My buddy said he managed to yell at everyone to duck, for fear of getting their heads knocked off. She went flipping, and they kept going, eventually leaving the track and stopping on concrete. That's when their brake man finally woke up. "

Bombkirby,wow,1390965209.0,By definition... play to win means that the only way to access the strongest character/gear/weapon/armor/gun/etc is by paying. Pay to win. Paying to speed the process of a game up isn't Pay to Win. For example: League of Legends allows you to level up super fast if you pay real money and unlock all the characters you want instantly if you pay... but you don't have to pay to level up or unlock characters... paying just gets it over with faster. Another (negative though) example: There's a shooter that I will leave unnamed that sells weapons/clothing that powers your character up beyond the normal strength of a player. Only way to access those weapons and etc is to buy them for a heap of real money! If you pay you will be the strongest person in every match you play essentially.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390965257.0,"&gt; Right, which means that must redefine X. You didn't actually disagree with what I said. Aggression is either wrong or it's not wrong, it cannot be wrong sometimes just as gravity does not only work on some things but not others. 

This is where we disagree. I'm saying that morality is not universal, but situational. That's the answer to the next section of your answer too. Different situations. Different reasoning involved, different results. I believe theft is GENERALLY wrong, but I also believe that it is right for the government to coerce people based on their ability to pay to provide funds for services. We tried having a government that was weak and ineffective and didn't have the power to tax. It was called the articles of confederation and we got rid of it because it was weak and ineffective. We couldn't defend ourselves properly, for instance.

&gt;A thief will contribute to the economy with money that I may have simply hoarded in my greedy capitalist bitcoin wallet. Is that okay with you?

While utilitarian, I don't believe people have the power to act on their own. The government is created to act on the peoples' behalf. This is why we have a criminal justice system too. Instead of avenging yourself, the government is your advocate and does it for you when you are wronged. It's meant to make society less violent overall, and provide consistent rules for PEOPLE to follow. This is not to say that government can't claim an exemption in the name of this greater good. 

&gt;Well maintaining the state will, by definition, continue this problem. So again, you are either okay with this and thereby accept that the government has no actual legitimate claim to any fictitious ""social contract"" or you have an alternate plan to propose. 

Actually I'm just gonna reject your framing. Look. We have a government based on separation of powers, that LARGELY recognizes rights. If we get rid of this government, some dude can just rise up, a warlord, a corporation, a mafia, etc. and impose an even more tyrannical rule. Just because the government is a problem doesn't mean that getting rid of it is actually a solution. "

pack your lunch the night before 

pack breakfast the night before (toaster strudel anyone?) and eat it when you get to work (unless you commute by train, in which case - yay noms! but otherwise if you're driving: eek, crash).

play around with square-brushes as opposed to round for blowdrying. They grab hair more firmly so you might be able to get the same or similar shape you want without spending time with a straightener

Fuck the rest of the hair. Blowdrying the front part of my hair takes 5 minutes as opposed to 20 for my whole head. Sure, it doesn't look as good as it COULD but it still looks damn fine.

Now that I read your post again, what's most obvious in terms of saving time is... leaving on time. You're leaving 15 minutes early right now! That's like, a WHOLE DREAM about John Gallagher where you guys get married and have babies and you win an emmy for being awesome.

Another thing that helps me with the shower is actually having a clock where I can see it. I find that my mind wanders in the shower and I end up spending time day dreaming or stressing about work when I should actually be hurrying the fuck up. Keeping an analog clock in sight really helps me stay on track.

Anyway, good luck with the new job. I'm sure once you've settled into it some more your routine will become more manageable.

Mankind. That that word should have new meaning for all of us today.

We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps its fate that today is the 4th of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from annihilation.

We're fighting for our right to live, to exist.

And should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one voice:

""We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight!

We're going to live on! We're going to survive!""

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390965551.0,"&gt; That's incorrect as ""job creation"" actually increased. The reason the ""labor pool"" shrunk is that... and you may want to sit down for this... there was a large sum of people who were collecting unemployment welfare who weren't actually looking for jobs but were counted as such because they were collecting this money. Once the free money stopped, what a coincidence! Less people ""in the labor market"" suddenly! Even Krugman acknowledged this occurrence. 

Doesn't mean they weren't looking. Don't generalized. it took my dad, for example, an entire year to find a new job. I've been looking for even longer honestly. 

&gt;Aside from that your assertion was that people would be in trouble without these handouts... So where's this valued data on the millions of people who lost unemployment welfare and are now in trouble? It seems that you only claim to value data and utilitarian arguments when it suits your narrative. 

It just happened a couple weeks ago, give it time to come out.

&gt;You've been collecting unemployment welfare for three years? And why are you now making individualist emotional appeals when you've previously stated that what matters to you is empiricism and utilitarianism?

No, we collected for ONE year and my dad's been at his current job for almost two years. But we needed it then.

RichardBehiel,worldnews,1390965585.0,"&gt; Doesn´t the extra mass becomes irrelevant in space?

Good question.  Mass is actually one of the most important things to take into consideration when talking about space travel.  Delta-v, or change in velocity, depends on the mass of the spacecraft, since momentum is mass times velocity.  

Mass is irrelevant for gravity assists though, if we're just talking about delta-v.  You can get more kinetic energy from a gravity assist if your spacecraft is big, but your net change in velocity for any given trajectory will be the same.  This is because with gravitational force depends on mass, as does acceleration, so mass cancels out of the equation."

However most of the rewards are just outdated now (Wintergrasp's gear is for 80s not 90s) and there's no reason to go back to those zones for most level 90s so they're empty most of the time aside from a few questers and people trying to get easy marks so they can buy the mounts and looms.

MoP didn't have a zone like those because they tried promoting open world PvP instead of single zones with PvP for 15 minutes every couple of hours, but if you stick around you can see what its like to have a PvP zone like that in WoD. They're kind of just like battlegrounds really but with a simple/fun raid afterwards. It can be an especially good time if you like PvP and PvE."

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390965663.0,"&gt;What if the Reconstructionist performing the conversion does not see a need to uphold the old rituals?

Then their conversion is invalid according to Conservative Judaism. Conservative Judaism is based on halakah. Halakah is very clear on what is required to convert: study, beit din, mikvah, brit milah/hatafat dam brit. 

That is why, in our eyes, a good chunk of older Reform conversions (back in the 50s-70s more or less) are invalid: the Reform movement at the time overwhelmingly rejected ritual. Most modern Reform conversions do meet the requirements though, as the movement has returned to adopting ritual. I know the Reform rabbis I worked with when first starting even encouraged us to do all the rituals so that we would be accepted in Conservative circles even if we didn't find them meaningful ourselves.

&gt;If that wouldn't be OK, how is that Conservative opinion any different than an Orthodox rejection of a Conservative conversion?

Because we don't say ""All Reform and all Reconstructionist are invalid conversions in our eyes by virtue of being done in Reform/Reconstructionist communities."" We say that if the required rituals have been carried out in their communities, that they are converts in our eyes as well.  It doesn't matter if the period of study was according to Reform or Reconstructionist theology to us, doesn't matter if the composition of the beit din are Reform/Reconstructionist, etc. 

Orthodox says to us, and everyone else, ""if it's not our beit din, it's not valid."""

I always wanted to be his friend, and I kept thinking that if we ever had the chance to have a conversation, he'd love me!  Never happened though, I barely talked to anyone, even when they spoke to me, out of social anxiety.  Anyway.

Like I said, he was smart...so he went to the best, specialized public school in the city, which you have to test really high to get in to.  Last I heard, he spent his first year of high school hanging out in the cafeteria instead of attending class, and then dropped out.  I have no idea what happened to him, and can't even find ANY information about him on the internet.  It's weird.

EDIT: I think I found him and he's a martial arts instructor."

I don't think it was innocent and that he was just being stupid trying to get his niece to laugh - watch how he starts slowly licking it, watching the girl squirm, pulling more and more of it into his mouth as she tells him to stop. after he eats it, and his mom scolds him, he laughs at her *pretending* to be joking, then at 1:40 or so, his face changes as he looks at the girl, saying nothing, his dead eyes shifting around the room. that's one fucked up guy "

By destabilizing the state, you'd just have someone else exerting violence.

It may well have just been an unformed element in the sprawling expanse of material that the author draws from in constructing a particular work.

It's then pretty logical that, if he continues on to express his same ideas consistently and truthfully then there should be some coherence between the formal elements of subsequent works.  That's my reading on the thorny problem of ""intention"" in art.

Which isn't to say I agree with all this Olga/The Boss stuff, it's more that I think when you are dealing with a prolific artist, the idea that ""no ideas existed before they were created"" isn't necessarily true, or useful."

I'm getting sick of repeating myself so I'm going to put it out straight. I am not arguing that black people's race influences their work or that they consume similar media. What I am trying to say is that I don't feel it is all that different to American culture in general.

What I was eventually going to get to was that furthermore I think the concept of ""black culture"" is toxic insofar as it encourages a segregated view of society and also emphasizes the misconception that Africa is not many different peoples but one single monolithic nation.

""Black culture"" as a concept seems only to exist to ignorant racists and SJWs who seem intent on whitewashing (blackwashing?) minorities into something they aren't. Minorities are people, not unattainable medalists of the Oppression Olympics.

Flightless_Kiwi,gaybros,1390965823.0,"I lost like 70/80 pounds and have kept it off for ~2.5 years, so I feel pretty confident pontificating on this subject. 

Main points:

1) Vegetables.

2) That's the whole list.

Not potatoes and corn and this, green things. Broccoli, spinach. Brussel sprouts. Khale. These sorts of things should be the bulk of most meals, not just a side. It's okay to cook these in fats, like butter or olive oil. In fact it's preferable, because otherwise they will be a pain to east instead of a pleasure and not enjoying what you eat is a terrible thing, and furthermore it makes you more likely to give up and resort to junk food.

Personally I lost the bulk of it on a low-carb diet. (see /r/keto and /r/ketorecipes.) The basic gist of it for me was that most carbs are not very satiating and they gave me cravings. If I was eating bread or cereal or pretty much any processed grains I could scarf down three times the calories of a healthy meal and barely even feel full. On the other hand, a meal consisting fat, protein and fiber (green vegetables) was satisfying and reasonable number of calories.

The kinds of things I ate:

Usually eggs for breakfast, generally with tomatoes or other vegetables, and sometimes meat.

Lunch and dinner was often salad. Big salads, with meat and cheese and sunflower seeds and Caesar dressing. I went through spinach like nobodies business. The other thing I ate practically everyday was stir-fry. Broccoli, sausage or some other meat, some onions and garlic, sometimes mushrooms, often peppers, adobo, and sometimes I'd add some salsa. 

Also chicken. Oil, garlic, adobo, and bake it, that's pretty much all you need. You can give pork chops the same treatment."

cmagnificent,PoliticalDiscussion,1390966157.0,"&gt;The beneficiaries of the savings involved

So you missed the part where your proposal would *cost more* than the damages you cited by just leaving the illegal immigrants be? Who are these beneficiaries and where are the savings coming from? If the cost to us for having the illegal immigrants is $113 million and the cost we've worked out, that you edited into your post is $1.25 billion, we're not saving money and there are no beneficiaries.

Secondly state and federal law enforcement resources are stretched far enough as it is, and offering this training and time takes resources away from things that actually matter, as I already stated.

&gt;If they are caught between jobs... they get a chance to get documented and go on their way

How are they supposed to prove that they're between jobs? Did you miss the part where we're talking about undocumented workers, it's not like they're going to be walking around with a copy of their W2. So either everyone these rednecks find gets deported (regardless of whether or not they're a contributor) or your proposal is completely unenforceable because anyone who is stopped (again, regardless of whether or not they're a contributor) can just say 'well I'm between things right now, but there's a farm up in Oregon I'm heading to soon'.


Regarding background checks -
&gt;If it comes from the US or elsewhere it would be valid.

That is a massive drain on law enforcement resources. Furthermore you still seem to be missing the point that if they were arrested in the US previously *they would have been deported as an undocumented individual then* it is impossible for any of them to have a criminal record from the US. 

Also do you have any idea how big of a pain in the ass it would be to request a background check from their country of origin for *every* immigrant that's stopped?

 - One, every single country would have to agree to share that information with local US law enforcement which there is no guarantee of (I can even think of several that would flatly refuse).

 - Two, not every area of every country is as good about keeping criminal records as you seem to think they are, especially poorer areas with higher levels of political corruption *which is where more illegal immigrants are likely to come from*.

 - Three, what about the undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as children? There's a good chance their country of origin doesn't even know they exist, much less would have any detailed information them.

&gt;If you think it would be waste of time and resources to discover who is a criminal and who isn't then you support criminal activity.

The problem is that what you're proposing *would in no way, not even the teeniest tiniest bit tell us who is a criminal and who isn't*. What you're proposing is about as efficacious as ejaculating into space. It would accomplish nothing and mean nothing.

&gt;...would include certain community service education that would help them identify those here illegally.

How would they do that without racial bias? Without taking race into account how could they possibly tell if someone looks like an illegal immigrant?

Also community service education just *works so well*. It's not like when New York City instituted 'stop and frisk' policies that included a community service education component blacks were stopped five times as often as whites or anything.

Except that's exactly what did happen, because racism is a real thing, and while I'm delighted that you live in this bubble where you can solve racism with a couple of classes, but for all of us here in the real world that sounds fucking ridiculous."

1wiseguy,space,1390966251.0,"This is what you would call a ""fringe"" idea. Kind of like a ""crazy"" idea. I'm not saying the guys are literally crazy, but it's a theoretical plan that isn't supported by the scientific community. The fact that the study ended in 1978 and hasn't been pursued since tells a lot.

For example, it uses helium-3 for fuel, mined from Jupiter using robotic factories. That's also a crazy idea, and it's never going to happen. There aren't any robotic factories, and nobody is going to spend a trillion dollars sending such a mission to Jupiter.

The vehicle described absolutely can't carry humans, because it travels at high speed, and never stops. Mankind is not going to be excited about spending a fortune on an unmanned space mission that may or may not return any results.

Perhaps we will send humans to Mars someday, but exhausting the world's science budget forever to pursue this questionable mission seems very unlikely.

By the way, I see no reason you couldn't have politely answered my request to calculate the kinetic energy in that vehicle. However, I don't see the point, since nobody really knows how much energy a helium-3 engine can produce."

Homer_Simpson_,AskWomen,1390966331.0,"Korean culture is sort of the opposite.

There's an old idiom which translates roughly into, ""he wore his high boots today"". After adults dine in Korea, one person will usually grab and pay for the entire check. Unlike the aforementioned Chinese culture, the Korean culture loosely dictates that whoever has the most money should pay. The people with less money will hover around, willing to split the check evenly, but in reality, they're just hoping their rich friend will foot the bill.

The idiom stems from the fact that many Korean restaurants requires patrons to take their shoes off upon entering. If I wear my high boots to a restaurant, hopefully the check will be dealt with while I take extra long to lace my boots. In laymen's terms, I'm a cheap bastard and I'm going to mess around with my shoes until I see someone's paid the check."

No, it really doesn't. The economy is pretty awful.

&gt;It happened July 1, 2013. That's ample time for the millions of people who lost their needed welfare to die of starvation. 

I thought we were talking about the extensions that ended January 1st?

&gt;Then you're making an anecdotal argument for ""needing"" it for one year. The goal posts are moving rapidly here. 

Fair enough. But I do think it's also a valid anecdote given the discussion.

&gt;Your assertion was not that it's ""financially harmful"". Your assertion was that people ""need"" this money yet you have no data to verify that anyone needs it. So again, you've moved away from your initial claim to value empiricism and utilitarian outcomes and are now making emotional appeals and anecdotal evidence. 

What do you think happens? I get the impression people lose their house, end up on welfare, and eventually end up homeless as that runs out. 

Also, I just looked stuff up on this, but when people run out of welfare:

http://thebillfold.com/2012/04/things-people-do-when-they-actually-have-no-money-moms-kicked-off-of-welfare-edition

There's some stories. I find the ""robs wetbacks"" story particularly troublesome, which kind of gets to a point of why you, as an upstanding citizen, should probably be interested in making sure people have enough. If people dont have enough, they can resort to crime to meet their basic needs where they otherwise wouldn't. And if they  get caught, they end up in jail.

He's probably one of those people. I didn't read up on half the bosses in SoO and I never died on any of them unless it was just a wipe. They're all pretty straightforward if you've raided before. Step out of this, stack together when ya need to, kite those mobs, run when you get chased by the boss, dispel the debuff, kill the adds, yada yada blah blah. 

Even the ones I read up on didn't really help me much since some mechanics were ignored or just not in the LFR fights. Even if you do read up, it doesn't guarantee everyone has. Plus the leaders just yelled at everyone who didn't read up on the fights half the time and gave really awful directions. Example: The leader last time I did LFR marked himself with Square on that Devilsaur boss. He also marked a spot on the floor with Square. In the middle of the raid he starts raging and telling everyone ""OMG GET ON SQUARE, ITS SO EASY YOU IDIOTS!!!"" I reminded him that he had several square markings up at the same time so of course he's confusing people! Sure half the raid was ""lazy"" and ""stupid"" for not reading up and standing in horrible spots, but the angry raid leaders giving equally horrid directions weren't helping."

AshleyYakeley,PurplePillDebate,1390966497.0,"&gt; I am saying that calling it ""SMV"" or ""attractive"" do an equal job of implying this.

*Implying,* consequentially, yes.

&gt; Being attractive means that your chances of hooking up with any given person is greater than the chance a less attractive person has of hooking up with any given person.

Yes.

&gt; The fact that this, in turn, means that people who are themselves more attractive are now more available to you is a consequence of the fact that all manner of people are more available to you when you are more attractive than are available to you when you are less attractive.

Yes.

&gt; That is the meaning of the word.

No. It's a *consequence* of being attractive. It's not the *definition* of attractive. Being attractive has a number of consequences; in the context of dating, this is one of them. ""SMV"" helps to focus on that particular consequence."

cmagnificent,PoliticalDiscussion,1390966670.0,"No I'm not. I'm telling you what your proposal would look in the real world and not in magical _Katsu_land where dogs talk and birds have human pets.

Who do you think would sign up to become these bounty hunters. Honest, thoughtful and concerned members of the community? No, because chances are they already have jobs and better shit to do with their time than round up illegal immigrants already. You're going to get people that have a personal vendetta against brown people signing which will lead to horrible abuses.

You appear to be consistently missing a lot of my points so let me just clarify and summarize.

- It is either wildly discriminatory (everyone gets deported) or completely unenforceable ('oh I'm just in between things').

- It makes no economic sense. Your proposal costs *way* more than just leaving the immigrants be and considering your entire point about why we need to get rid of them is that they cost too much in our society, this solution is even more ludicrous.

- It promotes racial profiling and discrimination.

- No legislative body would even consider passing it.

- It would do almost nothing to actually stop illegal immigrants. Except for maybe fear that we just gave all our rednecks free reign to hunt brown people (which is still not okay).

- *No legislative body would ever pass this; It wouldn't even make it out of committee.* Fuck, there's a good chance the committee wouldn't even hear it."

duckface08,nursing,1390966961.0,"Just keep in mind that, as a student, you are going to have very little influence or pull, especially since you are only there for a short time. Right now, you are seeing things as they should be according to your text books. The nurses you are talking to are working according to reality. Perhaps they have already tried many times to help the patient reposition but without success, and they have now given up and are turning to issues they *can* fix. With so many residents and a limited amount of time, they probably have to choose their battles.

At the nursing school I went to, in our final two semesters, we had to come up with some sort of initiative in our placements and present it to the staff. I remember fishing for ideas at one placement and a couple of the nurses who had graduated recently at the time said, ""I had to do a project like that, too. Nothing came out of it."" Mine, too, fell through completely. I didn't get any rude responses, but the general consensus was, ""There's just not enough time or resources for that."" I tried to tell them, ""But once you get used to it, it's easy and quick!"" Oh, how wrong I was. Now that I've worked for a few years as an RN, I know how insane the workload can be and you barely have time to think, eat, pee...the list goes on. I look back at my student self and think, ""How naive I was!""

It's great that you're trying to advocate for a patient, but keep in mind that there's only so much you can do, especially if the resident in question is the one refusing the interventions. Stamping your feet and badgering the nurses about it won't really earn you any sympathy. Think about it. If you had 10 years of nursing experience and some person with zero nursing experience comes along and tells you how to do your job, how would you react?"

ElQuietOne,personalfinance,1390967043.0,"He's right that it's because of progressive tax rates, but didn't really explain why that's so.

You state that each of you earn about 45K yearly (90K combined), and filled out your W-4's withholding at the single's rate. This means that tax was withheld with the assumption that you would be in the 25% bracket.

However, your combined income for the partial year has only put you at 48k total. Based on this, you ended up in the 15% Married filing jointly bracket. So basically, you withheld taxes at a much high rate than needed since your income put you in a lower tax bracket.

Next year, with a complete year of income, you will likely see a much smaller return.

Edit: Withholding is done at a constant rate based on your yearly income, otherwise you would end up with less take home pay on the check that tipped you into the next bracket, which would suck."

That said, Kobe's career FTr is .389 to Durant's .437, but Kobe's dropped significantly when he got old.  From 2003-2009 he was higher than Durant's career average excepting on season.  After he stepped back and started relying more on his midrange and postup games he started(duh) drawing fewer fouls and getting fewer free throws.

If you give me exact games I can calculate FTr's, but I'm not sure what stretch of Kobe's we're talking about.

Edit:

These are apparently full seasons, Kobe 2005-2006, and Durant 2013-2014 so far.

The difference in Kobe's .491 and Durant's .509 is negligible, but Durant is technically higher.  Doesn't excuse the vast gap in efficiency though."

Quick gist of the top of his wiki page: Five-star general, ended the Korean War pretty quickly into office, tried not to get too carried away with funding non-stategic nuclear armaments (probably influenced his famous warnings of the ""Military-Industrial Complex"") but did alright dealing with the Cold War business (U-2 incident was what it was), apparently opposed McCarthyism, enforced desegregation and backed up civil rights like a total badass, and led to the founding of the U.S. highway system, DARPA, NASA (Reddit **loves** NASA), and more.

Not saying he was the only genius in the room, and certainly not without faults or ""just influenced by the times,"" but as far as American role models go he's a good study. And it's readily apparent that he's close enough to us (even in time alone) to see that the impact his programs have had are very relevant and useful to us today."

The Oxford English Dictionary's etymology of ""human"" [link, if your library subscribes](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/89262?redirectedFrom=human#eid):

""Etymology:  &lt; Anglo-Norman humeigne (feminine), humane (feminine), Anglo-Norman and Middle French humain, humayn (French humain ) of or belonging to people (as opposed either to animals or to God) (1119 in Anglo-Norman), having human nature or characteristics (c1170), composed of people (c1174), benevolent (c1175), having people (as opposed to God) as its subject (1552 in letres humaines : compare humane letters n. at humane adj. Special uses) and its etymon classical Latin hūmānus of or belonging to people (as opposed either to animals or to divine beings), characteristic of people, civilized, cultured, cultivated, kindly, considerate, merciful, indulgent &lt; the same base as homin- , homō homo n.1 + -ānus -an suffix, although the origin of the vocalism is unclear. Compare Old Occitan uman , Catalan humà (14th cent.), Spanish humano (c1200), Portuguese humano (13th cent.), Italian umano (13th cent.). With use as noun compare classical Latin hūmānus human being, hūmānum that which is human (uses as noun of masculine and neuter respectively of hūmānus , adjective), French humain human being (1340 in Middle French, usually in plural), human nature (a1630)."" 

Oxford English Dictionary's etymology of ""man"" [link](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/113198?isAdvanced=false&amp;result=1&amp;rskey=RQNAKM&amp;):

""Etymology:  Cognate with Old Frisian man, mon, Middle Dutch man (plural manne, man; Dutch man (plural mannen, rarely mans)), Old Saxon man (plural man; Middle Low German man (plural man, manne, men, menne, mans, mannes, mennes, mannen, mennen, manner, menner), Low German Mann (plural Manns, Männer)), Old High German man (plural man; Middle High German man (plural man), German Mann (plural Männer)), Old Icelandic maðr (stem mann-, plural menn; Icelandic maður), Faroese maður, Norwegian mann (plural menn, (Nynorsk) menner), Swedish man (plural män), Danish mand (plural mænd), Gothic manna (genitive singular mans, plural mans, mannans); further etymology uncertain. The forms in the various Germanic languages belong to two different types of stem: one is a consonant-stem, giving Old English mann (genitive mannes, dative menn, plural menn, genitive manna, dative mannum; some of these Old English forms have been re-formed after the a-declension) and the other an n-stem, giving Old English manna, the only attested oblique form of which is mannan, found almost exclusively as accusative singular. Old English menn (plural and dative singular) has the umlaut which regularly arose from an original -i in the nominative plural and dative singular of Germanic consonant-stem nouns.""

Completely different paths, and they end up with the same three letters positioned so that it looks like the same morpheme!  I love how bizarre the English language is!"

I didn't dodge the question. you already know the answer to it because I gave you the information. Percentage changes in Economics are usually very low. From year-to-year inflation (in the US) is about 2-3%. So any estimates you want to make about real wages using this formula are perfectly acceptable. 

The title of your post literally says ""Subtracting percentages, is this right?"" With no other explanation as to other applications, anyone reading it would have to assume it's economic ones.

ProffieThrowaway,AdviceAnimals,1390967260.0,"The reason people claim that critical thinking is required in English moreso than other subjects is that most english teachers haven't bowed to administrative pressure to teach 100 students at once and only give multiple choice exams (I had some good 200-400 level math courses in college, for example, where I had to actually do the math, but my freshman level courses with thousands of students were all multiple choice). Some literature classes are going that way, but for the most part writing courses must be small enough for teachers to adequately grade long writing assignments and assess students' research skills. 

And then, god help us, there are majors that should be taught at a level requiring lots of higher level thinking skills (see: Business) but often aren't. I teach Business Writing and I have a lot of whiny business majors who inform me that their professors in the business department don't make them think or make realistic predictions in their business reports. I am the devil for doing so. I really don't care, I don't let them just make up stuff.

Breklinho,MLS,1390967391.0,"&gt;Soccer favors short players

Not really. Most keepers are 6'3 minimum, almost no center backs are shorter than 6'1 and most top strikers are between 5'11 and 6'2; some short players are *very* good at using their size to be quicker, more agile and more balanced than taller players, but really height is a non-factor in an athletic person finding a role in soccer. If anything being short restricts a players options on the field, someone of Ribery or Messi's size would never make it as a number nine, keeper, or center back, while someone 6'0 can play keeper (Casillas), center back (Silva), fullback (Maldini), defensive midfield (Busquets), central midfield (Schweinsteiger), attacking midfield (Kaka) out wide (Ronaldo) or as a center forward (Torres).

If anything being short limits the ability of a player to occupy a given position, meaning that if a 5'9 guy and a 6'1 guy are competing for a centerback position, and they are indistinguishable technically and mentally, the taller player is going to have an advantage."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390967682.0,"&gt; Then there's no such thing as morality. 

Objectively speaking, no there is not. Forming communities was originally an evolutionary survival strategy more than anything, and rules were made to enhance survival. There's no grand unifying theory of morality, on a cosmic level, seeing how im an atheist, nihilism sounds about right. Morality is what we make it. I just think the common thread in all moralities is they're intended to improve our lives.

&gt;If you hold this ""belief"" then surely you can provide a logical basis for why theft is okay if ""the government"" does it but not okay if an average person does it. I've provided you with a scenario to address twice and you've avoided it to simply continue repeating your opinion. Were trying to help you understand your own opinions here but you refuse.

I understand my own opinions. The inconsistency may not be logical, it's pragmatic. It's a form of ""if we don't do this, people would be worse off.""

&gt;Cool theory so can I go smoke a joint now or...? Oh shit, they'll still take my money and put me in a cage for doing things they don't like, don't they? So much for that theory!

To be fair, I'm for legalization, especially since marijuana was originally made illegal under false pretenses...

&gt;That didn't actually address anything I said and you're very cognitively impaired if after all the discussion you've had here that you still believe that our goal is to just get rid of he government. I'm starting to think that you're actually just a troll. 

Oh, I know you seek to replace it with free markets and communities and rights enforcement agencies, I just don't think that picturesque view will pan out in reality.

&gt;If you're not a troll and you're mind is just complete mush from years of pro-authority indoctrination from public school and /r/politics and politician rhetoric and HuffingtonPost articles I want to pay close attention to this next statement:

Actually I have a bachelors in political science and criminology, and a master's in liberal arts. I wouldn't say I'm indoctrinated at this point, as I have MANY unconventional opinions.

&gt;""Libertarians just want to get rid of the government"" is false. It's a straw man made up by authoritarians to keep people obedient to them and afraid of liberty and choice. Not a single person in this sub thinks that removing the federal government is a utopian solution. If you learn one thing from this ""AMA"" learn that. 

As I said, I'm aware of all of your proposed solutions like rights enforcement agencies and small communes and stuff, I just am highly skeptical of them because I recognize dozens of things that could possibly go wrong with them where they end up way worse than what you got rid of. The thing is, you don't seem to understand that the problems with government are based in human nature, and by getting rid of the government, you don't address the root of the problem."

MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE,badhistory,1390967767.0,"&gt; atrocities committed by communists aren't related to the discussion at all.

Yes they are.  If you undertake a morally objectionable action in order to head off an even more morally objectionable outcome, your decision relates your action to the perceived consequences of inaction/alternative action.  The United States undertook action, which included knowingly committing war crimes, because of the perceived consequences (mass atrocities) of inaction/alternative action, consequences they perceived to exist because of the prior track record of the DRV, Pathet Lao, DPRK, PRC, and USSR.

This does not cleanse the U.S. of having knowingly committed a grievous moral wrong.  But it is also not correct to say that U.S. war crimes are unrelated to prior communist atrocities or to anticipation of future communist atrocities.  The NPR callers seem to be making an ""ethic of consequences"" argument, similar to the argument made by people considering the Trolley Problem, wherein 90% of respondents (and 68% of philosophers) justify committing one evil in order to prevent a greater evil.

Your position creates a false equivalence between atrocities by refusing to distinguish between them.  Someone with a deontological ethical standard refuses to commit morally repugnant acts without regard to the consequences: ""Let justice be done though the heavens fall!""  Consider a person harboring escaped slaves as part of the Underground Railroad.  When questioned by police, they might freely admit that they are harboring slaves if they were to follow a deontological ethical standard, because telling a lie is morally wrong regardless of the consequences.  Your NPR callers would seem to be happy to tell a lie in order to attempt to conceal the runaway slaves, because it would be a greater moral wrong to give them up (and they would argue that telling a lie was justified even if lies are immoral).  The NPR callers are capable of differentiating between different evils and understand that their actions have consequences.  Your position creates an equivalence between the moral wrong of telling a lie and the moral wrong of betraying the runaway slaves.

The NPR callers are not making an argument to exculpate the U.S. on the basis of *comparison* but on the basis of *consequences*."

equiraptor,Cumberbitches,1390967791.0,"I have [a pair of Dainese boots](http://www.dainese.com/us_en/motorbike/st-grace-lady-d-wp.html?gender=1&amp;cat=26&amp;cat=125) that have a lot of the protection and performance features of the racing boots, but don't look nearly as ridiculous. They have ankle armor, shin armor, strong toes, small enough toes to work with my SV's shifter without concern, good bend and movement, etc. And they look, well, sane. The downside is they're expensive. 

Something no one had told me about... The soles of these boots are grippy. And... Well... I race cars. I am familiar with a number of grip levels from tires, from ""normal"" street tires to high performance to ""race"" compound treaded tires to slicks. The soles of these boots feel and grip like race compound tires, except at ambient temperatures (rather than needing to be up to racing temperature). I can't flat-foot the SV with both feet simultaneously, so the added grip from the boots, particularly in the wet, is a huge advantage for low speed maneuvering, particularly if I need to back up.

They've been through a crash with me, too. A car cut me off, and so short I couldn't dodge them. I slumped into the side of the car, and the car went over my bike's tank. The boots took no damage, and neither did my feet or legs. When I bought the boots 3 years ago, I spent more than I was expecting to. I hadn't really put a cap on my gear budget, because it's so critical to safety, but I had found ""expected"" spending amounts for the gear. These boots were over that amount. And I'm extremely glad I chose them."

Also, cosmetics now will often have a little emblem ([like this](http://imgur.com/c3d20fJ)) which will tell you a general guideline about how long it will be good for.

But here are a few general tips:

* Be more worried about liquids/creams/gels than powders or pencils. Bacteria loves to collect in them, and it's a great environment for them to grow. 

* Along that vein, mascara and liquid eyeliner are particularly problematic, since your eyes are so sensitive to bacteria and such. Definitely try to avoid sharing these products with others, too.

* Clean your makeup brushes or applicators regularly. This will help stop the spread of bacteria from your face to the products and back.

* Regardless of timelines, if it starts to look or smell or taste or feel different or bad, chuck it. And if it starts to do so far earlier than it should have (like very shortly after you bought it), return it or let the company know."

WeaponsGradeHumanity,WorldofTanks,1390968032.0,"&gt;Half of what you listed was covered by ""Find a high priority target that can be hit.""  

You could think of it like that but that just means the difference between a good player and a bad player is whether he's aware of all those things I listed.  Some of them might not be 'issues' but they're still things that need to be accounted for.  

Personally I have fun playing arty but I understand why playing against arty isn't fun.  There's a big gap between the counter-play and the pay-off.  When you're in a heavy tank, for instance, you might counter enemy heavies by angling your armour and you'll be rewarded right away by the bounce when they fire at you.  For arty, you have to take all kinds of precautions to avoid being shot but you'll hardly ever get any satisfaction out of it.  
It seems to me that a lot of the complaining about arty would disappear if they simply put in some voice messages for when people avoided or survived a shell.  Things like ""Looks like arty missed us completely!"" for a near miss would help drivers compare the number of times they get hit to the number of times they avoided being hit and help to counter that confirmation bias.  
While I like how arty plays right now, I'm not philosophically against a rework except that I can't think of a way to do that which would solve the problem.  "

If you want to be friendly then just suck it up and say you're sorry. Tell them that you didn't mean to offend them and if it happens again tell them that they are free to stop you so that it doesn't happen again/so you can work on it.

He's been a minus defender most of his career(According to every non-eyetest metric), his offense is enough to get him into the hall of fame alone, but in comparison to the people he's being put up against -- the top 20 or so players in the history of the NBA, he's either wildly inefficient or significantly less versatile because he's never been a great distributor like the guys he's up against.

Here's the most damning thing he's up against outside of his longevity:

His best season by WS/48 was 2005-2006.  In it, he finished at .224 WS/48 minutes.  That totals out to the 198th best season from that metric either.

Further, if you reduce it to unique seasons, he still finishes 64th.  In other words, there are 63 players with better seasons than Kobe's best.

So then what makes his longevity that good?  His age 34 season was one of the 5 best age 34 seasons ever.

AgentDL,AskMen,1390968273.0,"&gt; Some people are better off staying out of relationships. It's not a popular opinion but it's true.

I don't disagree. 

&gt; Why should someone be saddled with my burdens? They're mine to deal with, and I don't want to inconvenience a partner. 

I get what you're saying, but with relationships it's kind of a give-and-take between two people that have different strengths, weaknesses, and coping methods. As far as burdens are concerned, in a good relationship you're both able and willing to support each other. The whole ""no man is an island"" thing, you know? 

&gt; In the same vein, I show a disturbing lack of empathy for others. I wish I could, but I can't. Just another reason why I shouldn't be with someone.

i_lick_telephones,AdviceAnimals,1390968354.0,"People that take advantage of the system are so incredibly low though. Most of the people in poverty desperately need it. I just hate the idea of focusing on such a small group and denying everyone coverage because a small faction of people take advantage of the system. There's always going to be people that do that, but just because they stick out in our minds, doesn't mean we should base decisions off of them. So I'm glad you agree in that regard, because it frustrates me when people think we shouldn't provide any welfare because of a select few who ruin it for everyone.

The welfare we have set up is really shitty though. Usually, if you make enough money, you won't receive food stamps but that ""enough money"" is usually still such a minuscule amount. You might be better off not making enough money and receiving food stamps. It's a lose-lose. And don't get me started on TANF...an oppressive program all around that could barely count as providing much care and concern for those in poverty.

I don't think every person who is pro-life is against welfare; not at all. It's just if we're looking at the political parties, *generally* speaking, the people on the right side have their agenda (as much as the people on the left do) that typically includes being very against abortion, and also not in favor of government assistance when it comes to welfare programs. But sure, there's tons of pro-lifers who are in favor of welfare and tons of pro-choicers who want no government involvement. I'm just speaking in a very general sense when it comes to trends in political parties."

If they didn't intend to offend you, but in some way clashed with your own beliefs, then let them know what your beliefs are, or just drop it. 

I still don't understand how people cant grasp this concept, and if a topic is brought up that they KNOW they are likely to be offended by then they should either keep their emotions in check, or leave, or change the topic.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1390968464.0,"The phrase sort of on point in it's philosophical analysis, but impractical in it's suggested implication. 

By that, I mean the phrase was coined to specifically target attractive men. Men's sexuality is binary (either a man is good or **really** good with women or he's bad or couldn't get laid if his life depended on it). So the idea is if you're going after a high quality man who gets sex often from women, or could if he wanted too, if you give him sex, he'll treat you the same way he treats the other women, which is typically not nicely. 

It posits that men of this quality will all of a sudden respect you because you don't give them what they want, but it doesn't take into consideration that if 9 women are willing to fuck him, and the tenth witholds sex, he'll just be perfectly happy fucking the other 9 women. In this sense, by witholding sex, you don't even have any skin in the game, and you shoot yourself in the foot. 

The women that coined this phrase would have done better to encourage women to simply be his best possible option, and leveridge emotional intimacy instead of trying to play a self-defeating game.

capital_silverspoon,AskMen,1390968539.0,"James K. Polk helped to fulfill our Manifest Destiny by bitch-slapping Mexico and negotiating a pretty sweet purchase of Oregon from Britain (54-40 or fight!) He lowered tariffs and reeled in federal spending, which was a great boon to the economy for a good while thereafter. He established an independent treasury, which was in line with his party's goals at the time. He swiftly oversaw the successful annexation of Texas, which as nine years' worth of Texan independence had demonstrated, was not a practicable task for the two Presidents before him.

And the real kicker? He ran his campaign on those four promises! He literally said, in his Presidential campaign, that he would gauge his success as our leader by his ""Four Measures"" which were:  

* Acquire Oregon &amp; Texas
* Establish an independent Treasury
* Reduce tariffs
* Win California from Mexico

So here we have a President who ran a campaign on four promises. He was elected in 1844 and made good on all four of his promises in his first term. After having lived up to his ""Four Measures,"" Polk declined to run for a second term because he'd done everything he needed to do already! Definitely an unsung hero in American history.

I was dining with the GF one night, and gave the server my credit card for the bill. When he came back with the receipt, I realized that he had charged me for someone else's bill. It was slightly cheaper and I could have feigned ignorance and walked away, but I knew the corresponding table would be upset at the mistake, and mistakes earn servers quite the earful. I quietly motion for the server and tell him what he did. *Without even looking at my bill*, he tells me it's correct and walks away. Slightly frustrated, I call for him again and shove the proof in front of his face. He takes the receipts and disappears.

Imagine my surprise when he comes back, 10 minutes later, and tells me that both bills had been paid with my card, and could he please have it back so he could at least refund me my money. I come to the realization that if I had not noticed the mistake, I would have paid for a strangers table in addition to my own.

Long story short, I make a huge fuss to the manager, make one more when they tell me I can't have a ""refund"" receipt, leave 0% tip, and storm out. GF was cool with it because she knows I'm normally courteous and leave fat tips."

pHScale,pics,1390968728.0,"I'm not even kidding when I say this: **Wyoming was so boring that *I had to go to the emergency room*.**

I was driving from Ocean City, MD to Carson City, NV. Two days of driving had gotten me as far as Omaha, NE. Starting the day there, I knew I had a lot of driving ahead of me to get me to Salt Lake City, UT. 12 hours, in fact. It's doable, but long.

So I started the day with a *large cup of tea* from the hotel lobby.

The day went on, driving west across Nebraska on I-80. Weather was good, albeit a bit breezy. Around 10am I stopped just after Lincoln to use the restroom, and to grab *a soda*.

Come noon, and I'm near North Platte. I stopped to get a combo meal from McDonalds, which included *a soda*.

I was pretty good the rest of the state. I stopped once around 3pm in Sidney, NE, and got some water.

Then I crossed into Wyoming.

Nothing seemed to change. I stopped in Cheyenne to grab something to drink, and I got a milkshake.

the sun was starting to go down, and so was my energy after 8 hours and 2 days of driving. But I had to make it to SLC. And it was winter. The sun sets early. I've still got a few good hours left.

So, I powered through. I was looking forward the whole trip to Laramie Pass, which was the highest point on I-80. I was expecting spectacular mountains framed by the sunset. I didn't get them, and it wasn't the sunset's fault.

I got to Laramie before I knew it, and I felt cheated and tired. Realizing the rest of the state was probably the same, I accepted my fate and took *A No-Doz*.

That's where things took a turn for the worse.

I started feeling short of breath and dizzy. I started having to stop frequently to pee. I assumed the first symptoms were altitude, and the last one was simply all the fluid I'd been drinking throughout the day. I wasn't totally wrong on the last one.

I eventually make it to Rawlins, WY around 6pm. Here, I stop at a truck stop to take a break, catch my breath, and eat some dinner. I got a subway sandwich with *a mountain dew*, hoping to rehydrate and refocus.

I got worse just sitting in the truck stop. My sister, unable to drive at the time, went and got the manager of the stop and asked him if there was anything he could do to help.

He didn't have anything.

But, he did help. He drove me and my sister in my car to the nearest emergency room.

There, I slowly started to recover. I was asked if I had taken anything earlier and, forgetting the No-Doz, I responded ""no"". They did some blood tests and found out that my oxygen was fine (ruling out altitude), but that I had a whole lot of caffeine.

And that's how I found out where my limit was on caffeine.

At this point, it was 9pm, and the day was done. I got a hotel, and left for Carson City the next day, 11 hours away.

The drive through the latter half of Wyoming was just as boring, but it was over by noon when we got into the Wasatch Range of Utah and enjoyed ourselves some scenery.

And that is why I have no desire to ever return to Wyoming. It was so boring, that I combated it with caffeine. So much so that I had to go to the emergency room. That's why I say Wyoming was so boring that I had to go to the emergency room."

But yeah, I'm honestly not that invested in pursuing theater as anything besides a fun extra curricular in school.  I've never felt discouraged personally, but I know some people who feel like the theater department at my school has been historically racist, in addition to not trying to have good roles for people of color.

They intended political leaders to be not only lawyers, but also doctors, engineers, farmers, etc. It's a real shame that most political leaders only study law and have little background in other affairs."

tylerpoppe,AskMen,1390968929.0,"I think, for me, if I was to ever start dating again, I would just hope my partner realizes that trying to be normal in a relationship is like climbing up a very muddy mountain. 

What I mean is that being with someone that was terrible has skewed and rewired my entire outlook on how things should be handled and how I should react to situations. I will now actively have to stop and think before I make any judgements or reactions and that I might be feeling insecure or inadequate but I must try my best to remind myself that I do deserve someone kind or whatever. 

I think many people don't understand the war that can be brewing inside when a terrible relationship has occurred - war with themselves that is. It can be simple things as just ""do I buy her flowers, when I bought the ex flowers they weren't right, so what if these aren't right. What if these are the type she hates and then she's disappointed in you again and you have to watch her eyes show her disappointment. And she'll smile and tell you she's so happy and she'll hug you, but you'll know. You'll see those eyes. Those eyes that tell you just how much of fuck up you are, even in this fresh start you can stop screwing up."" And so then you'll have to stop and tell literally fight with your own mind, your instincts, your heart and anything else you want just to make a simple decision like buying flowers, and you'll have to battle this up hill mountain that is muddy as hell which causes you to slip all the time, but you need to make sure that you don't look muddy or look like you are slipping so that you look like a normal person should and react like a normal person should.

Along that vein, I think a ""makeup transformations"" planned thread (whether weekly, monthly, or whatever) would be nice. I feel like the sub here is often filled with ""look at my brow transformation"" or ""look at thirty pictures of how my makeup has changed since I was a teenager."" I'm sure some people like these posts and find them valuable, but they don't really add value for me. They're not really teaching me about a new brow product or a good brow technique, or anything like that, but instead are just someone saying ""I used to be worse at this and now I'm better at it."" 

Also, I agree with discouraging the sob story titles (like ""Boyfriend dumped me so here's my makeup,""), since that often leads to blind pity upvotes, but I think there's no problem with posters including the context for their looks, whatever that may be, inside of the post.

tehsuigi,toronto,1390969117.0,"Trying to get further afield in the region is dependent on GO Transit - they run inter-city transit within Toronto and its neighbours, and with one exception, they only run train service in peak direction in peak hours (into Toronto in the morning, out of Toronto in evening). The Lakeshore line does have 30 minutes or better service all day every day, though, so if you want to venture out to Oshawa or Burlington, you're OK.

Compare to Vancouver's system...well, we don't have a train to the airport yet (that'll be 2015), but the surface network is far more substantial. If you're on a major grid route, you can expect a bus every 10 minutes or better outside of late-night, unless something goes wrong (which it does with some frequency).

Keep in mind the reason that a lot of capitalist enterprises have not used force currently is because they largely obey the law.

What do corporate entities that do not obey the law look like? Drug cartels, mafias, triads. Organized crime. 

Or, alternatively, gangs. Bloods and the crips. Need I go on?

The fact that we had states arise to begin with, I think, is testimony that human nature, left to its own devices, would not act civilized. I believe we act civilized because we're given an environment in which to act civilized, and because men with guns come to take away people who DON'T act civilized. Without government, all you really need is one entity to act uncivilized in order to have everyone else act uncivilized in turn. And then the entire moral fabric of society falls apart. To be honest, I don't think a lot of people would act violently because they want to, but I think they will quickly find that without government it's dog eat dog and they'll do what they have to to survive. Really, that's how I see things. Just look at what happened in New orleans in the aftermath of katrina for instance. I seem to remember mass rioting and the military actually needing to be deployed to keep things under control. People on their roofs with rifles trying to protect looters from taking their stuff.

Quite frankly, even if you disagree with government, I have to accept the Hobbesian view that some of the worst governments (aside from genocidal ones at least) are favorable to a society without a state. Because at least the state provides order and security. And I don't say this because I'm brainwashed to say it. I say it because I just see too many things that could go wrong with anarcho capitalism. It could easily become either tyrannical, or exploitative, or chaotic, or a combination of the above.

Also, I'm watching a couple of these vids, these things seem biased as all heck. Half the articles and videos' seem to spend their time attacking the state.

To address the one about rothbard with warring rights enforcement agencies, he seems to be saying ""oh well we dont have nuclear warfare at least"", but he seems to completely ignore that fighting might happen on my doorstep, which never happens now. He also ignores we'd still have nukes, and we'd also see less innovation if we can't acquire better weaponry anyway, since we couldn't create much new tech at all due to a lack of resources. Technological process is the result of the safe environment states create for us.

Just...ugh. I'm not gonna go through everything and debunk it point by point, but yeah, I just don't find those sources convincing at all, sorry. At best, the videos rely on assumptions I just flat out don't agree with, and at worst, on fallacious arguments."

I have found an amazing woman, but she is so different from my wife I just don't know how to respond sometimes. While we didn't have a ""bad marriage"", the love just fizzled out, I have found that my ex affected me more than I thought. 

A few things i have noticed-  
My GF tells me all the time that I am handsome, sexy, cute, hot, etc.. My ex never said those things and it makes me feel good. 

My GF LOVES sex. After 12 years of once a month pump and roll its great to have someone that truly enjoys sex. 

My GF likes to do things with me. Ride Motorcycles, build lego, and more. My Ex had ZERO interest in any of my interests. 

My GF is just fun to be around. I suggest doing something fun and she is up for it. My ex was as fun as a nun. 

There are many times I just look at her and say ""women actually DO THAT?"" And apparently some women actually do... Who knew?

Just be awesome, but be real, and don't fake it. And understand that he needs some time to adjust to this new relationship. I'm sure that he really likes having someone that truly cares about him, but there may be part of him that does not fully trust that you really are that great. "

I know I was struggling at first with reading, but then around 2nd or 3rd grade it seemed to suddenly make sense and by the time I finished 6th I was known as library student and was always found in there.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390969306.0,"&gt; I don't think that is correct. Wars are funded by the fiat central banking systems we have around the world, meaning the costs can be deferred to the future.

We've had wars since forever. They used to be one small tribe of people throwing rocks and swinging crude weapons at another small tribe over some land or something.

&gt;You would less likely have a standing armies, which also means individuals would have more civil liberties by way of gun rights etc etc.

I don't necessarily agree. 

&gt;Anyway, most of the wars I'm familiar with were started and caused by governments and religious fanatics.

And resources, and ideology, etc. 

&gt;Ancaps just want to be left alone so they can build a functioning society. They are very tolerant of people with different ideas to theirs and no threat to anyone. I'm not seeing what the problem is? Don't worry about us and we won't worry about you!

It also helped that, for five years, I lived in Japan and could follow series easily. I don't live there anymore, so this has been more difficult, so I have found myself ""catching up"" and have started to discover new series that may have started after I left, or those that I just wasn't following while I was there (because I was follow a number of others). Still, I don't tend to like to wait until a series is almost complete to start it as I enjoy the anticipation of each chapter release. It's also fun to ""get in on the ground floor"", as it were, and follow a series all the way to its end.

sovietterran,AskMen,1390969492.0,"Short answer: Yush. 

Longer answer: yes. However, there are a few other problems that can arise for guys when dating a bisexual or pansexual individual. Sometimes it can feel like a pansexual or bisexual is more prone to fall into the threesome or open relationship bracket than hetero people because of the picture culture paints around those communities, true or not. When you don't have a partner who is into that or aren't into that yourself, it can sometimes make your partner feel like they aren't meeting all your needs and effect their confidence. Not all guys will feel this way, just like it's bs to assume all pan/bi individuals aren't looking for monogamy, but it may be best to be clear from the get go what you want and how he can be all of it. Segueing  from that point, when and if you get to the point where you are comfortable talking about past relationships, it's good to remember that while a guy may be fine hearing about your homosexual encounters, there IS a line where reliving that may make it seem like you're in need of female companionship. Hearing my ex talk about her ex's DDs was fine... Until it took up half the drive to Denver... Then I just felt like I really lacked something major.... So yeah. I think you'll find most guys would be fine with it. Just remember a guy CAN feel bad for not having..... Other equipment to make you happy with. "

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390969568.0,"&gt; 1) You assume that the government is the only way to provide those services. This is clearly incorrect as private fire departments exist, businesses conduct research, etc.

But I'd argue they're not necessarily the best way, and even if private businesses perform those things, I dont think they ever would've occured without a state protecting people.

We never had technological progress at all until the first states arose. Beyond that, the extent of our progress was fire and maybe the wheel. States provided a safe environment for us to advance, even if much of the advancement is done privately. 

&gt;2) ""The government does good things except when it doesn't""? So far, your argument consists of the notion that we are wrong for disliking violence against us because more people who approved for it than disapproved decided to show up and vote, and that life without government would be bad because of reasons you can't specify but totally exist.

You're always gonna have rule by one, rule by a few, or rule by many. I think many is the most equitable. And your universal principles mean nothing without enforcement, which brings us back to that first question. If you dont propose rule by many, what do you propose, forcing others to follow your principles? That seems even more tyrannical than the ideas you're attacking."

The Natural Resource Defense Council gives Delaware a rating of 5 stars for Dewey Beach and Rehoboth Beach. Delaware's first settlers were Dutch and they settled in Lewes which conveniently is beach property. They arrived in the 1630s.

Delaware was the source of [one of the 4 cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belton_v._Gebhart) that led to school desegregation in the US. 

We gave you [Ryan Phillipe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Phillippe#Early_life), [Valerie Bertinelli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Bertinelli#Early_years), and [Joe Biden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden#Early_life_and_education)...not sure if thats a good thing or not but it is what it is. Bob Marley also used to work at the Chrysler plant in Wilmington though it has now been demolished. 

Trulia named Rehoboth beach one of the [most gay friendly zip codes](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/15/gay-lesbian-friendly-zip-codes-neighborhoods_n_1601446.html) in the country. 

If you are interested in off centered sporting events Delaware hosts world champion [Punkin' Chunkin'](http://www.punkinchunkin.com/) every year as seen on the Discover channel. 

Delaware has provided some awesome things to the world. DuPont chemicals was founded in Delaware during the early 1800's. Obviously they have made awesome stuff but we also gave the world Gore-Tex as W. L. Gore &amp; Associates is a Delaware company. University of Delaware researchers founded a company which produced high quality multi touch technology which was later bought by Apple and used in those snazzy iPhones that later came out. 

Delaware happens to be the first state since Ceasar Rodney was the first to ratify the constitution. It also is the only state in the US with a circular border. In addition it also has the lowest mean elevation of any state.

I've never been stopped but I've known alot of stoners and some of them have been caught. I have never known anyone to have anything happen to them unless they're dealing.   
The only time i've been close to being caught or even seen the police near me was once when i was smoking in a park with 2 of my friends (a couple). We saw the police coming from a mile away and flicked the joint but held onto the bag, they chatted to us for a while and asked us what we were upto.

Look at the color of the people who work in fast food chains and as janitors and then look at the members of congress. That's not a coincidence. That's not because black people are lazy or lack personal responsibility. They lack a lifetime of social and human capital, no family history of wealth, little opportunities, etc.

noc007,funny,1390969925.0,"Ok. I understand the reasoning to keep these; I can count three on my keyboard and one on my desk that I admit should be tossed. If this bugs you like it bugged my wife, there is hope! Go to [Monoprice and get some velcro cable management](http://www.monoprice.com/Category?fq=SubCategoryId:1052003&amp;c_id=105&amp;fq=MultiMainCategoryId:105&amp;fq=MultiCategoryId:10520&amp;searchtype=subcategoryid). They have the rolls that one can cut to length; I can't vouch for how well they will perform and these may be awesome, but the ones I've encountered in my IT career have been sufficient and I felt they could have held better. They also have the fixed length ones in 6"", 9"", and 13"" that also has a hole on one side; I have used the 6 inchers extensively at home since they were cheap and just doubled or tripled up on them when I needed additional length; I didn't know they came in longer versions when I ordered. Pay attention to the quantity for each item as well as the item quantity discount as you may save yourself some money. For example, ordering a quantity of one of the 60-count 6"" 6-color pack is $8.15, but ordering a quantity of 10 of the 6-count 6"" 6-color pack is $5.80 for the exact same thing; this is because of the volume discount when ordering multiple of the same item. You do want multiple colors so he can color code if he wants and most of the colors are noticeable amongst the sea of black cables.

Buy a bunch of these, at least 50 or more since they're so cheap, so he doesn't have any excuses. If you buy 10, he's just going to want to hold on to them for really ""special"" cabling and nothing is going to make the cut. Drop this epic pile of awesomeness in his lap and make a rule that the twist ties are to be kept with the original packaging only. If the original packaging is being thrown away, so do the ties. If the packaging is being saved, it stays in the box. Even if there's a cable that he only needs to undo a loop or two, twist tie comes off and the velcro goes on; there will be a time that he'll need to undo it completely and then the tie is left in a random place. Have a *central location* for the velcro to be stored; if it's loose in a random spot, it goes back with the others and he wont have an excuse of it getting lost.

They do charge for shipping, which is annoying. They do sell on Amazon, but I don't think one gets any volume discounts or free shipping. Check out the site as there's bound to be other useful stuff on there. If he does cabling, including crimping and punchdowns, and doesn't have his own tools, he may benefit from owning his own. They do sell bags with a bunch of tools as a kit, but I haven't found them worth it for my uses and sometimes the kits don't always have the best quality tool. They have a $10 off $30+ order for new customers which may cover shipping; **coupon code TAXACT0113 and it expires on the 31st**. If you miss out retailmenot.com generally has useful codes.

If he is not already aware of this site, it's a great resource for cables priced appropriately. Just pay attention when ordering RCA cables; mine were coax cables with RCA connectors, which really cuts down on potential interference, but it made the cables too rigid. If he runs out of a color or two that he likes, I think he'll use it as a good excuse to order more of the color(s) along with some much needed cables. Or you could just send him the link and tell him the new rule and to order at least 50.

So, for 20 bucks or less you can pick up a wired controller which is plug and play with no additional hardware. I wouldn't play a multiplayer game with a controller on PC, but I would (and do) play many single-player FPSs with a controller just fine (Bioshock, for instance). Non FPSs are even better, but the FPS isn't my favorite genre. I love kicking on Big Picture Mode on Steam, sitting on the couch, and playing some XCOM for hours on end (which controls very intuitively with an XBOX controller).

TL;DR - Buy a wired 360 controller on the cheap, even an off-brand like Afterglow, plug it in and enjoy. Just don't get frustrated competing with mouse and KB players in multiplayer."

Junoh315,pcmasterrace,1390970139.0,"Possible reasons why you're being downvoted:

1. You are straying away from the circlejerk.

2. You didn't back up your claim with any evidence yet said it as if it was a fact.

3. It DOES happen.

Before explaining how you're wrong and how it happens, I'll let you know that you're possibly still somewhat correct.  They don't actually hand money to IGN for the reason of getting good reviews(as far as I know).  However, IGN gives good reviews because they get money from EA.  That might sound like an oxymoron but it's not; there are a few ways that IGN editors, writers, and executives get money by EA that don't involve bribes.  

IGN gets money through advertising products.  EA is one of their regular advertisers and both parties know this.  IGN executives and editors know that they'll get more advertising money if they select only the good reviews.  However, they don't force anyone to write a 10/10 review for the games(as far as I know).

IGN's writers are to blame for the 10/10 score.  Either they truly enjoyed the game(which seems to rarely be the case), they know what kinds of perks they'll get by sucking up to EA, or they're physically being paid by EA to write a good review(which there is no evidence of but the possibility remains).  The review with the best score will be selected by the editors that want to keep making money.

It's not breaking FTC rules if they don't pay them directly for their review so it doesn't have to be mentioned.  It's a grey area and lots of journalists push how far they can legally go."

He told me on our third date that he had herpes. Before I freaked out and let my mind go crazy, I went to my gynecologist and got my full panel STD test (I always do this in the beginning of a relationship). I asked all sorts of questions. The truth is, this is very common. Much more common than people think. Most people actually go their whole lives without realizing they have it. A lot of people put a really nasty name to herpes. Because of this, the stigma that people with herpes are ""dirty"" and ""irresponsible"" has spread like wild fire. However, I do feel like the societal views on this are shifting. 

If I would have stopped seeing my boyfriend over this herpes thing, it would have been the biggest mistake of my life so far. Wear a condom, and if you are extra worried, she can take regular anti virals. The transmission rate is very, very low when she isn't coming up (or in the middle of) an outbreak. 

I rambled a little, but please don't let people convince you to run to the hills JUST because of this virus. You might miss out on something great over something pretty insignificant.

_TIXCY_,incest,1390970360.0,"&gt; Perhaps you're sticking up for the gays but grow up. It is my opinion that Father/son shit is that...shit. How many people here like that? It's not been a popular post here once. /r/gayincest[1] is that way... B/b gets downvoted also. So tell me, why the censorship? If you're going to be mod then delete the troll comments. That's reddit rules.

Because YOU come across as a troll. It's not okay to call gay oriented posts or comments ""fugly disgusting gay shit,"" that's fucking offensive. Don't like it? Go somewhere else. 

We don't have a rule that prohibits gay content. **You're not a moderator** and **you don't make the rules** so until that happens (it won't), gay content is perfectly welcome here and will continue to be accepted.


&gt; Really? ALL THE TIME? Typical to exaggerate.

Yes, ALL the time. You're seriously bitching every time I see one of your comments.

VooDooBarBarian,pcmasterrace,1390970366.0,"Having played both, I don't see myself going back to WoW but it's only ever a matter of time before I go back to Eve. WoW eventually just became ""hit these buttons in this order"", but nothing ever had consequences. Party wipe in Arcatraz? Try again tomorrow, maybe drop some gold on repairs. Beat Arcatraz? Try again tomorrow, the shaman didn't get his new pants. At the end of the day, there are only 3 things you can do in WoW, deal damage, absorb damage or undo damage.

Eve, on the other hand... well, what do you want to do? You don't earn XP by doing things, your character just accumulates skill points over time. You decide what skills those points go into and gradually build your character up. The skill tree is mind boggling, so when I ask what you want to do, I don't mean PvP or PvE. Do you want to take a bird's eye view and track down spatial anomalies that can lead to untold riches or perils? Do you want to sneak through enemy territory, probing for weakness before hundreds of your allies show up? Wanna be a pirate who preys on the unwary and takes what he wants? You can do it all... from stock broker to shipwright, miner to marauder.

My long term goal is to be a ~~smuggler~~ cargo transport specialist. You want something moved from point A to point B, I want to be the guy that can get it done. To that end, when my account is active I work towards high-end cargo vessels and cloaking devices. To pay the bills in the interim I take player contracts to move stuff or haul resources from where they're cheap to where they're rare. In a pinch, or when I just want to wind down and listen to the excellent ambient soundtrack, I'll go blast space rocks apart to sell their precious innards."

You can't go faster than light.  

So it turns out that if you multiply the permittivity of free space and the permeability of free space, then take the square root of that and invert it, you'll end up with the speed of light in a vacuum.  That should be an indication that there's something inherently fundamental about the speed of light, and indeed there is.  

An object cannot reach the speed of light, because such an object would have an infinite amount of kinetic energy (and be infinitely massive!)."

EDIT: I just looked, and the exent of Batman's preparedness is knowing how to avoid Grodd's mind control. He also found a cure for synthetic Kryptonite and sent a message to space, but neither of those are prep. The fact that he was running the simulation itself shows crazy preparedness, but inside the simulation, there is very little.

People don't agree. So this isn't an option.

&gt;Also, you're just rationalizing your own beliefs here. Technological advance occurred while states ruled, so it couldn't have otherwise? That is a logical fallacy if I've ever seen one.

Before we had states, we were too busy trying to just survive. We didnt really begin advancing at all until around 5-6k years ago, which is when the first modernish states began to form.

&gt;I don't care if you adopt my beliefs. You do. Feel free to merrily skip away, middle finger extended, if I want to sell you something strictly voluntarily. The IRS, on the other hand, doesn't enjoy similar actions when collecting protection fees.

I just think some level of coercion is necessary to enjoy the fruits of a civilized society. You may not approve, but I support it for the greater good.

&gt;I would never force my beliefs on you. The fact that you seems so eager to do so to me simply extends your own cognitive dissonance in a manner utterly hypocritical.

I really don't know where you saw a personal attack. I don't mean to be dissmissive--I'm sure you feel this way--but I don't see it.  The shitass hippie comment was directed at those hippies, not you. Usually our mods are pretty good at removing posts that literally have people calling each other names.

Saying that, a lot of the regulars don't shy away from debates here. Yours was a position that was eligible for scrutiny the moment you posted it. Everybody's is. No user is special in that they get a free pass to have their views unchecked if someone disagrees.

Saying that, your posts in this particular instance would be like me going into /r/christianity and claiming that Jesus was an avatar of Vishnu, that this is teaching is Christian just because it has Jesus in it somewhere, and expecting to not have the Scriptures, and councils brought to my attention in order to refute this. There is Right View and Wrong View. A lot of people are open to eventually understanding Right View without dismissing it. On a Buddhist forum we should not advocate throwing away parts of the Dharma outright even if it's hard to consider and accept at the time. When you say things like there is no Buddhist orthodoxy, that's the message you are spreading. I'd be surpised if I found myself in a sangha that let that slide, let alone a forum where people come to learn about Buddhism (this forum isn't a sangha in its true sense, and ""schism"" has a very specific definition of literally breaking up a school, not just our individual feelings).

Resentment? Not from what I've seen.

I or my school don't need defense as if it's some alien injection into the Path. Researching and reading the Pureland sutras and letters of different masters will make this evident. People don't really care to do this and that's no skin off my nose. What I was referring to was you using Pureland and Nchiren to support your view that Buddhism is about doing whatever you want. Neither school throws out teachings on the Four Noble Truths, The Eightfold Path, karma, rebirth, etc. To imply that they are without orthodoxy is the misunderstanding I was referring to. They may be different but they are not deviant, just a couple of facets of a jewel, with the Buddha's  teachings as the rock.

Mahayanists recognize the authority of the Pali Canon. That user wasn't saying that the Pali Canon contradicts Mahayana schools, only it doesn't support what *you* said.

The writings of Ven. TNH are for westerners who need Buddhism  to be presented as more palatable to them, not the end all be all word on things (which is why I find sanghas which claim to follow his ""path"" confusing because he is not his own  school). You certainly need a broader perspective than what he presents in his books to practice, which I don't think he would disagree with. For example, I read Living Buddha Living Christ when I was first practicing, now I don't really need parallels with figures more familiar to the west so I can try to understand.

Shit that was longer than I intended.

Mephrael,AskReddit,1390971128.0,"I guess it boils down to whether or not you believe more in time paradox, or divergent timeline theories. 

In changing the past, you may create a divergent timeline where events play out differently than in your original timeline, but (at least theoretically) you won't make yourself spontaneously cease to exist, as by travelling backward in time, you essentially create a unique instance of yourself. 

I'll admit I haven't yet seen Looper, but it sounds a little like the writer was aiming for the idea of a time convergence. Basically, the idea is that some events are somehow pre-determined, and no matter how many times you try to change the past, the event still occurs. 

This idea was hinted at in the Terminator series, though not in great detail, in that each time Skynet tried to kill Connor, something happened to make sure he made it through. Key details may have changed each time (Kyle Reese being his father, Connor becoming fond of the T-800 series, and his receiving a replacement heart from Marcus in Terminator Salvation), but the end result was a showdown between the Skynet central computer and Connor himself. 

Edit: I can't believe I left that last sentence hanging like that, my abject apologies!

I got a hair cut and lost like six inches and am really happy with it. It's back at my shoulders! Woot! Walked yesterday. It was SO COLD but I felt proud that I did it! Didn't walk today, but did see I, Frankenstein which was dumb but pretty and fun. Way better than its 5% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes would suggest. Been a little down in the dumps, sleeping a lot in the day and night. 

Been trying to read more, finished The Handmaid's Tale, been reading the first few Fables comics, and working to wrap up The Kite Runner and The Light Fantastic, the second Discworld novel. Thinking of reading the third Dark Tower book next. I joined Goodreads (direct message me if you want to be friends on there, yo!) and have a million books on my to-read list.

Everyone has felt the pangs of desperation eating away at us.  We usually fall into depression when the person we cherished/adored turned out to be not who really thought of them to be.  A lot of people subconsciously project who they want this person to be to them.  When we find out they aren't who we think they are then that's when the heartbreak occurs.  The saddest part is that this person wasn't who you thought they were the whole time.

""Sponsored by New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, the legislation is similar to previous bills passed by the House, and would put into law a ban that is included each year in annual spending bills that prevent any federal funds to be used for abortion services.""

This is something that is added to annual spending budgets repeatedly. This isn't new. [There has been a ban on federal tax dollars going to abortion since 1976](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment). 

"" It bans Americans who qualify for Obamacare subsidies to purchase health insurance from buying plans that cover abortion services.""

The only thing new about this amendment is that it prevents people from buying private insurance plans that grant abortion coverage if they are partially subsidized. There is no fight. This has been settled for over 4 decades. "

sprengertrinker,whiskey,1390971346.0,"As a non-psychic person who doesn't know you at all - it doesn't come off that way. It's more of a distraction, really. The clothes you guys are wearing are actually fine (except for the vest of the guy on the right...that is an abomination, this isn't a video about hunting or fishing, is it?). I'm making an assumption that the reason you posted this to reddit was to get your channel more views maybe, so the criticisms I have in the video relate to the aspects that make it come off as an un-desirable thing to watch. Youtube production qualities have gone up quite quickly over the past few years, lots of nice lighting and great cameras, but the way popular people on youtube dress has remained kind of the same. They wear things that are kind of generic and easy to relate-to by most audience members - jeans and t-shirts or collared shirts, not too many accessories that distract from their faces you might notice.

The people who you drink with at your local bar might completely understand the vibe you're going for and get why you're wearing your hats, but as a random stranger on the internet it's just a distraction from what you're saying since both hats look pretty unflattering to me, and I don't get the whole ""hat off indoors"" thing."

bunniesz23,dogecoin,1390971403.0,"There are a ton of variables that go into it. The obvious one is the increase in difficulty over time. As it becomes more expensive to mine per coin, the value should, in theory, increase as well. While this is a key point, this is not going to be what sets Dogecoin apart from the other currencies.

There are two major factors that are going to work in our favor: population and support. These two go hand in hand. As population creates the demand for more services, more services will draw people to our community. We are not currently the largest community, but we are definitely the fastest growing one, and as we've seen in the last week, many people would love to provide a service to this new, growing consumer base. As more services become available, people will look to get in on this currency that is becoming more and more user friendly.

Last but not least, no post about the value of Dogecoins would be complete without mentioning you guys. Perhaps the strongest trait that Dogecoin has is it's welcoming, generous, and faithful community. Our fundraising efforts help to spread the word, our helpful and eager community lowers the barrier for new shibes (tipping is an important part of this), and our faithfulness has already proven that it makes us a ship that is very difficult to shrink.

Then speculators come in, but I think you guys see the lunar direction this post is heading in.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390971425.0,"&gt; the odds that they are pure evil is effectively zero in the grey world and the US' own motives are then cast in a grey sheen as well.

To an extent, but they still wish to do harm to us, and Obama is right to preventing that.

I guess it would make more sense within the nation state system, but I'm guessing you wouldnt agree with those terms to begin with, hence our difference of opinion.

&gt; but I don't understand the defense of no-trial. If they're so dangerous it ought to be easy to have some kind of judicial presentation of the case in order to tidy up, no?

They also want to extract info from them tho to prevent attacks. They also dont want them getting in contact with their buddies which would be more possible in the actual judicial system.

&gt;I'm glad you followed the point I was making because I believe you're likely to come around on this. As you agree that citizens have a right to be concerned, surely you also believe that your right to a fair trial is in jeopardy so long as the precedent is being set that certain concerns like ""national security,"" can waive away every right that citizen or non-citizen might have?

I definitely recognize the potential for abuse, and I'll continue to be against it on principle simply because I'm NOT in the know. But I will admit that there may be info that would cause me to be in favor of it. Remember, obama was also against it...until he got into office. It's debatable why he changed his mind, but I would suggest that as commander in chief he may have been given info he didn't have before. So yeah, it's complicated. I definitely understand the concerns though, and share them."

&gt;In late 1785, Jefferson dined with Buffon in the count’s summer mansion outside Paris. Jefferson found that Buffon was “absolutely unacquainted” with the American moose and thought it was simply a miscategorized reindeer. Jefferson told the count “that the rein deer could walk under the belly of our moose.” Jefferson noted that Buffon had “entirely scouted the idea.” Finally, though, Buffon relented and hinted that if Jefferson could present him with the antlers of a giant moose, he would pull back—either by omission or by an admission of error, it isn’t clear from the historical record which—his theory of degeneracy in the next volume of Histoire Naturelle.

&gt;Jefferson wrote to Sullivan begging for a moose: “The readiness with which you undertook to endeavor to get for me the skin, the skeleton and the horns of the moose … emboldens me to renew my application to you for those objects, which would be an acquisition here, more precious than you can imagine. … Address them to me, to the care of the American Consul of the port in France to which they come.”

jaynay1,nba,1390971547.0,"So in other words, you don't know what WS/48 is?

I've been watching nearly equally long.  Kobe, at his prime, was exactly who the statistics say he was.  He was an okay distributor, but not one that would stack up to any of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Lebron, John Stockton, heck even Bill Russell.  Better than Dwyane Wade maybe -- it's quite borderline.  cf. his AST%

He's not a great shooter.  Not compared to Stockton, Nash, Allen, Durant, heck, even Jordan, whose major issue was that he took too many inefficient jumpers -- even if he was the best in the game at them.  cf. his TS%

He's not a great scorer.  He had none of the physical dominance of the huge guys like Shaq, Malone, Lebron, or Magic, and while his finesse was good, and his footwork is arguably elite, it pales in comparison to Hakeem or Duncan.

Let's play a specific game with some similar players actually.

Player A scores 32.1 PPG on .457 FG%, scored more than 30 points in 51 games.  He also had 6.5 RPG and 5.5 APG.  He had 13.2 OWS, 2.9 DWS, and 16.1 total WS alongside .262 WS/48 and his team finished 42-40.

Player B scores 25.8 PPG on .489 FG%, scored more than 30 points in 29 games.  He also had 6.6 RPG and 5.2 APG.  He had 8.1 OWS, 2.6 DWS, and 10.7 total WS alongside .189 WS/48 and his team finished 42-40.

Player C scores 35.4 PPG on .450 FG%, scored more than 30 points in 56 games.  He also had 5.3 RPG and 4.5 APG.  He had 11.6 OWS, 3.7 DWS, and 15.3 total WS alongside .224 WS/48 and his team finished 45-37.

Player D scores 27.6 PPG on .460 FG%, scored more than 30 points in 30 games.  He also had 5.5 RPG and 3.9 APG.  He had 10.3 OWS, 2.6 DWS, and 12.9 total WS alongside .208 WS/48 and his team finished 47-35.

ecclectic,sex,1390971549.0,"As I said, you sound more and more like a long troll.

I once had a dream that I would be a professional chef.  That failed, then I was certain I would be an animator, that didn't pan out.  I worked a dead end job for 3 years before going back to school and getting a trade.  My first shop closed it's doors a little more than a year after I started, I jumped ship from a VERY good company to a 'good union job' that tanked after 8 months, and spent 6 months searching everywhere for work. I worked for an abusive employer for a year before getting laid off again, eventually hired on with a good company again after 4 months.

IF (and that seems to be a really big if at this point) you're not a troll, you're so deeply ingrained to see yourself as a loser, you are correct. You are a failure, you'll always be a failure, because nothing ever works out for you.

when i was younger, i found where my parents' sex stuff was stashed. porn, The Joy Of Sex, a pair of plastic handcuffs, a velcro bow tie collar, some lubes, condoms, the whole nine yards. i didn't know what most of it was used for at the time, and by the time i remembered that they existed, i was kind of impressed. if i've got as lively of a sex life as them when i've been married 25 years, i'll be happy.

as long as i don't picture/imagine it, the *concept* of the idea doesn't bother me in the slightest."

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1390971681.0,"&gt;Eh, most women are not ""mythically gorgeous"" and do not have that kind of power over crowds of men.

Yes they do. You don't have to be an 11/10. Most men consider most women sex-worthy, that is to say, of quality, than women do for men. That is something that has been documented and studied in several fields such as online dating, and genetic testing.

Whomever values sex/receiving the validation of the other party less, has a far greater chunk of the social power. In this case, that's women, and this is pretty obviously seen in western culture.

&gt;Beautiful women have been around forever and it hasn't exactly made any difference regarding the conditions for women in society

What makes you think it was attractive women's job to care about other women? Attractive women have always and are still doing just fine without embracing feminist values. Back in the day they'd likely be hollywood actresses, broadway singers, the wives of rich men etc. It's not their job to fall on a grenade so unattractive women can have privileges

&gt; what has made a difference, however, is education, political influence and fighting for your rights. That is why feminism wants more female CEO's, amongst other things.

That's a pretty twisted view of the entire issue...

Women, especially a woman born in 2014 faces no greivances or social issues that men don't have an analagous issue, so the concept of women needing to fight for more power is folly. Women have been equal, and I would argue the socially favoured sex for well near two, to three decades now. 

Secondly, women don't enter fields like politics or high end corporate entites because women either aren't worthy of the positions, or don't want them. Feminisism, for some reason, doesn't and has never considered the possibility that women quite simply just don't want to enter those realms. Especially considering positions of leadership and high degrees of authority are traditionally male roles because they validate men specifically, in the same way capitalism works because it takes advantage of the nature of the human as a living being (ie. their greed).

There are women in leadership positions for lots of companies...the CEO of HP computers was a woman, and the CEO of Ubisoft Montreal was a very attractive woman; they don't those positions because they likely deserved them and worked for them, and actually wanted them, not because some made up garbage called ""the patriarchy"" held them down. If they can do it, you can do it.

pilotmkn,Shitstatistssay,1390971687.0,"History Lesson Time!!!!

The Wright Brothers were not given credit for the first flight for many years because they beat the government at creating the first successful airplane!

In 1898, the government (specifically the War Department) gave Samuel. P Langley $50,000 (over $1.2 million today using 1913 dollars) to create a powered airplane that could carry a man. All of his attempts [failed](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Samuel_Pierpont_Langley_-_Potomac_experiment_1903.jpeg), while two bicycle shop owning brothers in Ohio tinkering in their own time beat him to the punch.

Well, it just so happens that Mr. Langley was one-time Secretary of the Smithsonian Museum, and the museum wasn't too keen on granting credit to these two upstart brothers over their government-backed stooge. So, in a quirk of history the Wright Flyer was crated up and sent to London, England where it was on display for 20 years and could have easily been lost during the heavy bombing of WWII.

It wasn't until 1948, after both brothers were dead, that the Flyer was brought back to the United States and placed on display at the Smithsonian, were the Wright Brothers were given proper credit for their work."

alannathelioness,AskMen,1390972373.0,"I feel like men and women have slightly different interpretations of ""creepy"". You said you were afraid of women making a scene. I know plenty of guys have had similar experiences that left them feeling uncomfortable.

I'm certainly not trying to make light of the situations that men have to deal with but I think women (at least from my experience) view creepy as something more sinister. Creepy definitely gets overused by women for many reasons. But I think it's worth mentioning that when women are ""creeped"" out, it is often because we feel our personal safety is at risk. Whether or not a guy is well-meaning, can you blame women for being slightly distrustful of any unknown man who approaches her? I know that the majority of guys approaching me do not mean me harm but as a woman, there is always the following thought in my head:

""He could rape you or kill you""

Call me paranoid but I know I can be easily overpowered by most guys physically and it scares the shit out of me. This is the thought that can make me see any negative reaction I get from a guy as threatening. Thus, to me, they are creepy whether or not they are well-meaning. Creepy isn't just something that makes me feel uncomfortable, it makes me feel threatened. 

Would I be correct in saying to men, creepy comes mostly from discomfort and not a potential threat to their well-being? Fill me in!

Then you try to get to the mun using that, earning more science points, which in turn is used to unlock bigger everythings, and brand new stuff (like remote control tech, batteries, solar panels).

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390972562.0,"&gt;being other, rather due to its invalidity within Halachik status.

That's the same thing today for all intents and purposes.

&gt;A conversion that does not accept traditional halachik views or a conversion done by a group which does not accept those views are considered invalid conversions by those same halachik views.

Right... which is why, today, Orthodox say to us (Conservatives), and everyone else (Reform, Recon, Renewal..), ""if it's not our beit din, it's not valid.""

&gt;It is thus no different than Conservative Judasim rejectin conversions done without Bris Milah.

Conservative rejects a conversion done without all the required rituals. We don't reject a conversion if the rituals were done by someone who understands halakah differently than us (like Reform or Reconstructionist).  

If Orthodox were like Conservative, it would accept all conversions that completed all the rituals - even the Conservative.

That's the difference. I'm not blaming Orthodox for this difference, and don't think it's something they should change. But Orthodox do say ""our beit din or not valid"" because they don't see any other group (C/R/R) holding to their standards.  Conservative say, ""all the rituals, even done by others, or not valid.""

&gt;Your attempt to make it an ethnocentric viewpoint is severely lacking.

Orthodox is ethnocentric... they judge others by their own standards. So is Conservative... our standards say no to fewer people, but they're still standards imposed by us on others. Don't know why you got a hair up your butt. Nothing I've said is false.

sunofabeeeyetch,cringepics,1390972661.0,"Hmm. Hadn't considered that, but I suppose a small section of overly defensive bronies do feel that way.

It also appears that I thought you were talking about how some bronies get overly defensive. Instead, you're saying that watching the show itself is a strange activity. Perhaps it's simply a difference in cultures, but cartoons aren't necessarily always childish where I come from, especially if they're decently well-written (i.e., like the current iteration of MLP). So to me, watching a well-written cartoon show is no stranger than watching any other well-written television series. I don't at all get what's strange here.

Even if we were to accept that it's a strange thing, that doesn't make it a *bad* thing, especially where gender equality is concerned. While the primary target demographic (young girls) is expected to watch it, a growing acceptance of the secondary target demographic (everyone else) is a good phenomenon, one that can hopefully tip the scales against outdated and patriarchal gender roles for both men and women (women because the main characters--all female--are of varied personalities and temperaments, thus showing that there is no single unifying archetype of women that young girls should follow; conversely, it's good for men too because being forced into this idea of violent and sex-hungry masculinity is terrible for self-actualization as an independent individual, and fostering a community receptive to such hobbies that do not conform to this ridiculously narrow mold is a small step in the right direction)."

This is obviously overtly racist, because decisions of admittance include race as a factor, however because racism is seen as a system that is applied to minorities by Mr. Evil Whiteman, racism against whites has been termed ""reverse racism,"" mostly by white people, as a reminder that racism isn't a one way system of oppression, but is meant to be applied to any judgment against any race.

In Illinois, in a household of one (i.e. just yourself) you need to make less than $390 a week gross (which is approximately $9.90/hr at 40 hours a week). If OP is working as a day laborer and a commercial driver, my guess is that he's making more than that unless he's severely underpaid. However, if he does go back to graduate school then this may obviously change.

That said, if you qualify through the ACA you can get some amazing coverage at very low cost. They had a plan available to me that was only like $60 a month but was probably twice as good as my plan was (which was already pretty darn good).

Aeroelastic flutter happens when the airflow around an object creates a positive feedback load by changing the deflection of the object in relation to the flow of a fluid. This is what destroyed Tacoma narrows

Forced mechanical resonance is when an outside force vibrates an object at the objects natural frequencies which causes the object to build energy in the form of vibrations. This is what caused the Kalinin k-7 to fail.

They are fundamentally different concepts.

I think a voice like this has been missing for the past 100 years or so in the US, ever since the first Red Scare of 1919-1920 shut down socialism for a long time.

What is fantastic, and this is first grade level really, is that some of the Americans who think Obama is a ""socialist"" may see this video and have their minds blown that one of his supposed ""comrades"" disagrees with every single thing he has ever done or believes in. On top of that, they might find themselves nodding along in agreement ""this healthcare is expensive and still broken, I still am struggling to pay my bills and this socialist is saying this isn't socialism, but it's actually capitalism and Obama is a corporate crony? That means.....Obama is not advocating actual socialism? Huh."" Again, this is the lowest level of thought that could come from this, but honestly, most of American's thoughts on socialism are so ill informed, this is a great, great start to rebuilding what it's all really about while breaking away the ""Democract = socialist"" narrative.

If you're wondering WHY you're being censored, it's because you're always bitching about something on this subreddit, and being a jerk to other users because you're always right and everyone else is always wrong.

This isn't the first time you've been shadowbanned from this subreddit. You were before and I stupidly took you off the shadowban list because I thought you'd start being nicer to other users. But you didn't. You are constantly causing some kind of argument in a thread or just generally being rude and thinking you have some kind of power here (what's this about anyway?) 

Hell, even in /r/MILF you're a jerk, constantly calling people out for reposts or telling them their pictures aren't up to your standards or that someone isn't a MILF. 

So, **I'm not deleting any of your comments.** AutoModerator is, and will continue to delete them unless you stop being such a jerk to everyone who posts or comments here. 

You've even been rude to moderators when we've simply tried to tell you why your comment was removed, or that you *were* being rude. You want to tell moderators how to run a subreddit? You want to talk shit to the moderators, too? Cool. That shit doesn't fly, though. Maybe when you realize other people are interested in things besides M/S or MILF's, you'll be unshadowbanned, but until then, nope. You can argue back with me all you want but the other moderators are perfectly aware of this and were on board with it. 

**EDIT:** And to top all of that off, you've also been a total dick to /u/GayGiles, insulting his sexual orientation, and just making anti-gay statements in a lot of your posts. Which again, isn't okay in this subreddit."

Right now, from a learning environment standpoint, public education is shit. Thanks to shortsighted government regulations (No Child Left Behind) we have a generation or two of students who were told information pertinent only to a test to come later. Why is this the case? Because funding for the school is tied mostly to two things: Attendance (Seriously,  suck at your job all you want but as long as you take attendance you're golden. ) and test scores. Schools with higher test scores got more money, while underperforming schools lost valuable resources. Because of this, there is a tendency to fudge the numbers or make teachers teach what's on the test. I do know that this is changing. I know that the TAKS is now the STARS and the TEKS is changing its format next year. I don't yet know if this is a change for the better. I know that my degree plan (Music Ed) is being truncated so that all bachelors degrees are 120 hours. This is bullshit because it isn't sensible to compress the volumes of information I am responsible for into 120 hours. The education system in texas can be: open minded, well funded, nuturing, and successful.  More often, it is: politicized, bankrupt, intellectually stunted, and a huge failure. "

None of the Freyjaswomen I know have kids or are planning on doing it soon, oddly enough. One really really wants them but the other two seem solidly ""meh"" on the subject. Freyja doesn't appear to care.

All the Freyjaswomen I know work with slightly different aspects of her. Some get her more as a war goddess. Some get the ""heeeyyyy baby"" aspect. You don't have to be all things to all people or even all the things Freyja is to worship her and be her priestess.

I can't tell you anything about those websites. Most of what I know of her comes from hanging out with a bunch of Freyjaswomen who always have time to talk to you about their goddess. If you want some UPG-type info I can share more."

I can also imagine the freezer causing stress for the animal, or tightening of the muscles similar to that of a conscious lobster. Of course, I wouldn't believe either of you until this is looked at more empirically, so I'm speculating.

myrrlyn,teslore,1390973483.0,"The Thalmor.

The Empire can't win a protracted fight in the province that has traditionally supplied much of their military having also lost every other province save High Rock, which is for some reason we don't know at present apparently out of the picture, and the Stormcloaks don't possess the popular support necessary to establish a province-wide government and then collect strength from the other half of the province and hold Skyrim as an independent province that's probably lost economic connections with High Rock and Cyrodiil.

The Dominion, meanwhile, is consolidating and rebuilding and even with Hammerfell thwarting them, Black Marsh remains aloof and Morrowind is in shambles, and so **when** the Empire loses Skyrim and is reduced to just Cyrodiil and High Rock, assuming High Rock doesn't *also* splinter and fall out of its grasp, there is a very high probability that Great War Two: Bloody Boogaloo will occur and this time, Mankind won't do as well."

I agree that his fans and the media as a whole may be perpetrating the white savior complex but saying Fuck Macklemore and Eminem just because they're white and make rap music (though I agree that reddit's Eminem obsession is ridiculous, they don't treat any other rapper that way) is wrong.

oldneckbeard,vaporents,1390973736.0,"MFLB - Just doesn't get me that high anymore. Batteries were a pain, Always had 8 or so batteries just laying around the house. 

VaporBros - Still fuckin love this thing. Hits hard, extremely efficient, it's been a work horse. The only ""problem"" is that the kit with new tubing and stuff is so expensive. 

Arizer Solo - Still pretty good. The big con (for me) was the price -- I dropped full price in a head shop on it. Biggest cons are the high intake resistance, and the way you connect the herb to the base always means a bit of herb drops directly on the heater, so I find some small pieces black, and others still green. The stuff that gets dropped on the heater at a 7 combusts, and it's a pain. There should really be a screen on the back side of the stem as well. 

O-pen Vape: The only con so far is the taste of the cartridges. They don't taste like awesome flowers, there's a funky taste to them. But they hit hard, the pen was free, and it's discreet as fuck. I might sell my Solo and just keep this bad boy as my portable herb solution. "

If anything my post does more in the way of providing evidence than the OP, which was completely anecdotal and only looked at one instance where his assumption was supported."
maowsers93,texas,1390973746.0,At what point do you just admit that you're wrong? You are seriously trying to argue that federally funded abortions are lurking around the corner when an amendment that has prevented them has been added to every spending budget since 1976. The president agrees to add it to the newly passed health care reform bill and you still argue that it isn't good enough. It has been implemented every year for 4 decades. You are arguing that federally funded abortions could possibly happen despite the fact that they've been illegal for decades. You are delusional.

TheGloriousNose,AskReddit,1390973817.0,"Efficiency isn't everything. Let's start with the problems of energy storage and peaking. Wind and solar energy are great - while the wind is blowing and the sun is shining. We don't currently have a way to store the massive amounts of energy we would need to in order to keep the grid running when these alternative sources aren't producing. In addition, since the wind can cut out quickly and unexpectedly, coal and natural gas plants are essentially kept ""idling"" and ready to take over.

There's actually a lot more lobbying to push alternative energy forward. In college, I was tasked with offsetting the energy needs of a school with alternative sources. The only reason we were close to coming up with something economically viable was because, in our area, the utility company was forced to buy power from alternative sources back at 5x the cost they sold power for. Without government interference, that doesn't happen."

ixAp0c,NewSkaters,1390973846.0,"It's a really low cost activity to do, since all you really need to start is a board, and some skate shoes.  

And being 18 you are still young, it's definitely a good time to pick up skateboarding if it looks fun.  The younger you pick it up the more time you have to enjoy it in the long run and to gain experience.  

Like /u/ameoba said, just go to a local skate shop with around $150-200 (around 100$ for complete, more or less, and some skate shoes, and a skate tool wouldn't hurt). 

From there, you have everything you need to skateboard, you don't need anyone coaching you, you just learn by doing it.  Find a big open area like an empty parking lot that has nice smooth ground with little to no traffic (lighting for night skating is a bonus), tennis courts work too if you have any of those by your house.  

And check out Braille Skateboarding on YouTube, he has tutorials on a lot of things from the basics to more advanced tricks.  From simple things like pushing and riding, loose vs tight trucks, vulc vs cup shoes, how to ride off a curb, how to ollie, etc., to more complex stuff like how to nollie nose manual and 360 flips etc...  He also has several helpful videos on other miscellaneous topics like cleaning bearings, making home made balance boards to practice balance inside, microwaving your shoes to get that perfect fit, etc...  But yeah I highly recommend you check out the channel as there are hundreds of videos and skate support videos which are also helpful (he helps people that send him a 'skate support' video that are in need of help with a trick, and tells them what they are doing wrong, it can help you if you are facing similar problems with tricks).

First off, go to the gym and get bigger. Muscle is good for your health and asthetically pleasing. It will give you a long term goal and challenge you. Second, clean up you face. You definitely have a bit of acne but if you can get a good skincare routine I'm sure that plus general aging will clear it up. Third and the easiest thing is cut your damn hair. Cut it short maybe leave the top a little longer than the sides and put some product in and style that shit. Fourth, dress better. I don't mean to be a dick but jeans and plain t-shirts is not dressing well its extremely plain. /r/malefashionadvice gets a lot of shit but their sidebar gives plenty of useful information about how to dress well. Fifth is the glasses. Get a stylish frame or contacts. Go to your local eye store and ask an employee for help and maybe find a better frame for your face. Lastly realize this. There is nothing wrong with how you look. You are an average Joe like 50% of all men. The reason I gave you all that advice is to become ABOVE average and help you feel confident with yourself. I'm on mobile and am too lazy to link subs for all the areas I advised you on but I'm sure you can figure it out. Best of luck."

Other psychologists argue that this is in fact rather a process through which false memories are created by blending actual memories and outside influences. Furthermore, some psychologists believe that repressed memories are a cultural symptom because there is no written proof of their existence before the nineteenth century.

Before ABS existed, driver were taught to apply the brakes ""smoothly"".  This keeps the brakes from locking up and it was the fastest and shortest way to stop. 

Now that we have ABS, the fastest and shortest way to stop is to activate the ABS by slamming the brakes on.

HalfysReddit,AskMen,1390973931.0,"As a motorcyclist, **GET ON THAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKER**.

Nah but seriously, riding is fun as hell. It's also surprisingly affordable. It ain't cheap, but it ain't mad expensive either. You can pick up a good used started bike and all the gear you need for around $2500 with some craigslist searching (that's $2K for the bike and $500 for gear). To get a license I recommend an MSF safety course, you get your license in only one weeks time and they do a very good job of educating you. The course is like $300-$400 or so. After all that, toss in another $200 a year for insurance (bike insurance is mad cheap) and you're good to go.

So for &lt;$3500 you can be a biker. But then guess what! Let's say you want to stop riding - you'll find that selling your stuff, it holds a lot of its value. That $2000 motorcycle is still $1700 today. That $500 gear is still worth $200.

WeaklyDominant,TrueReddit,1390974112.0,"Yeah, unsurprisingly, I disagree. I think there's something that sets football apart from plenty of other forms of entertainment with ""activities and rules,"" and that distinction is largely based in violence. That's why there's historically been a market for *Greatest Hits* videos, why sports coverage tends to emphasize people getting ""jacked up,"" etc.

Sure, people want to watch a good game, and that's all well and good. But I think if we allow the NFL to continue to be so profitable without really protecting its players or being upfront about the risks to them, then we are complicit in one way or another. 

I still plan to watch the Super Bowl. But I also plan to be critical of how I'm supporting that type of violence and what I can do to offset it."

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390974202.0,"&gt; If that wouldn't be OK, how is that Conservative opinion any different than an Orthodox rejection of a Conservative conversion?

That is the question that I was responding to. It's specifically asking to contrast Conservative and Orthodox rejection of other movements' conversions. Where I specifically say

&gt;It doesn't matter if the period of study was according to Reform or Reconstructionist theology to us, doesn't matter if the composition of the beit din are Reform/Reconstructionist, etc.

which specifically addresses two of the three things you list as examples...

Conservative expect rituals and remain mute on others' halakah.

Orthodox expect rituals and speak out against others' halakah.

Both lead to rejections of converts. For Conservative, that boils down to not saying ""All Reform and all Reconstructionist are invalid conversions in our eyes by virtue of being done in Reform/Reconstructionist communities."" That can't be said of Orthodox in respect to Conservative."

MarkWW,guitarlessons,1390974288.0,"Say you have a IV chord. You think, that's a nice chord, but kind of boring. What can I do to change it?

I can make it a IVmaj7 chord. Better. What if I substituted a ii7 chord for the IV chord. That's nice, but I miss that maj7 feel, so I can make it a ii9 chord et voila - all the notes in the IVmaj7 chord, but now it's a ii9 instead.

Or say you have a V, IV, I chord progression. You say to yourself - the fifth is in both the V and I chord, but it's not in the IV chord, what can I do to keep that fifth in there? You can make it an add9.

When you start playing at this level, you begin to see the scale as not seven chords, but as one or two giant chords with lots of alterations and substitutes.

There are only 3 kinds of movement. By seconds/sevenths, by thirds/sixths, by fourths/fifths. When you start extending chords this much, movement by thirds is just shifting around the root, and movement by seconds is the same as movement by fourths, and suddenly your entire world is reduced to ""every possible note, at any possible moment"" because suddenly every note can become a chord tone at any given moment.

Probably the best way to explore this is to think about the bass part (bias: I'm a bass player). Do you want the bass to leap around from root to root or to move by relatively small half-step/whole step movements? And given your chord progression, how can you alter the chord so that the bass moves the way you want it to.

This is when extended chords open up to you - paradoxically by thinking about the bottom, you start considering ways to change the top.

Once you have handle on voice leading in the bass, then you can start thinking about voice leading in the upper registers - start with the top note and then think about the middle notes - and suddenly you're not ""playing chords"" you're moving voices around &amp; that's when all of the various alterations of chords really begins to make sense."

lamblikeawolf,short,1390974384.0,"1. Averages are a little bit silly. They don't give you enough of the picture. They don't tell you the spread. They can even lie about your chances of finding a particular thing if it's a bimodal distribution. Take [the average female heights in the US from the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height#Average_height_around_the_world), for example. If you're a white female, 5'5"" is average. If you're a black female, 5'4.5"" is average. If you're a Mexican female, 5'2.5"" is average. But it still doesn't matter, because a significant portion of the population is still going to literally look down at you, and give you the feeling of being shorter than everyone else. Or you could look at the Netherlands and find that the average female height is 5'7""! Or in Bolivia, where it is 4'8""! Quite a big difference depending on the area you live in.

2. I certainly hope that you don't see every post that is posted here as someone whining or crying. (Although it is really annoying trying to find clothes that fit, and basically guarantees you have to spend more time looking and you probably also have to get your clothes altered in some way.) Universal sock sizes are anything but universal. There's a reason even underwear comes in multiple sizes, and it's because people are shaped differently. Those who make socks have not yet caught on to that fact, or they don't care. (Even though I'd pretty much kill to have some over-the-knee socks right now. All the knee-highs I buy only come to my knee.)

3. I certainly hope you don't treat men who are 5'7"" or 5'8"" like that. It doesn't matter how tall you think they are - if they're being put down for being shorter than someone, they have a valid complaint. Regardless of their height. People who are 6'6"" shouldn't sneer at people who are 6'2"" for the four inch difference. And people who are 6'2"" who are affected by that sneering have just as much right to be upset about being sneered at as someone who is 5'4"", or 3'9"". Because it's disgusting behavior.

Off the top of my head, I don't think there is any way you could actually reduce the passage of time for yourself in a way that matters to your frame of reference from the standpoint of relativity.

But your ""not psychologically"" stipulation is one you should revisit. If you have near infinite energy and a way to use it to do anything within the laws of physics, then you could presumably speed up the processing times in your brain, the speed of your muscles, the rate of your metabolism, etc. 

At the point where all of your thoughts and actions are faster, it would be more or less like simply living in a world where everything else has slowed down. You might notice more friction between yourself and the air around you. But at a basic level, ""psychologically"" just means ""in terms of the physics of my brain""."

argleblather,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1390974843.0,"I have roughly a 45 minute commute- I have to be at work at 8, and I leave the house at 7 to get there with 15 minutes to noodle around and get settled in at work. Here's some things that make my life easier. 

1. Set out clothes the night before on my dresser, grab and hop into the shower. I don't really have to be awake to do that. I brush my teeth while my shower water heats up. 

2. Once I'm out I keep my hair in a towel to put on moisturizer/primer, dry hair, foundation and eye primer (let set), eyebrows, eyeshadow, smutchy liner, powder and lipstick- on to breakfast! This morning all this took me from 6:38 to 6:46. Not bad. I keep a clock in my bathroom to keep me on schedule. 

3. Programmable coffee maker. I need coffee for the living and functioning, and unfortunately, need coffee to make coffee in the morning. I bought a coffee maker that I can program to be ready right when I get out of the shower. I fill up my travel mug and my breakfast mug while my toast is toasting. 

4. I eat pretty much the same thing every day for breakfast, which helps. Peanut butter toast with fruit, either banana sliced on top or dried cranberries or dried prunes (the diced ones are good). While the toaster is toasting I feed the cat and get out my peanut butter and slice up fruit and doctor my coffee. 

5. The night before I also figure out what lunch will be, and usually have a soup packed up, with a yogurt and fruit cup that I can toss in a bag on my way out the door. 

So, I wake up at 6:15 and usually head out the door a few minutes before seven in the hopes that I don't get stuck behind a fucking school bus and can stop to get a latte, which never happens because I'm always behind the bus... but the important thing is it only takes me 45 minutes to get out the door *including taking a shower every morning.* Streamlining things and setting up a routine that works for me make all the difference. Of course if one thing changes, I'm fucked, but that's life.

Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1390974928.0,"A liquid's tendency to turn into a gas is defined by its *vapor pressure*.  Liquids with high vapor pressure are considered *volatile*, they turn into gas very easily. Rubbing alcohol, for example.  Liquids with low vapor pressure generally don't vaporize on their own. 

Vapor pressure tends to go up with temperature, which is why warm liquids are more volatile than the same liquid at a lower temperature. 

Molecules in a liquid are swimming around and bumping into each other, and while on average they have a certain amount of energy which keeps them from flying in every direction which is why you've got a liquid form of the substance at this temperature-- they have enough energy to flow around, but not enough to fly away into space (not outer space, but the space above the pool of liquid).

There are some molecules that have low energy in them, and some that have high.  So, the liquid has one overall temperature, but on a molecular level, you have some cold molecules that move slowly, and some hot ones that're moving quickly by comparison.  Molecules that're hot, or have been heated by being hit by hot, or are just in the wrong place at the wrong time, are ejected by the liquid into the air-- they become vapor.  That's evaporation.

A metal that's barely above its melting point, such has having just been liquefied for smelting, is as cold as it's going to get while still being liquid. Thus, vapor pressure is low, and so its tendency to vaporize is low.  But as long as it stays a liquid, it will vaporize extremely gradually. 

Mercury is a metal that's liquid at room temperature, and has a moderate volatility; you can safely soak up little bits of it if you spill it, but a large spill of on a warm surface will produce a good bit of vapor, and mercury vapor's the dangerous form.

My OG came in a little low (1.062 actual vs 1.068-1.072 expected). After watching some youtube videos, I believe an additional 15 minutes to the malted grain steep would have helped bring that into range. FG was 1.012, giving me 7% ABV.

The kit came with a spice pack that I believe I was supposed to add to the boil, but I decided instead to make an extract in a mason jar with just a bit more than enough vodka to submerge the spices, which I decanted into the beer a few days before bottling. I'm *really* happy with that decision. The spices just pop out.

I used K.C. Super-Kleer on a whim, but it didn't do a lot of good. The beer was too dark for it to matter.

I thought it tasted a little thin during bottling, but of course it just needed to be carbonated. I ended up with a fantastic beer, all told, and will probably do this again every couple of months, when I have some free carboys.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390975089.0,"&gt;  I suggest you study some economics.

I did, thanks.

&gt;then consider the fact that with every voluntary interaction there is necessarily mutual benefit between both participants, whereas with all hegemonic bonds imposed upon people means one can only live at the expense of the other, living parasitically off of their productive capabilities. To make a world that truly brings people together, you need to embrace mutual benefit and reject hegemonic bonds.

Quite frankly, I feel capitalism brings a bit of both to the table. On the one hand it brings economic progress and a higher ceiling for living standards, but I think without some regulation and government intervention, it's highly exploitative, and the word 'voluntary"" is used in a particularly slippery context that seems to ignore the realities of the ""work or starve"" ultimatums it actually offers. 

&gt;Even if you think hegemonic bonds would be acceptable in certain situations, do you really think it's wise to grant one group full power to break these rules that we expect everyone else to follow simply because they call themselves ""the state""?

It's not about hegemonic bonds being acceptable, it's about them being inevitable. So I say we use the state for good.

&gt; Is there anything about modern government that makes you think these people are at all trustworthy, even if that was a good idea?

1) Their motives are a but more complex than the pure profit motive of the private sector to a degree.

2) Power is separated and limited as per the constitution and according to the philosophy espoused in federalist #10, which recognized power as a problem, but accepted that it is a necessary evil.

&gt;The state can never match the efficiency of a free market. By being able to use prices to figure out how things are going on in the world, we can harmoniously and simply figure out the best way to use resources at the lowest possible cost. If you mess with this system, you will only create disharmony. Instead of a world where we benefit from each other's existence, you create a world where everyone sees everyone else as their enemy. You'll replace a world of peace with a world of war.

I disagree. I think a truly free market would be exploitative, because the same people who control the big bad government would use it to their advantage at the expense of everyone else.

&gt;By rejecting principles and destroying any kind of logical dependability, predictability, and responsibility, you will bring about unnecessary human suffering.

The free market also results in a lot of unnecessary human suffering. 

&gt;Justice isn't this nuisance that's keeping you from helping people while they unnecessarily suffer, it's what prevents you from causing unnecessary suffering.

When elites can use your right to property to deny resources to others, yes, yes it can. 

Look, I understand your arguments against the state, but the free market doesn't solve those problems, mainly because the same thing that makes the state bad also makes the market bad, and that's human greed and corruption. Now, I dont agree humans are necessarily EVIL, just self interested. The difference between the market and the state is the market is pretty much interested in profit and self interest, while the intentions of government are a bit more nuanced and complex, and it CAN be used with good intentions.

* Low security space has no space police, but it is still controlled by NPC.

* Null sec has no space police, and for the most part NPC do not control it at all.  Players gain political control this space instead, and fight over the resources.  

* Wormhole space is like null sec, but there is no official control and no stargates.  It is a resource rich space and only those who can defend themselves actually hold the space.  *thanks /u/jpfrana*

Especially the part where he tells the press that they are happy when the team is winning and supporting them...but when they are losing, the press are vilifying them constantly when they should be supporting them. This bad Hexagonal was also a result from the Mexican press putting insane amounts of pressure on El Tri.  
This is probably the reason Carlos Vela refused to come to El Tri, even if he was ready. With the press calling him a savior and the one to guide Mexico smoothly, if Vela would have shown up and the same outcome that happened in reality would have occurred, the press would have crucified him as well, and would probably have made comments about the so-called savior. Fuck the yellow journalistic press."
thatonecoolguy,HPfanfiction,1390975128.0,"Harems. I don't mind so much if it's an important part of the story, e.g., Firebird's Son, but most of the time the only reason for it is as fanservice for people to fantasize and wank over.

For example, I'm currently reading [Rise of Arcane](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8687160/5/Rise-of-Arcane), a Harry Potter/Marvel crossover, where a lot of the attractive female characters have had their ages changed just so Harry can have sex with a load of women. To me, this is completely unnecessary and just distracts from the plot, and takes away the chance of the story having an interesting, realistic romance.

People do daily drive the aircooled classics, though to the best of my knowledge none of the members of any of the clubs I'm part of in the midwest do it.



Regardless of the year I'd suggest waiting, especially if it's restored.  If the underneath is coated in some way (por-15 paint or Ziebart for example) it would be safer for the vehicle if you did drive it during the winter months.  You may be able to get away with fairly frequent car washes that include an intense undercarriage cleanse to remove the salt that finds its way onto any exposed metal.  



I can't find the photo links now, but a few months ago someone in the fullmoonbus club or limbo (I think) posted dogleg and floor repairs that needed to be done after a few years of daily driving with salt and snow exposure.  This yellow bay had been in greatt shape before becoming a daily.  He said he'd not do it again after having to fix the newly formed rust.

Also, i hate to say it, but you're going to get a lot of advice (some of it bad). Focus on doing your research. If you want a workout tailored specifically to you, then YOU have to make it. Use routines like [this one here](www.bodybuilding.com/fun/train-like-ronaldo-build-a-body-for-a-better-game.html). (I love this workout. It's a Christiano Ronaldo weightlifting routine that made its way around /r/fitness a while back. It's tailored to wingers/forwards.) as a framework and add/subtract exercises based on your strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. If you're feeling weak, I wouldn't recommend jumping straight into crossfit, as you can get injured pretty easily without supervision/trainers/etc. p90x is very endurance focused so unless you're having trouble with fitness, not speed, then I'd recommend hitting the gym. 

Work in your hip flexibility and strength (VITAL for running/sprinting). Hit the gym, focus on nutrition (eating RIGHT, no shit food anymore) and cramming protein after lifts and workouts.

lamblikeawolf,short,1390975422.0,"I am very sad that I have to break out my old copy/paste from when I had to argue people down about eugenics being bad regarding IQ from a biological standpoint. The same arguments apply to any arbitrarily selected human trait. These are all the reasons why ""designer babies"" are a bad idea.

**Argument 1: Genetic Variation**

Eugenics severely limits the gene pool. Eugenics decreases variation in the population. Why is variation good in a population? For a number of reasons, actually.

A. Populations with higher variation are less likely to go extinct because of some mutation in a virus or disease.

B. Populations with higher variation have lower inbreeding coefficients. Why is that good? Well, it increases heterozygosity. Why is that good? Consider heritable diseases. Heritable diseases occur because you have ""broken copies"" of a particular trait. 

Let's look at sickle cell anemia/trait, for example. In those areas where malaria is a problem, having sickle-shaped blood cells increases survival. But your body still needs to get enough oxygen. Those without any sickled cells are homozygous dominant. (They have two copies of the dominant form of the trait, which is to have regularly shaped blood cells.) Those with a large proportion of sickle shaped cells are homozygous recessive. (They have two copies of the recessive form of the trait, which is to have blood cells that are sickle shaped and don't effectively transport oxygen.) Heterozygotes (those individuals with one copy of each variant of the trait) are protected from malaria, though, while simultaneously getting enough blood to their organs to survive well.

**Argument 2: Nature Doesn't Value What Humans Value**

Eugenics is selecting for traits that a certain portion of humans deem important. But that doesn't mean that nature gives a shit about those traits. In fact, those traits may be very harmful to the species as a whole, and then all of the humans will be wiped out.

Example:

There is a population of mice living on an island. There are 4 footed mice and 3 footed mice, and the number of feet are heritable (i.e., if your mom has 3 feet and your dad has 3 feet, you have 3 feet.) 4 footed mice run faster, and let's say the 3 footed mice have a better sense of smell, which is also heritable.

Scenario 1: 3 footed mice, with their superior sense of smell, can more readily detect better food sources, and decide that this makes them obviously superior. They decide to practice eugenics, and after a few generations, only 3 footed mice are left.

Scenario 2: No eugenics is practiced, and after a few generations, both 3 and 4 footed mice continue to exist.
SUDDENLY: predators have made it to the island. Only 4-footed mice can outrun them. Let's check on our mice in each scenario.

Scenario 1: no 4 footed mice. This population is now extinct.
Scenario 2: while there are no longer 3 footed mice, the population of the mice still exists through mice with 4 feet.

**Argument 3: Unforeseen Consequences**

Our understanding of the human genome is limited, and eugenics can lead to unforeseen problems. Take selective breeding of dogs, for example.

Big dogs have hip dysplasia and heart defects, while small dogs often have knee problems. We bred them for one thing, and, in our ignorance of all the traits we were inadvertently selecting for, or those ancillary traits we were ignoring, they ended up being lemons. Given our similar levels of ignorance about human genetics, we have no idea what traits we'd actively encourage in the population that nature would never select for.

For another, more general example, undesirable trait X and undesirable trait Y might mix well and give use desirable trait Z.

**Argument 4: Scientific Time Waster**

Eugenics is a scientific time waster. For any effect to occur at all, it will take a significant time to see any improvement. This time could be better spent developing drugs and biomechanical enhancements - helping all of the species, regardless of individual traits.


**Still not convinced?**

We're still missing the ability to predict the future. We will never be able to know:

1. Every future potential mutation of every allele for every gene that exists, and exactly what it does.
2. What occurs with every combination of future and present alleles for every gene that exists or will exist.
3. Every future environment, including every future mutation of every pathogen or parasite that will evolve.
4. How every every combination of future and present alleles for every gene that exists or will exist also interacts with every future environment that will occur.

**Why are these things important?**

Take malaria resistance, for example. Malaria resistance is caused by a mutated allele in determining the shape of red blood cells. This mutant allele causes the gene to code for a hydrophobic amino acid instead of a hydrophilic amino acid. This results in the red blood cell being sickled in shape. This shape is less effective at oxygen transfer. 
However, the shape also makes it an ineffective target with malaria. If malaria had never existed, this would seem like a detrimental trait, and a potential allele for elimination under eugenics. But had that occurred, if malaria then evolved after this variation was eliminated, there would be no genetic resistance against malaria in the human gene pool. Now, malaria isn't a particularly wide-spread disease in the modern world. But imagine if it was a more lethal strain of a bacterium or a virus, or a parasite that could spread easily. Suddenly, your entire population is infected. If this is also a particularly deadly strain, your entire population is dead. Good job."

myrrlyn,teslore,1390975472.0,"Printing: Well you're sticking to just in-game texts, which is a good limitation to have. Attempts at an entire corpus would be far more difficult, given the contradictory and still-growing nature of the lore.

There's an ebook of every *Skyrim* book somewhere and I could have sworn I had it but I can't find the thing now.

Journal: since the Hero can only be *canonically* stated to have done the Main Quest, you can either write down an in-character journal from the perspective of running only the Main Quest track, do a journal for each questline, or combine them all into one if you like, but five Main Quests **and** the side questlines might get to be a lot of work if you're going for more immersion than just the individual stages of each story.

There are people who RP their Heroes across all five games as being the same person, though I believe the general consensus is Eternal and Agent both died... Anyway, the Nerevarine is functionally immortal and *could* easily be the Champion of Cyrodiil, but since the CoC wound up turning into Sheogorath, the LDB pretty much has to be a new person. And if you take the Nerevarine ""invading Akavir"" to be literal rather than a euphemism for ""wandered off doing who knows what"", then all five Heroes are divorced from each other.

Shezzarines aren't actually immortal champions, but rather aspects of Shor. Some of them turn up over and over again (Ysmir); some of them are one-offs.

&gt;back into the First Era

that was a while ago; Divayth Fyr has been alive since then, as have a smattering of other people, but I don't believe even Shezzarines have been.

____

Anyway, as far as resources go, you can trawl [Imperial Library](http://imperial-library.info) for the in-game books and if we ask nicely /u/ladynerevar might even get you access to the file collection instead of you having to go through each one, copying all the text, pasting it into the document of your choice, and making sure the formatting came out nicely.

I've got nothing to say on making physical forms, since I'm not a bookbinder. I am an amateur carpenter and have made chests before, but art designs are Not My Thing and so I can't offer any advice there. The games all have neat designs you can use, though. Skyrim's scrollwork is nice.

The Anthology came with five maps: Tamriel, Iliac, Vvardenfell, Cyrodiil, and Skyrim. You could probably snag the image resources from in-game notes and maps and print those off, though I'm not really sure how, myself.

Sounds like a big task. Divide it up into stages, one step at a time, all that good stuff. Best of luck."

Would a show trial really fix the institutional problems you point out, seeing how it's a ""show"" trial?

&gt;I don't know what you mean by that. I'm contentedly debating you in the context of the US nation state. So far as I can tell, I haven't been pushing anything here that would be outside that system. You're free to indulge in the ancap literature if you want to know more about it, but as I said, I am not here to evangelize you out of your state preference.

Well, the theory is that the government of a nation state is to first and foremost look after its own citizens. That being said, the use of violence is generally an acceptable means to protect them. If a ruler needs to choose between deaths of his citizens or death of another's, he should choose to protect his own first and foremost. 

Also, I thank you for the last part there, I've had tons of evangelists contacting me =P.

&gt;That's a fair point, but surely you realize that exact same argument could be used against an accused US citizen in the states. I'm not arguing that failing to provide judicial recourse has no purpose. I am simply suggesting that it is a dangerous precedent to set in a liberal democracy.

And I agree with you. I am rather ambivalent about the whole deal here, and based on my current knowledge am logically against the concept of denial of rights. However, i also recognize I'm not ""in the know"" and that I'm basing this decision off of limited information.

That being said I do recognize your concerns."

Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1390975567.0,"When you plan an event before knowing when it's scheduled to happen, you use relational times.  ""X must happen 48 seconds before [event].""  ""Y will occur 2 hours after [event].""  X is at T-48 seconds, Y is at T+2 hours.  

Later, you schedule the event for 10PM, and that's how you can then be sure to do X at 9:59:12PM and Y will happen at midnight.  Maybe you set the event for 10PM *because* you want Y to happen at midnight.

Other such things are D (Day-- yeah, D-Day is the day of any event, not just June 6th, 1944 Normandy Landing), H (Hour), M (Minute); not every event occurs in an instance like T-time.  A plan might require that it happens at Sunrise, but nobody knows the day yet, the event is scheduled for H-hour, M-minute-- make sure everyone's ready by sunset on D-1, and everyone's awake in time by waking everyone at H-2, and it takes 2 minutes to get everyone facing the right direction, so start that at M-2.

He explained to me that the girls ""lead him on"" with the promise of a relationship so he does nice things for them. I later came to realize his definition of ""leading on"" is being nice to him in any way. He told me this girl ""lead him on"" (knowing she had a boyfriend) because she sat next to him on the couch and at one moment leaned across him to get the remote.

Yeah...

He held a one sided crush on that girl for a year and a half and even got extremely pissed off when we invited her AND her boyfriend to a party because we weren't ""respecting his feelings"" and he ""can't help how he feels about her.""

And yet clearly I was distinguishing throws from other takedowns. Pretty evidently what I was doing.

The thing about the 'and then his friends will get you' argument is that it works no matter what you're doing. If you're slipping his punch and counter-punching...then his friends get you from behind. If you're throwing him...then his friends get you from behind. Blah blah blah.

If he has friends, then you're just as likely to have friends. So that's a useless sort of argument.

Try a throw when you're between two parked cars. Or at the bar of a crowded club. Or on icy pavement. I'm not saying they aren't good, I'm saying that my experience with both BJJ and Judo has shown me that Judo focuses on big *point scoring* throws too much, and less on OTHER takedowns, than is ideally practical."

mundabit,birthcontrol,1390975621.0,"A lot of people are saying you need to start a certain point in your cycle. when it comes to contraception this is not necessary.

You can start a combination birth control pill at any point. It will take 7 active pills before the pill alone will be effective as a contraceptive.

The reason most doctors advise you to start at a certain point in your cycle is because women who want to use the pill long term want to avoid side effects like spotting, break through bleeding or messed up periods. But as you will be comming off tyhe pill a month after you start, this wont be too much of an issue for you.

So you should take a pregnancy test if you have been sexually active since yoyr last period. Then if its negative take an active pill 7 days before your boyfriend arrives. keep taking active pills and on the 8th day and the 8th pill, youa nd your boyfriend can have sex.

I would advise you to get two months worth, so you have 42 active pills. This will give you 7 to start before your boyfriend gets there, and 4 weeks of pills after that, so you will take 5 weeks worth of active pills instead of 3. Why? because this way you are less likely to get a period during your boyfriends visit. When your boyfriend goes home, stop taking pills, you will get a period, and then you can start researching other methods to use for his next visit.

I'm not saying you wont get spotting. and depending on where you are in your cycle the pill may not stop your period. I'm just letting you know that you can start at any time during your cycle, and you can take as many active pills in a row as you want to try and delay a period (a minimum of 21 pills is needed though)

Of course there are other methods that are better for short term protection. Condoms, Cervical caps, Contraceptive sponges and so on. "
