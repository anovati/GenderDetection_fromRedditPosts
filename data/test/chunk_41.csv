You can add a hard drive if you want more storage space. I personally had a computer with just a single 250GB SSD for a while and recently added a second SSD so I can keep a large number of games installed. Hard disk drives are much cheaper per gigabyte if you need tons of storage. But if you don't want to have more than about 6-12 games installed at a time (depending on size) and you don't have a huge media library of videos, just the SSD should be fine for quite a while. Trust me, once you get used to an SSD you'll never want to use a hard disk drive again. 

You can bump up to an i5-4570 on the same motherboard if you want, but the i3 should be plenty powerful for modern games at this resolution. Your graphics card does most of the heavy lifting in games. "

its really my fault, expecting too much from a known ""hang out"" of socially awkward heavily autistic neckbeard who have such appalling judgement, they are outcast and confused by normal concepts other people take for granted.

This is why we would cut him sooner if that is in our plans, to free up extra money to sign players during the free agency period.

Also, if you fight him with a sub optimal team, or a couple of people who are bad, you might actually wipe on him.

I don't know many bosses that can be DPS'ed down before they use any meaningful attack. Most bosses' attacks are neutralized or reflected in order to DPS better, but that has nothing to do with the meta itself, it has to do with the encounters specifically.

In my final year of highschool I had a colostomy bag for six months and it took a little while to get used to it. I went on a leadership 'camp' with several of my classmates and on the return bus trip I started to notice a strange smell (reminiscent of vomit) and I had no idea where it was coming from. As time went by the people around me started to notice and complain; it was then that I had a horrifying epiphany. I put my hand down my pants to where the bottom of the colostomy bag was and I felt something wet and kind of chunky. My suspicions had been confirmed; the seal at the bottom of the bag had burst because too much pressure had been allowed to build up inside. 

The complaints of my peers became louder and more insistent and it was then that I had to pipe up. Luckily my friends new about my situation and were very understanding, but the final twenty minutes of that trip were very uncomfortable for me. I am unbelievably grateful that none of them every teased me about it, or ever brought it up again.

They:

- Have a goal difference of -4
- Are 4 points off bottom
- Have a relatively tough fixture list for the rest of the season

Should a good manager not understand a squad's limitations and either:

A. Strengthen it so it's good enough to handle the extra fixtures

B. Realize the squad isn't good enough and prioritize the league so they're not dragged into a relegation battle

I wouldn't be surprised to see them go down. Based on the last ~30 games it would almost be expected."

&gt; Quite a few MRAs seemingly believe that no one critiques feminism - it's always accepted, and always taken as truth. This always makes me laugh, because it's not hard to find criticism of feminism within academia 

If you want to post links to critiques of feminism in academia, you can do that. I'm not sure how non-academics would actually find them though, if you did not post them. If I google [critique of feminism in academia] do you really think I have time to go through 50,000 results?

Also, Silva played on the idea that people would be either too dumb or too confident, but he didn't know exactly which and I highly doubt he could have anticipated someone exactly like Q.

I think that if they were too dumb then it would've gone off without a hitch. The program was there just to waste time and divert their attention. Maybe if someone smarter or at least more aware than Q came along they might've caught on. But this was a program very few people had experience with and was designed a specific way.

&gt;He could've at least called for backup from the more trustworthy agents. Silva had a miniature army and he thought 3 people, one of whom was the head of MI6, could defend against it.

Maybe she is worth it. But what you should do is try to look around and find someone else. Like you said, don't want to fuck up her relationship.

TheLittleGoodWolf,MensRights,1389882601.0,"Well shit, I had no idea that was the case about the DNRs, not even sure we have them where I live (I would want one though). I always lumped that together with organ donation in my moral library. I can't be forced to donate or give up body fluid or tissue (except for drug tests or similar) while I'm alive, and shouldn't be forced to do so after I'm dead. These are my beliefs and personal moral standpoint though, the law is still the law even if it's a stupid one. 

As for DNR I would never ever want that decision to fall in the hands of a friend or relative because they are not in a position to decide that. I find it scary that such a decision is placed on anyone but be. If I have not given any written statements as to what should or should not be done it's business as usual. I suppose that not resuscitating is not business as usual.

Treatment of the dead (burial) is ""disposal"" of the body not ""usage"" of it and that is an obligation and not a right. I have the right to not have people ""use"" my corpse without my consent. Since ""disposal"" of my body is an obligation my rights do not go over that obligation. At least it should not. That obligation falls on family first hand and ""state"" secondly, any family should have the right to refuse the obligation of the disposal of the body, that is part of taxes (at least here).

wordserious,AskReddit,1389882637.0,"I am almost 50 and I consider myself liberal, although I can see many good things in some conservative ideas. Please keep in mind that you are making a generalization, but it's not that older people are conservative; it's that after you've lived long enough, you learn to be careful. You've seen many ideas fail. You understand that a lot of what you thought was new in your youth, really wasn't - it was just new to *you*, but they were usually centuries or thousands of years old.

Most of all, being careful means not jumping head first into something you don't fully understand. You test it first, you learn about it, you try it in a limited fashion, and if it works you do some more of it, but you always keep your bridges up so you can go back if/when the new idea fails.

Of course some older people tend to be too careful, and not try anything new. People become suspicious, jaded. Also by then they have a lot invested in the ""older"" ways - pension plans, a house, money, children. A lifetime of effort invested in something makes you careful with risk.

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1389882688.0,"&gt; I guess what I'm saying is -- I have always had the intuition that while men were valued for doing, women were valued for simply being.

I think this is a theory, not intuition. And, I would posit, it's  a modern concept, not an old one. 

Back in the 1800s, farmers' wives and children were expected to work long hours along with the men. But the women did different things. Pretend I'm an 1800 farmer. Do I really want my wife handling heavy lumber, at the risk of it falling on her, disabling or killing her? Hell no. I need all the help I can get to run the farm, she's experienced, and gets a lot of work done. So, women did work where there was less risk of them getting hurt, which requires less physical strength, *but is no less tiring.*  Any work the women did was very valuable and helped the farm out a lot. 

Go to Youtube and watch ""Victorian Farm"" (1880s) and ""Edwardian Farm"" (about 1910). It does a great job of showing the work done by men and women. And it's interesting to boot.

In most vaccines, yes. Seasonal flu vaccines are, for the most part, live, and can be lethal if introduced to an immunocompromised patient - during the pre-screening for flue vaccines, the part asking whether you're immunocompromised is an instant red flag.

Even for non-live viruses, the vaccination is a waste of time at best and a physical hazard at worst. The weakened immune system is either too weak to generate a sufficiently strong response to create a lasting immunity, or the weakened immune system musters enough energy to counter the vaccination but the exertion weakens the host in the process.

4. Quality of sex says nothing about possibility of a relationship.
5. Doesn't sound out of the norm for a casual relationship.
6. 2 weeks of not having sex does not mean he's committed to you.
7. Friends go to house parties.
8. Sex based plans are par for the course for people that have sex together.

It sounds like you are not friends with benefit but rather dating casually. I think there's a good chance he likes you more than as just a friend, but he also is not interested in anything like commitment, hence his preference for casual. If he really only wants casual, there really isn't anything you can do to change his mind. Have you tried telling him that you want more?"

JackPAnderson,worldnews,1389883127.0,"&gt;Predisposition is no excuse- 
Lots of people have a predisposition to substance use yet they counteract this, by, guess what. Avoiding these substances. A pedophile cant do the same? 

While substance abuse and child sexual abuse may sound similar because they both contain the word ""abuse"", they are actually quite different. 

Substance abuse is caused by an impulse to overuse that substance, compulsively. For instance, if an alcoholic has one drink, it would be exceptionally difficult for him to stop drinking until he wakes up in a gutter three states over. In other words, it is an attainable goal for an alcoholic to avoid that first drink, but it is not an attainable goal for him to avoid the second or third or twentieth drink once he's already had the first one. 

Pedophilia, on the other hand, involves a normal impulse, but directed at an unacceptable target. We are *supposed* to want to have sex, survival of the species and all, but obviously we're not supposed to want to have sex with prepubescent children. In other words, the challenge in treating pedophiles is that the urge to have sex is correct and natural, yet theirs is broken and can't be fixed. 

Currently, the best that we can do to treat pedophiles is to give them medication that suppresses all sexual desire, including the desire directed at children, and psychotherapy to help cope with it all. Unfortunately, many pedophiles do not seek treatment because their doctors must report them to the authorities, ruining their lives. 

Perhaps it would be better *not* to demonize pedophiles who recognize their problem and seek treatment. "

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1389883326.0,"When I was very young I grew up in a family where me (the boy) was taught how to cook, clean, do laundry, sew, and equally, my protesting sister was taught to weed, garden, shovel snow, mow and trim the lawn. My mom phrased things positively like ""girls like a guy who cooks"" so equality was prominent in my home. And my mom never caved no matter how much my sister protested mowing the lawn. 

Also, in an award-winning school system in a small town, all kids were required to take a sewing class and cooking class in junior high. The teacher made sure all the guys (and girls) got a chance to cook something at least once. I hated those days, their food was mostly awful. I was the only guy in the class that could cook, and cook well. 

I had bad experiences with feminists in college. Little did I know college is where the extremists tend to congregate. But I tried not to let that make me jaded. When I did talk about equal rights with friends, I did find most of them to be moderate feminists who also supported men's rights. 

By 1985 my friend had internet email (Compu$erv gateway), by 1987 I had my own internet email, by 1989 I had web access (there wasn't much on the web before that anyway). So I've spend a lot of time online almost every day. I just like learning new things. But after continued bad experiences with some feminists online, and MRAs, I can't call myself either. I just say I'm for equal rights for all. 

I make an extra effort not to assume hostility in a person's comment, and try to understand their perception, because perception (and their personal experience) plays a huge part in a person's opinions.

The Natives never had a chance once the Europeans started coming to America. Their immune systems couldn't take it. I suppose this is what you'd call survival of the fittest. If their systems could have combat the diseases then I agree that history would have been different.

evilbrent,careerguidance,1389883649.0,"I always look at it like this: if it's the right job you'll do well in the interview. You'll be relaxed, you'll know how to answer their questions, you'll have intelligent input. If it's the wrong job you'll stumble and stutter, you'll spill your drink about laugh inappropriately.

Basically if it's meant to be then it will all just happen swimmingly. And the reason that's good news is that you can relax. Either you'll be nerve free and get the job or have nerves and not get it. So you might as well relax. You can't change the outcome, in a way, so just go with it. They'll like you or they won't.

But remember, aside from the fact that you applied, THEY called YOU because on the face of it they think you could potentially do the job. They had their chance to laugh in your face when they read your resume, but they didn't. They had their chance to mock you on the phone interview, but it didn't happen did it?

Even if this is a long shot for you, there is absolutely no reason to not believe you can get the job. And further, it shows that your practice of putting yourself out there and sending out resumes is a valid activity. Remember, skills can be taught, procedures can be learnt, but positivity, which is say you have, comes with the person. I'd far prefer to hire someone with the right attitude and the wrong skills than the other way around because you can fix skills, you can't fix attitude.

When we weaned my older son, nights were the worst. We co-slept (still do), and it felt like he was waking up just so he could nurse back to sleep. He was about 14-15 months old at the time. I finally decided I couldn't take the stress from lack of sleep when I found out I was pregnant again. He started to nurse *more* and I was miserable.

Personally, I don't do CIO. That's my choice for my family. What I did was tell my son that he could nurse for 5 minutes, and after that we would cuddle and I would sing to him. The first couple of nights he cried a lot, in my arms, when my 5 minute timer went off and I unlatched him. Then it was pretty smooth for a week or so. Then he started sleeping for 2-3 hours at a time, instead of 4-6. So I only nursed him every second or third time that he'd wake - still on a 5 minute timer, still with cuddles and songs. After a month, maybe a little less, we ended breastfeeding. He was a week or two shy of 18 months.

As for co-sleeping still, he goes to sleep in his room, and somewhere between midnight and 4 am he wakes up, walks himself to our room, and snuggles up to my husband. This works for us. I hope you find what works for you!"

PirateCodingMonkey,bisexual,1389883684.0,"it depends on *why* you are doing the ""nofap"" thing. if it's to regulate or diminish your porn consumption, you can do that without stopping masturbation. if you are doing it for health reasons or to retrain your response, you can do that and still enjoy porn.

&gt; porn objectifies women, and has real cognitive effects on attitudes/opinions/emotions/behaviors, etc, etc. I'm with her there -- but I countered that it's important, then, to moderate porn consumption, and realize that porn itself is NOT reality.

this is the correct way to handle porn. yes, realize that str8 porn objectifies women (as much as gay porn objectifies men) and it does influence your attitudes, opinions, and behaviors dependent on how much and how often you consume it. limiting your consumption or consuming porn that is sex and person positive (yes, it does exist) can help with that.

&gt; One time in the past, we talked at length about my bisexuality, but it hasn't come up since. In the abstract, she is okay with it and accepts me. In reality, being bisexual by definition means I'm into girls and guys. It means that I like to sometimes imagine being with a dude.

this, i think, is the most relevant part of your argument. i had the same issue with my now-ex. even before we got together, she knew that i was bi, but not being in an open relationship, i also used porn to help with imagining myself with men. eventually, she assumed that my bisexuality was a phase or whatever.

you owe it to yourself and to her to make sure she ""knows"" that you are still attracted to men. continue to talk about it, while assuring her that while you with her, you are and have been monogamous. you might invite her to watch porn with you (many women, both str8 and lesbian, enjoy gay porn) and you can use that as a backdrop to enjoying intimate times together.

the point is, you can consume and enjoy porn without masturbation, as much as you can masturbate without consuming porn. however, i think in this case it is more about bi-erasure in your relationship.

best of luck to you."

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389883698.0,"&gt;Now replace killing someone with ""wearing black on a friday"". Under relativism, you'd be fine with imprisoning someone for that if people voted on it. But your justification seems kind of weak.

Sure, we prescribe the laws and people have to fall in line and follow them or ship out, but you're diverting the discussion to government now.

You keep looking for an external justification, and the point of moral relativism is that *there is none*. Society is the arbiter of justification. A bunch of people got together and formed a society, and they decided that wearing black on Friday was an illegal action (this doesn't necessarily mean that it is immoral, just illegal). If people want to be a part of a society that allows them to wear black, then they should try to change that within the current one or form a new coalition. In the meantime, whether or not it lines up with their moral code, they have to keep in mind that *they will be punished for wearing black on Fridays*. This is a simple fact."
devonclaire,AskCulinary,1389883700.0,"Instead of greek yogurt, I would stir in canned coconut milk. You can get it from the Indian or Asian section of any supermarket, and it tastes fantastic in curry.

The other suggestion I have is maybe you need to pick out the beef, piece by piece, and just toss it. (I know it's wasteful, but it's less wasteful than tossing the entire crockpot of food.) Then, cut up some boneless skinless chicken thighs (or breasts, whatever) and sautee them over medium-high heat in a pan until they're cooked and have some brown crust on the surface. Add those to the curry to give it some protein and some good flavor. 

Good luck!

megawompwomp,OkCupid,1389883709.0,"&gt; How did you meet?

On OkC. 

&gt; What were your initial thoughts when you saw them for the first time? 

Glad he looks like his profile pics.

&gt; What drew you to them?

His personality. Dude can carry on a conversation with the best of them. 

&gt; Was the first kiss good? Was it early?

First date. I gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He looked at me funny and went in for a kiss. It was good.

&gt; How many dates did you go on before the talk?

However many dates we went on over the course of a month and a half. 8? 10? No idea, really.

&gt; How long have you been exclusive?

We had ""the talk"" in early March last year, but had both established beforehand that we weren't dating anyone else (and hadn't been since our first date in January). So either a year or 10 months, depending on how you're counting.

&gt; What interesting things have you done so far? What is your favorite?

Well, we've moved in together. 

&gt; What are some qualities you like about the person that sets them above the rest?

I already mentioned that he can carry on a conversation with the best of them. There's just something that ""clicks"" with us - we work well together. Sure, there have been challenges over the past year, but we've been able to work through them. Also, he has a cute butt and is an excellent big spoon.

&gt; What are some challenges you might face? Or have faced?

See that whole ""moving in together"" thing. It's been an adjustment (still in the process of combining all our crap), but we both agree that this is the next step toward a future together.

&gt; Do you think about your future, or is still too early to tell?

Oh yes. I've already figured out what our babies will look like. Wait, should I have admitted that?

&gt; If you could describe your perfect date with this person, what would it be?

We're both in our 30s, working full-time jobs, and live together. So I suppose any date that gets us out of the house and forces me to put on something other than sweatpants."

JayMayo,tall,1389883865.0,"I don't think short guys are inferior as human beings or as men. And I've known plenty of short guys who still managed to be alpha males and confident around women. So in that regard, I've always assumed it is mostly confidence/personality/attitude which determined your social stance and height can only help you so much.

But to answer your question directly and bluntly:

&gt; Do you feel: ""Wow he's good. But he's still short""?

That's exactly how I feel when I see a short guy who is better than me at something. It might be a defense mechanism on my end, just patting myself on my own back that at least I'm still tall, but that's always the case. 

There's a guy in my gym who is ripped and could kick my ass, but only like 5'10"", which is not even short, but I'd never trade his body for mine. And I always feel like I could just punch him once, Hulk style, and end the fight quickly. And it's not the case at all, but having 6"" on him makes me feel much more powerful. 

But you can't help your height. You need to make the best of it. Being short didn't stop Tom Cruise from being a high profile actor, a sex symbol, and a guy who played a lot of badasses in his time. It shouldn't stop you from living your life. You won't have it as easy as a tall person in certain regards, but there are other areas in which you probably shine and I, for instance, don't. That's what life is, you get some flaws, you also get some qualities. Can't change that, but you can change how you act about it. "

Invest in some fermcap, because this will probably blow over.

There's lots of methods on the fermentation side you can use to get high attenuation and higher abv but 10%abv should be easy enough to attain with most yeasts without getting too complicated. If you are really worried using EC-1118 it's a wine yeast from lavalin i think. Can handle upwards of 14% abv (anecdotally in my own wines).

I'm inclined to agree with you on the matter, but since I don't view morality as all black and white I also have my own reservations and thus a bit of cognitive dissonance on the matter.

In my final year of highschool I had a colostomy bag for six months and it took a little while to get used to it. I went on a leadership 'camp' with several of my classmates and on the return bus trip I started to notice a strange smell (reminiscent of vomit) and I had no idea where it was coming from. As time went by the people around me started to notice and complain; it was then that I had a horrifying epiphany. I put my hand down my pants to where the bottom of the colostomy bag was and I felt something wet and kind of chunky. My suspicions had been confirmed; the seal at the bottom of the bag had burst because too much pressure had been allowed to build up inside.
The complaints of my peers became louder and more insistent and it was then that I had to pipe up. Luckily my friends new about my situation and were very understanding, but the final twenty minutes of that trip were very uncomfortable for me.

1. She has custody so I get to see my son every other weekend and 1 night each week. She now has more influence over him. However, when I am alone with him, he is a different kid and I am more free to influence him. I hope to have him living with me by the time he is 12. Still a net loss. 

2. I had to give up half of our checking, savings and stock accounts. I have to pay her child support (for 10 years) and alimony (only for 5 years). I also have to give up part of my 401k.  Again a loss, and it may affect my retirement.

3. Dating is actually not that bad. I am lucky and found a great woman that I get along with amazingly well and the sex is great. YMMV.

So, did I do the right thing? For me, absolutely YES!!.   
It took me some time to realize that my happiness was more important than the money. I am in control of my own life, and I am happier than I have been in a long time. 

Good luck to you. "

Obviously, it would be easier to PCS and start receiving BAH and whatnot if you are married, but not being married won't disadvantage your boyfriend/fiance in any way. However, you will have to wait until he has the free time to have a wedding and then deal with all the paperwork after the fact. It's not impossible or too difficult, really.

Talk it out. Determine what you want in terms of a wedding. If you *want* to get married now, get married. Don't do it because you feel obligated.

EtherBoo,AskReddit,1389884528.0,"I see this question come up on reddit all the time.  If you're interviewing in a corporate setting, this is a terrible question to ask.  Let's forget the advice that's already come out of here (making the interviewer think about reasons not to hire you on your way out of the interview).


Let's say the interview went well.  If the interview was going well, those concerns were already addressed.  That's because you're making the interviewer feel good and they don't want to lose a good candidate over a couple of concerns that can be addressed.  If it went bad, they just want to get you off the phone or out of the office.  Just because you asked the question doesn't mean they need to give an honest answer.   In a bad interview, they'd probably say something like, ""No. This all looks great."" Then move on.

People by nature don't like confrontation, and you're basically saying, ""Come at me bro"".  Corporate settings are all about dancing around confrontation and dealing with office politics (some offices are **much** worse than others).  It can be the epitome of 1984-esque double-speak.  

One of the most important job skills you can learn are ""soft-skills"".  These are skills that aren't trained like how to use software or how to log a trouble ticket with facilities. You want to ask questions that show off your soft-skills, not questions that back the interviewer into a corner.

Additionally, using this as a go-to question could end up completely futile.  For my first corporate job, I didn't even interview with people in the same department.  It was purely behavioral (""Tell me about a time you had to go against your team's decision..."").  They were specifically looking to make sure you were telling a situation, action, and resolution.  

What you really want, on top of a question that shows your soft-skills, is a question that's open ended (not a yes/no answer) and, if applicable, makes the interviewer imagine you in the role.  If you're interviewing with your manager, that's when you want them to imagine you in the role. If it's with HR or random person you'll never work with, one that emphasises soft-skills and makes them think about positive things.

Please let me know if I can expand on anything."

KatieKLE,writing,1389884583.0,"A lot of stuff here is just a general rehashing of the usual anti-indie stuff. Here's some reasons that are indie-positive to think about.

Your genre isn't indie friendly. What sells as an indie ebook now is what sold as a cheap paperback original in the 50s/60s (""it's a dirty story of a dirty man..."" etc.) and what sold as a pulp in the 30s/40s. Edgy or erotic romance, action adventure science fiction and fantasy, horror, ""mens' adventure (guys shooting stuff). The best selling stuff for indies are works that are intended as inexpensive entertainment. You can add a side order of ""ignored genres."" I've heard of people doing really well with epic fantasy because after being a staple of SF/F for the 70s to early 90s, it almost totally disappeared leaving a voracious if not particularly huge market that was underserved. On the other side, literary fiction has never been a mass market seller and it's not going to do well for most indies. For one thing, the literary fiction market is, dare I say, a bit stodgy and dubious of not only indies, but ebooks in general. It also relies heavily on established publishing houses and brands as a seal of approval. Tough market to crack with a $2.99 indie ebook.

Length of work. The market for shorter works with the trade press is pretty mediocre. When I read anthology calls paying $25-100, I just break out laughing. 

You're not prolific. If you can't keep grinding out work and keeping your name out there, you don't want to be an indie. The number one way of marketing yourself is also boughts and frequent releases. Some people thrive on this, others don't. 

You don't want to put the time into the business aspects or your layout/graphic skills are mediocre. Just my opinion, but the more you can do as an indie, particularly when you're starting out, the more money goes into your pocket and the lower your risk is.

You won't write to the market. A big part of the business aspect is that just like a publisher won't pick up books that won't sell, don't go indie if you aren't interested in writing what sells. You need to follow the market and you need to write what people are going to read. One of the huge advantages indies have is beating the trads to hot trends. This doesn't mean you need to write billionaire romances if you're a science fiction writer, but it means if you're a romance author, you should have had a billionaire story out in  2012 and an angsty New Adult with damaged characters in 2013.

You want to get rich. Hugh Howey pointed this out in an article, but the real strength of indies isn't in the few people like him who are making huge amounts of money on bestsellers and getting in the news. It's people earning a normal middle class income or supplementing a job through regular commercial writing. I know a lot of these people. You've never heard of them, they aren't on the best seller list unless they're part of a .99 cent bundle, but they're making five or ten thousand dollars a month. "

now, for the specifics. he ""hung out"" with another man last night, and this is making you feel jealous and wondering whether he is ""cheating"" on you. my first question is: have you made a commitment to him to be exclusive? has that been discussed at all? yes, you are having a nice time with him and you are getting to know each other, but if you haven't discussed where your relationship is going, why shouldn't he go out with someone else?

&gt; I know he hung out with a guy last night and said that they had dinner and a movie (which sounds like a date to me), but then if that was the case, I thought it was pretty straight forward of him to flat out tell me he was hanging out (supposedly non-sexily) with another guy.

this sounds like you heard ""through the grape vine"" that he was out with someone, not that he told you he was doing it. have you asked him about it? or did he tell you he was doing it?

as for me, i have friends that i go to dinner and a movie with quite often, and it is not sexual. it is two friends who enjoy each other's company.

you owe it to yourself to talk to him. talk about your relationship, how you are feeling, and what your expectations are. then see if they align with what he is feeling and expecting. if they do, move forward and stop listening to the people who *aren't in your relationship*. if they don't align, then you know that he is probably not someone you want to move forward with. best of luck."

While every man experiences privilege differently due to his own individual position in the social hierarchy, **every man, by virtue of being read as male by society, benefits from male privilege.**

If you have issue with the [synonym](http://thesaurus.com/browse/privilege) favour for privilege, then I can't help you, that is the English language.

&gt;You're getting confused here about the word ""privilege"". Every male may benefit from ""male privilege"", but that does not mean every man is privileged in general. What that means is that men don't face the same barriers to attaining positions of power that women do. Sure, plenty of men have trouble attaining positions of power, but tends to be for reasons other than gender (in a patriarchal society anyway).

You're not getting the point. Because people who happen to be men are in positions of power does not mean that men as whole receive some special privilege because of this. It's not about men obtaining having trouble gaining positions of power. It's about the fact that a group of people who have power, who happen to be men, **has absolutely no bearing on any other man in the rest of society.**

&gt;You seem to be interpreting the statement ""All men benefit from male privilege"" as meaning that all men are ""better off"" than women, or less ""oppressed"".

Oh come on. Now you are being completely disingenuous. Feminist theory strictly states that women are the ""oppressed"" class. 

&gt; In each instance, the perspective you've chosen to analyze things from is only one source of data, just one factor among countless others.

On the contrary. My perspective is including every part of feminism, just properly. When one describes feminism, one must describe what is a part of every ""feminism"". What do I mean by this? Think of feminism as a genus and the different parts of feminism as a species, ie. marxists or radicals. I cannot say that feminism looks at economic classes because that is not true. Marxist feminists look at that. Not feminism. Other forms of feminism do not look at it all. When a person describes feminism they must choose the parts that are the same throughout all feminism disciplines. And that boils down to two main things, patriarchy theory, and male privilege. It's not equality (as there are strains of feminism that think women are superior and society should be structured as such), and it's not whatever particular brand you happen to subscribe too.

hungryhungryhorus,personalfinance,1389884727.0,"This is the case with all mortgages.  At or around the time you recieve a mortgage you will receive an amortization table listing each month's payments and how much goes to principal and how much goes to interest.  What percentage goes to what depends on the life of the loan, interest rate, and principal balance.

An example would be to say that for your very first payment, 99% is interest and 1% is principal.  Then month two is 98% interest and 2% principal and so on until the last month is 1% interest and 99% principal and the loan is paid off.

You can use something like this to figure it out: http://www.myamortizationchart.com/

I should say though that my explanation only works for fixed rate mortgages.  With an adjustable rate the ratio would fluctuate in conjunction with the interest rate but the same **principle**(not principal) would apply.

Loans are structured this way so that lenders can start making a large profit right away, especially considering most mortgages aren't held for more than 10 years (sales, refinance, etc.)

Finally, now that you are aware of this, it should be pretty easy to see how payments made towards principal early on would have a much greater affect toward bringing the lifetime of your mortgage to an end quickly than would a payment at the end of the loan."

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1389884742.0,"I wonder if this should be a ~~private~~ restricted subreddit. (Restricted = anyone can view, only certain listed users can post. The listed users can be a balanced qty of known MRAs and feminists for starters. The starting users could be 20-30 regular posters who are known to give high quality posts.) That means, moderators would have to type in  500+ current usernames to allow them to post. New users would have to be vetted to make sure the balance is restored, but then again, people could lie. If they say they are feminist, but turn out to be MRA, how are we going to track that? It could be an administration headache. 

However, we could try it for a week or two, and see how it goes. 

EDIT: I'm looking into the limits of a ""restricted"" subreddit. My question is, can only listed submitters create a new topic? And can only listed submitters make comments?

&gt; 
&gt; There's currently no real difference between the left and the right (this is not surprising if you read Monnet's English colleague who said presidents must be turned into little mayors). But oh boy do they continue to blame each other while not talking about the EU. 

You didn't get my example: when your party loses the elections, and therefore another party or coalition will make the rules for the next year - which you disagree with - will you also claim that your country is an undemocratic one?

It's pitiful how people waste their time with a return to an imaginary golden past. If you manage to break up the EU, you'll still have to win the battle against austerity in each individual country... but this time, you'll be a dwarf trying to deal with the financial giants of the world.

&gt;Europe was made with full institutional legitimacy but not from a democratic movement, it's from enlightened despotism.

""Democratic"" also means ""popular"" or ""populist"" in Italy. I wouldn't find it strange from that perspective to try and put something in the ""not Berlusconi"" camp. Anyway, I'm sure you'll disagree with many other things he said, so why suddenly agree with this :p

&gt;And by joing NATO first (talking about Baltics), as requested by Bush Jr. Apparently, ""there is no conflict between membership in NATO and membership in the European Union"".
That's in the treaties too (article 42 of the TEU): the EU should adopt a common defense policy, no objection is made to those who consider their NATO membership as their defense policy.
If NATO membership is not in conflict with the EU defense policy and it's even the common one, this means EU = NATO + US, represented by the judeo-christian block in Samuel Huntington's racialist book The Clash of Civilisations and the Remaking of World Order. And they're opposed to the evil Muslims and Asians.

WTF man. Are you going to leave the NATO too?

&gt;Some issues in the EP are not present in national parliaments since everyone agrees in the country anyway (animal feed)

Some issues in the national parliaments aren't present in the municipality council of Kleinkirchen-upon-Isère either, but that doesn't mean we should get back to feudal territorial arrangements.

&gt;If the choices made by that parliament cause unemployment, the population is fine with paying unemployment benefits without batting an eye since they have a sense of belonging to the same country. You do not have that in Europe because there is no European demos.

There's significant disagreement about unemployment benefits within every country. It's called politics.

&gt;I don't disagree, and that's exactly why I want out. The EU doesn't represent the real affinities between people. We do not have the same interests just because we're neighbours, far from it. Alliances can be made at the WTO between countries who share the same interests. The following day we can make alliances with others on another matter against the same countries we were allied the day before. We need to take our seat back at the WTO.

Hahaha. You've only got a say as part of the EU, the largest market on the planet. If the EU changes its standards, China has to adapt. If a single EU country changes its standards, they can be happy if China sends an official with actual power to get things to the explanatory meeting... because half of their provinces are more populous and therefore more important.

Anyway, we've seen how good you are in making alliances at the European level - Rofl.

&gt;Even if you want to bailout those in need of help, you can't do it alone, you need Germany's help. Are they okay with austerity ? Absolutely. Convince them first, the rest is empty talk. Why would they throw away their efforts accumulated with the Hartz reforms ? Good luck with that.

They have been made to accept the ECB being the lender of last resort. When their current economic policy will be shown not to be infallible, as it inevitably will, they will budge too. They can either relax printing policy and let the Euro devalue a little, or they can let it go bust... and then they'll have to devalue a lot, because their currency will be much too strong to export.

&gt;I can elaborate on optimal currency area and asymmetrical shock theories if you want me to.

Countries all over the world have been impacted by the crisis, it wasn't caused by the Euro but by excessive credit creation by private banks. It was the stubborn refusal of sovereignity retentionists to allow it to work that barred the Eurozone from weathering that shock.

Besides, those asymmetrical shock theories are arguments against *any* currency: surely London, Wales and Manchester react differently to economic trends?

&gt;Look at the krona exchange rate and compare it to the other countries. Sweden devalued its currency during the crisis while the others couldn't.

Belgium couldn't, and yet had the same policy and the same good results. The currency didn't make a difference, the policy did.

&gt;My bad, I meant capital movement.

Capital was moving about long before people did. Folding back on your national border will not hinder capital, but it will hinder people.

&gt;What does that have to do with the safeguard of my industrial sector ?

- [Forbidden Island/Desert] should be shorter than Pandemic (don't know about FD) and easy enough to play
- [DC Deckbuilding Game]
- [Anomia] with a filtered deck can work. Maybe those kids don't know blues musicians.. so just remove that card
- [Bohnanza]
- [Two Rooms and a Boom] if you feel like doing the work of ordering cards from artscow or whatever could be a pretty fun game
- [Dixit] of course 
- [Snake Oil] similar game play all creativity (plays like Apples to Apples but without all the complete brain drain for the older kids)
- [Wits and Wagers] for the trivia fun times

Well, there are some more things. Although I could be content with her fellating my fingers while I fuck her (oh, I wanna feel how talented her tongue is), I also plan to hold her throat, to show her what my hands can do to her. Also, I will tell her that I can tell apart whether she is afraid of me, or if she likes it.

There is something she definitely hasn't come across yet, and that's breath play. I will hold my hand over her mouth, and if she doesn't behave, even close her nose with my thumb and index finger. One of my hands is big enough to keep her from breathing.

TheLittleGoodWolf,MensRights,1389885368.0,"Okay then, I suppose we won't fully agree.

My reasoning behind ""disposal"" is that from a purely logical standpoint it's necessary due to other problems that can arise. And while having your organs harvested after death won't do much difference to you (because you are dead) removing that choice becomes a slippery slope. Where does it end? Can medical personnel claim ""emergency"" and just take an organ? Could you as family decide to ""sell"" the body for medical testing? when you stretch one rule enough it eventually breaks.

In the case of burials etc it's not a question of do or do not (as in DNR or organ donation) but a question of how. The body has to be disposed of one way or the other, there is no choice. In the other areas there is a choice.

As you have described, this is exacly why I don't want this decision in another persons hands, it's unfair and mean. The choice to put the decision in another persons hand's should still be though.

As it sometimes does, the law and my own morality don't agree, such is life in a democracy.

sortaplainnonjane,beyondthebump,1389885738.0,"I'll never forget the show 20/20 (or Dateline or whoever) had on this.  One story was about a small boy the dad forgot.  All day long, the boy kept trying to get out and he repeatedly triggered the car alarm.  His dad turned it off remotely and continued his job.  When the dad got to his car, he realized what had been happening but it was far too late.  God, my heart broke.  

To intentionally do that?  Well, there should be a pretty strong charge to go with that.  

I don't personally understand how you could forget our kiddo, but I do think it's worthwhile to know some tricks if you're prone to that.  The two big ones include putting your cell phone by the car seat since you're not likely to forget that for very long, or putting a doll/stuffed animal in the car seat.  When baby is in the car seat, the toy goes in the passenger seat so you have a visual cue that baby is back there.  "

Well, if it was a small element of the game it might. Ifyour entire game is played through the screen of your phone it's goign to be shit, but as a quick little gimmick it might have been good on a controller.

 And the answer I guess is ""no"" because they've dropped it.

You just asked for help imagining why it might have been good in the first place - as I said before, they thought it might be cool, had a few ideas and it turned out not to be worth it.

A bit like when the Wii first came out.

&gt; This all seems to suffer from the Kinect syndrome. The idea is potentially awesome and works in a limited number of applications, but developers will find ways to squeeze it into their games needlessly.

JaminSousaphone,tall,1389886171.0,"Personality is the only reason why I would ever take someones height into consideration and judge them to do with it.

It's no different to race or gender. You can't help being tall, you can't help being short (bar smoking and drinking through pregnancy, but still it's not your fault) If I was to meet a short guy who to me was just an absolute cunt then i'd probably put it down to his size ""Oh well he's just got short man syndrome trying to be a big man because he's 4 foot nothing"" However it's the same with tall guys ""Oh well he's a cunt because he's ten foot something and things he's big n 'ard"" That's the only way i'd make a prejudice statement to do with someones height, but even then it's more often a thought than a verbal statement. 

When it comes to those shorter than me I don't see them as my lesser, I don't see them as weak, smaller inferior in anyway because you'd have to be a colossal twat to think that. The way I see it is when i'm stood about (e.g at the pub last night) an empty bar with me stood there like a lanky streak of piss with my long spindly arms and legs stretching from side to side of the bar as I wait, I feel self-conscious, that feeling where i'm like, I look so weird right now at this bar, my head is hitting the low hanging lights and i'm having to slouch yet I have infinte bar space width wise, just not height wise. 
Times like this I envy the shorter folk as they blend in. I'd imagine when you're REALLY short and I mean an inch or two off being diagnosed with dwarfism is just as bad as they may also feel the same way but for opposite and obvious reasons.

Theungry,nfl,1389886438.0,"I would create performance specs for helmets that would provide durable impact protection without being hard enough to cause bouncing impacts, and cut a fat bonus check to the first company to meet the specifications.  Then I would get rid of defenseless receiver and illegal contact penalties.

I would go down to 2 pre-season games, and expand the regular season to 16 games per team over an 18 week schedule, with 2 bye weeks for teams.  This would add extra national games for all the networks (more $!) while also increasing player health.  Every team would get a bye before their Thursday game, and if relevant after a Monday night/cross country/international game.

I would get rid of the extra point.  TDs would be worth 7, or you could risk 1 point for the option to go for a 2 point conversion by either scoring a TD from the 1 yard line or kicking a FG with the ball spotted at the 40.

I would eliminate the current OT system and install a timed OT.  Continuous 7.5 minute OT periods (eigths - half the time of a quarter) until the tie is broken at the end of one of them.  Max 2 extra periods in the regular season, unlimited in the playoffs.  Coin flip at the start of the first OT, but afterwards each extra 7.5 minute period is just treat like a new quarter, switch sides on the field and continue play.

I would make every play review-able in every way (Pass interference, holding, anything), and it would never be the officials in the stadium reviewing.  A league office team of reviewers would handle the calls for consistency.  Coaches would still only have 2 challenges per game with a third available only if the first 2 were successful challenges.  The presumption that coaches would now ALWAYS use all their challenges and slow down the game would be balanced by the time saved by not kicking extra points.

I would make the 6th seed in both playoff brackets open to teams from either conference.  No more 11-5 teams sitting home while an 8-8 team goes in the opposite conference.

I would change so that any team that didn't make the playoffs could either draft in their slot, ordered by worst record, OR they could pass on their spot and take 2 players at the end of the round.  This would actually give bad teams a better chance to restock if the perfect high pick player wasn't available to them, and also give playoff teams a chance at some better singular talents in the draft effectively moving them up a notch for every ""pass"", but putting them behind in later rounds.

I would mandate 10 always on cameras in every stadium capturing definitive angles from the top of each goal post, the end zone lines and all 4 sidelines.

I would remove marijuana from substance abuse testing.

Lastly, I would fire Jeff Triplette and his entire crew, and I would make the ref grading process transparent, but only in the off-season.  I would up the $ in the ref contract and make it full time, and at the same time hold them to a publicly stated standard."

I don't think dominance in sex is *important*--that is, I don't think it's a required skill or anything like that--but I personally love it and find it incredibly arousing for my male partner to be rough and controlling.

I think I understand what you mean by ""do the whole work"" (be the initiator/aggressor/planner/decider), but I want to point out that being submissive/on the bottom is also work! When my partner is being dominant, I'm not always some passive fuckdoll that he wrangles about on the bed (sometimes I am, and that's hot as hell)--I'm more often having to do as he directs, holding difficult positions, etc.

When they hired me, they told me that because I'd asked, they took the things I'd mentioned into consideration and moved me higher up the pay scale.

koh522,beyondthebump,1389886549.0,"My two year old does the head banging thing, though not to the point of bruises. The leas attention I give him when he does it, the sooner it's over. He usually comes crying to me, wants a hug and cuddles, and tells me his head hurts. I always point out that if he wouldn't bang his head then it wouldn't hurt. Not making fun or anything - just stating it to him as fact, just the same as if I'd said the sky was blue or touching a hot pot is going to hurt.

That being said, I've learned to see his tantrum triggers (usually), and try to cut them off before they get to that point. I get down on my knees so he and I are eye-level, and talk to him. Often, getting him to make eye contact with me and getting a hug &amp; kiss will distract him just enough that he will calm down to tell me what he wants or what's wrong.

You know this, but sometimes it helps to be reminded: treat him like he's a human being, because he understands more than you think; talk to him as if he understands, and get on his level (physically low to the ground) so that you are equals instead of you dominating him. In the end, you're still the Mom and you're still in charge - and you have a much better handle on him than when he's banging his head."

I just don't think he's an exception to how the Turkish judiciary works (and he's not the only instance that I complain about). One may believe violence is necessary as a means to whatever end. That does not then make one a terrorist, unless they act upon that idea. Freedom of speech matters, and there's a not-so-thin line between words and action. I don't like the guy (to put it lightly), nor do I agree with his ideas, that doesn't mean I want to see him jailed for his ideas. IBDA-C was a terrorist group. Salih Mirzabeyoğlu approved of them and his ideas inspired their acts. He himself wasn't involved in the group, nor did he found it. He's in jail (was going to be hanged, actually, had capital punishment not been abolished) for what he *wrote*, not for what he *did*.

edit: to clarify, he was going to be executed for 'attempting to overthrow the government'. The police, the military and MIT all officially agree that he wasn't involved in any violence. The court admitted that there was no proof that he contacted or even knew the actual terrorists that committed the crimes. The only 'proof' that he founded or was involved in IBDA-C was that he was referred to by the nickname ""Kumandan"" by some group members (as I said, the group agreed with and was inspired by his ideas). So when I say he's in jail for what he wrote, I'm not referring to his official 'crime', but what led to it.

edit2: I see you've pasted your comment from eksisozluk, but let's also note here that those quotes are from the magazine Taraf, not directly from Mirzabeyoğlu as he didn't write for the magazine (unless they're from his interviews there, but that much isn't clear)."

Also, reincarnation supposedly works according to an evolution in consciousness. You wouldn't reincarnate into a beetle because your previous lives will have already ""leveled up"" to the highest state of being, which is human. The next highest state is Awareness/nirvana/releasing yourself from the cycle of reincarnation and joining God, the ultimate state of Awareness/Consciousness.

Wollaton is nice, quiet, next to Wollaton park us nice for walks etc. it's a bit closer to the city but didn't have the same access to shops etc.

also have a look at west Bridgeford, it's a very nice area, few students, good schools etc and a good high street. it's also close to swimming pools and gyms and there's a big asda. you can get buses into the city and it's really not far. it's on Rushcliff council not Nottingham, but definitely worth a look!"

WithMyFaceInMyPalm,AskMen,1389887182.0,"The beginning is rough for a number of reasons. One being that you are too focused on getting validation from a girl - any girl - and you put too much pressure on yourself for a girl to accept you and like you. It's difficult because you put little to no importance on what YOU actually want and what YOU like about these early girls you date. When they shoot you down or when things don't work out and you get dropped like a sack of garbage it hurts like hell because you never got the chance to know them yet they've already made up their mind about you.

You need experience to figure out who you're compatible with, what's out there, what to look for etc but many times starting off you get shot down too early without having the chance to figure out all of this stuff.

Put the highest importance on what YOU want or think you want in a partner and see how the girls you interact with stack up.

They have never been good on training, but I never really valued structured training.  I enjoy learning on my own, which is one reason I'm good at my job.

skfoto,askcarsales,1389887584.0,"Leasing companies will set limits on how long you can lease, and they'll also incentivize certain lease terms to make the deals more attractive.

The bank we use for Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge vehicles limits leasing to 48 months. But- all their specials are 36-39 months, and they have a special lease rate for those terms. Doing a term other than that results in a lower residual (car is one year older at the end of lease) and loss of the special rate. Do the math, and the 48 month payment is actually HIGHER than the 36 month. I'd suspect Honda Financial does something similar- if they don't outright limit the term to 36 months, there probably are other factors that make a 48 month lease so unattractive there's no reason to even consider it."

lamblikeawolf,short,1389887614.0,"&gt;most guys on here can tell you that being a ""nice guy"" has gotten them nowhere but the friend zone. 

Right. Because if you talk to a woman you think is attractive, or ten women, or a hundred women, at least one of them is **entitled** to date you.

Some girls are straight bitches, but to say that being nice only gets you to the friend zone is bullshit. ""Friend zoning"" is an easy excuse to grab for when things don't go your way, when there could literally be hundreds of factors involved.

Maybe I'm just particularly annoyed by it because a guy I knew in highschool thought every girl he ever talked to put him ""in the friend zone."" He started talking to me, and we had several things in common. However, I could tell he was attracted to me, and I didn't feel the same way about him. I told him that I just liked him as a friend, because I prefer to be clear and direct about these things. That didn't stop him from getting mad at me when I started dating someone else a few months later. He even told me ""I feel like (my boyfriend's name) is getting in between us."" I saw this kind of thing happen to him with other girls in highschool, and it was like every time, to him, it was the female's fault and she ""put him in the friend zone."" 

Granted, some of those females were less direct about it than I was, but it wouldn't have mattered. If they didn't date him, they were ""putting him in the friend zone."" Like it was malicious. In reality, the guy had some pretty severe self-esteem and anger issues, and was fairly socially awkward. As I understand it, he has worked on a lot of these things since then, but I stopped talking to him after he called me a bitch and got into a huge argument with me over my best friend not dating him.

I'm not trying to say that sometimes this doesn't happen with malicious intent, but someone just wanting to be friends with a guy instead of dating them doesn't automatically make it some kind of conspiracy against the guy."

DoxasticPoo,RedPillWomen,1389887644.0,"Man here.

Not many woman take the time to think about seduction and Pickup strategy, but in a way you've stumbled upon one of the greatest pickup truths.

Seduction is not convincing a woman to sleep with you.  It's not manipulating her into bed.

True seduction is vulnerability.  Opening up, showing her who you are, and letting her decide if she's attracted, which if you're RP she will be.

And over time, as the vulnerability increases the simple seduction turns into love.  As the vulnerability goes through the roof, scares you senseless, makes you wonder if you can take it, feels like you're standing on the edge of a skyscraper, yet you know he holds onto you so you won't fall, that is love.

Without the will to be vulnerable, it's something you will never experience.

And that is one of the most sad things about feminism and what it's done to our girls.  It's made them unloveable."

With the massive interest in this match, it's highly unlikely these will go on general sale either.

Ingenium21,malefashionadvice,1389887725.0,"1)  Cut that hair.  But don't just cut the hair, find yourself a nice barbershop or salon, look through [this slideshow](http://www.gq.com.au/style/grooming/mens+hairstyles+2014,26552) find a couple that you like and you think would fit with your bone structure, and take the picture(s) to the hairdresser.  

2)  Jeans and a tshirt is basically the rice cake of male fashion.  It has its place, and on certain occasions is the perfect thing to wear, but just like eating rice cakes for every meal, wearing that for every occasion gets old very quickly. 

3)  While we are on the subject. Graphic Tshirts are shaky territory.  If you pair it with the correct pants and a couple of good accessories(more on this later) you can look very stylish.   [This is what DJ MOS looks like when wearing Jeans and a graphic T](http://www.contactmusic.com/pics/le/yrb_magazine_issue_party_210511/dj-mos_3355526.jpg).  

4) I read on the comments that you run with a bunch of other DJs.  So if you feel you need to stick to that style.  Find some [DJ](http://images.askmen.com/fashion/fashion-news/the-most-stylish-djs_1335296648.jpg)s [who's](http://images.askmen.com/fashion/fashion-news/the-most-stylish-djs_1335296682.jpg) style you [like](http://assets-s3.rollingstone.com/assets/images/story/on-the-charts-macklemore-and-ryan-lewis-cinderella-story-20121017/20121017-macklemore-ryan-lewis-306x306-1350493358.jpg) and simulate.  

5) The Belt.  Get rid of it.   The easiest thing you can do about a belt is match it with your shoes.  Got brown shoes? have a brown belt.  Most guys will usually wear a black belt with black shoes or black boots.  This is acceptable just very boring.  

6) Accessories.  Start with something simple like a watch(Timex Weekender is the usual goto around here for a simple and nice looking watch).  The rest is up to personal taste.  Like rappers and gold chains, you can overdo this and look ridiculous.  I recommend at least three watches.  One daily/work wear watch, a second daily and workwear watch with a different color band, ie, if your main daily is a black leather band, get a secondary with a brown leather band.  And a ""going out"" watch which you will splurge a little bit of cash on.  Doesn't need to be a rolex, but do find something nice that appeals to you. "

Ralkir,changemyview,1389888159.0,"&gt; First of all, you have the causal link backwards - the reason men got these positions of power in the first place is in part due to male privilege.

No I haven't got it backwards. This takes us all the way back patriarchy theory. What you just said is derived from patriarchy theory. And I disagree with with patriarchy theory, hence I disagree with this. So no I haven't got it backwards, It's just not right. 

&gt;explain why it happened that way in the first place.

Secondly (and more importantly), it's not a ""special"" privilege. This is where your primary misunderstanding lies. There is nothing special about male privilege that differentiates it from any other privilege like female privilege (gasp what? Females are not privileged! Lies, Heresay! But no, this is a real thing), or privileges tied to class, race, height, weight, disabled status, mental ability, proficiency with sports, etc.

I actually accept privilege when presented in this light, because it is a reflection of the different power that people possess and not a reflection of one being more advantaged over others just differently advantaged. But once again this is not a characteristic of feminism as a whole. Because even YOUR SOURCE, explicitly says there is no such thing as [female privilege.](http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2008/02/09/faq-female-privilege/)

&gt;You're right - it's not special. Again, nobody claimed that it was. It's just a useful way of framing the problem - lack of women in positions of power. It can be insightful to look at problems from different perspectives, like that of patriarchy theory.

&gt;You're still blatantly misinterpreting how I'm using the term ""privilege"". I'm not going to argue any further - I have already made my case. You continue to misunderstand how that term is being used, in both my posts and that source I gave that you quoted.

As for the rest of this, aside from not actually responding to my arguments you go off on wild red herrings. I am not misinterpreting the term, I'm just not using it in the particular form your brand of feminism apparently likes to use it. As feminists are so fond of stating feminism is not monolithic. Feminists disagree greatly amoungst each other as I have already demonstrated with you stating there is female privilege and your source completely denying it (unless you're going to do a 180 on me and say oh yea women actually don't have privilege).

At the end of the day it comes down to this. Feminist theory states things as absolute fact, when they are everything except absolute fact.

Griemak,Fitness,1389888260.0,"I started last year, around March at 278 lbs 5'10"" 36 yo.  My kids dragged me into soccer and I became much more involved, to the point of referee'ing and playing in adult leagues on top of board positions and volunteering for maintenance.  It progressed into general fitness after I ballooned last winter up to my heaviest weight of 278.  I dropped to 195 in 10 months and being able to survive an entire 90 minute match (competitive play) as well as ref'ing multiple matches over the weekend.  

I played soccer, football, track... I was athletic in high school and college, so I can't say I ""feel better than my late teens/early twenties"", but I certainly feel better than my late twenties/early thirties!  I don't plan on stopping until I drop to a body fat % of less than 15.  I'm hovering between 23 and 27 depending on source.  I have no great reason why this is a target.  I question it myself sometimes.  It is my current goal.  I suppose it is measurable to a certain extent, so it won out over other goals I had.

The largest challenge I have found isn't the common excuses to put off starting to ""get in shape"".  Time was easy, I wake up at 5:45a, lift my dumbbells, do some time on the elliptical, eat breakfast, get the kids moving, and am out the door solidly ready to go by 8:00.  Equipment wasn't a factor, Craig's list got me up and running for a few hundred dollars total over months worth of purchasing.  Convenience wasn't lacking either, I cook my entire week's worth of lunches on Sunday evening and freeze the portions, plus I chop and freeze my morning smoothie ingredients as well.  With MyFitnessPal being a web and mobile app, I have access to stay on target no matter where I am.

I did find difficulties, relating to age, that shouldn't be surprising:  recovery is slower, output is lower, intensity doesn't climb as smoothly as it used to, things are sore at random times without reason (they go away by noon), pops and creeks can be heard (especially squats and OHP's for me), recovery is slower, I need more water to replenish all of the sweat I produce which results in multiple late night bladder emptyings, and recovery is slower.  By the way, recovery is slower.  The only thing I really miss about my teens, really, was that recovery was faster.

Did I mention recovery takes more time?  This is my largest challenge."

Look...you're a year, maybe two, away from being an adult. You're probably three to five years away from living on your own year round. I don't know what your future is going to look like, but you're crossing a threshold into adulthood and this is what adulthood looks like. 

This beef is between your mom and your aunt; let them figure it out. You didn't excommunicate her, you have nothing to be pissed about. Ergo, they have NO REASON to wrap you into a tacit or explicit participation in this fight. 

You tell your mom to shove it; you like your aunt and cousins and you want to see them. You tell your aunt to shove it; this fight is between her and your mom and it isn't about you. Then you make time to see both of them regularly. Holidays might be tense until this gets worked out, but you can make it work. Say you do Christmas day with your family, perhaps you can stop in on Christmas eve and spend a little time with them, exchange gifts, eat a meal, and then go home. 

&gt;I could always try and contact them, but then it would just feel like I was pestering them especially since the one who lives close is the one who really doesn't want to talk about anything, which is fine, but it would be nice if he tried reaching out to me because I have no problems with him I just want to make sure he has no problems with me.

Here's your problem right here. You aren't treating this like you are a full-fledged participant in your relationship with your family. You're not ""pestering"" them in wanting to see them. You are family. This is your job. You call them up and say, ""Hey.....I was thinking about coming down [x time and date]...sound good?"" Then you tell anyone who brings up the feud that it has NOTHING to do with you. 

That's really important, by the way. People are going to try to drag you into conversations about the drama llama and you have to just shrug and say nothing more than it is between them and you have nothing to do with it. The less involved you are in the fight, the more neutral you stay, the less people are going to associate you with it. In some ways, you might become a role model for your mom/aunt. 

The rift is a rift if you *let* it keep you apart from your family. So don't. You are old enough to drive and make your own plans, so do it and make it clear you're Switzerland on this issue. They can fight it out on their own time, but you'll be maintaining your relationships with these people regardless.

I made a right turn and the force of the turned caused me to puke out of the window again, this time into a busy intersection with many witnesses. Bottle ten. I am sick. I park at the drug center.

WraithPDX,movies,1389888580.0,"The Red Spectacles. You have no idea how disappointed I was upon viewing this movie and how much I hated watching it. Mind you, the director of the film, Mamorou Oshii, has been the director of three animated films I hold in high regard: Jin Roh, Ghost in the Shell, and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. Jin Roh is my absolute favorite of his and I wanted to watch the live action films that inspired the animated one. I had high hopes, because while I remain critical of Ghost in the Shell, Oshii didn't create that series. He did, however, create the ""Kerberos Saga"", which Jin Roh, The Red Spectacles, Panzer Cop, etc. all come from.

It starts out entertaining enough, with a group shooting it out against three soldiers in Protect Gear. It gets a bit ridiculous and overly-cheesy at some points, but I figured it was an 80's movie, so we'll go with it. In the first 20 minutes I watched the main character, naked, kill 20 armed thugs in a weird, silly, over-the-top anime-style montage.

The rest of the film goes fucking nanners after this, definitely inspired by cartoons/anime and leaving any sense of serious storytelling until the end, where they write the entire thing off as an NDE. The rest of the ending makes zero sense, the movie makes zero sense, and the fact that this inspired such an amazing movie is absolutely mind-boggling.

WinterCharm,AskReddit,1389888702.0,"I doubt anyone will read this, so here we go... 

I was the weird kid. 

In middle school... I came out of depression from witnessing the death of a close friend in second grade, and instead of building healthy connections, I developed a god complex. I sought to control everyone around me to keep from feeling emotional pain.

I brought most of the middle school under my control, and conducted myself in a lawful evil fashion. The teachers loved me. They thought I was the sweetest kid (and still do). I did this because it gave me immunity - ""no way would /u/WinterCharm hurt ____ he's too sweet. Thus, _____ must be lying""

Once I was immune from any sort of punishment, I just expanded my control. It was I who dictated who dated who, but all from behind the scenes. I created drama and rumors at a whim, and solved people's problems at  a wave of my hand. 

Everyone needed me, and I felt important, but I didn't need anyone. I didn't have to be emotionally attached. All the bullies feared me, and if they hurt anyone I liked they would always regret it. 

Machiavelli would have been Proud.

Long story short, one person finally figured out what was going on - my crush at the time, in 8th grade. She confronted me after school one day, pissed off and hurt that I'd orchestrated her breakup with her boyfriend... 

After I saw her cry something changed. I came clean and vowed to be a good person. I told all my peers what I'd done, and that I was sorry. I was nice to everyone after that. I always helped them, and never complained if they were assholes to me. I deserved it. It was my penance. Most people hated me in high school. Some people were still in complete awe and they feared me, but no one was my friend. I didn't make any real friends until senior year of high school. And I only had those 3 friends until I went to college.

I used that time to learn how to be a good person, and now I use my ability to understand people to help them, instead of control them. I turned out okay, but it was a long road.

I'm a happy and mentally healthy individual now. I have some great friends who care about me, and I genuinely care about them. Life is good. I am happy. :)

I too have a kid who is super social, and I am socially awkward, always have been. I do ok, I don't completely fall on my face, but I do go through periods of avoiding social situations and I very seldom feel very comfortable with people I don't know. School functions are a bitch. 

I don't want to be awkward, so the thing I love about this is that my very socially confident child pushes me into situations where I'm forced to interact instead of avoid. It's good for me. It makes me feel bad, though, because I'm getting this benefit, but what am I doing to help her?

The dancing/stalking thing sounds like something my kid would do - I can just picture it. The other kid is totally over it and my kid doesn't understand that. It's painful to watch her get rejected by other kids. At the dentist's office a while back, she walked up to a group of kids in the waiting room and tried to get some play going and they acted like she was an alien and basically told her to eff off. I don't know how to get her to understand because I don't get it, myself.

She's exuberant and she just assumes everyone loves her. I love that about her, but it just doesn't set her up for good experiences sometimes. As a mom, it's so painful to watch.

I worry a lot that the help I try to give her and the advice that I try to give her are BAD and making matters worse, despite my good intentions. I'm clueless. I just don't understand why people act the way the act, and kids are an even bigger mystery. I feel like I'm setting my kid up for huge disappointments and pain, because I have no idea how to get her to understand these other kids.

So anyway, I feel ya. I wish I had some brilliant advice."

I can understand that you are conflicted, I would probably be too but since I don't have such a story I take the cold logical route. Still it's only my opinion.

We can't say and we can't really know how someone feels who can't communicate that with us. That is why I am for organ donation registries and DNR registries it takes away the need to make a decision at such a time because it's already made.

Chickeny-goodness,AskReddit,1389888859.0,"My perspective as the owner of a company: I couldn't care less what you ask, as long as you don't try to play 'stump the chump' with me.  Don't ask pointed questions to try to prove to me that you've got options and that I need to strive hard to get YOU.  Be aware that we will be asking ourselves why you are asking your question.  A question about health care benefits is fine, but ""what is the culture like here"" can be misinterpreted as ""do we get to screw off or are you one of those hard-ass bosses""?  The interviewer will ask all of the questions important to them, so they've already passed their judgement on the prospective employee.  It's unlikely that I would change my opinion of a person based on the questions they ask unless it's a stupid one.  A perfectly fine answer is ""no, I really don't have any questions, but I really appreciate the opportunity to have met with you all"".  

On the other hand, if you're being interviewed for a very high level position (i.e. management or higher), you could ask about corporate vision and what markets the business intends to expand into, but that's just a lead-in for you to talk more about yourself and how you can facilitate growth.

I decided that I wasn't going to neglect my health one second longer so that I never had to inflict the pain and suffering of loss on anyone else if I could avoid it. 

Learn to recognize when you're hungry and when you're just bored. When I first started trying to restrict my calorie intake and incorporating exercise, I was amazed to feel what being hungry actually felt like. I honestly couldn't remember the last time I actually felt my body alerting me to the fact that it was all tapped out. Then you start playing with what combinations of food keep you fuller longer to keep that hungry feeling at bay for as long as possible. No more eating just to eat. No more grazing. No more ""I'm feeling kind of munchy"" I think I'll have some chips or something. Food tastes good and is pleasurable, but remember that food's purpose is to fuel you. 

Notice I said fuel you, not fill you. We've all over-eaten to the point that we're just miserable and then we feel bad, then you're sluggish, and it gets everything thrown off. Remember that every meal is meant to satisfy your hungry, not fill you to the point of bursting. A tip to trick your brain a little bit is switch to smaller plates so that your smaller portion doesn't look so lonely on a giant plate. 

Track your progress! Track your calories, track your workouts, track your measurements! Nothing motivates quite like progress! But at the same time, don't beat yourself up if you have a set back. We're only human and we just can't be perfect all the time. To be honest, I only really count my calories sunday-thursday. Friday and saturday I do what I want, I just make better choices. Like having a slice of pizza and a salad instead of 2-3 slices of pizza, flavored vodka and club soda at a bar instead of some fruity drink that's loaded with sugar and calories. Don't be afraid to live your life and live it well! That's the whole reason why we're here! "

C) Just look at recent history.  There has only been one team to score over 500 points in the last 10 years and win the Superbowl, and that was the 2009 Saints who faced draconic sanctions for paying injury bounties on defense.

You can't show them doing drugs once and then hope the audience gets that doing drugs in an excessive manner is bad - it has to be repeated multiple times to show that its not about the act of doing drugs that is bad here (that's another argument) but its about the act of doing drugs over and over and over that is bad."

TheFarnell,Quebec,1389889428.0,"**Billets**

Un match du Crimson Tide, à l'Université d'Alabama, coûte entre 55$ et 85$.  Multiplie ça par 80,000 places (parce que, pour y avoir été, le stade est *toujours plein*), une demie-douzaine de fins de semaine par année, et c'est déjà des revenus intéressants.

**Merch**

Les universités vendent des produits dérivés, allant de porte-clefs à manteaux de cuir.  Les profits de ces ventes sont comparables à ceux d'une équipe de la NFL ou de la NBA.

**Droits de télé**

Oui, les matchs sont télévisés et les universités (par l'entremise des ligues) peuvent vendre très cher les droits de diffusion des matchs.

**Dons**

C'est une culture qui n'existe pas vraiment au Québec, mais dans le monde anglophone, faire des dons (souvent importants) à ton Alma Mater est quelque chose de très commun et presque obligatoire, parce que l'université à laquelle t'es allé est plus qu'une marque de parcours, c'est central à ton identité professionnelle.  Le prestige de ton université est directement lié à ton propre prestige professionnel, et donc tout ce que tu peux faire pour aider ton université à rayonner t'aide aussi, et ce tout au long de ta carrière.  Les équipes de sport sont souvent un point critique à l'entretien de cette identité - toi pis tes chums d'université (qui sont aussi ton réseau de contacts professionnels) se rassemblent autours des matchs de football et de basketball, alors c'est bien vu de faire des dons à cette équipe et donc, par la bande, à l'université.  On parle ici parfois de dons de plusieurs millions de dollars *par année* pour certains bien nantis.

Tout ça, c'est des revenus *directs*.  On ne parle même pas de l'effet indirect que cela amène par ce qu'ils appellent les ""legacy families"" - les familles riches qui vont tous à la même université depuis 3 ou 4 générations, formant une clientèle incroyablement fiable à très long terme, et, comme tu l'as dit, l'effet publicitaire de recrutement.

Bref, si tu considères ça, tu peux voir un peu pourquoi l'UL veut aller dans cette direction.  Personellement, je trouve l'approche contradictoire aux valeurs québécoises d'universités publiques accessibles et non-élitistes.  La mobilité sociale est beaucoup réduite par ce système, par exemple - si t'es pas allé à la ""bonne"" université, tes opportunités d'affaires sont grandement réduits, car y'a bon nombre des meilleures firmes et des plus grandes compagnies qui ne regarderont même pas ton CV sans ça."

obsidianechoes,3Dprinting,1389889472.0,"&gt; ~~Robo 3D will be sponsoring the **December** printing challenge~~  [*Addressed*]


Also, a few thoughts...

~~I don't think you can control whether someone ""cherry picks"" this contest with a print they made beforehand.  They don't have to disclose or be honest about when it was printed.~~  [*Addressed*]  I read this contest and immediately thought of a print I made about a year ago.  It used a spool and a half of PLA and took about 40 hours to print in total.

**Cost of consumables:**

This contest can get expensive for those who choose to compete.  As I said, I spent about $50 in PLA to make that print about a year ago.  Unless I could guarantee winning the first prize (something that cannot be guaranteed due to subjective judging), I'd be walking away with a net loss since second and third prizes are valued at $30.  As a result, there is not much incentive to compete with a new print unless we restrict submissions to using 1 spool or people willingly choose to lose time and money.

**Banana for scale:**

Well, not a banana persay but pictures of contest submissions should really have a ruler or measuring stick in the frame.  As we all know, prints can be scaled and it wouldn't be hard to make a 6"" object and call it a 12"" object if it's sitting by itself on a table."

It's called a ""sectarian"" rivalry, but not one in a hundred of the participants in it could even tell you the differences between the doctrines of Rome and Calvin. It is in fact as senseless and as tribal as the fraternal infighting observed and recorded by Caesar.

&gt;Does anyone have any tried-and-true parve (or perhaps dairy, if such a thing exists?) cholent recipes?

This is a contradiction. It can't be called cholent if there isn't any meat. You call that wimp stew.

Exis007,relationships,1389889616.0,"You have knotted together your problems here, that's why this is so complicated. 

Let me start off by addressing something completely different; when you apply to school, there is an essay section wherein you can explain any serious grade issues. Explaining that you went through a period of alcoholism that you've since addressed and moved past is going to seriously factor in to how they read your GPA. They aren't so stupid as to not recognize that a major life issue can tank an otherwise strong student's grades. They have read transcripts like your before so address it in a professional manner and move past it. I know you still need to do community college for your dad's benefit to secure the funding (I agree, totally fair) but don't let that GPA issue convince you that no one is going to recognize you as a good student. 

Now, about everything else: 

**You need to know what you're doing before you say ANYTHING to your boss/friend**. I'd seriously consider canceling this dinner and rescheduling it. I have some questions I'd ask yourself first. 

* Would it be possible, for instance, to drop back down to part-time so you can both pay rent and go to school? 
* Do you live in an area with a job market that you can reasonably expect to get a job (with your experience) that you can cover your monthly expenses? 
* You say you hate your job....are you willing to stick it out until the baby is born and the maternity is done for the sake of being there for your friend?
* You say you hate your job. How much of that is the untreated ADD making your tasks overly difficult? 

You need, first and foremost, a plan. Once you know what you're going to do, then you have the issue of telling your friend/boss. One thing that's helpful is to draw a clear line between friend and boss. ""You know you're my best friend, but I can't make career/life decisions based on that friendship. I have to worry about my money and my future without taking into account that I might hurt your feelings because I have to take care of myself. But you know I still love and respect you and blah blah blah"". 

Another aspect here is that, when you do eventually leave this job, you can leave in such a way as to make sure they transition smoothly. You give them plenty of notice, you stick around to train the new person and make sure they can walk into your role without headache. You make it clear, when you say that you're leaving, that you're at their disposal for x-number of weeks to get a new employee in place. 

_____________________________________

All of that being said, you need to think about goals here. What is the goal? From your post, the goal would look like you getting a people-oriented job that allows you to eat and pay rent and go to school. 

You CAN work and go to school at the same time. You are a grown up and people worse than you have done it. 

**First step**: Come up with a real budget for what it would cost to take two classes, pay rent etc., buy books, and feed yourself. You need a real dollar amount. 

**Second step** Think about financial aid. You want to go and get your FAFSA done ASAP. Your financial aid will be entirely dependent on your family at your age so you're going to need to deal with whether or not you qualify. 

**Third step** Do a faux-job hunt. Don't apply, but look at what  is available in your area, what money you could reasonably make, and think about what job you think would be a better fit for you. Compare that money to the money you're making. 

You need to understand how much you need to be bringing in to make two classes and the logistics of living work, be that income from a job, financial aid, or both. Once you know that number, once you understand the job landscape, you can go from there and formulate a plan as to whether you're better staying where you are and taking classes one at a time, moving on to another job and taking classes, supporting yourself on financial aid, or what have you. I can't give you more advice than that because I don't know what your life looks like. 

It is about figuring out what you need and then finding the least repulsive way of making that work. 

**Last point** You hated restaurant work. You hate this job. Do you hate the WORK or do you hate the ADD? If the ADD makes all jobs repulsive, then that's the first fix, right? You need to have that under control. Dealing with that first and THEN working on school/work/money might be the absolute best step. Much like the drinking, if you have a serious issue not being addressed, all the work you put on top of that is meaningless. If you hate your job because of the ADD then school won't be much different. Sort that out and then you'll have a better idea. "

&gt;An opiate is an opiate!

Well, kinda. You are correct that they are all in the same class of drug but that doesn't mean they are the same thing with different names for higher or lower dosages. [This website](http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/drugs/html/morphine_text.htm) shows that morphine, heroin, and codeine all have a unique molecular structure with the base structure being the same or close to the same. So they are very similar but saying they are the ""same"" is technically incorrect. These small differences can have an effects on the drug properties and is why hospitals prefer using some opiates over others. Some opiates have shown less risk for dependency, some show less respiratory depression (the main cause of death from opiate overdose), and others have quicker onsets to better deal with breakthrough pain. As you mentioned [Fentanyl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl) above, note that it and methadone are synthetic opiates and have a very different molecular structure from morphine and heroin. Although all opiates act on the opioid receptors in the brain so that part is the same. *Unrelated side note: hopefully not to far in the future, genetic testing of your unique DNA will be able to tell doctors what opioid medications would work best for you personally as far as pain relief and mitigating nausea, etc*

&gt;You do heroin every day for 2 months and percs every day for 2 months and the withdrawal will be the same because it's opiate withdrawal. 

Again, kinda. You are correct in that it would be an opiate withdrawal in both cases but the severity of the symptoms could vary quite drastically. I would say that ""typically"" in this scenario a heroin addicts withdrawal would be more sever than someone using percocet. Especially if a heroin user is using intravenously compared to a pill popping percocet user. The IV heroin user would be using more often as the drug is metabolized quicker when injected directly into the bloodstream, and be needing bigger and bigger doses as they built a tolerance quicker. Although both opiate withdrawal, Id expect more severe symptoms in the heroin user. I would compare this to alcohol withdrawal between a frequent beer drinker and a frequent liquor drinker. The good news about opiate withdrawal is you probably won't die! Although you might wish you were dead if it is that severe. This is unlike alcohol withdrawals which can be quite fatal. 

Sorry if this is all known to you and you were just paraphrasing. As you say opiates are a motherfucker. It should be pointed out that more people die from prescription opiates than heroin although this is probably due to availability than anything else. I'll post one more link about narcotic equivalents that is pretty interesting: http://www.globalrph.com/narcotic.htm

Ending rant: I want to apologize to any drug users who have had judgmental assholes for doctors or nurses when you are honest about your drug use with them. This is wrong and encourages people to lie about their drug history. If you have a high tolerance for opiates and don't tell the doctor that before having a large surgery, chances are you are going to be in horrible pain because they won't dose you correctly. Please be honest about your drug use. "

I think this mainly relates to the fact that when getting high you are in a relaxed, leisurely state of mind. You're not worrying about the stressors of life or anything like that, so your mind tends to wander and think about things that aren't necessarily relevant to your life.

Try something - I'll try it to, although I don't consume marijuana as much as I used to - every time (sober or high) you have an epiphany take some time and write it down. Maybe just a few sentences or something to remind you what it is. Consider them both when you're sober and high and see if anything changes."

yourdungeonmaster,rpg,1389890144.0,"I may have shared this one here before, can't remember.  

The door is supposed to open by pushing against the right side.  When opened correctly in this way, the door pivots on a central axis, creating openings on either side of the door.  Residents of the location know this.  

For everyone else, the door has a big brass handle on the right and hinges on the left, suggesting to the uninitiated that the door is meant to be pulled open.  Close examination of the hinges on the left reveal that they are not actually connected to the wall.  Casually pulling on the handle will, of course, fail to open the door, but it will wiggle just enough to suggest that the door is stuck.  The handle is big enough that two characters might simultaneously pull the handle in an effort to open the door.  Make a big deal of the strength check.

The handle snaps off easily, releasing a strong, hallucinogenic gas (nightmare vapor in PF, for instance). If they rolled well on the strength check, and since the handle comes off so easily, consider requiring a reflex save to avoid falling on their asses.  

Additionally, an alarm (silent or not) is triggered, and denizens nearby are aware that hallucinating intruders have arrived for their entertainment."

&gt;This is the flu myth most likely to drive experts bonkers. “There is simply no way that the flu vaccine can give you the flu,” says Hay. “It’s impossible.”

&gt;Why? For one, injected flu vaccines only contain dead virus, and a dead virus is, well, dead: it can’t infect you. There is one type of live virus flu vaccine, the nasal vaccine, FluMist. But in this case, the virus is specially engineered to remove the parts of the virus that make people sick.

Source: http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/features/top-13-flu-myths


&gt;The nasal spray flu vaccine does contain live viruses. However, the viruses are attenuated (weakened), and therefore cannot cause flu illness. The weakened viruses are cold-adapted, which means they are designed to only cause infection at the cooler temperatures found within the nose. The viruses cannot infect the lungs or other areas where warmer temperatures exist.

Personally, I feel it's been worth it to just pay monthly for the garage space my apartment provides.  I commute daily, so searching for parking after a long commute every single day would probably give me gray hairs.  Also nice to have no foggy or icy windows, no potential break ins, no accidental illegal parking resulting in a ticket (it's easier than you think..), or bumper scratches from messy parkers.  :)

So if you're a patient person up for a search sometimes or if you live in a place with an affordable garage or parking space, a car is just fine.  Other than that, prepare for some potential frustration."

TrustMyOpinion,relationships,1389890666.0,"Wow. Thank you much for taking the time to type this out.

I'll start with the ADHD issue. You're right... it is TERRIBLE. I need to do something about it. But since I have addiction history (always downers, never uppers), I am uncomfortable with trying ANY sort of stimulant. I have tried the non-stimulants before, they didn't work for me. My therapist who has known me since I went to treatment says that some people just NEED stimulants because of how they work, and that it is an option for me because ""uppers were never my thing"".

I was offered a job by an old manager who saw me. He said if I am ever in the place to where I want to change jobs to give him a call. I'd be taking a major pay cut, to only around 9 dollars an hour. HOWEVER, I am more than willing to stay at my current job until the baby is born/until whenever she needs me. I just do not know if that is what SHE needs, as well.

I will come up with a budget ASAP. I'm almost done with the FAFSA... the school I am going to will also work WITH me. I have some contacts there from when my sister went.

I know I didn't cover all of your points, but I just printed it out and am going to take a good look at each one. Thank you. "
sprengertrinker,relationship_advice,1389890670.0,"So - like you I was in a maddening relationship a few years ago with somebody I met on the internet (who seemed like an upstanding, normal person at first glance). It was long distance, and he would get angry if I wanted to step away from the computer even for an instant, even if it were just to concentrate on my homework or get a drink of water. The frequency of him being a crazy person only increased over time and with each occurrence they got worse and more dramatic. He also threatened to kill himself if I ever left him multiple times in casual conversation, during fights, whenever he felt the need to trap me. Luckily he lived on an army base so when I finally stopped wasting my life and decided to break up with him I was able to contact his base and warn them that he was suicidal, and wash my hands of responsibility.

So, the bottom line is this girl is making your life worse rather than better, and it seems like she isn't happy either, I imagine it's very exhausting to be so paranoid and angry all the time. So even though she hasn't accepted it yet, breaking up would probably be the best thing for her as well. I'm presuming that since you two were so far away most of her support system (family, friends) are far away now as well. But if she has any friends locally contact them and let them know that you're worried she may commit suicide, contact her family, work, whoever you think can do the most to help her if she actually tries (your university may have a suicide watch as well - something to look into). I understand that this is probably a horribly awkward situation on top of a painful one, but ultimately you know you can't be happy/sane spending the rest of your life pandering to this girl's neuroses, and she would probably be happier with someone more co-dependent. It will suck and she'll probably flip out and make you feel shitty, so brace yourself before hand as best you can, prepare her friends and family and extract yourself completely. If there's a way you can help her get home, it might be nice to do that, but don't let her stay with you, that would only increase the odds of her doing something stupid and dramatic. She doesn't understand you - and she doesn't seem to WANT to understand you either which is even more important in my opinion, everybody makes mistakes when interfacing closely with other people, but not wanting to correct those mistakes is pretty terrible if you think about it for too long. Stay strong, you can do this! Try to hold the reasons you **need** to do this in your mind."

The publicity and promotional aspect lost through using createspace or lightning source or lulu or whatever cannot be overstated."

[](/olemiss) - House Greyjoy - Right now they're more of an annoyance because they just kind of chip away at everyone else, a close game here, an upset there. Everyone knows that it will just take one strong push and they will be right there as a power player.

[](/mississippistate) - House Martell - They're just kind of there. No one is sure if or when they're going to do anything, except for that one time with the dragon, but we all know how that ended.

Fantastic! So why is his light limited to the morning? Or is it not and really can go on and on and on? 

You still have not defined morning and evening, you only used them as context to define night and day, which also are not well defined as there was no sun for the first three of them.

&gt;Dusk, dawn, noon, etc are man made categories

So, split second, we go from total day to total night?

&gt;You're asking questions that don't matter and are used only to confuse.

I ask because a perfect text is perfect and must be understood. You have not provided answers.

1. [Please look at how some words are used in the text](http://imgur.com/a/7RGUV). ""evening"" and ""morning"" are not as simple as people insist. And [here](http://imgur.com/a/JpI2D#14) we have two pages giving an examination of what ""day"" means.

2. [I give answers to why the text is not redundant and what it means for God to rest.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ouq2m/what_is_the_sabbath/) Because God ceased working, but God asked us to not to work, even thought we work and labor the other six days. Very specific wording.

Current routine:
* Cleanse with CeraVe hydrating cleanser (both day and night)

* Silk Naturals Super Serum (morning)

* CeraVe in the tub mixed with either a drop of avocado oil or rosehip seed oil (both day and night) 

* Elta MD Sunscreen (day)

* Meow Cosmetics light foundation (regularly wash my brush) 

* Adapalene 0.1% (been using since October, every other night)

* Silk Naturals AHA or BHA toner maybe on the opposite nights from Adapalene -usually if I feel like it.

* Remove makeup with old Ponds (not new formula) - but I was using jojoba oil for a few days and thought maybe that was causing my problems and stopped.

* Vaseline layer before bed

I did a rice flour mask about two weeks ago and noticed some pimples in uncommon spots, so I haven't done one since. It just strikes me as strange because I usually have pretty clear skin, but lately it just looks so blotchy. Maybe too much exfoliation?

They were both in the wrong but that does not give a man, a retired officer no less, to pull his gun from his holster and kill him. He out of all people should know better and it wasn't instant either, whether the concealed weapon was at his side, behind his back, or up on his side, it was buttoned in, he had to unbutton the strap holding in the gun, pull out of the holster, point it at the man and fire. Some point in there he should have realized that was a stupid thing to do especially in a crowded theater. Did the bullet not only go through the victim's wife's hand as well as she tried to block her husband?

In many states it is illegal to bring in a concealed weapon into a movie theater, while it might not be in Florida, it should be. But most people with common sense do not resort to shooting someone over a fight about texting. Then again, I've seen people go after others with a tire iron over cutting them off.

But like I said, the gun did not kill the person, a gun does not kill ANYONE. It is a means to kill, not the kill. The person behind the weapon or any weapon is the killer. The gun did not pop out and shoot the man, the man pulled it out and shot the man."

They are charming at first, make you love them, then they start isolating you and taking away your exit options. You'll leave your job, get pregnant, whatever. He will start the emotional abuse. He will make you believe you're not worth anything, that no one could love you, that you're lucky to have him...and after being told that enough times, it's easy to believe it. Every time you make a mistake, he will use it as proof that you're stupid and useless. Eventually, the physical abuse happens. He will make it your fault in the moment, and apologize for ""having to do it"", and afterwards he will give you gifts and use that charm to bring you back. At this point, your spirit is broken and you feel terrible about yourself. You'll believe that it was your fault, and that, while he shouldn't have hit you, you did deserve it. Isolation continues, and the violence escalates.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1389891192.0,"Here's the thing: I think the hosting and socializing bit is a red herring. There are two issues here that I notice. The first:

&gt;I told her I feel bad about her feeling alone, and that I want to try to do something differently for her, she got upset with me for ""making it about"" myself.

I'm not saying that you don't have a valid point, in that she needs to be less critical of you and more appreciative when you make an effort. But I kind of feel for your wife in that nothing drives me crazy faster than telling someone ""I feel X"" and having that person reply ""Well it makes me feel bad that you feel X."" It's dismissive, invalidating, and it does make it all about you. If you're genuinely upset about this and want to help her, then focus on her *for now*. That doesn't mean you should just take it if she's being overly critical, I just think that's a separate issue. 

Second, and what I think is the most crucial point here, is this: 

&gt; she feels alone

In my view, *the whole point of marriage is so that you don't feel this way*. Sure, there may be problems and issues, but feeling isolated and lonely defeats the whole purpose of being in a relationship with someone. I think the problem is that you two aren't connecting on *any* level and she doesn't know how to vocalize that. She makes it about socializing, but how much quality time do you two spend together? And I don't mean in the same house together - your hobbies are all loner hobbies and it's clear she needs more interaction. How much time do you two spend experiencing things together? How much time do you two spend talking to each other about things that aren't negative? I'd bet money that the whole workout program thing and the planning dinners thing are her attempts to actually do things with you, to spend time with you, and she feels rejected when you don't participate.

So, the solution is not to have you just suck it up and do things you don't want to do. The solution is to find activities - and this is crucial, I mean activities, planned time in which you two focus on each other and building and reinforcing your marital bond with each other - that you *both* enjoy. You don't have to fundamentally change anything about yourself. Plan one ""date"" night where you two do dinner and a movie or something like that, and plan one ""active"" night where you two take a walk together, go to a museum, take a painting class, whatever. That's two nights a week - you can do that and still have plenty of time for your homebody stuff. The dichotomy of either satisfying her or totally changing yourself is a false one - from your post it doesn't sound like either of you have tried compromising yet, you've just endlessly argued about it. So *stop arguing*. She's right - talking it to death isn't helping. Start doing.

In that vein, you need to stop being so passive about her criticism. Next time it starts, shut it down. Tell her that you're happy to listen to anything she has to say as long as she can say it calmly and productively. Tell her you're happy to revisit the topic if she needs a little time to cool off.

""CeCe's only being defended because she's black and trans, "" - nope, i said gender, didnt mention race. Once.

""neo-Nazis who have a habit of physically attacking people shouldn't have their pasts taken into consideration if they die trying to beat the shit out of people they hate,"" - never said that, said that each case should be examined based on fact as opposed to people's past (aka colouring logic with emotion, which is the whole point im making)

""who cares that the cops forced her to confess before she got medical treatment,"" how fucking dare you, i did not say this or anything like it. I think it's appalling, and i already acknowledged that i learned this ITT.

""left-wing prejudice at work, etc."" - i said that i think the left wing can be as prejjudicial as the right, and for that i'm to be pilloried.

That's the game that for real teaches you to play the guitar, and requires a real guitar plugged into the console or computer to play.  If you are constantly missing notes, the game will only give you a few key notes to play, but the better you do the closer the game comes to straight feeding you tab of the game until that is exactly what it's doing.

try taking him to the occasional interesting restaurant, like a thai place.  

baked or grilled chicken (sandwiches)

deli meat sandwiches and grilled cheese.

pasta (if you make spaghetti, put a dash of cinnamon in the sauce.  it will taste a little bit like curry)

chili

biscuits and gravy

try baked sweet potatoes or squash

ettoufee or other cajun dishes (without the bell peppers)

tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc.  heat them up in the skillet so the outside is crunchy (rice makes a decent burrito filler, but you need the really big tortillas for it).

omlettes. 

try roast beef, or an inexpensive steak that you can slice up.

something with mushrooms (not the slimy canned ones, but fresh ones) 

lightly sauted zucchini and squash with balsamic vinegar (so it's not squishy)

oven roasted pork loin with veggies and roasted red potatoes (use fresh rosemary if you can find it).

also, find a gym that you can go to and drag his fat ass there.  tell him that if he has a coronary at 40, you'll kill him yourself and feast on his fat, tender remains.  if he scoffs, tell him you'll use the crock pot and make him all stringy.

&gt;Anton LaVey established Satanism's first and largest religious organization, the Church of Satan, in 1966, and codified Satanic beliefs and practices in The Satanic Bible in 1969.

&gt;Bolded for emphasis. 

First of all, the source isn't cited. You could have gone onto that page and literally typed that sentence for all I know. Secondly, even if it is factual, LaVey establishing Satanism's first religious organization is not proof of your claim that noboy self-referenced as a Satanist before LaVey.

&gt;Further, I have referenced a document, the Satanic Bible, written in 1969. I do not need a document now saying it was the first, you have to provide something that came prior to it or my proof stands. No piece of paper needs to say it is the first so long as you can not bring forth this non-existent Satanic manuscript. 

Your words are not proof and your say-so is not good enough for me. The burden of proof is on you to provide a source that supports your claim that nobody self-referenced as a Satanist before LaVey.

jareths_tight_pants,raisedbynarcissists,1389891556.0,"Pretty much. My older sister was the SG child because she would just not stop pushing my mother's buttons. She never wanted to walk on eggshells like me or my dad. She also hit puberty first, which is when our Nmom started to become emotionally abusive. NMom was threatened by the fact that she was aging and her two daughters were growing into women. She still struggles with this as she is nearing 60 and I'm 27 and married. She gets jealous of the time I spend with my husband. 


My sister has a heavy, heavy dose of FLEAS and is quite passive-agressive. Nmom insisted that I have my sister as a bridesmaid, which I really didn't want to do and completely regret giving in to. At my wedding my sister was a total ass.
 

Instead of saying ""hey Jareths_tight_pants, I'm happy for you, but I'm feeling a little sad and jealous too"" (5 years older, been with the same guy for over 10 years, not engaged/married, no career, no kids, etc...) she decided to scream at me calling me a bitch, not pay attention during the rehearsal, arriving late and leaving early at the rehearsal dinner, not helping during set-up, leaving the wedding early, buying a clearance price (sticker left on) non-registry item for the wedding ($5 Easter shape cookie cutters from Target, wtf? Just don't get me anything then) and then downloading all of the wedding photos she's in and posting them to FB so that people can tell her how pretty she was. 


The worst part is that my sister completely embarrassed me with her behavior. All of my other bridesmaids and my MIL were asking me wtf was up with her behavior. I heard later that she was going around to people saying things like ""at my wedding I won't do this"" and ""at my wedding my colors will be ..."" and ""these bouquets are so pretty... but they keep falling apart."" (I made the bouquets from silk flowers because our floral budget was almost non-existent)


Right before the ceremony our NMom decided to ""fix"" things by giving her a huge check. Like 10 grand huge. She was nicer after that, but it just rewarded her shitty behavior and made her feel justified. She never apologized, either. We don't really talk now.

There's nothing wrong with patriotism, or loving where you live. I find a lot of Americans are genuinely surprised that citizens of other nations feel their own sense of patriotism, though. 

I also don't think there is anything wrong with the original idea of American exceptionalism, the nation being historically unique. I think many historians can make the case that the U.S. in unique in many ways, but that doesn't necessarily make the country better than all others.

miyakohouou,asktransgender,1389891626.0,"I've lost about 100lbs (about 45kg) since I started HRT in may.  At the time that I started HRT I had already lost around 120lbs (55kg)  I'm still about 20lbs (9kg) obese / 50lbs (22kg) overweight. (I started at ~420lbs when I started losing weight in september 2012, I was at 302 in may when I started HRT, and I'm at 200 right now). While I'm not a doctor and can't give medical advice (and really, it's such a YMMV situation that nobody but your doctor after giving you a complete exam can really say for sure), here's my experience:

&gt; Should I be waiting until I have fully dropped the weight before starting? Even thought his means probably another 6-8 months before beginning (I want to start asap while I still have my youth :P )

I'd say that there shouldn't be any problem with starting HRT and planning on dropping the weight.  The HRT will make it a little harder to lose weight in the long term, but over the first 6 months you'll still have a lot of muscle mass, which means a higher metabolism and easier weight loss.  The longer you're on HRT the harder it gets, but it's not like it's an impossibility or anything.

&gt; Will my boob development be impeded by my current moobs? (Will they look funny? Would they start to grow properly and not look so limp and mooby (coined a new word?) ?)

My boobs look a little off, but no different than any other small-ish breasted woman who has lost a lot of weight.  I think the biggest thing is that psychologically there is less of the ""oh hey new breast budding! yay!"" thing, since there is tissue there for me it just sort of slowly became more boob like.  As I've lost weight my chest has stayed the same-ish size, or at least shrunk a lot less than the rest of me, and what started out as moobs have become real boobs.  Since there was never any obvious growth in terms of getting bigger sometimes I look down and have a dysphoria moment thinking back to the moobs I had when I was a lot heavier, but actually looking at them in the mirror they are obviously breasts.  Also, I'm not sure if this is related to the weight loss or not, but my breasts seem to be a big bigger than people say to expect starting HRT at my age (29).  I've been on HRT for around 8 months (6 at a full-ish dosage), and I'm somewhere between a 42C and a 40D depending on the bra.

&gt; I plan on actually doing intensive cardio workouts once I begin to help drop the weight but wanted to start after I was on spiro to ward of testro boosts, is this wise?

I have avoided doing much exercise while losing weight and focused on diet.  I've used T levels as an excuse for this but honestly I just really want to put off exercising as much as I can because I don't enjoy it.  That said, the adrenal glands do produce testosterone and cardio will cause them to produce more, so working out can raise your T levels.  That said, it's probably not a bad thing to start before hormones if you are going to plan on doing exercise regularly anyway.  You want to let your body get it's T production up to where it would be so that as you are doing blood work and adjusting your dosage you are properly accounting for what your body is producing from your adrenal glands at your activity level.

&gt; Being young, and getting fit, should I really worry about blood clotting taking pill form?

Blood clotting and DVT are risks of HRT for sure, but my understanding is that a lot of this risk was from back when premarin and ethinyl estrogens were more commonly prescribed at high levels for HRT.  With spiro and bio-identical estrogens that are used today I don't believe the risk is all that high for women under 50.  If you're eating well and being active that will probably help.  That said, don't get complacent, be aware that there are risks and do your best to monitor your health and see a doctor if you have any symptoms."

Even then, I still felt like a shitty girlfriend (because fucking your gf when she is not into it most of the time makes for a pretty lacklustre sex life). But deny him even *that*? I don't get how people can be so cruel and indifferent to their partner's needs. On the other side of the fence, I am one of those girls who gets super disappointed if her guy can't get it up, and no, fingers and toys and tongues will just not scratch the itch when I need to get fucked. I like that my bf will just pop a cialis and take care of business without me having to tell him.

Sometimes I lurk /deadbedrooms, and honestly I just don't get it. Unless you have a vaginal pain syndrome or something, it's really not that difficult for a girl to just lie there with her legs spread for her man. No matter how out of the mood I was, I've never found it to be painful or uncomfortable for my bf to go to town, as long as we use lube. Sometimes it can be kind of annoying....but there are so many annoying things I do all day that are way less important than giving my guy pleasure. I would much rather let him put it in my pussy rather than, say, load the dishwasher.

That stuff comes with time and attention to the game. Hell when WoW was released how fast were their players at max lvl? It wasn't until the game had established a firm player base and majority of them were capped till expansions began being released.

Edit: After reading a few more of the comments i would like to say, that while alot of deciding factors on whether the game stands the test of time or not falls on the developers, alot of it also falls onto us as consumers. How we treat each other and act as a community, Effort we put into making the game fun for ourselves, friendships we make, guilds we join etc etc. I truly believe TESO can beat out WoW, obviously not right away (WoW has a long time loyal following) but over time with consumer review and a positive and horizon seeking community its definitely possible. IMO people that played/ play WoW or have tried it and other games like it (Aion, GW franchise, DAoC, SWTOR, LOTRO etc etc) are looking for this new and exciting game to sink their time into that both captures their attention and holds their interest."

Maybe the attention you get helped you, but you need to think that others may be bothered by it. If they've been teased all their life about it, to them, this attention brings them back to those times. Other people simply don't want to be bothered and want to be left alone. 

Some people have no sense of personal space or of social etiquette when talking to a stranger, and they just come at people they don't know to point out the obvious or tell them what they should be doing (like the whole 'you should play basketball' story).

So let's say I'm somewhere between where you stand and where the average annoyed tall/tallette stands. I don't hate it, but I'm not a fan either. You know why? Cause we're all different. 

Strangers shouldn't take a chance and should just leave strangers alone. The way you wouldn't go to an average person to tell them 'Hey, you're average sized! You know what you should be doing? Playing soccer, cause that's perfect for an average height person!', the same way you should refrain from approaching a tall person about it. "

cachow6,hockey,1389891963.0,"So this thing happened to me but I don't know where else to put it so I'll just tell it here.

So on Saturday I was at the Yale-Harvard Madison Square Garden game, which was awesome. After the game I'm leaving MSG when I see a big Rangers ad with life-size player pictures, so I yell to my friend ""Hey, take a picture of me with HenriK Lunqvist!"" 

So I walk over to his picture but when I get there this guy says to me,"" Why don't I jump in there with you, I look kind of like him."" I don't really know what to say, because I don't really want a random guy in my picture, so I sort of awkwardly stand there. But once I get a better look at the guy, it turns out it's actually Henrik Lundvist! Unfortunately at this point my brain is having a really hard time understanding what is happening, and in the meantime Henrik sort of laughs at my confusion and starts walking away. I stammer eloquently, ""Hey... wait... um.. you aren't..."" and then he's gone. Stupid stupid stupid.

TLDR: Henrik Lundqvist approaches me while I'm trying to take a picture next to the fake Henrik Lundvist, I end up a blabbering idiot. 

EDIT: extremely worthless picture I took without Henrik Lundvist

During this period I try to keep things as low pressure and as casual as possible. I can see a girl casually for about 4 -6 months before making a decision to move toward a relationship or not.

The 'moment' you speak of is the time when I realize I don't want to see anyone else and I know she doesn't want to see anyone else either. It often occurs when I notice she can't look at me without smiling and starts holding on to me as if I'll never return once I walk out the door."

Also, my point about ""nice guys"" is this. Niceness is great. But, that's a basic standard for humanity as far as I'm concerned. If a guy has nothing else about him that is attractive, then niceness isn't going to cut it.

If, on a desktop, you put a shortcut to a folder in your copy folder, Copy backs up and makes the linked file available on all devices - so you don't have to move stuff around to your copy folder. 

It also lets you share storage - if you have a 6GB file shared between 3 people, each person gets 2GB subtracted from their storage, instead of the full 6GB.

necron33,Automate,1389892033.0,"The problem is that you perceive the amount of jobs as a static value, and believe that the amount of human population will simply continue to increase, that is false, when there are no sufficient resources, human populations will not tend to increase, and birthrates will decrease. Both the amount of jobs and the amount of humans are variable and will change according to the environment in which they live in. The Agricultural revolution induced a massive expansion of populations, so did the industrial revolution and that can also be seen in developing countries (like the Middle East) where the presence of economic growth acts as an incentive for people to make more births. The opposite is true as well, without economic growth to sustain new individuals, humans will not tend to mate and give birth as aggressively, and jobs are not static too.

A basic income is to me just an incentive for people not to learn new skills and adapt to the needs of the job market, and don't you really think that under a free market, It wouldn't adapt? Sure, everyone may have more money right now, but then prices rise and everything gets higher-priced.

WIthout some kind of direct or indirect tax on income for people (or parties) then the GMI would not work, someone has to pay in the end. And then you have to deal (again) with the problem of freeloaders, the problem of immigrants who would come for this kind of welfare, and then the problems of population expansion, where simply because everyone is guaranteed an income, there will actually be an incentive for the population to increase.

61% of individuals age 50 and older toward phased retirement [according to a 2001 survey](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/perfi/retirement/2005-06-08-retiree-main_x.htm) are doing it because they need the money, other interests only come in at second.

Structural and dynamical similarities of different real networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the dynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of such laws remain elusive. Here we show that the causal network representing the large-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law graph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the Internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the dynamics of complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with implications to network science and cosmology.""

I became a philosophical naturalist for while post deconversion, but now I'm a inclined towards supernaturalism on the spectrum between the 2. Because I've had many experiences and observations that I can't deny that incline me to believe that the philosophical naturalist model of reality isn't accurate. But I also realize that my experiences and observations have plausible naturalistic explanations. 

One of the things I like doing is 'entertaining' multiple explanations for experiences and observations.

For example; ""Possession"" could be;

1) Psychosomatic illness manifesting.

2) A product of confirmation bias and suggestion, based on a belief in supernaturalism.

3) That there are 'entities' that attach themselves to people.

4) That they are psychological creations of the mind. eg. a disowned aspect of self.

5) That they are chi type energetic creations of the mind. eg. a disowned aspect of self, and/or blocked or dark 'energy'.

I've observed and experienced some things that I think can be explained by a combination of 1, 2, and 4.

And I've observed and experienced some things that I bounce between 3 and 5 as explanations. Though these days I'm inclined to rule out 3 as an explanation."

2. I'll admit you made a semi good point there, as I tend to forget about the Soviet Union and they might have reacted unkindly to us invading Saudi, but why'd that same King decide to switch to the dollar for oil trade? Same guy. You also failed to address my question of why the ""puppet state"" barred us from staging and invading from their country in 2003 if they're our pet why don't they act like it? 

3. &gt;First of all, the Iraq war, was an ilegal unjustified war, started by government warmongers, called Mr Bush and mainly the Dick...Cheney.

Who talks this way? You literally sound like a government propagandist.  Yes, the evil Dick Cheney, but wait, I thought it was the evil oil companies who pushed for the invasion, now it's just one man?  Kinda funny you mention the WMD, it seems like people who were evil and cunning enough to engineer a war just to keep one country from switching its oil trading currency to the EURO (*which your ""always a rebel"" Saddam did as late as 2000, oh why'd we wait three years and why'd all those damned European owned American oil companies want him to switch back? Kinda funny considering the Euro would be better for them, but you don't like logic so I won't go there*) failed to supply the evidence needed to justify it after we invaded, surely those evil leaders could have colluded with the evil military and had some Anthrax and mustard gas flown in? This would have legitimized the whole war to the world (Hell I'm pretty sure Iran would be glad we kept that stuff from Saddam). But they didn't, can you explain to me why people you think are intelligent and diabolical enough to engineer a war for oil could not accomplish such a simple task? 

Well the mission isn't really complete, Iraq is extremely unstable (which, I'm not sure you're aware of, is extremely bad for trade; but I'm sure you can think if some crackpot reason why the evil oil companies want it that way, and not stable like Saudi) if only there was some giant police force that could've hung around to help stabilize it? Saddam had only traded negligible amounts of oil since the 1991 gulf war (sanctions) and if the oil companies wanted prices high why wouldn't they just let the sanctions continue? Also Iraqi oil production is now [higher](http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=iq&amp;product=oil&amp;graph=production) than it was under Saddamn, you really should goggle stuff and not believe everything you're reading in what are obviously biased news sources.

Perhaps (since we're going with opinions I'm not going to bother citing sources either) women are more picky about choosing partners because men are supposedly wired to spread their seed far and wide and not stick around to support a child, whereas women are biologically designed to raise the child for at least a few years. 

Culturally, one could even bring up the stigma and possible death sentence associated with being a lone female with a child (or heaven, not a virgin!) and the still prevalent idea that a virile man is to be lauded. 

Given those two reasons, why on Earth would a woman *not* be picky about a mate and take into consideration his ability to defend her and her child, raise it (including teaching it to hunt or the modern equivalent), etc? Given equality today, how many women on equal wages actively seek out men who earn more or shower them with gifts? In the US the gap is still present (reasons notwithstanding) and so sex is unfortunately seen as a tradable commodity, hence the desire for gifts etc. in order for women to ""give it up"", but elsewhere we earn more or less the same (my guy earns less) and we see sex as something two people do, not one person gives and the other takes (consequently we have more casual sex, it's great). 

tldr: ""men think with penis"" countered with ""women think with men's money"" is not a particularly strong argument."

[CONJECTURE WARNING](#conjecture)

As far as Numidium is concerned, the Mantella is ""close enough"" to the Heart of Lorkhan (and we're told the Dwemer built a MERtella (get it?) to serve as a transformer between Heart and Numidium) to function, so it activates.

Numidium trashes Mundus in its immediate vicinity, but on the whole it strengthens it. To deny something in the manner that Numidium does first requires acknowledgment of that thing. Numidium is not blissfully ignorant of the world; it sees it, accepts it as real, and then demands that the world shift to its expectations. A force as powerful as Numidium stating ""THE WORLD IS REAL"" reinforces the world, even if that sentence is immediately followed by ""AND I HATE IT"". Mythopoeia doesn't care if you hate something as long as you acknowledge that it exists and is worthy of your attention.

Neither. It's a desperate attempt to paint the world in black and white with a blind spot for the good guys doing something wrong or the bad guys getting more than they deserve.

&gt;And you did ignore the comment about how the cops treated her for quite some time before you acknowledged it, so I think it was reasonable to assume that you didn't care.

Directly replied in next comment, so no, i didnt.

&gt;What part of ""dead guy was a neo-Nazi with prior assault convictions"" isn't fact? Likewise, what part of ""Trans women of colour are murdered at extremely high rates and the killers tend to get away with it"" isn't fact?

Didnt say it wasnt fact, said it shouldnt be held as relevant when assessing a responsible adults actions. It doesnt matter who you stab, it matters whether you had time to judge your actions and what your intent was. she pulled out the weapon, expressed intent to stab, stabbed through the heart, and killed. If it had been planned in advance, it would be first degree murder. it wasn't, so it was second degree murder. And anyway, how the fuck would she have known about his prior convictions? 

Let me spin an analogy at you - the cops know that there's a history of homeless people getting violent and using drugs, so does that mean it was ok for kelly thomas's murders to be acquitted? No, because that doesnt fit with our simplistic reddit bubble where the cops are the bad guys and everyone that they kill is a victim. Does it?


I'm urging you to try and be objective and look at the facts of the case, and don't fall into the trap - used by the media and litigators alike - of painting caricatures (positive and negative) of the people involved to muddy the waters.

&gt;That's like saying that a guy with multiple DUIs shouldn't have his record taken into account if he kills someone while he's driving drunk. You're ignoring the context in which the incident took place, and that's a dangerous thing to do.

That's not the same, because the nazi's not the one that went on trial. He was killed, and it was convenient for the case to be about him rather than the woman that killed him.

Ability: Levitate --- Nature: Calm --- EVs: 252HP/100SpA/156SpD

- Will-O-Wisp [Covers your the physical side]

- Hydro Pump [Obvious reasons]

- Hex [Gets 130BP when the opponent has a status condition]

- HP Ice/Protect [Ground/Dragon/*Grass* coverage, or Protect because...well protect]

The ban list is pretty strange, but I think you should just get rid of Aggron completely.  His weaknesses are just a no go in a ground type challenge.

If you're facing ground types, then Gliscor doesn't need Thunder Fang at all.  He could be removed, but if you want to use him, change out T-Fang for Protect and possibly BB for Subsitute.

Grass Knot on Greninja would give you another STAB against a major ground weakness that many don't plan on.

Those are my thoughts."

Exis007,relationships,1389892350.0,"&gt;My therapist who has known me since I went to treatment says that some people just NEED stimulants because of how they work, and that it is an option for me because ""uppers were never my thing"".

I think part of the reason that you work a professional is that they can give you perspective. My understanding of ADD meds is that, if you need them, they don't work like they work for those who don't. I took some in college once (I REALLY didn't like them) and they just made me twitchy. I mean, sure, I could focus but I don't have focus issues and the side effects were just too much for me. With a lot of experience working with kids who suffer from ADD, you just don't see that. They work with the body chemistry because you need them. That being said, I'm a stranger on the internet. I guess I am saying trust your doctor but then keep the lines of dialog and treatment open so that she can keep an eye on you and watch for any problems. That way you have a second line of defense if they become a problem for you. "

This is Bikeasaurus Rex, my custom tourer.

In 2011, I saved all spring at a college job and bought a Raleigh Port Townsend for $1000. I replaced the derailleur with a mountain bike one, kept the 2 chainring setup, and added brake levers on the flat of the drop bars.

Since then, I've ridden 7,000 miles across the entire Northeast and parts of Canada and Colorado on unsupported tours and daily commutes. I've ridden in NYC and Boston too!

I wore the stock wheels out and replaced them with Mavic 719 rims, Ultegra hub in the back and an XT hub in the front. I actually replaced the front wheel twice; a 25mph crash in Colorado during a windstorm wrecked the front wheel (I hobbled 90 miles to La Junta the next day on an extremely untrued wheel, bleeding from 4 places).

When I crashed in Canada, I replaced the stock fork with a Surly Trucker Disc, and threw a disc brake on my XT hub. 

I replaced the seat with a WTB Pure-V, which is very comfortable for long centuries and tours.

At a stoplight, I pulled my Deore derailleur into my spokes, almost wrecking a wheel. I replaced it with a Shimano XT derailleur, which is fantastic.

The racks are a Racktime front rack and an Axiom Streamliner in the back.

I'm currently rolling on 38mm Schwalbe Little Big Ben tires for winter, but will likely throw on Continental 4-Seasons in summer. 

My bike is my home. I have been everywhere on it. If you want to see more, check out [MaxTheCyclist.wordpress.com](http://maxthecyclist.wordpress.com) for gear lists, pictures, and tour reports!"

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389892525.0,"&gt; What I am saying is that government, all government, is ultimately rule by force. I am saying that, beyond preventing routine inter-group violence, it tends to reduce freedom as opposed to increasing it. I am saying that government does not exist to provide for individuals, but rather to provide stability from said violence.

I disagree. Because where government doesn't regulate, business extends its tentacles...you know, those guys who mandate your schedule and how you spend a good portion of your life to you. The people who hold the purse strings over your income.

&gt;Dude, this ""we as a society"" stuff is the biggest horseshit doublethink that currently exists in the American political paradigm. I don't have a contract with ""society."" In fact, ""society"" doesn't exist.

Sorry you think that way.

&gt;There are individuals and groups that interact; we are not some kind of fucking cyborg collective. Tell me, when some family sells their farm to pay the death/inheritance tax, do you directly benefit? Fuck no. Government benefits. Some bureacrat decides where that income goes--not you.

Actually, we do benefit...what do you think government spends money on? For US. Duh (well mostly). The biggest expenses are military (ie, the security you talk about), medicare, medicaid, and social security.

&gt;And you freely admit that your vote doesn't amount to shit. So, again I ask, how in the fuck are you going to see any returns out of that bureaucrat's decision when he's far more heavily influenced by someone with much deeper pockets?

Maybe the solution isn't to be against government though, but to make sure government listens to the right people?

&gt;And, if you hate the system so much, let's have a look at the ACA. How was it advertised? ""All people need healthcare! Mighty Obama will bring it to you!"" But what was it, really. ""We're going to force you to buy from insurance companies.""

To be fair, I hate ACA. I wish we went single payer. As richard wolff said, we had the chance to have a working health care system like the rest of the first world, but we adopted a republican plan meant to favor insurance companies instead.

&gt;Now, ask yourself who benefits most from this law, that single mom, or Cigna?

Actually both. Despite all its warts, obamacare does help people.

&gt;It is not a false dichotomy. When you ""balance"" something, you take away from one (e.g. technological development) in order to provide for another (e.g. more equal access to healthcare).

And posting the two extremes doesn't help your position. It makes you sound like you're strawmanning. I hate it when libertarians do that. ""We need minimum wage increase"" ""well what if we increased it to $100 an hour?"" ""We need to have basic income"" ""well what if we went straight to socialism with 100% tax rates?""

All false dichotomies, all strawmen that make the issue one of two extremes, when we should be weighing incremental costs and benefits and trying to find the RIGHT minimum wage or the RIGHT amount of wealth redistribution, etc. THings aren't black and white, and quite frankly, when you try to make me see the world in such climsy black and white terms, it makes you look like you aren't trying to seriously address my arguments. 

Here's a strawman for you. What if we took ALL the wealth, made it where everyone starves, and now we'll get 2050 tech by 2015? Well, that won't be good, because everyone will STARVE. That's how silly your arguments sound from the other side.

&gt;Your idea of ""better"" will reduce my idea of ""better."" I don't give two shits if 90% of the country falls into bankruptcy if it means that we find a way to achieve effecitve immortality in 40 years as opposed to 200. In such a situation, your idea effectively dooms millions of people to die when they didn't have to at all.

Small loss for a great gain. Greatest good for the greatest number, and quite frankly, your idea of good has a tingwe of upper class bias and reeks of the ""I got mine"" mentality.

Also, there's no reason to assume we'll have immortality in 40 years...I recently listened to a podcast on this subject, and it just ain't gonna happen within our lifetimes.

Also, who will afford it? Not the common man, just some rich jerk who will just spend hundreds more years hoarding his wealth.

&gt;The military, powerful as it is, has not advanced nearly so quickly as the private sector. Now, that said--it does provide lots of impetus for funding in a lot of important ways. DARPA laid the foundation for the internet, and it is currently funding plenty of research for cybernetics to assist with folks returning home with lost limbs. These are just a couple examples.

I've heard it said the government is about 10 years ahead of the private sector. Not to mention, you really dont knwo the full extend of what the government has technologically, since by the time it's public, it's decades old.

&gt;Again, though--I'm not advocating for no state research. I'm advocating being very scrutinizing about it.

And I'm just adovcating that everyone should be able to have healthcare.

&gt;Once again, I'm not advocating for this. It is either a misconception on your part, or a deliberate straw man.

Fair enough, keep in mind I DO deal with a good number of ancaps on this site though.

Fizjig,childfree,1389892536.0,"I was on board with what they wrote here until they got to the part about cutting parents slack for not knowing their child is being annoying. 

It is their choice to have kids and job as parents to know what their child is doing. It should be the responsibility of every parent to mind their infant spawn. Saying that a parent is ""used to it"" so everyone else should just excuse them when they don't realize they are being obnoxious is not only a lazy, apathetic, cop out, but a poor way to treat others around you. 

At infant age it's the responsibility of the parent to mind the child. At toddler age that child should be  being taught how to act in public. If that child still is incapable of behaving themselves in public they should not be allowed in public. Harsh? Maybe. 

When a parent cannot manage their child, or won't manage their child it's not the parent who pays the penalty for their out of line crib monster. It's the rest of us."

notskunkworks,relationships,1389892590.0,"What is your essential nature? What defines you at the lowest most fundamental level? What will it take to be the best version of you?

These are all really important questions to explore because you have already decided that you do not enjoy social interaction and that it's an inherent, natural, immutable state of your identity and nature. If that's true and your wife will not be happy with someone like you, then that's a pretty big incompatibility. A clash of life energy, priorities, perspectives, and a huge difference when it comes to what you guys do with your free time.

Is your lack of desire to socialize really an inherent trait though? Let's challenge that assumption because honestly, your marriage can't really afford to have you believe that.

I believe being an introvert is not a direct analogue to shying away from social interaction. It means you're happy being by yourself and you lead a rich inner life, but it doesn't mean you're a wallflower at parties or are terrible at planning them, or that you have to sit at home rather than explore the world. The problem isn't that you're not social, the problem is that you're boring!

You're not interested in things! The world and the wacky ass people in it and their stories. You don't want to go out and DO things that take you out of some narrow band of activities in your comfort zone.

Does it cause you anxiety doing something new? That's a problem to work on with your therapist. Are you not interested in the inner lives of other people? There are some really interesting people out there, and some of them you would never know it from the outside.

Your wife doesn't need you to be a gregarious charmer and a perfect host, so ask yourself, is this it? Is this the best version of yourself? Or are there some other issues you might be able to figure out that allow you to lead a more active and rich lifestyle that's still compatible with your introversion?"

However, none of them are evil. They merely are. ""Evil"" is applied when their goals are in opposition to those applying the term. As far as Mehrunes Dagon is concerned, **we** are evil because we won't let him find the pieces of Mundus he stashed so he can give them to Alduin and go back to Leaping everywhere. We are complicit in his torture.

Boethiah isn't evil, though I have some incredibly strong cause to think so. Boethiah is instructive, and harsh by necessity when people don't listen.

ZapActions-dower,gallifrey,1389892939.0,"There's three major types of science fiction:  hard, soft, and fantasy.  Asimov and Clarke usually fall under the heading ""hard science fiction"" which is characterized by adherence to a strict set of scientific rules.  Authors in this category will often even make it so their universe doesn't have FTL travel or communication because those don't exist in our current understanding of the universe.

Soft science fiction is much less concerned with accuracy or coherency of a rule system and more with the implications of this or telling more personal stories.  You could associated it more with ""soft"" sciences than ""hard"" sciences.  1984 could be considered soft science fiction.  Science fiction video games like Halo also fit into this category.  There is an overall science fiction setting, but the focus is on the story (and gameplay) rather than the science itself.  This category can feature a lot of impossible technologies that make the story work better or are more interesting to contemplate.

Science fantasy is another category, in which there is a science-y setting but the story plays out more like a fantasy novel/movie/whatever.  There are often fantastical elements mixed in with the science fiction, but there don't need to be.  Star Wars approaches this, but games like Final Fantasy VII and VIII, Shadowrun, and manga/anime like Dragon Ball embrace it wholeheartedly.

Doctor Who has never been hard scifi.  It generally wobbles for just harder than average for soft scifi to something approaching science fantasy, but not as much as Star Wars."

DrinkyDrank,TheRedPill,1389893015.0,"So, my understanding from reading this article is that masculinity is defined by strong characteristics, i.e. high self-esteem, extroverted, highly motivated, etc.; and femininity is defined by weak characteristics, i.e. low self-esteem, emotional sensitivity, introverted, etc.  My question to those who subscribe to this point of view:  why do you desire females, other than for sex?  Do you believe there are any positive, desireable aspects of femininity?  

The author of the article talks about both genders striking a natural balance and helping each other out, yet mentions nothing of what exactly the feminine half contributes to the equation.  In my mind, this sort of sets up a sexual hierarchy in which the ""alphas"" are the pinnacle of success, and climbing up the hierarchy means being as masculine as possible.  This isn't balanced, it's completely imbalanced.  It's a top-heavy system in which certain personal types are guaranteed failure.  For example, I am a man but I am also a bit shy, I am emotionally sensitive, and I am not particularly motivated but I like to support others in their goals.  Typical beta, right?  But I like who I am!  I don't want to have to become some macho hypermasculine douchebag just so I can date girls.  Can't I just find a girl who displays alpha characteristics?  I know they're out there, I've dated them before.  What's wrong with that?  I guess what I'm saying is that a little bit of androgyny should be considered a good thing, because it allows flexibility into the system such that balanced relationships can occur naturally.

lawrencethomas3,conspiratard,1389893050.0,"If you have a weakened immune system for any reason you should almost never get a live virus vaccine.  But the same thinking applies to people with controlled HIV/AIDS, dead virus vaccines like the flu shot are safe and recommended.   Now someone who has advanced AIDS and isn't getting treatment for it... well, they have more problems than getting a flu vaccine, but in that case the protection provided by a flu shot probably aren't going to be enough to stop the flu.

I think most confusion among reasonable people extends from 'symptoms' people get after getting one of these vaccinations.  People think they somehow got infected because they are having symptoms, but in reality its just the bodies' normal immune response to foreign particles that is making them feel bad. "

hopewings,relationship_advice,1389893118.0,"Real love triangles involve two people who are in love with one person.  Your post is unclear regarding whether or not your friend also likes this girl more than a fling.  Do you know whether she likes your friend as more than something casual?  Has she come out and said that she wants to be in a relationship with you? Does she know if you like her as more than a fling?  These are things you need to clarify instead of just guess via ""tone of the conversation"" and ""suggestions.""

It also seems from your post that this girl already knew that the guy was one of your best friends, but slept with him anyway.  Why?  What good could that possibly do?  Was she trying to make you jealous?  Stir some trouble between you?  Those would be some questions that come to mind.  But if she and you both have some history for sleeping around casually, then it's up to you whether or not to accept it.

Finally, you are both 23, which is just out of college and quite young.    Some advice from someone who tried to do the obfuscation and guess games -- everything about a relationship is easier if you are open, honest and genuine.  Nobody can truly ""read"" anybody else, even if you've been together for years and know a lot about each other.  That's where communication comes in, where you talk about things and have deep heart-to-hearts, tell each other what you are thinking and feeling, and make issues transparent.  Then you show via actions that you are consistent with your thoughts and emotions.  These are things that build trust.  Life is too short to play these silly head games.

Good luck."

Triplanetary,DaystromInstitute,1389893183.0,"&gt; Minimize waste heat to the point where you're losing energy to space faster than you generate it while running silent. This gives you the ability to cloak stationary objects like planetary defense grids, but is not supremely useful for a starship that has to maneuver unless you can minimize the waste heat from the engines.

The way you're wording it is kind of physically impossible, as I understand it, but you *can* store your excess heat and only radiate it out at a time when you're not worried about being observed. You can only do this for finite stretches of time, of course, depending on the capacity of your storage. (And yes, to anyone who noticed, that is indeed how they do it in Mass Effect.)

Lasing the heat away sounds like a really good idea.

A method that's used in Alastair Reynolds' *Revelation Space* trilogy is to create a pattern of thermal radiation on your hull that exactly matches the radiative background of the universe, so basically like a heat chameleon. I have no idea how realistic that is."

If you want to donate, you can donate either at http://tripsit.me/about-tripsit/support-tripsit/ or at http://www.gofundme.com/TripSit. The second option lets you get some Tripsit stickers or T-shirt, but obviously only a portion of that money goes towards the site (the swag is very cool though!)


The money donated goes towards running costs for the servers, and to help make merchandise which we can sell to raise money, that sort of thing. I can find more information about it if you are interested, I deal with the tripsitting instead of this sort of stuff really."

You have to understand what this phrase actually means. It could very well be that they actually do want to hang out with you. But when they say ""let's hang out **sometime**"" that's an obligation-free way for them to stay on good terms with you without actually commiting to anything. If you want to hang out with them then YOU have to take the initiative to invite them to something. Get their # or FB and talk to them. Find out what they're interested in and what they like doing. Hell, ask them if *they* know of anything going on and see if you can both go to that.

Also, I can blend it with my fingers so that way I don't need a foundation brush. For eyeshadow, I take a small neutral palette, like NARS And God Created the Woman. I take a variety of eye liners since they're small and easy to pack. I usually just stick with a neutral blush that also doubles as bronzer, such as NARS Douceur. I then take a few lipsticks: a natural, like MAC Syrup, a dark red, like Chanel La Sensuelle, and a nude, like Milani Nude Cream. Then I'm all about travel mascaras, perfect size for traveling.

NanoNarse,starbucks,1389893644.0,"I like to stress to all my new baristas early that the job has a sharp learning curve and things will take time to learn. Occasionally you'll get a newbie who just gets things on their first go, but the job can be very overwhelming for some. It's important to stay positive and stress that it's perfectly okay to make mistakes or not know something, so long as you're willing to learn and correct.

One trick I've learned is to establish early who the authority figures are in the store. That's you and the management team. When you're not around, baristas may try teaching new partners their tricks and create bad habits, or straight up misinform them. If the partner gets confused, it's nice to know whose advice to fall back on.

Lastly, keep going back to old topics. Your partner might have demonstrated knowledge of all the cup markings last week, but it's easy to forget things when you're being given a lot of new information in a new environment. Little pop quizzes in a quiet moment, or asking them to make a few drinks to keep sharp, goes a long way to helping them keep on top of things.

Hope that helps."

taonzen,bicycling,1389893658.0,"All of the big name apps will do what you're looking for; you might want to spend a month trying each one just to see which you prefer. 

I switched between Strave and MapMyRide for a while, before setting on Strava. MMR is more fitness oriented - it lets you log other details, like weather conditions, has a calorie counter, and will interface with other MapMyFitness utilities. Drawback: A lot of nag screens, and it maybe be *more* than what you need. Also, on my older Galaxy, it burned the most battery. 

Strave is better on battery, but lower on features (most of which I wasn't using anyway). Both allow you to join groups, and to track your ride against other people in the area. 

I used Endomondo for a while, but it did not run well on my phone. I switched phones after the end of bike season, so I might try it again... except now I already have a bunch of stuff in Strava.

It seems from your post that you are advocating circumcision where all that is needed is some warm water and gentle rubbing. The substances that are formed on the inside of the foreskin takes care of most bad bacteria and you just rinse it off daily. Circumcision would not ""help"" in that regard, I think that's why you are being downvoted. And just because it's good at harboring bad bacteria doesn't mean it will or that it will be harmful given normal hygiene.

The problems I have with GTAO are some of the bad design flaws I see, like kicking you out of your session before telling you the session you're trying to join is full, and then taking you to a different session. I wish they'd work on making this easier to play with your friends/crew because the glitching and hacking doesn't bother me that much -- in fact, it made the game more fun for a while -- But being separated from my friends after missions even though we all voted 'free mode,' that's way more annoying to me.

That's just great. So you say the next time a specialist says something you will know better? Like, ""smoking is bad for your health""... ""it isn't, I smoke and I'm still alive"" - good luck with your life mate, you will need lots of it!

&gt;As I said, that 1% is not spread equally around the country and it equates to 700k people

Have you read anything I've told you and given SOURCES to or just like UKIP supporter you will ignore facts? Like the link showing pretty good spread of population within whole UK and max being 6% in certain areas (which actually have been already previously affected by that certain immigration).

&gt;The percentage of residents of White Other origin has risen from 6.4 percent in 2001 to 14.5 percent in 2011. This is probably attributable to a large influx of Eastern Europeans (A8/A10) into the borough since 2004

I have found your source. *Waltham Forest has a population of 258,200 * 

*The data shows that the greatest number of National Insurance registrations in the borough over the last 10 years have come from residents originally from Poland (12,250), followed by Pakistan (10,760) and Lithuania (7,410). Other arrivals from Eastern Europe include Romania (6,940) and Bulgaria (4,170). South Africa is the fifth highest ranked source at 5,860.*

Total number of :

* Poles in Waltham Forrest is then: 4.7%
* Lithuanians: 2.87%
* Romanians: 2.68%
* Bulgarians: 1.61%

If topic of immigration is discussed, why haven't you mentioned anything about 10k new people from Pakistan (clearly, UK isn't forced to let in non-EU arrivals, especially if it claims it has a problem with too many immigrants).

What about this *Muslim: 21.9% / 56,541 in 2011 (15.1% / 32,902 - 2001)*? I don't recall Eastern Europeans being of that religion and it shows clearly increase of the population of 6%. Why don't you, nor anybody else notices this and focuses their attack SOLELY on immigrants from Eastern Europe?

As you can see, I was right about Poles being the highest of 6% in the areas with their highest arrivals.

P.S. Britain either needs to talk about IMMIGRATION in general or do NOT talk about it at all if it wants to choose only some groups of immigrants, based on their agenda."

I overanalzye quite frequently.  Once I start ""feeling"" a little more, I tend to not be able to stop talking about it.  If people are around me when I do hit the ""feels mode"" then it occasionally turns into a ""How can I avoid /u/Dsf192 without hurting his feelings too much?"" state.  In reality I just want to stop thinking about it, but it doesn't always turn out that way.

So it's kind of a double edged sword.  I need to understand an issue on my own time, but I'm told to stop being distant.  So I open up a little (read: a lot) more and then people leave me alone.  Honesty is not always the best policy, but I have a hard time not being honest when people ask me direct questions.  Why lie about how I feel?"

Time that coulda been used to work on the quarterback situation, or making sure Bess doesn't drop as many passes, or that Jason Campbell is aware that that guy wearing #84 with Cameron on his back is a hell of a good TE.  Maybe he should throw to him.  You were setting up for long term success, but expected short term results and kicked the staff to the curb because of that.  Norv is a good coach, but he was set scrambling all year long and the offense wasn't enough to keep the defense from being out all game long.  Can't expect a defensive coordinator to take the blame for his guys being tired from being out there after *another* three and out.

When you feel alone and alienated, that is your ""gut"" giving you a survival-level assessment and it keeps you from accepting the words and ideas you and he are talking about. As an adult, though, we learn to act differently than we feel. For instance we get up and go to work to support our families whether or not the job sucks. 

You might be feeling trapped between those forces, unable to be happy with the decisions and unable to rationalize away the feelings so you could soldier on. That is evidence that you are a selfless and fearless woman who deserves the best in life. His behavior stems from thinking that he deserves different than what he has, from his fear of being judged for what he is, and from the selfishness that started it all.

It isn't that you can do better. It's that from this point forward you can't do much worse. A year after you leave, you won't feel much need to take any responsibility because you won't be committed to him so perfectly that his black hole of greed warps your world view. The sooner you start the journey, the sooner your brain will stop exploding.

Reyalla508,poledancing,1389894069.0,"While I am no doctor I'll let you know what I think. :) 

Risk free doesn't really exist but I'd say any move in which you are actively pulling up with bent elbows and therefore fully engaged biceps will be fine (basic invert, shoulder mount, pencil spin and corkscrew spin). After that would be normal static spins (where the shoulder is not twisted). The momentum and weight bearing can cause strain if you're not actively engaging that shoulder, even with the straight arm. Higher risk are reverse grab spins, pretzel spin, twisted grip anything. Until everything is in tip top shape, avoid those moves. Because you have such loose shoulder joints susceptible to dislocation you will have to be focused on active engagement of the joint at all times. The moment you release that at the wrong time is the moment you'll have an accidental injury. Avoid anything that thrusts body weight onto your shoulders in an abrupt manner (handsprings, jumping into inverts or spins). 

Handstands are a great thing to work on and will do well for your situation. I've never heard of a shoulder dislocating during a handstand. Just don't overdo it. Your wrists will thank you. Yes, you should be pushing up in the handstand, actively pushing through your shoulders into the floor. It's one of the only times you should be pushing your shoulders closer to your ears.

OHotDawnThisIsMyJawn,malefashionadvice,1389894085.0,"I dealt with this for the first like... 24 years of my life.  I did the same thing as you with the hat.  At first I wore a hat every day just to keep my hair down.  Then when I got a job I wore a hat while I drove to work so it would dry down and look ok once I took the hat off.

* The most improtant was going to a nice salon and having them cut my hair.  The crappy barber my mom took me to growing up had no idea what he was doing in retrospect.  I'm sure there are barbers out there that know what they are doing as well.

* Switching shampoos was a big help.  I used to use whatever was cheap but I switched to Pantene Pro V for Dry Hair and it makes a noticeable difference.  

* Only washing my hair once a day.  Even though I do something active after work almost every day, when I take my second shower I don't shampoo my hair, only rinse

* Using product.  I was in this dumb feedback loop where I was always touching my hair because I was self conscious about it so I didn't want to use product.  But the reason it sucked and I was self conscious about it was because I wasn't using any product.  The product will depend on your exact cut

* Honestly, cutting it short.  I went short for 5 years or so.  Just a short on the sides and a little longer on top with some product to give it some shape and texture.  That got me comfortable with my hair and used to putting stuff in it.  I'm growing it back out but instead of just being a long poofy mass of afropuff I'm going more in this direction: http://0.tqn.com/d/mensfashion/1/0/K/w/74266396.jpg"

Mayor_of_Pallet_Town,AskReddit,1389894137.0,"Absolutely.

Apart from the fact that it set me up for a great job, it taught me a large number of invaluable things:

I learned about paying rent. 

I learned about drugs and alcohol. 

I learned that when no one is telling you what to do, it actually makes it harder to do the ""right"" thing. 

I learned what happens when you forget to pay a utility bill. twice.

It taught me to think critically, and more importantly, to be open to other people's world views.

I learned how to play quidditch.

I learned that Zelda tattoos probably aren't the best idea.

I figured out that you probably shouldn't let your roommate ""give you a haircut"" because he WILL mess up and you'll probably end up having to shave your head to a zero and be called a neo nazi for a few weeks.

I learned that searching for missing/dead people in the woods is not a smart thing to do. And that you and your friends will end up with ticks in you.

I learned what it was like to struggle with mental health and that there were other people struggling with the same things.

I learned that people change over time, some for the good and some for the bad. And that you inevitably will too.

I learned that gas is incredibly, incredibly flammable, and it's ALWAYS good to have a fire extinguisher and/or hose around.

I figured out that if you go to a non-target school, networking is incredibly important in obtaining a good job.

I learned that life is short, and fragile.

I learned that gay people were normal, good people. And that they should have 100% the same rights and liberties that I have.

I learned someone will always have it better than you, and someone will always have it worse than you.

I learned to not leave a candle burning on your nightstand when you go to sleep. You may wake up with a pillow engulfed in flames.

I learned that beer bottles, when thrown at high speeds, will go through, and remain stuck in a wall.

I figured out that being a Resident Assistant (RA) is a lot of fun. But a lot of work. I've seen some shit, man.

I learned how to be a man.

That's all that come to mind quickly. But yes. College is worth it. If you can, move away from family and friends and move somewhere away from the town you live/grew up in. Moving away was important for me to really ""grow up."" It is an incredibly valuable time to learn who you are to grow into the person you want to be."

I would just like to point out that you haven't tried every possible route to healing.

There is a an approach in therapy and self-help called somatic psychotherapy. Bascially it's based on the belief that mood disorders are psychosomatic, and have to be healed psychosomatically. Whereas most therapy modalities are based in changing cognition eg. thoughts, beliefs.

My personal favorite promoters of this approach are David Berceli, Alexander Lowen, and David Berceli.

This very popular self-development and strength conditioning youtuber shows and explains the Alexander Lowen approach. 

Please watch these short vids and take 15 mins every other day and give them a go;

The catharsis in action;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHFYEQRnQew

The explanation using the triune brain hypothesis (a falsified hypothesis, but I think still a very useful metaphor for the different aspects of self).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzfXd0yZz1A

It will only take 15 minutes total to watch the above, but it might give you hope and a different approach to find help.

These vids might seem 'extreme' to many people who have never tried it, but it's basically about catharsis. In mainstream psychotherapy catharsis is restricted to words and images, in this approach it's expressed with the whole being.

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1389894342.0,"I think your venue is giving you a discount/more-bang-for-your-buck *because* of your FMIL's involvement with them, and because of that, I think it's completely normal that the coordinator is contacting your FMIL about the wedding.

**I do not think it's OK for the coordinator to lie about your requests,** though it is possible that there's a miscommunication or misunderstanding somewhere (from you to the coordinator, the coordinator to your FMIL, or from your FMIL to you).  I recommend asking all information to be in writing, and you can forward that to your FMIL (including the email in question) so you're all on the same page.  Better yet, CC your FMIL and ask the coordinator to do the same, so all 3 of you are constantly in the same loop.

If the coordinator continues to cut you out of the loop, be sure to send her an email, with your FMIL CCed, stating that as the bride, you need to be included in all discussions about the wedding, and would appreciate it if she would contact you and your FMIL together by email.

As for the bar situation, I have no idea.  If you don't want to do drink tickets (or even a bowl of tickets, so there's a finite supply, but people can take as few or a many as they want), you're kind of stuck with the opennest bar ever.  I would nix the last night snack menu completely, since it will save you money that you can use for wiggle room with the bar.

For those who don't know, the 4th and 5th book run parallel to each other, just with different characters in each. Many people say the 4th is the worst book due to it being mainly political and lacking most peoples favorite characters, because they are in the 5th. As you can probably guess, that's exactly how I feel lol.

But honestly, I hope they don't do that. There's a lot of good info in the second half of ASOS. Maybe they meant that they would pull some more Lady Stonehart stuff from the 4th/5th books so you aren't left hanging with just the epilogue of ASOS (another jaw dropping moment).

Sometimes I think this whole ""active participation"" shtick - and by the way, that's not what the council said - is just a ruse for erasing the distinction between priest and laity, incrementally getting the congregation used to the idea.

Which, incidentally, dovetails nicely with society's landslide into a culture of fatherlessness. Once everyone in the parish has an on-stage role to play in mass, the only thing you would need a priest for is to say the magic words. And that's all. So who needs a priest for such a legalistic technicality anyway?

AnimusHerb240,occult,1389894445.0,"&gt; **Did you just criticize criticism?**

Yeah.

&gt; **Why do some people hate criticism so much? What lies behind the rejection of criticism? Can we drill down into it?**

I found this passage that sums it up nicely:

&gt; It's the Sam Harrises wasting breath on Deepak Chopras. It's the Chaotes wasting breath on the lineage followers. It's the skeptics wasting breath on the overtly ""religious"". **They're smart people with some good things to share, if they would just get on sharing it and dispense with the insecurity and get straight to their message.**

&gt; —AnimusHerb240, *16 January 2014* (emphasis added)

You boil down any text into a set of positions/suggestions—the stuff leftover after we get out our fat red pen and strike out all the ""HOWEVER""s and ""FURTHERMORE""s and ""OBVIOUSLY""s and ""BUT WE MUSN'T FORGET""s (and other less obvious empty fluff language and fallacies)—and you will likely find at the heart of certain flavors of criticism what amounts to waving a big flag that signifies **insecurity**, **impotency**, **weak dogmatism**, and/or **irrational expectations** (""irrational expectations""...forgive the redundancy) on the part of the author.

""You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."" ―Richard Buckminster Fuller

Does Kepler need to ""criticize"" Ptolemy for his circular orbit model as he demonstrates math in support of an elliptical one? (No.) Does Crowley need to criticize the church, or people in his community he has judged as being prudish, to sell me on Thelema, or his teachings on yoga? (No.)

The truth always has done quite a fine enough job of speaking for itself, and the people who are close to it often need do nothing but smile and nod as wave after wave of angry people pound away at keyboards or foam at the mouth behind loudspeakers. Those people really have nothing to say but ""NAAYYY"". They just react, or are just bored, and someone ought to deconstruct their criticism for them and show them the ghosts haunting their language.

""Truth often suffers more by the heat of its defenders than the arguments of its opposers."" ―William Penn

And then we come to ad hominem, straw men, character assassination, which are categorized as fallacious for good reason (not to imply that these can't be used Artfully). [Polemics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemic) has its place, criticism certainly has its place, and makes for more literature, I guess...by all means, keep the discussion going. On my reading list, for example, is [Rorty and his Critics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385169.Rorty_and_His_Critics) (the first published title in the realm of ""academic philosophy"" in which I've ever expressed interest besides *The Republic*).

**""The problem with Creationists is that they--""** *UGGGGGGhhhhhhhh... thanks for wasting my time. What do you HAVE TO SAYYYYYY. Nothinggggggg except ""NUH UHHH!!!""*

Criticism can kill the momentum of thoughtful debate, even if it is indirect, implied, crafted through use of tone/snark/sarcasm (you may have encountered this on the Internet). If the criticized fall into the trap of feeling offended, they may subsequently resort to a degree of defensiveness that sullies the conversation. I don't want to debate someone whose jimmies are rustled. I want to to debate someone who knows I consider them an equal, so we can really communicate, and the merit in the discourse can shine through more clearly."

Then when I got it I had a lot of trouble with the detonation aspect, it just doesnt work the way I would want it to work. It only arms after a certain distance which is hard to gauge and the explosion radius is very nominal. Furthermore the explosion animation doesnt even look that great. It does have the detonator jump ability, which I quickly learned was the best part about this weapon for me. 

I would have liked this weapon if the detonation worked more like the scorch shot does now, except instead of knocking people back along its path it created a mini explosion with knockback, which could be activated at any distance, basically the way the scorch shot explodes after it lands now. Imo they didnt need to add another weapon that did the same thing better and take the fire out of the detonator.

WhiteMarauder,books,1389894596.0,"From history class we always learned he wrote it in a jail cell after he was arrested for some kind of political crime.

So he basically wrote it in a place where he was very, very angry.  There's a lot of antisemitism and anti-communism.  He blames those two groups along with a number of others for the worlds and his problems.  Basically it's a book about how he wants to change the world, kind of like how an idealist writes about his perfect world.

I'm not going to sway you against reading it but, If you do read it, take it with a grain of salt.  I wouldn't take 90% of that book for fact and it definitely wont give you some kind of insight.

Most people picture Hitler as a mad man, so how do you think a book written by someone who's insane is going to be?"
goosrick,truegaming,1389894598.0,"The MGS games have a history of using almost all the features on the hardware and having almost all of the buttons mapped to one or even multiple functions.

MGS (PSX)

* You have to switch controller ports to beat Psycho Mantis (who also makes your controller vibrate and reads you memory card with his 'psychic powers') 

* Naomi gives you a massage, telling you to hold the controller against your arm (which then vibrates) 

* You need to look at the back of the game case to find a essential codec frequency

MGS2 (PS2)

* During cutscenes you can press triangle/R1 (can't remember which one) to zoom in. The harder you press down the button, the more it'll zoom in

* The analog buttons are used for aiming your gun (sadly didn't work very well, the sweet spot for aiming without firing was to finicky), and throwing explosives (not sure about the explosives).

* There's a motion sensor gadget based around the vibrate function

MGS3 (PS2)

* Motion sensor returns

* Analog buttons are used for aiming/throwing again (works way better than in 2)

* Again there's a button for zooming in during cutscenes

* The ps2's internal clock is used for a battle with the End, who dies of old age when you don't play the game for a week during his boss battle

* The internal clock is also used for healing; you can take a break from the game and Snake's health and stamina bar will fill back up

* The game has a brand new melee system (CQC) based around the circle button. Tap for a punch, mash for choke, hold lightly for a grab, squeeze for throat slit. You can also throw and interrogate.

MGS4 (PS3)

* CQC returns, with added features!

* Analog cutscene zoom button returns

* Internal ps3 clock is used for sales at Drebin's store at certain days of the week

* The amount of different functions mapped to the buttons are ridiculous. Almost all the buttons do multiple things depending on how hard you press them, whether you're standing up, crouching, crawling, near a wall, etc.

* There are two weapons in the game that require you to shake your controller around

* Shaking your controller gets rid of your current camouflage

* Motion controls can be used to control metal gear mkII/III during mission briefings

* Psycho Mantis returns with his old routine

As you can see, almost all the hardware features are used in the games, vibration, internal clocks, analog buttons, motion controls, the memory card itself, the game case itself, and even the discs themselves! (The MGS games take up a lot of disc space).

I have no doubt that MGSV will use all the new dualshock 4 features (built-in speakers, touchpad) and new ps4 hardware features (if there are any)

EDIT: When I complain about MGS2's aiming, I'm talking about aiming with *automatic rifles.* The pistols work with a release-to-fire mechanic that works just fine, while the rifles use a press down lightly to aim, press down hard to fire mechanic."

They politely told me that they were going to have to arrest me and that I had to be handcuffed. I said I understood. They told me they would double lock them so I didn't accidentally tighten them on myself. They brought me down to the station where I had to breathe into the big breathalyzer machine. The city had a zero tolerance for people under 21 meaning you WOULD be arrested, but had a grace level of 0.02 if you were underage, meaning if you blew a 0.02 or lower, they would just make you call someone to pick you up. 

I blew a 0.03. The officer was so nice, he said he'd let me go to the bathroom and blow again. Still was a 0.03. He said he'd call the bondsman for me because he didn't want to send me to jail.

dlyslexlicth,exmuslim,1389894808.0,"It certainly isn't very eloquent in english, there is far more eloquence to be found in popular science and fiction books. As for its eloquence in classical arabic, well only classical arab speakers can confirm that and that just brings up the question of Islam's accessibility to all of mankind considering Islam is supposed to be for all mankind. Furthermore 'eloquence' is a subjective term, it is a matter of perspective, to certain people it may certainly seem eloquent and beautiful, to others it brash, banal and repetitive.

The eloquence of the quran does not compare to the eloquence to be found in so much of mankind's literature. Even if it is 'eloquent', it certainly ain't divinely so. If they think that's the best God can do then I hate to say it but they have quite a lowly opinion of God's literary skill.

Lastly the fact that so many people read the quran and are either turned totally away from Islam or just don't really feel anything special about it just proves that it's supposed eloquence and divine nature really isn't self evident. Of course the muslim will argue either that these people are willingly denying its divinity when truly they think it is, or that Allah (the most merciful!) has turned their hearts to stone and blinded them from its beauty.

sayheykid24,baseball,1389894842.0,"Keep it simple: 3 sets of 5 (to maximize and strength and minimize bulk) of deadlift, bench (unless you're a pitcher), and- most importantly- squats 3 days a week. You'll build strength rapidly in the first month or two of the program. Make sure you do full squats though- that means going below parallel- otherwise you may as well not even do them. Check out Mark Rippetoe's book, [Starting Strength,](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738) to learn proper form and additional tips. Squats and deadlifts- will build core strength and explosiveness more effectively than anything else. After you progress a bit with this, start alternating cleans and deadlifts. 

As far as losing weight, figure out how many calories your body needs to maintain it's current weight, and eat at a 200-500 deficit each day, and get as much protein as you can. That means lots of chicken, turkey, beef, and fish. Rather than doing endurance running, I would recommend high intensity interval training. That's basically short, intense cardio. My favorite routine is a 15 minute stationary bike drill: 

1. Start out by warming up for 5 minutes at half of the bike’s max resistance.

2. After 5 minutes, pedal as fast as you can for 10 seconds.

3. Then, increase the resistance to the max and still pedal as fast as you can. Continue this for 20 seconds.

4. Go back to an easy pace and half resistance for 90 seconds.

5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until you hit 15 minutes.

The first few times you do this you'll probably feel like puking at some point, so pace yourself if need be. This exercise will help you lose weight and build leg strength much more efficiently than endurance training, and you won't sacrifice overall strength like you would do if you ran for more than 30 minutes each day. 

As far as baseball drills, do the usual: long toss, soft toss, hit off a tee, practice swings in your back yard, etc. I'm sure you'll get some good stuff at the camp you're going to. 

Edit: to figure out what your calorie intake should be use [this calculator](http://www.1percentedge.com/ifcalc/), and choose sedentary for activity level. "

Gluestick05,AskWomen,1389894904.0,"I don't think [the statistics](http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/resources/FAQ.html) really agree with the stereotype on this one.

For men age 25-29, only 1.9% of married men report not having sex in the past year, compared to 46.6% of single men and 20.8% of partnered men.  The percentage of men not having sex is always lowest for married men, with the exception of the 60-69 age range.  If you want to avoid being sexless, clearly marriage is the way to go.

Married men were also more likely to be having more frequent sex.  46.3% of married men 25-29 had sex a few times per month-weekly, compared to 27.1% of single men and 36.4% of partnered men.

For men in the 30-39, 40-45, and 50-59 brackets, married men do report the highest two frequencies slightly less than partnered, unmarried men, but the most common reporting status for married men at these age ranges is still ""a few times per month to weekly.""

Edit: I definitely agree that frequency != quality, but I'm under the impression that the standard complaint is ""no sex"" not ""boring sex.""  Could be wrong.  I'm also not arguing that a few times a month-once a week is doin' it like rabbits, but that's not a sexless marriage either."

Probably because their relationship was more complicated. 

Also I preferred Spike with Dru because I thought it was sweet how even though he was evil he took this clearly insane, wounded woman under his wing and stuck by her. I loved that part when she was talking about how beautiful the night sky was and Spike was like, ""that's the ceiling, love... Also it's day."""

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389895273.0,"There was definitely pressure to lose weight, but none of it was really direct - in other words, no one really told me that I was fat or that I needed to lose weight. 

First off, most people want to look good, right?  I started really looking at myself in the mirror (at first, it was just denial), and I realized I was pretty damn big.  Even sucking in my stomach wasn't changing things as much as I thought.  Then I saw myself in pictures - I really wasn't happy with that. 

Then there's pressure which is taken, I suppose, from how people treat you.  Anyone that has lost weight can likely explain the difference.  You're more approachable when you're in better shape, and people tend to be more likely to talk with you, flirt with you, or even look at you.  It's a big difference.  When you're overweight, you notice everyone around you is almost seeming like they're getting special treatment while you're getting ignored.  It sucks.


I don't think teasing would help - teasing usually puts people on the defensive, and you want to prove them wrong, whether it's in a good way or not.  Someone's going to make a joke about how I'm eating too much pizza?  Well fuck them, let me just eat some more.  So then the cycle continues, and I obviously don't agree with that.

However, I don't think it's acceptable at all to be that overweight, *assuming* that you don't have a major medical condition that's causing it.  Otherwise, it's just eating sensibly, in sensible portions.  Exercise isn't even necessary to be at a healthy weight, although I would recommend that as well.  IMO, the majority of overweight/obese people are being lazy about nutrition.  You don't even have to be an expert to realize you're eating *way* too much.  But if it's not clear how to approach the problem (and if you're obese, there's clearly a visible problem), then use the internet that just about every single person has, and find out how to fix the problem.  But people don't do this.  I watched someone complain about being fat while eating an entire package of oreos. It really blows my mind."

ByronicAsian,IAmA,1389895281.0,"More of a face thing really. Japanese law is also based off of ""Napoleonic Code"" as opposed to Common law I believe. 

Confessions are seen as the king of all evidence as it is the person's own account (despite the fact that some confessions are written up by the prosecutors). Without a confession, Judges MIGHT acquit, and prosecutors hate having an acquittal on their record. One can say the trial phase in Japanese CJ system is when the Prosecutors investigate you and decide whether or not to charge you. The judge is the rubber stamp. 

So the difference here is while in the UK and US, prosecutors may decide it worth the chance to go to trial with circumstantial evidence, most Japanese prosecutors would rather not. Both would probably plea bargain. "

Scarcer,microgrowery,1389895282.0,"Pictures help, but generally having the stigmas 'dry' and turn darker is part of the flower maturing.

Generally you will have a first set of flowers form a cluster. After a few weeks you will have a 2nd wave of fresh flowers form within the cluster, causing the cola's to get bigger. As this happens you may see the first half  of stigmas start to die off and change color. Later the 2nd set will start to die as you approach harvest.

Occasionally plants will spit out a 3rd 'wave'.

Just think of the plant as a factory that keeps churning out flowers over time; but with diminishing returns as it loses vigor.

These waves aren't a sudden burst of additional flower all at once, but a gradual thing you'll see happen over days; just like the very first cluster of flowers that started.

SafteyPencil,Drugs,1389895310.0,"Do you have a source to back the claim, ""it's in fact not possible to develop a physical addiction to cannabis.""? I am here to tell you it IS possible. Yes, mental addictions with cannabis are much more common. Yes, physical addictions to cannabis are not overly abundant, especially compared to other drugs. Yes, physical side effects with marijuana use are generally mild when compared to other illicit drugs. Still, it is documented that people have developed physical dependency, even if generally mild. Also in regards to physical vs psychological addiction, “The distinction is completely arbitrary. Psychological addiction occurs in your brain and it’s a physical change,” says Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Different brain processes may be involved in the psychological drive to take drugs and in the physical withdrawal symptoms when the drug is stopped — but both are brain changes.

I have nothing against cannabis, it is mostly harmless when compared to other drugs. Just don't want supposed ""facts"" getting out that aren't.

BeachBumHarmony,fatpeoplestories,1389895349.0,"I honestly think I could have written that. Dating can suck for some people, not because of their weight, but because of other things. My personality is great, but I was beta and shy in middle school and high school. I was also chubby. Size 12 at my heaviest. 

I said yes to the first guy to ever ask me out in 8th. Did I like him? Truthfully, I had zero sexual attraction to him (His nickname was The Hobbit, he was short and very hairy), but he was and still is a sweet guy. I was very lucky to have him for a first boyfriend. 

Then during high school, I was only asked out by people I wasn't attracted too. I don't even think of this as standards, but I guess it was. I didn't want to be with someone who would get sweaty walking home with me (about 2 miles), I wanted to be able to get my arms fully around someone. No one I *truly* liked asked me out. Why? Because I would get butterflies and couldn't talk to them, so beta. I blamed my weight and of course, wished they guys I liked would look past it. Plenty of guys did, but it would always be guys much bigger than me. 

Then college came. And I stopped being shy. And had a lot of, *ahem*, fun. But no relationships. Any guy I liked wasn't interested in a relationship with me, for various reasons. I even had a guy once tell me, ""I'm looking for someone exactly like you, but not you."" Ouch. Sometimes, it was because of my weight and I knew it. Other times, my lack of religion (fell for Jewish guys a lot - most were looking to date a Jewish girl. I'm not Jewish).

I joined Weight Watchers my final year and dropped some weight, and continued having more fun. Magically, one of those ""fun"" nights turned out to be with a total sweetie, who I had a bunch in common with. We started ""hanging out"" which turned into dating. I stopped going to Weight Watchers when finals came around and got the ""relationship chub"". About a year and half in, he told me ""we got fat"". When I stepped on a scale, I was heavier than when I started Weight Watchers. 

Then, I discovered this sub, along with /r/loseit and /r/progresspics. I'm now down to the smallest I've been since middle school. I'm a size 6. And still going. 

I'm also with the same guy. Who has been there for my highest weight and my lowest weight, who I never had a chance to *truly* like/crush on.

kakersdozen,Health,1389895396.0,"I'm not a doctor or medical professional, but it sounds like you don't have an overbite. Is [this](http://dearestscooter.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/perfect-smile.jpg) what you're talking about? If you line up your front teeth so that the top and bottom incisors are touching, your molars shouldn't touch.

That said, if this is VERY pronounced, it can be considered an overbite, but know that just because your molars don't touch, it doesn't mean you have one.

Many orthodontists offer free consultations (with the end hope that you will get braces). Go see one and specifically mention this concern. I'm sure they will recommend fixing other things, but if they say that your ""overbite"" is normal, you have your answer. Know that they are essentially looking for things to fix, because that is how they get their money, so ask if any of their suggestions are for function or purely aesthetic.

The worst part was they knew we were waiting on them. The bar and kitchen had both closed (the kitchen closed at 10, and the bar at 10:30) so we couldn't get them more drinks or food which they wanted at 11.

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389895512.0,"First of all, it's deflationary. People aren't using BTC as a currency (exchange volume is relatively low), they're using it as a store of wealth.  People don't want to spend BTC because they have reason to believe that it'll be worth more tomorrow than it is today.  This creates bubbles and reduces the stability and liquidity of bitcoins.  

Secondly, it is not attractive to businesses because its limited supply makes it subject to high levels of volatility.  It's nearly impossible to run a business when your cash flow is subject to wild volatility.    In the last 24 hours, bitcoin has fluctuated by about 5% from it's peak to its lowest point.... and today is a relatively peaceful day.  A lot of companies deal with products that have margins below 5%.  They could have purchased inventory for 100BTC and sold it less than 24 hours later for 103BTC and still come out with a loss.  Fixed money supplies can't curb volatility nearly as well as fiat currencies with central banks.  

Beyond those two points, BTC has a lot of other problems:

- A [51% attack](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Attacker_has_a_lot_of_computing_power) could cripple the currency and crush confidence.  

- It is extremely difficult to exchange USD to BTC in a manner that is quick and reliable.  

- It is much easier for me to protect my assets using traditional methods than it is for me to protect bitcoin.  If someone steals my hard drive, hacks my wallet, invades my network or does anything to acquire my BTC, I have no way to recover or even trace my money.  The money in my bank is insured.  Money I spend elsewhere can be traced.  I can keep cash on my body.  It's not nearly that easy with BTC.  "

Skulder,AskHistorians,1389895603.0,"The myth is that he fought for Thyra with clever clothing.

Typing from memory - some details might be fudged.

A rich man whose only child was a young girl, was approached by an old one-eyed man (we all know who that is), who offered to sell him a little pet.

A small pet snake with a magical property - It would sleep on a piece of gold, and the next morning, some more gold would appear.

The girl cared for the snake, and as she grew up to be a stunningly beautiful maiden, so did the snake.

After some years, it would encircle her bed, and it's hoard was sizeable.

When she was a becoming a woman, the snake would fill out an entire room.

And once she was of marrying age (and the most beautiful girl in the area), the snake was so big, that it encircled the house, and wouldn't let anyone near her.

The father, desperate to once again enter his own house, and maybe get his hands on the sizeable treasure, that the snake's hoard had developed into, announced that whoever slew the snake, would get his daughters hand in marriage, and half the hoard.

Many brave heroes tried - most were just munched by the snake, but it also spat poison on those who tried to shoot it from afar. Its scales repelled all steel, and its size meant that a blow from its tail would crush even the hardiest berzerker.

Ragnar wanted both the wonderful Thora and the gold, so he observed, while others rushed in, and spotted a bare spot on the belly of the snake.

He then went to slay the beasts of the forest, and sowed a suit of their furs, and reinforced all the seams with pitch.

Thus covered from head to toe in fur, he snuck up on the dragon at night, crawled up close, bunched himself up under its belly, and stuck a stout oak spear directly into its heart!

(btw, it was all an elaborate Ruse by Odin to find the greatest warrior in the land - Ragnar's later challenges - and those of his sons - make it very clear that he caught the eyes of the gods)"

neo1973,movies,1389895638.0,"Sorry for the late reply - school just started back up (last semester, yea!)

After reading your reply, I will have to concede that AH is thought provoking - very much so.  In that regard, I will admit that I misspoke and did not communicate my thoughts very well.

The characters *are* very deep in this movie - I keep going back to JL's Rosalyn and trying to decide if she is truly psychotic or just helplessly broken (maybe both?).  

Is Cooper's character truly just power hungry, or does he have altruistic intent behind his power lust?

I do stand by my opinion that the movie was not compelling - at least not in the way that I had expected it to be.  Prior to watching the film, I was curious about ABSCAM and did some research on it.  This led me to expect/ desire a story driven film; I wanted to know the intricacies of the ABSCAM scandal, who did what, why, etc.  

Instead we get a character study, which is fine in and of itself, but not what I was expecting/ wanting.  That doesn't diminish the film, as it is what it is.  For me, though, I was a bit let down compared to my expectations.  

I imagine that upon rewatching I will get much more from it than I did the first time."

Investing one card of your budget of sixty in the proposition that ""when I am attacked, I can buy some time"" might return to you your investment when it works, but it definitely wastes a card any time that the opponent is winning without creatures or when you don't draw an answer the next turn. So those turn it from a 1:1 value to more like 0.6 cards value per 1 card invested.

oldneckbeard,programming,1389895703.0,"Yeah, I can see why you did it the way you did. A few points to note: 

1. Typesafe Config is hierarchical. This means that you can have config in properties files, xml, json, hocon, or even come from a database if you write a wrapper. So you can have 10-12 different files that contribute to the config object. It also overrides settings by inspecting the command-line arguments and the environment variables.
2. We work in a continuous delivery shop. Every commit to our version control results in a production deploy (as long as all the gates pass). We write our config files in the HOCON format (with some magic, of course), and generate JSON output. We then throw that into an RPM file and stick it in a behind-the-firewall koji system. As the build passes each environment, we tag it with the next environment. Our config is deployed like code, with hot reloading of the config (that's not built in, but it's not difficult)
3. At my current place, we have 6 different environments. The properties file versions are 200+ lines of just overrides (per environment), with a much longer ""default"" configuration. This maps more naturally to a structured object, and it reduced the code size by half.

Either way, I think you are probably 90% of the way there, just took a slightly different fork. I have a very strong preference to not build things myself unless absolutely necessary :). File sizes just don't bother me any more, if the library is 10k or 10mb, it's irrelevant because these things are being deployed to servers with disk space measured in the range of terabytes.

You should have the option of driving, sure, but having wide roads and plenty of parking spaces only encourages more and more people to drive. This creates congestion, pollution, and forces the city to design for cars, not people. When parking is hard to come by people are more likely to walk, bike, or take public transit which is good for everyone. I've been reading [Happy City](http://www.amazon.com/Happy-City-Transforming-Through-Design-ebook/dp/B009LRWHPY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389895553&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=happy+city) which is an interesting look at urban design."

It's a gross assumption, and despite what is culturally is more common it is ridiculous to assume that it applies to any one woman just because she happens to come from East Asian decent.  

Also, I find something weird and off about guys who want ""passive"" women.  It sounds like they want someone to easily manipulate and control.  The thing that bugs me the most is their word choice.  They may not even intend for it to come off that way (at least I hope they don't)... But if that's the word they chose to use as a descriptor, I'm forced to think that's the word they intended. There are a thousand other things they can say to convey what they mean.  Im honestly not even salty that this type of person prefers Asian women; I think were all entitled to our preferences and sometimes that extends ethnically.  I'm more upset that they can't clearly express what they want without being assumption and insulting.  Instead of saying something like ""I just want someone who's calm, wants to raise a family, doesn't really like going out, and has similar morals to me"" instead they chose to boil their interests and desires down to ""passive"".

when someone dresses in a sexual manner, realistically it is interpreted that they only want to hook up or have sex or whatever. its unfortunate, but people judge how they should act around you based how what you look like, what you're wearing, how you're acting. it's not fair and that's not how it should be, and as much as I can try telling someone to not judge others based on the way they look, they're still going to act a different way around a girl in a mini skirt and crop top vs a girl in a pair of jeans and long sleeve t shirt.

so, getting back to my original point, realistically speaking it is sometimes vital to look at the way you act and dress in order to be taken seriously or as more than just a sexual plaything.

While I have no emotional attachment to my last name, I really really like the sound of my name, and would feel weird just abandoning a big part of my name.  People call me by my full name all the time (it's 7 letters total, 3 for my first, 4 for my last), so I have a real identity in my NAME, even though it's not tied to familial reasons (my mother has passed, and I don't speak to my father).

I like the idea of your name changing to signify a change in your life; it's hard to stop saying ""My name is Jennifer Dorn"" and start saying ""My name is Jennifer Slate.""  Who is Jennifer Slate?  Is she a different person?  Well, she's certainly a MARRIED person.  

Getting married is a big change in your life, and if you want that reflected in your name, which you use all day erryday, you should consider changing or hyphenating your name.  If you have strong feelings about your name, but also want to take your fiances, hyphenating is a great option (but I feel bad for people with super long names marrying other people with super long names - it's not your fault, but you'll feel bad when people have to write the hyphenation out).  If you take identity from your last name, of course you should keep it.


You're in a tough spot, OP!  A frenemy of mine just got married and with her last name changed will have the same name as one of my best friends, and I'm already dreading facebook saying ""which one did you mean!?""  My selfish problems aside, I hope you find a solution you love!"

Um. Excuse me. I think you are very clearly confused about a lot of things.

1. [The original 1981 Evil Dead] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083907/) was pretty decent, especially for the time. It is not a movie that is supposed to be taken 100% seriously. Just knowing that Bruce Campbell was cast should tell you as much as that. If you watched it as a straight horror movie, I do not doubt that you had a bad time. Also, Sam Raimi directed it. This is important information because...

2. [The Cabin in the Woods](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/) is basically a giant love letter to Sam Raimi. And also not to be taken as a straight horror movie."

Get rid of Colback, not really a great 5th choice and then with Rooney out for longer than expected, I'd maybe look at Adebayor? Thus giving you more funds to play around with your 5th midfielder who is 'punt' worthy. (I brought in Ki last week and it was a lovely payoff)

Exis007,relationships,1389896374.0,"Well, you already know the options with your current job. You can stay, you can leave. You can ask to have your duties reduced so that you can possibly go to school and work there are the same time. Are there other options?

The realistic issue here is that you ARE going to leave someday. If Ansley is indeed your friend, she is going to have to understand that your dream is not to work at her office forever and ever. And it really isn't anyone's dream. Every employer wants employees that want to work at that company till the end of time but that just isn't going to happen, especially in a low-level career like yours. If you're not going to pay a wage that would allow a person to build a life, raise children, and buy a house then you can't expect your employees to sell their soul to you. People will HAVE to move on to bigger and brighter things. She wants you to stay and that's great, but she can't hold her affection for you over your head such that you can never move on and live your own life. 

So, you know your options. Really, the only option if you're going to be a full-time student is to leave that job. The question is WHEN to leave that job. After the baby? Before? To know when to make that move means having a concrete plan about where you're going next. The only way to do that is to have an idea about another job, financial aid for school, or another source of income. Until you can line up another situation that is going to pay the rent and let you make the next step, you're probably going to have to stay. So work on constructing the next step and, until then, you're going to keep the job you have in order to live. 

If their bottom line is that you either commit to being there for the next five years or they are going to find someone who wants that, then the answer is pretty simple. Then you're going to have to find another job, period. You know you don't want that. And since you hate the job, that's not the end of the world. It'll take awhile but your expenses aren't crazy. You're just going to have to put a job in front of school right now. You have to obey the hierarchy of needs like the rest of us (food and shelter coming first). 

If they want you to stay but ALSO want a promise that you'll stay forever....then that's on them. I assume your friend knows you want to be a social worker so she's fooling herself to think you'll be content in this position forever. 

It all comes down to one thing: **What do you want to do?**. 

* Do you want to leave as soon as another job can be found? Then that's priority number one. Start job-hunting. You don't, however, want to tell them that until you have something lined up. That's not being an asshole to your friend; that's protecting your ability to pay your rent. Business and friendship don't mix well and if she cares about you, she'll work through it. 
* If you're willing to stay on, then tell them that. You can tell them you intend to eventually go back to school, but you are willing to commit to being there until [x]. Then start looking at maybe taking a night class in the mean time. 
* If you're unsure of what you're doing just go along with the program for now and keep working on the next step of the plan. If you honestly don't know what you are doing next, just assume you'll keep doing as you have been. 

Maybe I'm missing a part of this picture, but I don't understand what the problem is. "

namer98,Christianity,1389896498.0,"&gt;I know there are many layers with deeper spiritual meanings

So I challenge you. Give me a second (and third even!) layer of something in Genesis. The thing is, I don't expect you will. Every YEC I have given this exact same challenge has failed to give me another layer of meaning. Maybe you will be the first.

&gt;Lets not bypass the earthly meaning. 

I didn't. I am saying that your Earthly meaning is not well defined. To me, the Earthly meaning is about God's relationship to the world and to man, Gen 1 and 2 respectively. The non-plain meanings go much much deeper.

&gt; The definition for a morning is a morning. Do we really have to go through a spiel over that?

Yes, God's word is *that* important to me. When is morning? Is it 12am? First light? Sun starting to go over the horizon? Sun fully over the horizon? When does it end? Does it even have to do with the sun?

&gt;A day is a morning and an evening. 

Is that 12 hours? 18? 24? In the winter, morning to evening is like 13 hours. Is the Central American definition different than the Alaskan definition? Without a sun, how does this make sense the first three days?

maowsers93,atheism,1389896539.0,"If you want specific answers it is that the Texas GOP has been pretty steadily marching to the right for some time now. To give you some perspective, Lt. Gov. Bill Ratliff is a former Republican member of the legislature from a few decades ago is horrified at what the current GOP leadership has done to education. Since his time in office the stance has gone further and further to the right and the funding for schools has gone down. [In this article Ratliff specifically says](http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/wise-men-pete-laney-and-bill-ratliff) that in the past 10 years the Texas education system has been cut by 30%, which is unconstitutional by the way per our state constitution. 

Since then a lot of things have happened including gross gerrymandering which has increased the conservative strong hold on the legislature. Between the years of [2009 and 2011](http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legeleaders/members/memberstatistics.cfm) for example the balance of representation went from 74 Democrats and 76 republicans to 49 Democrats and 101 republicans. Add to this the understanding that Texans have one of the lowest voter turn out rates in the nation and you get the picture. Rick Perry has also served 3 terms (yes three consecutive terms) which means he has appointed ever single chairman for every single agency in the state of Texas for the past 12 years. Now the significance of this isn't just political in terms of Dems vs Reps. The stacking of the deck and leadership has resulted in the GOP being able to pass what ever they want with little to no resistance. 

When this one party system got created in order for the leadership to hang on to what they had they got more and more extreme in their views. In doing so they were able to rev up their base and get them to the polls. Everyone else fell asleep at the wheel so the elections have been widely in their favor. 

One of the major things the Texas GOP has used to influence their base is fear, fear of them, those, the others. They knew that religion played a major factor in their base and they began to pander to it. Rick Perry started implementing new heads to all the Universities trying to get them to change their curriculum to a more conservative teaching method. Because they couldn't do that directly to the public schools they were able to circumvent it through the Charter schools. 

For years bills have been popping up designed to divert funding from public schools to charter schools in the form of vouchers. Even last session there was a pet project that would have given any ""unused"" property from public schools directly to charter schools. By property I mean buildings, class rooms, sports equipment, fields, etc. Unused was worded as basically anything not currently occupied. So as an example if it wasn't football season the field could be considered ""unused"" and taken by the charter school. The issue of course is that once the public schools need them can they get them back? That wasn't addressed in the bill and most people think it was a failed attempt at confiscating property over time. 

One of the biggest proponents of this type of theological and charter creep is Sen. Dan Patrick ........ he is also head of the Senate Education Committee. You see, the leadership which is the Speaker of the house (Rep. Joe Straus) and the Lt. Gov (David Dewhurst) are the ones that choose the committee members and the committee chairs. They knew Patrick would push the charter bills and appointed him. I've sat in on the committees when public testimony comes up for these bills and people line up by the dozens to testify against them. When they do Patrick eviscerates and humiliates them. There are other smaller players that help write the bills but Dan Patrick and the people who appointed him are the real brains behind the operation. 

Now, it is also important to realize that Patrick and Dewhurst are now running against each other for the Lt. Gov spot and in their fight they're traveling even farther to the right saying that they want to repeal the 17th amendment. The 17th amendment give citizens the direct right to vote for their own Senators. Repealing it would mean that the House votes for who becomes a Senator from now on. This is how absurd it has become. They aren't really as theologically driven as they make themselves out to be though. They're just playing a game because doing so will retain power for them and in doing that they have no problem throwing things under the bus like education, health care, transportation, etc. 

Texans aren't in favor of these bills which is why most of them haven't passed. But at the same time Texans also refuse to vote. So, when people say we caused this directly they're right but not because we voted for it, but because we are apathetic to the process. That is currently changing however. "

I didn't assign anything, there is no way to interpret any of the above characteristics, taken directly from the article, as positive.  If I was going to describe feminine characteristics myself, I would use adjectives similar to those you described.  I was just commenting on their absence from the article that was posted.  

The other problem I have is with the marketplace analogy, because like capitalism it relies on a bottom-line determinant of value, only for people instead of commodities.  I don't know why, but this just seems spiritually wrong to me.  People are complex, it seems narrow-minded to stick them on a single scale of value.  I could play the game and try to find my highest point on that scale, but I feel like I would be selling my soul to the system if I did so.  I know I won't find your definition of ""success"" by not playing the game, but maybe there's a different kind of success that's right for me out there.  Maybe there's a girl out there that also feels like entering the ""sexual marketplace"" is selling out.  Maybe it's naive to think someone else like that is out there, but I'll take my chances."

Any additional money he might spend on an i5 over an i3 would be better spent first on upgrading the GPU to a 770, and even after that, I'd go with more storage, maybe a mechanical keyboard, before bothering with the i5. If he isn't overclocking, the i3 has such close performance in gaming to the non-overclocking i5s, he will never see a difference.

All else being equal, the actual gender pay gap is about five to seven percent.

Don't forget that a significant portion of the remaining five to seven percent can be accounted for by the loss of advancement due to downtime in child rearing and the perceived risk of hiring young women to fill positions when they could drain company resources through having a kid and taking maternity leave prior to quitting.

To be honest, although I don't think they should be worse than actual rape, I do think that they should be worse than what they are now. Provided you can prove that the story is entirely fabricated just to screw you over.

Like, a rape case where the rapist can't be convicted because it can't be proven beyond reasonable doubt, there shouldn't be punishment for fabrication, but if you can actually prove the story is made up in order to ruin you, you should be able to either sue them to hell and back, or get them locked up, because that's no laughing matter.

This would happen on a regular basis, as one will inevitably be orbiting much further out than the other as they'd eventually collide/be thrown off into space if they were too close together due to affecting each other's orbits.  Since they'd be in completely different orbits, they'd have completely different orbital periods.  Say one of them made a single revolution in 20 days, and the other took 10 - the closer moon would go through its wax/wane cycle twice in the time the further moon took to do it once, and would therefore would be both waxing/waning at the same time and waxing while the other was waning/vice versa twice every twenty days."

verbalizing one's discontent is not a plea for advice.  offering advice that is not requested implies the following: your discontent is your own fault, if you altered your behavior in x way you would not have these problems.  i know your best course of action better than you do (despite my wild ignorance of what it actually feels like to be you).  your problems are not worthwhile.  improve yourself.

i'm sure you don't feel that this is the message you are sending, i'm sure your intent is to be helpful.  but immediately running through the gambit of solutions to another's problems marginalizes the fact that the problem is valid, and that the other person is justified and has every right to feel the way they do (which, in my experience, is the message people are usually looking to hear when they share their discontent with others)."

almostsebastian,AskReddit,1389897174.0,"I was six and my grandfather was dying of cancer. Everyone went to go visit him close to the end. My parents, my aunts and uncles. Everybody, basically. My cousins had school but I didn't that day, for some reason, and since all of the adults were at the hospital I went, too.

I still hate that hospital smell. Antiseptic and sadness and endless corridors of linoleum. I knew he was sick, I knew that everyone was feeling pretty down. I could feel the end hanging in the air even though nobody said anything. Then there was this little voice in my head, just a thought. This was the guy who taught me to play chess, basic math, drew funny sketches of my grandmother with donkey's ears and there I was standing outside his hospital door. My legs became cement, I couldn't move them. I just didn't want to believe it. He wouldn't just leave without saying goodbye to me first, right? So if I just waited a bit... I could get myself ready, say something, anything to let him know how important he is to me.  

But I couldn't do it. Just couldn't. Frozen to the spot until it was time to walk back out, telling myself we'd see him again tomorrow. 

He died that night. 

I know that it's not *really* my fault. I've gone over this with my folks and a couple therapists over the two decades(ish) since it's happened. I was six, after all. But I don't think it's ever going to feel like that to me.  I'm still deeply ashamed of my behavior that day, even if nobody else will be. I just can't shake the feeling that he deserved better than that from me.

One of the main exemptions is on page 27, but this Q&amp;A has a lot of info on the EU securities issuing regime if you're curious. A good securities lawyer will be able to structure most issuances so are exempt though.

A big exemption is the 10% exemption. If a company issues less than 10% of its shares outstanding they essentially dont have to disclose anything. Granted, you will probably be able to find some financial information, but in a typical prospectus there is so much more information than simple financial statements. 

We will have to see how strict they are in enforcing securities regulations. They are brand new, so I am not sure if they are allowed to write their own binding rules like the SEC. I *highly* doubt they are. I cant imagine the UK agreeing to that in a million years.

elkab0ng,askscience,1389897264.0,"""it depends"".

LED's (and many, many other components) for high-risk uses are tested VERY extensively. An example might be the venerable NE555 timer that every hobbyist has worked with at one time or another. You can pick them up for pocket change at your local parts store, or you can go to one of the big chipmakers, and buy the same part, but certified for installation in satellite applications (tested for 1000+ extreme heat/cold cycles, tested for ESD tolerance, tested for pressure integrity, and radiation, and resilience to inconsistent power). It's been a few years since I checked, but I think it was about $80 USD for the same part Fry's has for $1.99.

LED's are tested for avionics installation in the same way - tolerance to vibration, heat, impact, power fluctuations, repeated handling, min/max temp cycles...

So, just like the CFL that can perform for 20k hours in a lab, you might get that if you install it in a part of your house where the temperature is always the same and the power is stable, but I can always count on the CFL's on my outdoor fixtures to fail more often than the ones on my indoor settings. And the cheaper ones will *usually* fail before the more expensive ones. "

This is a typical reaction from the partner with a higher sex drive. (Trust me, I've been there.) What you have to realize is that it has nothing to do with *you*, it's your partner. I'm not saying that anything is ""wrong"" with him, but I am saying that his sex drive is lower than yours and he would have the same sex drive issues with a super model. 

My suggestion (I can't believe that I'm saying this) is to ease up on the BJs. (That was hard to say.) If his sex drive really is that much higher than yours (2-3/week vs 1/mo) then he really isn't going to get much from it, plus you might be satisfying him with them, possibly decreasing the amount of PIV sex that you two have. Right now, just try to ease off, spend time with him for the sake of spending time with him, talk, do things together, go out, whatever, but make sure that he feels loved in ways that don't include the bedroom and let him come to you. It might be difficult, but if he feels loved outside the bedroom, then he might want to make you feel loved inside the bedroom."

This. I need to find out what their ""bottom line"" is, and I'm pretty sure Ansley is planning on telling me what that is at dinner tonight. I am very willing to stay on until I get my GPA back up and transfer to a university, which will be in about 2 years. I need to know if that is even an option, and that requires going to dinner with Ansley tonight to discuss it, which most people who have responded in this thread have been against.

Sorry about the confusion... I can't keep my thoughts straight with this. I've never had to deal with anything like this before, and it is scary because I finally got a sense of ""security"" and made ""home"" for myself.

I'm really sorry you feel that way, if you really do, but this has to be one of the most disturbing things I've ever read on reddit.  I could understand having some of these feelings as maybe a teen, when everything is unsure and you are still forming the thoughts and opinions that would shape your life.  

But as an adult?  Certainly you should have realized by now that the decisions your mother made, *AS AN ADULT*, were her decisions and her decisions alone.  Blaming yourself for your mother's plight is a copout in order to avoid facing the reality, which is that your mum is a flawed person.  Newsflash - we're all flawed and have shit we deal with.

I'm not really sure why you feel the need to shield your mom like that, but I implore you seek some therapy to help you with your feelings of guilt.  No person should have to live their existence in shame just for being born - that is absurd.

If a tank or healer goes down, it is usually a wipe, whereas a DPS death is usually recoverable. Additionally, DPS responsibility tends to be thrown out the window as soon as damage meters are discussed.

I know that many players feel compelled to ignore mechanics that aid their party members in efforts to inflate their DPS scores. (Putting more strain on healers to put out extra DPS, ignoring/breaking crowd control/interrupts, bard songs, etc)"

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389897604.0,"&gt; They only mandate your schedule if you work for them, or interact with them. And you have many choices with respect to the organizations with which you do so. This is the essence of the free market.

All are equally bad though. If they weren't, then there would be competition to join one rather than another. Businesses, despite what so called free market models suggest, dont actuallt like competition all that much since it will ultimately hurt everyone's bottom line. It's a lot like the prisoner's dilemma.

&gt;That spending is not for us; it is to maintain order. It is related only insofar as, to maintain order, it is beneficial to provide for security and other items in Maslow's baselines.

This is a very drab way of looking at the world. I tend to believe that people in government at times actually do have good intentions and actually do want to help people.

&gt;But, remember: I'm actually advocating for a UBI. So, I cannot be said to be pushing an extreme. Hell, many would say that I'm extreme on the side of socialism! I simply differ from you when it comes to how much.

A UBI under $10k simply isnt worth it. People would lose rather than gain, taxes would go up for many people without decent benefits, etc.

&gt;Greater immediate gain for people living in 2013. Greater loss for those living in 2043.

Not really, especially of the people in 2043 cant afford healthcare because they're too busy looking at how great things will be in 2073. That's the thing about capitalism. It doesn't matter how much we gain, many people are still stuck in this system of artificial scarcity when there needs to be none, and it's often defended in the name of ""progress."" 

 &gt;It's on me to make sure that, if this technology comes about, I can afford it. I'm pretty confident that I'll put myself in a position to be able to afford the technology in 30-40 years--very confident. I certainly can't develop it all on my own, though. This is why I want others who are developing such technology not to be disincentivized.

And that's a luxury you can afford. Not so for the millions of americans living paycheck to paycheck.

&gt;The long haul, that's what matters.

Won't help me if I die waiting for something that might not even happen. Can't you see this is a scam? 

&gt;In fact, all of its most advanced equipment is ultimately built by private organizations.

Not really, it's repurposed. It was NASA that launched satellites but the private sector that utilized them to give of a communications network. It was the government who made the internet, AOL and the like just repurposed it.

&gt;Great. I'm advocating that everyone should have a million dollars.

Strawman.

melonzipper,AdviceAnimals,1389897683.0,"I think you're still giving those who even RTFM a little bit too much credit. Even in a work environment which works with the web, IT is still needed for when shit goes south:

* you need to make sure that the code you wrote works in Opera as well for this specific client, but alas you don't have that installed on your computer! If you're in a large company with an IT dept. that controls your environment so they make sure no crazy viruses get downloaded and bog down their network, then you probably have to file a ticket to IT to install Opera.

* Photoshop keeps crashing. You notice that you only have 4gb of RAM, but you're constantly running Outlook, IE, Firefox, Chrome, Dreamweaver, PowerPoint, and Flash - it's required for your work. Being an educated user, who does indeed RTFM, you make the educated deduction that it's something to do with needing more RAM, and something other to do with a possible update for your video card driver. Let's say you work in a small company so you're allowed to look for updates for your drivers yourself, but you still don't have random bits of RAM laying around the office, do you? Probably no little screws either to open your laptop. And how many users that RTFM know how to install RAM in their laptop? Not the majority.

* you start off your day with a wonderful notice that your Product Activation Key failed, and you need to prove you own this software. Guess who gave you this computer? IT. Guess who you need to take it back to so they can find the correct key and reactivate it? IT.

The IT industry wouldn't collapse, there wouldn't be an end of the world for IT. The knowledge and know-how is still needed, even if everyone did in fact RTFM, you'd still have the lazy ones who file a ticket anyway because they ""have better shit to do than fix this"" - just as in your scenario, even if everyone knew how to switch out their oil in their car, they'd still pay someone else to do it because they don't want to take the time to dispose of the oil properly, and they don't want to get all messy, and they don't have time to do it themselves.

The whole point of the meme was the benefit of power users and nice people who follow rules. IT gets a lot of emails with ""**subject:** Printer. **text:** it's broken."" AND NOTHING ELSE. By reading the manual, the user would at least read the screen of the printer and notice it's out of toner or the fact that it's not even plugged in.

Here's my last point: you think you barely have enough time to finish your work now? Try doing your own IT work on top of that and not being a power-user. You've only read the manual, but every time something is going weird, you have to google the shit out of it, and waste 20-30 minutes trying to fix it to no avail. What's that? You just worked through your lunch trying to fix your computer so you could get your work done by EOD? Good luck with that. There's no way that IT jobs will just cease to exist in the foreseeable future.

If we taxed INCOME at 25%, we would get $14,500, and it would actually be worth $14,500. To get the same nominal number with VAT, you'd need 32%...and this would be worth only $10k.  Heck, looking at the trends, you literally CANT get $15k real value from UBI with a VAT because the more you tax, the more you devalue the money you give.

DERangEdKiller,AskReddit,1389897838.0,"I might not have been clear due to only telling the information relevant to the question above, but the situation wasn't as bad as this kind of seems.

Her boyfriend who was the father of her daughter got locked up for vehicular manslaughter so she prioritized her daughter over her relationship.  

After that, because she got pregnant, she had two part time jobs and was taking care of her kid.  Her friends would take turns watching her daughter who was 2 at the time.

She came to me because she didn't log enough hours to earn company insurance, and not being able to afford the expenses, but needing to keep her meds she reached out to friends.  2-3 of them did little deals on the side, and they knew us to be decent enough people, so they sent her our way.  

She hung out when we threw any parties, and we'd see her every couple of weeks when she'd buy the medication.  We got it because my friend had tourettes, and his doctor would prescribe him Xanax.  We obtained it legally, and seeing a way to turn a quick profit, we sold them, and I just dealt with my friends little  ""bouts"" as he called them.

After the first time she fucked me, I felt uncomfortable about sex as payment.  I know I'm not a great looking guy, and I knew she was in a bind, but when she started, the only thing that was going through my mind was ""What the fuck?  Don't say anything it's been awhile, she's beautiful, and she seems conscious of her decisions, let's see how far this goes!""

It was afterwards that I talked with my roommate about her situations, and he gave me the pills for the cost of the co-pay.  I just gave her the pills (which I counted before giving to her) and basically told myself, ""If she comes back needing more before this runs out more than once, I'm cutting her off.  Normally it's out of sight out of mind, but we shared friends, and I couldn't be responsible for her losing her daughter or worse.  When you've never seen the kids, it's easy to just pretend ""out of sight, out of mind"", and I'd met her daughter a few times.  They say you can't have a conscience in the pimp game, but it's harder to have a heart in drug game, and that little girl Cindy Lou Whoo'd me.

The girl's mother got my message after I gave her the pills the first time that I wouldn't have sex with her for pills, and she showed up with cash.  I refused the money, gave her the meds, and waited.  I was cordial with most of the people she'd know who could get Xanax, so I waited, until I either heard news, or she came back.  I knew she was aware how dangerous the game she was playing was, and I also knew that the version of her she made me believe she was, and wanted to be was better than what we did, and I knew who she was would have wanted me to be on guard. 

 She was a big girl. She could take care of herself, but life is hard enough without having someone to watch your back, and although we were nothing more than decent friends born from illegal transactions I knew the version of her that I knew would not want her daughter to have to suffer if it went bad.

Like clock work she was back about 2 weeks later for more. (my buddy was a known abuser, and I've never needed stabilizers, so I assumed a 2 week supply was his doctor monitoring his usage. I applied that to her, and when she didn't seem to abuse the pills.

A month later, she was talking about going back to school and finishing her nursing degree.  She talked about how she wanted to help people, and my friend thought having someone on the inside of a hospital means he could improve his stock eventually.  I let him think that, and used some of our funds to help her tuition costs.  Then I helped her study, and I still can't unlearn some of the shit I learned about the vascular system.

My friend and I helped out for about 6 months. In that time she managed to reconcile with her parents, and moved her and her daughter in with them.  That's when she stopped coming to me for free Xanax.

About a month after that we got tired of the game, and I had a falling out with my friend over the money we lost over helping her.  I made it clear the debt was mine, we both moved back west, and he never contacted her for anything other than to ask about the neighborhood (it got real bad around the time we left, and 5 of our friends died within a couple of years, but I went legit and worked shit jobs, my roommate went into a downward spiral until I refused to use the money I owed him to help pay his bail for larceny, and he got locked up for a few years.

I got a solid job, and when he got out, I gave him the money to start a clothing business (which is doing well), she's working as a certified nurse, and still clean, and I'm going to a UC.  

I don't deal anymore even though there is a pretty nice market here, and I have the connections to clean up.  It doesn't appeal to me anymore, and I'd probably be dead or in jail if I didn't meet her and her daughter."

Glacier Point also has great views but it's closed until May (usually) because of snow. AVOID HALF DOME!!!! It's not worth all the freaking tourists and wannabe ""mountain climbers"". If you're into backpacking I know a decent but difficult trail that if you push yourself will put you on top of El Capitan by dinner time. I did it and had my best experience in Yosemite. There were 3 other groups and they were chill. It was me and two buddies. The top of the mountain was free of all humans. Deer and other wildlife would frequently stop by to see what/who we were. That night the moon was so bright it was like daytime and seeing every granite monolith in the Valley illuminate like that...it changes who you are as a person and how you see the world."

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389897897.0,"Very solid rebuttal. 

&gt; What I will say though is that Bitcoin is closer to a commodity like gold than it is to a currency

I agree with you, which is why I don't like it as a currency.  There are lot of potential stores of wealth, but at least with gold you theoretically have a tangible good with real world functionality if the price tanks.  If I were to buy BTC it would be as a commodity, but I think there are other, more reliable commodities available.  

&gt; People don't want to spend BTC?

While bitcoin is being used in headline grabbing ways, I'm still troubled by looking at Bitcoin Days Destroyed charts and seeing huge fluctuations of transaction volume on days when markets rally or crash.  When I see that, it reminds me that most of BTC wealth is held by ""whales"" and a small number of people could dramatically move the market.  

&gt; There isn't really a point for a normal person to go out of there way to buy bitcoin just to use them to buy things. But I think there will be soon.

What makes you say that?  You cite the target thing, but you also agree that it's tough for the average person to protect their BTC.

&gt; What coinbase does is it takes every single Bitcoin that is spent at Overstock, and immediately flips it for cash. 

Doesn't that make it seem like BTC is just serving as an awkward middle man for normal USD exchanges?  BTC is only being used for p2p and person-to-business exchanges.  I can't imagine widespread adoption for a currency unless businesses use it for b2b exchanges. 

&gt; Difficult to exchange USD for BTC? Only difficult to learn how. I just bought BTC while making this post on coinbase.com. it was one button click, and typing to tell them how much i wanted. Or you can buy locally.

As much as I distrust BTC, I like discussing it from a theoretical standpoint.  A month or so ago I tried to buy $100 worth of bitcoin just to have some skin in the game.  I had two transactions reversed by coinbase for unknown security reasons.  If I want to get coin from them, I have to submit a lot of personal information (to an unregulated company) and wait for nearly a week for my transfer to clear.  Even the time-based barrier to entry is discouraging enough to avoid BTC.  

If I want to buy locally, I have to meet up with a stranger and exchange a large amount of cash.  It's very unnerving as a new person to develop trust with a stranger on such an unknown type of exchange.

Dre-Never_Forget,Android,1389897995.0,"&gt;You can't arrest or ticket someone because they could have done something. That's the scariest precedent.

True, but that wasn't the case here. She got pulled over for speeding, and then when the cop saw that she was wearing Google Glass, she got another ticket. Since she could've had it on two minutes before she got pulled over (as you've mentioned) the cop erred on the side of caution and gave her a ticket. If she can prove it was off, then the ticket will more than likely be dropped. 

I don't see anything wrong with that progression of events. If she had been ticketed for the Glass because it was sitting on the front seat that's one thing, but she didn't. She had it on her head, in her vision, and if it was on (it might have been), it would've been breaking the law.

Because the names are so similar, they do confuse people when we travel together (they often assume that they are the same name with a typo).  So I don't really want to both keep our current names.

In an ideal world where this sort of thing was common, I would really like to choose a new last name together.  Specifically, I think his father's first name would make a lovely last name (it's the only first name that would make a culturally neutral last name of our four parents).  It would also allow me to do First Middle Oldlast Newlast, instead of completely ditching my current last name.  He doesn't love his middle name and would do First Oldlast Newlast.

Which is rude, and I only did because I so deeply disagree with where you are coming from and, further, don't see the merit of your argument. I might take one side more often in say, pro-life and pro-choice, but I see where both sides are coming from and I can see how both sides have a rightness and a wrongness to them.

Your entire argument seems to be that ""some people are over sensitive, how dare they have feelings and fight to be treated with respect, they should just deal with it, and America is protecting these little wussies. Also this doesn't affect me at all save to annoy me, but I'm ignorantly standing in the way of progress because it's too pansy and feely and ew"". Now, yeah, I'm being disrespectful, but that's how I'm basically translating your argument and it doesn't move me.

You know, it's *fine* if some people you know aren't offended by some words that other people find offensive. That doesn't make them across the board not offensive anywhere and anytime. What I tend to tell people when I'm arguing against the homophobic f-word is ""know your audience"". Are you a gay guy talking with a bunch of gay friends in a safe environment where you all know each other and use the word jokingly? Cool. Power to you. Are you playing a video game and calling a stranger on the enemy team a slur, and you don't know that person, and you don't know that they could actually be closeted gay and had people beat them up using that word and so the word wounds them still? Not cool. Know your audience, be respectful, don't use words that are considered slurs unless you know it's okay in the company you're in. Just try to be considerate and respectful. I don't think that's a lot to ask of people *in general*, let alone with words that maybe don't need to be defended. Maybe I might be over sensitive if I think it'd be neat if ""lame"" fell out of common use for indicating ""uncool"" and was just replaced with something else--if that happened naturally. Language evolves. Would it really be skin off your back if the word ""oriental"" or ""redskin"" fell out of use?"

gantt5,Physics,1389898086.0,"Know how to program. Whether it's C++, MATLAB, or whatever, know how to program and be comfortable enough with it to be able to change languages if necessary.

If you're going into experimental, make sure you know how to assemble and test equipment and circuits as well as how to keep a lab notebook correctly. If you're going into theoretical, fill all your empty slots with abstract, high level math.

Take as many of the highest level physics classes as you can. For example, if you are only required to take one of three senior level physics electives, try to take at least two of them. If nothing else, it will make you a more well rounded physicist. Take a class on complex analysis if it's not required.

You should score very highly on the general GRE. It's about the same difficulty as the SAT so taking at the end of college should mean you do very well, especially in the math section.

The physics GRE is important, but how important depends on where you want to go. If you want to go to a top-tier research university, you need to score in the top 10% or so. Otherwise, 50% or above is probably good.

Undergraduate research and/or teaching opportunities. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM! It's not a bad thing to work in a few different labs as an undergrad to figure out what you're really interested in, but try to work in one for at least a year so you can get enough done to present a poster at APS, AAS, etc. Ideally, you would want to publish a paper, but that's not a necessity. Also, piggybacking on a grad student's project isn't a bad thing. Their projects tend to be shorter, and you may be able to help them get their work done faster so some of them will be happy to have you as long as you get work done.

Recommendations make or break your application. Make sure you ask well ahead of the due date or you'll be lucky to get a form letter. More likely, they'll tell you no. When you ask, ask them if they are able to write you a *strong* letter. Be sure to include your research, the professor you TAed for, or both. Avoid asking professors who you've only had as a teacher and don't know well. They won't be able to say much beyond your classroom performance.

If you are applying for a master's program, this may not apply as much as with a PhD, but you should have a good idea of what you want to work on and who with before you apply. Ideally, you would have met your potential adviser at one of the meetings where you presented your poster or a talk they gave, but that's not absolutely necessary. Most program websites have a faculty page that lists interests and recent publications. Spend a couple hours a day browsing and when you find something, read a recent publication. Send them an email and tell them you're interested in what they're working on that you've read their paper. Hopefully, you can work in a well thought out question pertaining to the paper.

Be wary of LinkedIn. Don't apply for connections with faculty you haven't worked with. Your account should be thorough and up-to-date, though."

jimmy982,AskMen,1389898090.0,"My guess is because being funny is an attractive quality, and one that men, especially men who are not physically attractive can learn and improve upon which increases their chances of finding a mate.
It is a trait that has been evolutionarily sought out in some men, therefore it has become expected of them in our society.  

The other point that ""man humour"" is funny to everyone is simply the different roles we each have in life.  Women tend to be able to relate to other people and other stories through empathy more easy than men.  So, that would seem to indicate that while they can generally more easily relate to situations that men find themselves in, men are not always able to make the empathetic leap the other way.  Plus, many stories that female comics discuss revolve around specific female problems like their periods, their views on sex, etc.

animuseternal,AskWomen,1389898140.0,"I'm an Asian male, too, so don't take this the wrong way...

Are white women really *more* attractive than women of other races, or are we culturally indoctrinated to view certain characteristics as attractive which typically coincide with whiteness?

Racial *preference* is typically a result of racial *bias*. I spent a long time only noticing attractive white women; I spent a long time being overly self-conscious about being Asian. There's a quiet shame that develops when you grow up as a minority because you must necessarily always compare yourself to white culture, white conceptions of beauty, etc. So when you see an attractive person who isn't white, you think of her as the exception. And that's a biased way of thinking.

We've all been indoctrinated (in America) to view certain things as more attractive and other things as less attractive. This applies to men as well. So you might run into a few (or perhaps many, depending on where you live) people who have biases against you. And you gotta roll with that, sure. But if you're having a problem with feeling attractive and confident, then at least own it. Don't blame it on our race being ""naturally less attractive,"" because that's not true in the slightest. And there are a lot fewer bigots in the world than you might imagine. Own up to the insecurity without the racial baggage. And you'll at least have control over it and can work on it. But if you use your race as a scapegoat, then you'll always come at it from a defeatist position.

I understand wishing you weren't Asian. Every single minority understands this feeling, has experienced it in some form at some point in their lives. *Nobody* wants to be the ""other."" Everyone wants to be taken at face-value for who they are as persons and not for a few arbitrary physical traits. You don't feel ""normal."" But you have to realize that what you're feeling is this association of normalcy = whiteness, and that's cultural brainwashing.

You first need to treat and see yourself as a person--and not a race--before others will too. And don't get me wrong. Racism is a huge thing that doesn't look like it's ending any time soon. But first, realize that you're biased against yourself. Realize where that comes from. And exert control over it."

BrandNewSidewalk,SkincareAddiction,1389898154.0,"Happy to share!  An aloe allergy is really really annoying because, like you said, it's in almost everything and everyone assumes it's good for you.  You will learn to be a label-reader!  Even if you've bought a product 3 times before, sometimes companies decide to ""upgrade"" their products by adding aloe in and you might not notice it if you don't pay attention.  Be especially careful with any products labelled ""Natural"" or for ""Sensitive skin"", as these are more likely to contain aloe.

This label reading even includes, believe it or not, toothpaste, deoderant, hair products, hand sanitizers, soaps, and sometimes even cleaning products.  

Just two days ago I mentioned my allergy to the nurse who was checking me in at the doctor and she acted really confused and said she had never heard of aloe allergies before, and she questioned me heavily about what happens.  For me it varies depending on how much is in a product and what type.  Aloe vera gel makes my skin turn bright red and feel warm like a sunburn, and it is painful.  Aloe barbadensis leaf juice in shampoo or something makes my skin either sting or itch badly, depending on the amount in the product.  Either way, it's something I want to avoid!  My dad brought home an aloe vera plant one time and it was just sitting in front of me at the table, and that's how we discovered my allergy was definitely aloe, because my hands turned bright red.

Before I begin, let me describe my skin:  I am 28/f.  My skin is typically pretty dry.  I don't have all-over breakouts, but I tend to get one or two really painful big spots at a time.  I am also very sensitive to some dyes and perfumes, so that does affect the products I choose.

My skin routine, morning and night
-

-cleanse with **cerave foaming facial cleaner**
(some people prefer the cerave hydrating cleanser which is also aloe-free, but I have found it seems to make my breakouts worse.)

-if it's really dry out or we're running the heater a lot, I will sometimes add the step of removing my makeup at night with OCM mixture of **argan, EVOO, and jojoba oils**.  There's a lot more about OCM if you search this sub

-I use **Boots No 7 protect and perfect intense eye cream** to moisturize under my eyes and my eyelids.  This also serves as my prep for eye shadow.  I spent an hour or so one day in Target reading all of the labels and this was the only eye cream they had in stock that day with no aloe, but it just so happens that I love it!

-I use the **Cerave am/pm facial moisturizers** most days.  In the winter I sometimes substitute **Cerave in the tub**.  I don't use a separate sunscreen other than what's in my makeup and the cerave right now, which I know is heresy around these parts; however, I also don't spend a lot of time outside right now.

-I occasionally use **Neutrogena 2-1 rapid clear fight &amp; fade toner**, particularly when I have a breakout.  I've tried the stridex pads that the SCA beginner's guide recommends, but my skin actually gets worse when I use them.

-Most of my makeup is **Boots No 7** or **Physicians Formula**.  I am on the search for a better foundation.  I used clinique for years, but I'm not crazy about it.  I have good luck with **maybelline** eye shadow and the pink and green **greatlash** mascara.  Makeup can sometimes be the hardest to know for sure because the ingredients are either not listed in the store anywhere or they are very very tiny.  Search online if in doubt!

-I used **Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser** and the tub of moisturizer for awhile before switching to Cerave.  The Cerave seems to work better for my skin for some reason.

Body, etc Products
-
-I use **cerave in the tub** for hands, elbows, etc.

-I have really dry feet, and for that I alternate between using **A&amp;D ointment** (weird, I know, but it's effective!), **Heel Rescue Superior Moisturizing Foot Cream**, and **Palmer's Cocoa butter**

-**Aveeno colloidal oatmeal** bodywash and shaving gel are great products.  I actually mostly bathe and shave with the bodywash now.

-**Dove cleartone deoderant** and **dove sensitive skin moisturizing bar** 

-When I was a kid, before I knew I was allergic to aloe I just knew that the green sunburn gels made my occasional sunburns hurt worse, so my mom used to put **Noxema cold cream** on my burns to soothe them, and it really helped.  (Thankfully I haven't had a sunburn in a long, long time!)

Hair products
-
I have wavy/curly hair, and curly hair products are loaded with aloe.  I get my hair cut at an Aveda salon only because I really like a stylist there; my stylist has a list attached to my file with the products that I can tolerate (meaning I can get through the appointment without itching like crazy) but I haven't bought anything from Aveda.  These are the products that I use at home:

-**Yes to Carrots** Nourishing/pampering shampoo and conditioner. (Note that the hair stuff is fine, but I think almost all of the skin care from this brand has aloe.)

--**Generic Value Products Conditioning Balm** (from Sally's) for deep conditioning.  This is based off Matrix Biolage conditioning balm, but the Matrix stuff has aloe and the GVP does not!

-I alternate between the following styling products:  **AG Hair Recoil curl activator**, **Devacurl arc angel**, **Jon Frieda frizz-ease products**, and **Kinky Curly Knot Today** for leavein (note most of the other kinky curly products do contain aloe but this doesn't.)

I hope this helps.  If you have any other questions please feel free to message me!

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389898244.0,"Perfect, I've actually dealt with this before.  Except it wasn't just 15 hours, it was a few thousand miles, although relatively speaking, the situations might as well be identical.

We had this talk early on, and it wasn't really on purpose.  She voiced her concerns about being in a relationship that might have an end date due to her moving.  Most of the schools she was looking at were across the country - she'd ask me for advice as well, and of course I wanted her to look more locally, but even the far away schools would be beneficial to me.  I mean, they were all in or near major cities, they all had opportunities, they were located where I *actually* wanted to live in the US, and I had been trying to move out there anyway.

Because of this, I told her pretty early on that she didn't have to worry - if it got to the point where we were still together and she had to move, since I wanted to move anyway, it would make sense for me to move, and I would have no problem doing so.  I found out later that this freaked her out a bit, so I'm not sure I would necessarily do that, although something along those lines might not be bad.

My suggestion would be to wait until *she* brings it up.  Support her in her decisions and try your best not to sway her decisions in your favor instead of hers.  This is for *her*, so she needs to make the choice, and if you want to follow, that's the decision that's up to you.

If she asks you what will happen, my suggestion is to tell her that you'd be willing to consider the possibility of moving once you're at that point - you don't have to necessarily move in together, but it would be a good move for you anyway, so it's definitely a good possibility that you'd be up for making that move.  If you tell her you're moving entirely for her, it might put too much pressure on her and the relationship for that matter.  IMO, if she thinks that you're moving for her, she's going to feel incredibly guilty if you move there and then it doesn't work out between you, and it might freak her out, so I'd avoid that if possible.  If you can move there completely on your own but still see each other, that would probably be the perfect scenario.

Also, be ready for the worst.  I moved in with my girlfriend at the time while I looked for a job and a place to live.  About a month in, she broke up with me.  Luckily, I wanted to be there anyway, and I found a job and a place to live within a couple days.  I regret absolutely nothing from that, I fell in love with where I moved.

For now, just enjoy the ride and be happy that you have her.  No need to put additional pressure on the relationship with a decision that far in the future.  Also, if you have any other questions, I'd be glad to answer if I can.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389898341.0,"&gt;but by taxing wealth, or savings as another way to view it, you are intentionally disincentivizing saving, which should be a staple of almost every family. taxing wealth makes no sense.

I'm not talking wealth tax per se, I'm just saying if you're rich, it's common sense you should be taxed higher.

&gt;if you want to go technical, it is literally a massive tax hike for anyone earning above middle class, depending on how you define that. we already have progressive taxes. UBI further pushes that. i don't agree with it.

Middle class is third quintile. Say, $45-60k a year if we want to get at the middle of the middle.

Single (which btw puts you way higher than third quintile): $60,000 - $24,000 + $15,000 = $51,000. Or 15%. Between payroll and income you probably already pay that.

Married: $60,000 - $24,000 + $30,000 = $66,000 or -10%.....whoa...those taxes are so high, I actually benefit more than I pay in.

I already ran the numbers. I considered this. It was ESSENTIAL to my UBI plan to keep taxes low for the middle class. In order to sell it, you NEED the middle class on your side. But people have weird ways of defining the actual middle class. I'd say that by definition, if you're in the top quintile, you're not ""middle class"", you're ""upper class"". And that's why I don't have a lot of sympathy when you talk about such high taxes on people earning more than $100k. I mean, it's a first world problem. Seriously. At $100k, you're making double the median family income, and literally almost 7x as much as a minimum wage earner.

By posting here you are simply looking for people to tell you that your decision to abort is the right one, not give you unbiased advice.

Second, you could carry the pregnancy to term and give up the child for adoption.  This is a viable option that would a) address your guilt and b) address your SO's desire to preserve the life.

Everyone in this sub, including the top comment, seems to be addressing the guilt of the ""unwanted"" child; what about the guilt that you would harbor by having the abortion?  Are your feelings that strong?  Would you feel guilty for life?  These are the *other* things you have to think about.

Finally, there are a lot of people who have unplanned babies, raise them well, have fulfilling lives, and achieve their dreams.  Having a child is not a death sentence, despite what the redditors here would have you believe.  

If you go into this pregnancy resenting the baby before its even a fetus, than yes I would say that abortion is the right choice for you.  Otherwise, I would implore you to get advice from as many *trusted* (read: not the internet) sources that you can. 

Best wishes."

One cart grew to four, and in less than five years, they owned a restaurant with hamburgers on the menu in Anaheim, California called Carl's Drive-In Barbeque.[6] In 1956, Karcher opened the first two Carl's Jr. restaurants — so named because they were a smaller version of his drive-in restaurant — in Anaheim and Brea. The restaurant chain was characterized by its fast service, table service as a standard feature, and its logo, the bright yellow five-pointed Happy Star. "

I guess my initial reaction to that was caused by the realization that interviewing is a separate skill that usually (in my field anyway) has absolutely no bearing on a person's ability to do the job they were hired for. The people who are ""good"" at interviews get hired, but being ""good"" just means they know the secret knock - they just know which questions to ask and which ones _not_ to ask just to look like the right candidate for an hour or so.

And I suppose that whole paragraph is probably insulting to your ability to read between the lines of your interviewee's answers and see through the bullshit."

Sir_George,AskReddit,1389898553.0,"I've posted this before:

I was a 12 year old little boy. One summer I got really bored and how I possibly imagined this is beyond me. I basically was staring at some couple of huge fecal matter (turds) I had made and decided to put them in a ziploc bag, then another ziploc bag and into the freezer. When midnight comes along the turds are rock frozen. So I take my mini-catapult that I had made for science club at my school that can easily shoot a potato over 100 feet. I go to my backyard and aim the catapult to be shot over my house and probably to the houses that were behind the ones from across the street or beyond. Launching three turds in three different angles I hear loud thuds from far away. With the fourth and final turd I hear a loud shattering of glass to which I ran inside (mind you the shattering that a large window pane makes, not the splintering sound a car window makes when cracked).

Thinking back I am ashamed, but pondering the aftermath was always hilarious. Some person would wake up in the morning with a shattered window only to find a moist turd sitting in their house. Would they think some burglar broke in only to take a dump? What would they tell the police or the insurance company? That someone shat so hard against their window that it shattered it?"

It's difficult to create a setting where veterans and noobs alike can share and discuss challenges and victories. For the most part, I think this sub does well.

bored_criminologist,todayilearned,1389898650.0,"Well considering the individual white guy videotaped himself using racial slurs and stated on camera his intention to hit black guy it makes sense that he was charged with a hate crime. See how that works? He stated a racist intent and was charged accordingly. Black people perpetrating the crime didn't do that and thus have no basis for a hate crime. Edit: In short it's not as simple as black guy hits white guy or white guy hits black guy which makes a hate crime. 

Edit:  Perpetrating random violence against identifiable protected groups (race, religion, and gender) has historically had the express purpose of instilling fear and terror into those groups and not simply the individual. The goal is usually to make an example of that person.  In that case the offense goes beyond simple personal injury to inflicting injury in the form of fear to a specific identifiable subset of the population. Such offenses if left unrecognized can create a chilling effect on the targeted group making them feel as if they cannot inhabit certain areas, work certain jobs, or participate in certain institutions (such as voting or going to certain schools). In a case where the violence is completely random no one group will feel targeted and thus no chilling effect should be found."

We get it, you bet on the wrong horse. It's only human to feel pride in the occupation you've chosen. I studied as an electrician, and I'm proud of it, but god knows I don't want to do that anymore. But to take the step from ""my job can be done by robots"" to ""there will soon be no jobs left"" is illogical if not plain stubborn. I agree, your argument follows a nice path and stems in truth. But unfortunately once your comment finished stating the facts, it started to look a little more like unsubstantiated conjecture. Examples!

&gt;We're moving very quickly to becoming a post-scarcity society where automation and advances in information technology make just about everything so cheap to make and obtain it basically becomes free.

Now other than the redundancy of moving to becoming, the idea that adding steps between raw material and consumer costs jobs is (to quote Finn of Adventure Time) idiot talk. Let's do a counting game. How many steps were there between early humans and their clothes? One or two. More recently, in a town of a thousand people in early US history? There was probably a guy in your town who made these things for you. But at that point you knew the guy's name. How many steps are there now? I remember seeing the process for making a t shirt for one of the popular youtube channels. The material came from one country, it was shipped somewhere to be dyed, then to another country to be stitched, somewhere else to be printed... The process nowadays includes way more people. Are any of those people complaining that the sewing machine has ruined their occupation? I doubt it.

I'd like to end by making a little point along the lines of hope for the future. My parent comment already said nicely about adapt or die, support the Government that is making the right decisions regarding the future. But as wise as that is, it doesn't really fill me with hope for the future. But something does! And I want everyone to be as dreamy eyed as me.

The other day right here on reddit I read about a drone the size of a 757 being tested by the US Navy. Today I read about a 3D printer that can print a concrete house in 24 hours. I really expected flight and engineering to be automated before construction, but here we are. The thing is, I've worked in several fields. I'd never claim to be a pro in any of them, but my experience with them was more interesting to me than just the practicalities of how to execute manual labour. When I was working jobs that required manual labour, the people I worked with turned off the job as much as possible. When they went home, their job didn't exist to them. But in the times I've worked at places that are more about a social setting, jobs that thrive on and need humans to function, the people were more excited about letting their job be a part of their lives. This kind of job gave back to its employees much more than just a wage. In jobs that could be done by robots, I met musicians, thinkers, really interesting people- but none of that was expressed in what they did for eight hours a day five days a week. There's a market for these things out there- humans are social animals. Humans require humans. If people would stop becoming engineers because they balanced yearly earnings with what their IQ and social status could accomplish, we would get engineers who are in it because they are interested. Because they geek out over the work. Because they want their own idea of the future to be the real one.

And those engineers are going to be the ones that make engineers obsolete."

Both of my Nparents play the victim to varying degrees. My mom is worse and plays the ""woe is me"" victim all the time. She's 59 and still acts like a victim trying to get sympathy without making any effort to change her life. She currently lives with her mother, works 10 hours a week doing a desk job for a struggling company, gets an allowance from her mom to make up for the lack of pay, and claims there's nothing else that can be done to find a better job. She makes vague, but unsubstantiated references to how my father abused her. He is verbally and mentally abusive. He can be very intimidating, but he's only pushed me once and the rest of the time thrown shit on to the ground. I've never witnessed him get physical with my mom and there weren't any visible markings on her.

My mom will go on end about how terrible her life is trying to get sympathy from anyone willing to listen and enable her behavior. Her common responses to being called out are either ""what was I suppose to do"" or ""you don't know what it was like"". Any response to the former generally gets the latter in reply or some weak excuse. When my parents got a divorce, she got all of the savings as alimony up front. It was $100k in the early '90s and she blew it all in a year with absolutely nothing to show for it. She didn't work, rented a nice house, and flew back home to stay with her parents every other week when she didn't have me. In addition to playing up the victim, her manipulation knows no bounds and she'll play a person like a fiddle.

My dad on the other hand plays the victim when people get on his case about his behavior or not wanting to be around him. He wonders what he did or just wants people to forgive and forget. Sorry, getting figuratively punched in the face every day is hard to forget and progressively harder to forgive. He whines to family that I've forgiven my mother and will never forgive him. I've dispelled that by informing him that I have not forgiven her.

What's amazing to me is he started to recognize some of his poor behavior with me after I became an adult, but he made no effort to change it. He wouldn't apologize after realizing he was in the wrong and/or hurt me. He continues to do it and wonders why I don't want to speak with him."

A lot of watches are designed to be accurate at 28 degrees celsius which is the average body temperature when it's worn by a person. You're effectively acting as a crystal oven when you wear your watch which is also why some watches will lose time when you don't wear them."

For the eggs, I would drop them in a jar, and either seal it and throw it away, or do something, but I don't think you want to smoosh it, the eggs might stay on your shoe, and then hatch in the house like roach eggs.

Either way, check the house crawl spaces for more nests.  If it's an infestation, they either are, or soon will be everywhere.  If that's the case call an exterminator.  It's expensive, but they have sprays that drive spiders away for about 6 months, and although one bite won't kill you, the amount of bites you'll get if you or a loved one will get if you stumble into a nest could be fatal."

silverionmox,DarkFuturology,1389898967.0,"&gt; It is not so much vaccination per se that I have a problem with, but rather government-mandated medical procedures.

Why government-mandated? The Tuskegee case wasn't mandated, nor is there any reason to assume this kind of thing couldn't have happened with a private organisation. The problem was a sliding mental framework: they didn't consider it curative work anymore, but an experiment. 
Various other rationalizations like ""Based on the available health care resources, Nurse Rivers believed that the benefits of the study to the men outweighed the risks"" also played a role. Further illustration : """"The longer the study, the better the ultimate information we would derive.""[14] Author James Jones remarks about this attitude: ""The men's status did not warrant ethical debate. They were subjects, not patients; clinical material, not sick people.""[15]""

&gt;The potential for abuse is there, even if it is not actively happening at the moment.

If anything, I would distrust private institutes more, because they aren't impacted by a loss of productive people or potential contamination as a state is, and the private company can be disbanded to escape some of the consequences if word gets out.

&gt;The Tuskegee study demonstrates that there is historical precedent for medical procedures to be actively harmful to a certain vulnerable population yet sold to that population as beneficial.

There are many cases like that (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos#Discovery_of_toxicity, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco#Health). Most happen because caring about potential harm for others potentially harms the profit margin.

So you don't really look far to find examples. Politically, it's a typical concern of ecologists, advocating the precautionary principle."

sexualramen,manga,1389899282.0,"Akumetsu was NOT the masterpiece people claimed it was, IMO. 

The series started out pretty well, the fights were visceral, the protagonist's main origin story (which takes forever to actually see) was pretty damn interesting, and the ending was pretty much the best way it could have ended.

HOWEVER.

It could have been much better if it was shorter and less information-heavy. The series gets pretty damn repetitive towards the middle with Akumetsu just killing and killing everyone. It's also pretty damn dense on all the information (about how every victim of Akumetsu is an evil to society) but it really wasn't interesting to read through.

MFoy,gardening,1389899319.0,"Look at your local garden center for one of two products that can help, either [Moisture Mizer](http://moisturemizer.com) or Terra Sorb. Both of these use technology found in super absorbent diapers. They are essentially little crystals that absorb extra water and expand. They release the water back into the soil as the soil dries out. They are great for vegetables, annuals, perennials. They tend to not be as useful as we get into larger shrubs and trees. It won't be of any use for existing plants, since the crystals have to go into the ground as you are planting, but if you want to have annuals or a vegetable garden this summer, this will greatly reduce watering.

Don't use sprinkler systems for trees. Ever. Sprinkler systems are meant to be used for lawns. If you have an in-ground system that is specifically recalibrated, it might be of use for annuals/small perennials. Professionals water trees in a drought by using a [tree gator](http://www.treegator.com/). A cheaper way of doing this is to take some used plastic containers (like milk jugs) and fill them with water. Prick a tiny little hole so the water slowly trickles out, and set them next to the base of the trunk, NOT out in the drip line. The water will trickle out onto the roots slowly, like we want, so there will be less waste. Furthermore, you don't have to stand there, like you would with a hose, and you don't have to remember to turn anything off."

I went to private school, my elementary school is supposed to be one of the best in the area.  I still got tutoring from my parents and they made sure I had good grades.  When I went to high school, It was also a private school, also supposed to be the 'best school in the area'.  Same thing, had to get help from outward sources because that school did not provide anything other than basic education.  Had I gone to public school, I would have had access to the GT program(Gifted and Talented), Rotary club, and even JROTC which would pay my way through college if I continued on to ROTC.  Had I known that I would not have been stuck with this shitty student loan bill. 

What I'm saying is that, while yes, the school district will probably not do her any favors, as long as her parents are actively encouraging her and interested in her educational development, she is likely to do well.  Also school provides other children, who will help her develop these social skills that she is lacking.  Many people don't realize this but that is where a lot of children learn that shit.  

Anecdote: I've interacted with three homeschooled kids when I was in school.  All ended up going to school because of similar reasons to OP's daughter, yes this is confirmation bias but hear me out.  One was in elementary school and the girl had eventually leveled out and started talking to people.  The second one was in High School, it was this weird skinny kid whom we were all afraid was going to shoot up the school (kids are mean).  The third was also in high school, it was this girl who basically never brushed her hair or groomed properly, always wore these weird long pleated skirts that went all the way down to her ankles, and pretty bad posture to boot.

A c-bet is standard on this particular flop, but villain could still have unpaired cards or even a small pair that could still fold on the turn. If you don't bet, you can't get that fold, and villain might also then be able to read us for the exact kind of hand that we have.

We can also still draw out on him in the river assuming our aces and queens are still live, at whch point we should be checking behind any way.

If villain has an actual hand, he'll let us know on either the flop or turn anyway with either a done bet or a check-raise.

I don't like checking on ether the flop or the turn because we can't get marginal hands to fold by checking, and because we don't want a hand like AJ or AT that might have floated our c-bet catching an out.

On dry boards, I'd say that you should always fire a second barrel on the turn as a heat check, because not only are you representing a strong hand already having raised before the flop, villain doesn't always necessarily have to have a hand that is strong enough to call that second barrel on the turn.

However, we've cultivated a supportive user base by:

- eliminating low content posts and explaining why when we remove them (now with help from automoderator) -- this alters the user base somewhat... people who are interested in karma from memes stop posting (this is controversial reddit-wide, but it's our sub and our rules and our users are very happy with it)

- we try our best to dissolve fights / flame wars by removing comments with personal attacks and warning the user or even banning them

- we have a very strict zero tolerance policy about homophobic or racial slurs and we are public and communicative about it.

- we communicate with each other as mods when we remove a post that might be ""in a gray area"" of our rules -- basically calling ourselves out for review by other fellow mods

- when we come up with ideas for rules, concepts, etc - we run them by the community.. we almost never just start with a new rule... we get feedback, we listen to concerns, and sometimes we abort mission because the community disagrees...

- we do stick to our guns on some things, like low content posts, amidst protest, but only when we're confident it's the right thing to do.  there are some people who dislike this, but they're a very vocal minority and we don't let that sway us... it's not like there aren't places they can go post memes.

- we try and ""contain"" repeat/overdone stuff by having weekly threads for it... ""showoff sunday"", for example, where you can post low content stuff like pictures from your seats, a funny shirt you saw, etc..."

Rather, it might fix the short term problem of wanting to have net neutrality, but it would cause further problems because ISPs don't really fit into the same box as telephone networks, and a lot of regulations would have to be re-written to provide some exemption for them.

That's exactly what I wanted to see addressed. It seems like a lot of the telephone-era aspects of common carriage just don't make as much sense in the modern context. 

I have heard that forcing infrastructure companies to open their networks to competitors has been successful in Europe, though I believe that comes with stricter requirements for ongoing funding of infrastructure development and deployment. I know I had good experiences with RCN, who rent Comcast's network in some markets (Boston and D.C.) and are able to provide the service at much lower prices than Comcast."

Really, the difference between mixtapes and mix CDs is far greater than the difference between mix CDs and playlists. 
  
Mixtapes were a high wire act.  You had to build them as you went.  Fuck up and fixing it was a pain in the ass.  Going back more than one song was a huge pain in the ass.  So you had to get it right.  If you had decent stereo equipment,  that included getting the levels right so you didn't get distortion.     

Even if you planned the track order ahead of time you had to execute,  with the right amount of pause (or not) between tracks,  to fit the flow, maybe throw in some cool tidbits of sound you pulled from other sources,  like bits of dialog from movies or whatever.   And maybe the track order that worked in your mind doesn't work on tape. Don't know til you listen to the finished product (bad? too late!).   

Then there was the foldout insert. You had to do your best to make some art that made you look relatively cool and interesting,  all in this little strip of paper.  Fuck *that* up and you had to start all over. 
  
Make the tape itself look cool for bonus points. Feel the satisfaction of popping out the tab to seal the fact that it's finally done. 
  
So it was a real labor of love,  a product of work,  skill and ingenuity. An artifact of your creativity and dedication,  and therefore a worthy tribute to its recipient. 
  
Mix CDs?  Dick around with the track order all you want. Taste the start and end of each track to make sure they flow.  Listen to the playlist over and over til you're sure of it.  Hit burn and jack off until it's done.  Burned it but want to change it?  Whatever.  Fix what you want and just burn it again in five minutes. 

And I've never seen anyone do anything particularly cool with a CD insert. You could,  but even then no doubt you would use digital tools and not your own two hands,  with all the risk of error that entails.  
  
All very safe and secure from the tension and intensity of building a good mixtape.  
  
Just like a playlist, except a playlist is minus a disc of plastic. Boo hoo.

Now there are a few definitions of [abandon](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abandon?s=t).  Most have to do with leaving things or giving them up. But what we need is the noun version, as all of the temples are temples of a noun, and this one should be no different. 

 The noun definition is ""a complete surrender to natural impulses without restraint or moderation; freedom from inhibition or conventionality:""  This lends itself very well to satyrs and their revelries.

As I hiked, I ran into a different man who had an influence on my life (fathers of close friends, friends of my parents, my fourth grade teacher). They each made a chalk marking on my arm, and said what it represented (things like perseverance, humor, love, etc). Near top of the hill, a family friend said the last word, and blindfolded me. He lead me to the top of the hill, where my dad read a speech he and my Mom had written. Each man then said a short speech about what their word meant. I recited the poem. I had the marks washed off as ""I already have those traits, this was just to commemorate them."" My dad presented the box. I was turned around to face the ocean sky line as the men all recited a slightly different version of the last line of the poem.

More than that, she won't be constantly seeking your approval or stoop to playing annoying games rooted in her insecurity.

It's just a better situation overall -- unless you too are insecure, and you feel the need to possess some kind of leverage over a woman because you can't hack it with one who isn't riddled with self-esteem issues.

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389899765.0,"Yeah, no problem.  

&gt; First of all, it's deflationary

Imagine that if you make a basket in the first minute of the game it's worth 1 point.  Imagine that it goes up by a factor of two every 5 minutes.  By halftime, each shot is worth almost 60 points.  Let's also say that players are limited to only playing 5 minutes per game.  

You'd hold on to your best for as long as possible, right?  It's better to use them when baskets are worth more, because shooting early doesn't give you nearly the return as it does late.  

Bitcoin is like that, except that the game lasts forever.  There's a limited supply of coin (player minutes), but an increasing or constant demand (points per bucket).  There's more incentive to hold than there is to spend.  That's fine for a commodity, but it doesn't bode well for a currency.

&gt; Secondly, it is not attractive to businesses because its limited supply makes it subject to high levels of volatility

The basketball equivalent of this is JR Smith.  He can go off for 30 points and play a great game, or he can go out there and stink it up.  He's not consistent.  

GM's know that it's not a smart move to gamble on an inconsistent player in the long term.  Your best bet is to trade him as he peaks and hope that you're not left to deal with his cold streaks.  

Businesses don't want to hold money that has big ups and downs, because it means that they can get burnt by a cold streak.

&gt; A 51% attack could cripple the currency and crush confidence.

If enough computer power handles the transaction verification process, they can fudge the system.  

This is like David Stern having the ability to veto trades for ""basketball reasons"".  When someone has too much power, they can game the system.

&gt; It is extremely difficult to exchange USD to BTC in a manner that is quick and reliable.

This is like trading for a player with a bad contract and a million restrictions.  It's doable, but some assets are hard to move even if they have value (Bynum).

Brightt,circlebroke,1389899818.0,"&gt; Also, look at /r/feminism[1] vs. /r/mensrights[2] . Their front page is always filled with horrible stories of men being victims of false rape accusations and deprived of their custodial rights.All of their isses focus on how women are mistreating men. /r/feminism[3] deals much more with body issues, stories of successful women, birth rights, and how society can better treat women. 

Well, to be honest, it would be kind of pointless to make the front page of /r/mensrights about those things... Body issues? Most men aren't as insecure about their bodies as women are. Stories of successful men? That would be kind of redundant, don't you think? How society can better treat men? Well, there are some social norms that need some fine tuning, but all in all, men are pretty well set in society minus a few small things.

So, the only real thing left to talk about is injustice against men, don't you think? I don't subscribe to the subreddit, and I think the whole 'mensrights' movement is blowing shit so hard out of proportion I don't even think they're worth taking seriously for the most part, but your objection with the subreddit is kind of off tbh."

&gt;""I don't think it would be fair for me to give advice because I'm emotionally invested. I don't know anything about either school, and I would only give advice in a way that would preserve our relationship.""

This isn't entirely impartial, at least not to me.  You didn't come out and say that you want her to pick a school that's closer to where you are now, but you might as well have.  You're indirectly telling her exactly how you feel, which can sway her decisions.  If you want to be impartial, pretend she's a friend that you barely see that wants help picking a school.  Talk her through the thought process so that she can make a good decision that's good for her education and her career, regardless of where it takes her.

When we first starting dating, I stayed over pretty frequently because we wanted to see each other, and plus, she was closer to my work than my house (I was living at home at the time).  I worked pretty late, so I ended up staying over quite often so that I wouldn't have to drive home super tired.  Within a month or two, we realized I was basically living there anyway, she offered for me to stay, so I did.

By the time I moved across the country with her, I think we were dating for about 10-11 months.  Seems kinda fast to most people, but like I said - I wanted to move out there anyway, so while it was partially to stay with her, to be honest, it was mostly because it was a chance for me to move out there.  It was a stepping stone, I suppose, since it can be difficult to just pick up and move without some sort of help.    "

Euryleia,EQNext,1389899873.0,"&gt; John Smedley said that it was looking as though alpha would launch in the second half of January, and suddenly we Super Fans are forced to evaluate whether we think that’s true or not. Suddenly, an element of distrust has been introduced into the excitement-building mix.

This is rather annoyingly backwards.  If a developer can't give an honest assessment of where they think things are at for fear that they might be wrong, and fans will crucify them for being wrong rather than understanding that schedules often slip... that's precisely the kind of distrust I hate.  I like developers that trust the fanbase enough to be honest with them.  Those of us willing to be reasonable and understanding adults should not be punished with a veil of silence because a few individuals are going to go ballistic if someone says something in all honesty that they believe, but it later turns out to be wrong.

I'm very happy that SOE appears to be adopting the attitude of trust towards their Landmark fans here.  I disagree strongly that they should harbor the kind of distrust for us that would force them to keep their cards always hidden.  This *is* very much about trust, and SOE's getting it right in this case.  And for my part, I'm much more willing to trust them when they show trust in us."

The thing is that when a relationship ends there have been roughly 20 guys giving the gal attention when the relationship ended via either social networking sites (i.e. Facebook, instagram, etc.). At least that is how it has gone in my experience.

Also, guys rarely discuss their gal with their friends, the more a guy digs a gal the less he will talk about her. The friends of a guy know his deepest shit and can use it if the moment arises. 

So when a relationship ends, the gal basically gets hand delivered into a sarlacc pit of cock who will deliver compliments and keep confidence high. Where as the guy is placed quietly in a dark room of already taken women. Another way to prove this is look at your gal's Facebook notifications relative to yours, it is generally 10 times that of a guys.

&gt;Wrong. Those people in 2043 are much better of than they would have been, since they have access to technologies that simply would not have existed otherwise.

NOT IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEM!!!

Seriously, having the ""best"" healthcare doesn't mean anything if it's inaccessible!

&gt;Unequal growth or equal stagnation. You can float between them, but I'd optimize for growth, myself.

I'd prefer a balance. This reminds me of the minimum wage argument libertarians throw around, that if we actually ""gasp"" give people a living wage society would stagnate and fall apart, etc. It's a dumb argument, because who cares about progress if it's inaccessible to the common man?

&gt;Nothing is preventing individuals from putting themselves in positions to afford the same. Beyond that, nothing is stopping you from getting yourself to such a position and then helping others, since you keep claiming this is your goal.

You clearly dont see things through the eyes of sciology and the like.

&gt;Then put yourself in a better position. The default is that you are going to die. I'm trying to optimize for a system that might prevent this. You're just giving up.

This is a really dumb statement and a really dumb argument, instead of saying ""be a winner instead of a loser"", why don't we look at why we need losers in the first place?

Anyway, I don't see us really getting further, you have totally different priorities and concerns than me."

ElderCunningham,pics,1389900088.0,"&gt;Going in, I was told to memorize the poem 'If,' by Kipling. I didn't know anything else.

&gt;I was driven to a hiking spot by my uncle. When we arrived, we were greeted by my grandfather who lead us to the base of the trail. I was instructed to wait 5 minutes, then follow. As I hiked, I ran into a different man who had an influence on my life (fathers of close friends, friends of my parents, my fourth grade teacher). They each made a chalk marking on my arm, and said what it represented (things like perseverance, humor, love, etc). Near top of the hill, a family friend said the last word, and blindfolded me. He lead me to the top of the hill, where my dad read a speech he and my Mom had written. Each man then said a short speech about what their word meant. I recited the poem. I had the marks washed off as ""I already have those traits, this was just to commemorate them."" My dad presented the box. I was turned around to face the ocean sky line as the men all recited a slightly different version of the last line of the poem. ""Your's is the world and all that's in it, And what is more, you have become a man, my son"""

Guys come here often and say something like, ""When you see a hot guy, do you want to fuck him"" and the women often say, no. That they need a certain kind of attention or time spent with him to want to fuck him. 

Of course add to that that *again in general* women work full time and then are expected to do most of the child rearing or household work and you simply have someone who is too tired or stressed to even begin feeling sexy. "

Take the car to a full service hand wash shop. Give them your supplies, and ask them to follow whichever regimen you use to wash a car. 

Fill up 6 Home Depot buckets with water, carry them out to your car, use 1 for shampoo, 1 for the degreaser sponge cleaning, and one for rinse. The remaining three are all for rinsing shampoo. Dry with a squeegee, and lots of terry towels. Finish with a detailing spray, and microfiber. This is the most work. 

Make friends at a parts store. I washed my car behind an Advance Auto Parts for 3 months. 

Check out your neighboring apartments for a hookup, or find a friend with a connection. You can arrange a wash day with a buddy or 2, and wash everyone's car sequentially. 

Check around the building at your work for a hose. Sometimes there is a hose out back on bigger buildings, especially with loading docks. There was a Wal-Mart with a hose out back 2 minutes from my place, and they didn't catch me for almost 2 months. "

When it was unveiled that tobi was obito it was like a mindfuck because I was like ""why didnt I figure that out before"" I mean seriously to-bi, o-bi-to, the Japanese, it almost makes too much sense. 

I'm waiting eagerly to find out why kakashi killed rin like that, I assume it was because the other ninja were after some piece of information and he couldnt let it fall into their hands or something. I almost hope that kakashi will just be like ""actually dude she's been alive this whole time, Ive been banging her and everything"". But this anime has its moments where its simply not just a comedy action formulaic cookie cutter product.

We are finding out a lot about kakashi's character as well, where you can see how in the first episodes he valued teamwork in his cadets because it was something he personally failed at in his past. The great kakashi who has always been presented as able to accomplish anything, actually has a past of being quite helpless in multiple situations. The reality of the villains becomes more and more hazy, who is actually in the right? Is it wrong to want to bring happiness to the world even if its based on something that is fake? Is it wrong to hate a village that would make you sacrifice your friends to protect its secrets, honestly I would want to tear the whole thing down myself. 

The show also has a good contrast going between kakashi's cadet group under naruto's father and naruto's group under kakashi. Where in the first obito was basically the naruto character while kakashi was the sasuke, their roles are pretty much flipped where the first sasuke character stayed on the ""good"" side along with the second ""naruto"" and vice versa.

Once they get into mass production and boxed stores like this, it's not considered designer. Also designer clothing is a lot more expensive. Think $400 for a shirt vs the $70-90 you see here. And the mark down for sales is fewer and far between because with box stores like Express they have to constantly have clothes on rotation. It's also lower quality, not great stitching, dyes are off, fit is a boxed for everyone fit, etc. 

Now the exception to the boxed store idea is designers like Michael Kors, Max Azaria, Armani, etc. they are designers who now choose to mass produce but the brands carry their names. If you want to see designer clothing in person and how it's sold, go to Neiman Marcus, Bergdorfs, Barney's...

Otherwise look up these designer brands and see the price difference. It's not only because of the name, but the quality of the product; Gucci, Prada, Versace, D&amp;G, Marc Jacobs, Louboutin, etc.

They never called her a whore, and it was on radio. Sachs was supposed to be on Brand's radio show but didn't answer the call so they left him an answer message, wherein Brand &amp; Ross egged each other on to say stupid shit until Brand said he had slept with Sach's granddaughter. The papers blew it way out of proportion since they have had a vendetta against Brand for the most part and he ended up being sacked. I think Ross actually quit because of the ridiculous shit he was being given for it all. Andrew Sachs himself even said about a week after the whole furor that he accepted Brand's apology and everyone should just forget about it now. 


I actually think most of the reason why Ross doesn't get as many A-listers on his show is because it's ITV, which doesn't have as much prestige around the world as the BBC."

I think the point is here is that female's may not be reduced completely to their sexuality, but their sexuality becomes a big part of their character where it might not be if they were male. Because if Fela was a man, this question wouldn't come up, obviously. But why is it fair that it came up just because she's a woman? I mean, Fela is obviously nearly as intelligent as Kvothe, but there weren't any questions (admittedly, of the questions I saw, at least) about that.

What matters is that even off the cuff comments shouldn't happen. In the same way casual racism is *still racism*, casual sexism is still sexism - and is still objecting women.

Serae,AskWomen,1389900652.0,"I think many people forget to continue to maintain their relationship after they get married (or even in long term relationships) due to a few reasons.

1.) They feel secure and don't think they need to continue to do special things for one another.

2.) Their focus has shifted to work, kids, or hobbies.

3.) Lack of privacy for a variety of reasons, kids, roommates, in-laws...

4.) Laziness.  I think this is the big one.

As someone else said here, never stop dating your SO.  This is good advice.

I have been with my husband for 8 years and married for over a year.  College actually hurt our sex life more than marriage did.  However, sex has dropped off substantially after the first two years we had been together.  I don't think marriage was the think that began killing it so much as familiarity and the feeling like you didn't need to try anymore.

Sex never got old to me.  I would still rather have sex than play video games, read a book, go out and so on.  That is not true for my husband.  The sex we do have is great, just not up to my level of frequency.  It isn't a deal breaker for me either, and my husband knows.  Therefore these is no way to initiate change on his part.

I wouldn't say familiarity breed contempt, that would be the wrong word. I think it breeds laziness.  Who ever wants sex the most will be put out and have to take whatever they can get.  The one who wants sex less often is in a win-win situation where they feel comfortable enough to not put in any effort...and get sex when they feel like it because they know the other person is a desperate want of it.  

Remember, relationships are complicated.  Sex is a big part of it but not the biggest for everyone.  Some couples lose interest in sex and it works for them.  Sometimes one person suffers, sometimes both.  Every is different.  But what I think everyone should take away from the discussion is to make an effort for your loved one to make them feel wanted, whether it's sex, date night, a butt grab or a compliment."

tjah,AskCulinary,1389900676.0,"Not quite. The 212F is actually the maximum temperature at which water is capable to remaining a liquid. So when water reaches 212, it becomes steam. Steam is perfectly capable of being heated above that point, it just becomes steam at 212. So when you cover the pan, the steam that is 212 when it becomes steam stays surrounding the chicken from the top and all sides, and potentially can continue to heat up above 212. It may not necessarily get to 400 like the pan is, but it will be warmer than room temperature air.

If you take the lid off, the steam escapes and instead the chicken will be surrounded by the top and sides by air that is closer to room temperature. You're thinking of it as chicken either in 400degree oil or chicken in 400 hundred degree oil surrounded by 212 degree steam, which will cool the 400 degree oil. But it's actually chicken in 400 degree oil surrounded by 212 degree steam, or chicken in 400 degree oil surrounded by 72 (ish) degree room temperature air.

That being said though, if you're cooking it in oil, you're probably looking for a crispy outside. In this case, keeping the lid on keeps all the moisture in, making it harder for the outside to get crispy, so you may want to leave the lid off anyway, for that reason.

TL;DR: Cooking with the lid on will keep the heat in and make it cook faster, but it also holds moisture in which will make it difficult to achieve a crispy outside, if that is what you're going for."

yourdungeonmaster,rpg,1389900697.0,"Whoops!  Wrote out a long response, then accidentally closed the tab before I saved.

What I did was ran through a scenario using the [same trap I described elsewhere in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1vcon2/fun_simple_trap_ideas/cer3r92).  I ran it two ways: 

1.  The standard 3.5-ish way (I have since read Frotch's reply and agree.  I think versions PF/3.0+, in trying to defend players against tyrant GMs,  ruined traps forever).  TLDR:  action stops to roll dice and compare results to target numbers.  If you run traps this way, then it's not fun *even for the rogue/whoever is detecting/disabling the traps*. Then...

2.  I ran it how my group ran the trap in real play.  I am afraid I don't have the time to type it all out again.  TLDR:  everyone was involved, the door was examined in detail, the presence of a trap was *certain* in the minds of the players, so the encounter focus was on how to solve it, not who could reach the target DC with a roll the fastest, the hinges being unattached was fairly easy to find (automatic, actually, if the players said they were examining the hinges), the rogue, if he had had a chance to inspect the handle, would have had a better chance at discovering it was suspiciously loose than the others, and two of the other players - over the rogue's objections - pulled the handle, failed their saves, landed on their asses, started hallucinating, I got to roll on my custom d30 hallucination table, the the party got attacked by the resident denizens while two members role-played their specific visions.  Everyone had a great time.  People laughed.

Then I anticipated all your objections, based on the thousands of 3.5ers who have voiced the same complaints about traps that you have, and addressed them one by one.  

This sucks.  Time is too short.  I wish you could sit at my table.  Fun is had by all, laughter is pretty much non-stop, and immersion is *enhanced*, rather than *broken*, by trap encounters.  Are they perfect?  No.  When a trap seems less fun, I figure out what didn't work so well, and I just don't do that anymore.  But mostly they're a blast.  For everyone.  

I just find it sad every time I hear these complaints about traps, because when I do, it informs me that folks aren't running trap encounters imaginatively, and another gaming group misses out on the magic."

That's how it used to be, but the FCC Reform order of 2011 actually changed that. After a transition period, which I'm not sure exactly how long, carriers are moved to a bill-and-keep mechanism which means there is no longer mutual compensation that pays you for terminating a call on your network.

I like the Tektronix TDS 320 series. There are a bunch of similar models, and you can find them for a couple hundred dollars on ebay, if you're patient. They're pretty reliable, so if they claim to be working, you'll probably be fine.

Analog scopes are fine, but for any kind of microprocessor or serial data stuff, you really need a digital storage scope. I haven't used an analog scope in years.

Probes are a trick. Real Tektronix probes are kind of pricey. You can find ones on ebay called ""P6100"", which I believe is supposed to sound like a Tek part number, but is actually crap from China. I got some of them, and they work."

fkjac,AskTechnology,1389901241.0,"The first concern would be that the translation would change as you write more words, especially between languages with the verbs, nouns etc. in different orders.
For example from French to English:

""Je mangez une pomme rouge""  
becomes:  
""I am eating a red apple""

In French, the adjective comes after the noun, while it is opposite in English.  
You *could* circumvent this by waiting for the sentence to finish before translating, but that would ruin the whole instant-translation thing in long sentences like this one."

it tends to grow tiresome to constantly be asked to justify yourself.  consider how annoying it seems when extroverted people tell introverts to ""just come out of your shell.""  there are infinite reasons why people choose to do the things they do, and having to source all of one's behavior choice reasoning for another's benefit can be very frustrating.  asking others to extensively explain themselves removes you of the need to attempt any empathy, which is one-sidedly selfish and generally feels quite fruitless to the person doing the explaining.  it's foolish to assume we possess the ability to actually KNOW another's point of view, and it is demanding and self-involved to argue that another MUST present counterexamples to your logic for their choices to be worthy."

redwhiskeredbubul,TheBluePill,1389901406.0,"Okay, more anthropology science checking here. 

I don't have much of a problem with the core point of the book this comes from--that there is a mythological notion of a 'noble savage' which doesn't accord with the facts. But when the data is extrapolated back to make statements about modern society I think you run into problems. 

In particular, I think a cross-comparison between Europe and the US to specific societies in Amazonia or Papua New Guinea obscures a lot about 20th-century society. Leaving aside the reliability of some of the data in the chart (I'm hoping the data on the Yanomami doesn't come from Napoleon Chagnon, for example, but I suspect it does), there's just the complexity of the question of what the social and political causes of mass death are. For example, 'war communism'  policies and the threat of external attack contributed to policies in the Soviet Union in the 1930's and 1940's that lead to very high death rates, including at least one event that's controversially considered a genocide in the Ukraine. Those deaths were chiefly by famine (which might be argued to be rare in hunter-gatherer societies) but they had military roots. Moreover, if you look at the death rates during WWII you _do_ get rates that are entirely comparable with the figures here for that period. If I'm recalling correctly somewhere in the neighborhood of 15-20% of the German male population died during WWII. That's a period of five years, never mind what you would get for lifetime incidence of violent death in combat. In general, the axis powers had high rates of male deaths because most of the people who died were combatants. A number of other countries (Poland, China come to mind) were literally decimated: 10% or more of the entire population was killed. These countries had more even distributions across gender because they were invaded and large numbers of those killed were non-combatant women and children. Also, by convention the figures I'm using don't include the Holocaust or people who died in forced labor camps. Moreover, shocking as it is to say, American death rates in WWII were essentially negligable compared to places like Poland, so that is another thing to keep in mind.   I don't know what numbers you would get for the Korean or Vietnam War, or Iran-Iraq, but they're probably comparable. (I think the Korean War killed something like 5-10% of the population of Korea and 90% of the population was internally displaced.) 

In short, people tend to underestimate how horrible WWII was,  the demography of war is pretty complicated and while the idea that 'men die in war' is also a myth, there are limited senses in which it is true. "

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1389901464.0,"Part of me wonders about this sort of thing a lot.  I was born with severe hearing difficulties (allergy/inflammation/eustachian tube junk) which weren't caught until I was almost kindergarten age, when I was suspected of being retarded (yes, that was the proper term at the time) due to the fact that I wasn't picking up words and mimicking them properly... after screening they determined that I was actually pretty intelligent and after tube operations which improved my hearing drastically, I caught up quick but always had an issue with loudness/inflection/modulation which has taken more than three decades of my life to get a handle on. 

It makes me wonder if it forced my brain to develop differently because I rely more on visual than auditory input.  I figure I owe my high visual acuity to this... I'm one of those guys who notices things which others do not, can pick out insanely minute details or flaws in things I see if I'm focusing on it properly, stuff which most other folks overlook.  Those 'where's waldo' games were pretty easy for me when I was a kid :-D.  

It also begs questions about Asperger's... if a brain is forced to develop in an Aspergian/HFA fashion versus it happening 'naturally' as it were... does that count as a separate category or is it more of a ,""If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck..."" sort of thing.

It's hypocritical of you to say this. It's also wrong -- sometimes it's reasonable to get offended and sometimes it isn't, and there's nothing wrong with saying so or with arguing about it. It's also not that relevant whether a person is offended unless they can justify/explain the source of their offense.

I know it's a tough pill to swallow, as I've been there.  But you aren't going to suddenly be satisfied with less sexual contact.

So a new haswell i5 running at 3.4 GHz is probably about 2-2.5x as powerful as the quad 2 duo at 2.5GHz. Still, many games run perfectly well on much less powerful hardware.

JackPAnderson,AskReddit,1389901567.0,"&gt;So we begin to negotiate price and, great news you beat me up, we'll sell the vehicle to you for $37,000. You got a very nice and healthy discount (on an SUV in that range there's probably 4200 dollars in mark up.) Well...now you're still hovering around $620 per month and you're no where close to your budget and there's no room left in the vehicle to move that number.

So suggest leasing, then. Or a lower trim level. 

&gt;If you get a vehicle for a monthly price you're comfortable at a deal you find fair. What does it matter how much the car costs?

This is exactly the type of thinking that gets people paying way too much for a car. Whether you're paying cash today or financing the car over time, you still have to pay the price negotiated. 

Let's say I want a $25,000 car and can afford $550/mo, but I want to negotiate for the car to pay less. ""But why even bother? I can get you that $25k car for $542.38/mo for 48 months at 2% interest, so I'm saving you $8/mo!""

Well, that's great, but I'd be paying 25k+$1034.15 in interest if we do it your way, but if I negotiate down to $23,500, then I pay $23.5k+972.10 in interest. Well, I don't know about you, but for me, saving 26,034.15-24,472.1=$1,562.05 is something that I would appreciate doing. There's a lot that I'd enjoy buying for $1,562.05, and one of them is not your paycheck, no offense.

Look, I get where you're coming from, and I'm sure you have the best of intentions, but you have to recognize that the vast majority of the people out there don't understand financial calculations. It is just too easy for someone to think that they're getting a good deal and actually be getting ripped off.

That's why the general advice is that if the salesman starts talking monthly payment right off the bat, make sure you have a firm grip on your wallet because you're about to be pickpocketed. "

ashwinmudigonda,india,1389901609.0,"When I was younger, every Sunday, my parents would take my brother and me to a temple in Madras. It was a bit far away, and was about a half an hour ride. A few minutes before we reached our destination, we would have to make a left turn and cross a bridge over the Cooum river. Right at that intersection, to our right, was Melody theater. It was one of the city's C-grade porno theaters. 

Until this point, my brother and I would be fighting, yapping, talking and playing word games. But right around then, I would quieten up, and wait for the theater. My mother figured this out, and she would try to distract us by asking about school or some such shit. But given the paucity of skin on TV (WTF was on DD1 and DD2 anyway?) I would be distracted. 

When my dad made that left turn, there it was in all its glory - a twenty foot high poster of the movie that was playing inside. Of course there was no nudity, but nudity for the pubescent mind in the early 90s was relative. I'd gape at it, and my mom would look at me through the rearview mirror and order me to turn forward. I would (for the fear of her slaps) but I'd try to catch the fading glimpses through every way possible. Looking out of the window, but straining with my peripheral vision, through the side view mirror, etc.

A few years passed. My voice broke, my lip caterpillar emerged, hair dropped everywhere. I went on my annual summer vacation to Hyderabad, and my cousin Amit, who was a couple of years older to me, asked me if I wanted to go and watch ""an A pitcher""? I said, yeah, been dying to do so.

So we hopped on his Kinetic Honda, and zipped to some nameless theater with fading posters and peeling paint. I asked him if they'll let us in (I was only 14), and he laughed and said, ""This not your Madras. Everything chaltha hai here."" 

Sure enough, a few minutes later, we were inside. No A/C, but fast turning Khaitan fans. The room was dingy, smelt of beedi smoke and phenyl. The seats were terrible. They were torn, lumpy, and totally uncomfortable. I assumed there would be a 50-50 gender ratio, but it was more 100-0. Greasy men leered at the ads on the screen. I sat uncomfortably and waited for the movie to start.

It did. I don't remember the name, but it was some seedy Malayalam shit movie dubbed into Telugu. I hoped for boobs, but all I got was the actress showering with her clothes on. And then there was a rape scene, but no boobs. A lot of clothes tearing, and bra showing, but that's about it. Each time the actress touched herself in there were fake ""Aaanh....Mmmm...Oooh"" sounds that clearly wasn't being made by her. Just around interval, I told Amit I wanted to get out of here. 

And so we did. 

Amit felt bad that I was disappointed with his choice and said that we'll go and watch an ""English blue pitcher"" And I agreed. After grabbing some egg puffs and downing a Thums Up each, we went to some movie that I forgot the name of, but it was a Hollywood D-grade softcore porno. And I was in for a surprise when the script involved some fuck-all reincarnation of an LA guy in India. The LA guy was a sculptor in his previous life, and the sizzling white chick was his muse.

AgentDL,dogs,1389901687.0,"Thanks so much for your input!

&gt; I would suggest completely cleaning/moving/getting a new crate, because now she is associating it with bad things/going to the bathroom.

Worth a try. I need to leave her alone tonight. I'll move the crate to a different area of the apartment and see how that works out. 

&gt;On top of that, practice ignoring her before you leave/after you get home. It can be tough to not get excited when getting home after a long day, but in the end, wait for her to calm down before giving affection; it can help curb some anxiety to know that everything is still normal.

Very easy for me to do. She is a very ""chill"" and low energy dog and I don't try to rile her up. When I get home, I spend a minute doing random stuff before I let her out. Even though she is experiencing anxiety, when I go into her room to let her out of the crate, she is completely calm, will sit down for me, and will wait for me to not only open the crate door but also give her permission to exit. 

&gt; make sure she knows that she's still part of the pack, include her in what you can but remember who is the pack leader.

I believe I'm pretty good at this. Being a responsible pit bull (mix) owner means knowing exactly what it means to be the alpha and have the dog under control. I'm confident that Maya knows her place in the pecking order as I am her alpha and don't allow her to step out of line. She also has a submissive nature to begin with.

am5437435,toronto,1389901699.0,"&gt; I was debating with someone the other day about the Star's bias against Ford. In my opinion The Star is the left wing version of Fox News.

Oh please.

The Star has an agenda and a bias.  This is well known and has been for as long as The Star has published a newspaper.  All newspapers have a bias.  The NP and Sun are just unofficial mouthpieces of the Conservative Party in high and low brow flavour, respectively.  The Globe is to the right, but more centrist.  The Star is left-centre.

But Fox News?  Come the fuck on.  They publish opposing views all the time and are very concerned with being factually correct.  And, as the past year has demonstrated, have an unassailable track record for factual accuracy.

And as for the agenda against Ford:

1. He's not the only politician they have taken down.  They also took down Giambrone, a lefty star candidate.

2. It was an open secret at council for years about Ford's behaviour, associations and background.  No one could say anything because they didn't have proof and would have been sued into submission.  When he got elected, they decided to go get the proof and expose him.  And thank god they did.

Stop acting as if this is the first or only time a newspaper has attacked a politician of a different ideology."

When the transaction was originally described, it was published that the New Orleans front office would still retain control over basketball operations.  The GM made a move that they wanted, but it was vetoed by a body that shouldn't be in a position to veto such things.  

It would be like a little league game where a coach comes in to throw pitches because the other team is short, then fires bullets that the opposing team can't hit.  Maybe the league should have stepped in, but they should have left the basketball business to the teams.

So mens and womens issues are not equal, get that out of the way. But i believe there should be campaigning on mens and womens issues. I would say *i am for social justice movements*. I would say im a feminist because women deserve equal opportunity, i wish i could say i was an equivalent in some mens movement, but there isn't a credible equivalent. The MRM seems like the toxic counterweight to toxic feminism.

Feminism is a mess. But its contributed more of everything good to smart social justice than the reactionary MRM, which has only really succeeded in tackling emergent inequities in divorce courts. Thats evidence enough to me, that it needs to exist. Feminism competes against mens issues by nature.

I'd like to call myself egalitarian, but again this isn't a tangible movement, so i might as well call myself a spooky ghost. What i see is gender focused social justice movements as blobs with few identifiable markers i align with.

So social justicey? Interested in SJ politics... I dont know. Its all a shitshow.

Sunfried,KerbalSpaceProgram,1389901899.0,"Minmus is, IIRC, 6 degrees inclination off equatorial-- it's a very small amount, so it may not pay to try to match the inclination from launch.  In other words, fly on the compass (due east) rather than on the target indicator (purple node).  Once you're in orbit, you can easily and cheaply correct the inclination by thrusting normal or antinormal, depending on your position.  (For equatorial orbit, normal is north on the compass, antinormal south, both on the 'equator' of the navball.)  Get into equatorial orbit, set your target on Minmus, and then adjust inclination at the ... I forget what it's called-- where the two orbital planes intersect."

**(I'll try to avoid spoilers for your sake)**


The Doctor/Companion dynamic can be a bit problematic from time to time, but I think that's a product of the reboot generation (from 2005+) because the BBC has (so far) tried to make The Doctor younger and younger and there has been an added element of sexiness that wasn't necessarily present in the older seasons. Sooo we have things like one companion falling in love with The Doctor and the next companion harboring unrequited love for him, and another companion who's implied (I think) as a romantic interest but nothing explicit is ever said. It can get, well, boring, to be honest. BUT only that dynamic and only when it exists, which is not all of the time.

There's one companion who's a fucking badass who takes no shit from anyone, including The Doctor, and one who turns into his best friend (that relationship also includes a male companion who is in a romantic relationship with the female companion). So not everything is, ""Oh geeze, another hot young Doctor, another hot young female companion, how long until they kiss?""

That said, it's *kind of* iffy that so many young women are so eager to totally abandon their lives for this attractive young(-looking) guy; but I mean, he's a fucking time and space traveling alien. I imagine there are a lot of guys who would do the same, it's just the BBC wants to appeal to everyone and that means having a young, attractive male Doctor and a young, attractive female companion.

*THAT* said, I'll be very interested to see how the dynamic changes (or doesn't) with the introduction of the newest Doctor, who is played by someone much older than the previous two."

mytoeshurt,short,1389902082.0,"I think it is pretty grossly exaggerated when you say we think anybody is entitled to date us.  I don't think many people think being nice is the only thing they have to do.  

It is more of a reaction to being pissed when you see a woman fall for a guy you know is a dickhead.  It makes you think personality doesn't even matter and all that did was looks.  In the case of short men, it makes us feel even more helpless and angry, because it is usually heavily based on a trait we can't do anything to change.  

I think there is a difference between a guy just being nice and getting rejected, and a guy having a lot in common with somebody, hitting it off really well, and getting rejected just because he was unattractive. 

I am not saying that rejecting somebody purely based on physical attraction is some evil act.  I just think it is completely acceptable for the person that is rejected a lot in this fashion to be frustrated by it."

* Two years isn't *that* long, but it's also not super short a time, either.  You're a little older, you know more about what you want in life, etc.  So I think it's ok to go for it, especially since you guys have talked about it and are both on board with the idea.

* You don't have to get married right away.  You can be engaged for a little while.  I got married very quickly after getting engaged - just eight months - but we'd been together for six *years* before the wedding.

That said, I would suggest living together just the two of you once you're engaged.  It gives you a chance to figure out how you'll work as a couple when you can't ""gang up"" together on the other roommate.

edit: to add that we met as students, and started out grad school plans during engagement and after marriage, respectively.  You find a way to make it work.  People asked me if I was going to go to NYC with my wife when she got into law school here.  I was like, ""Um... duh.  We're married!""  Just because the people around you aren't in that stage of life, doesn't mean *you* aren't.  Young adulthood doesn't magically end at some arbitrary age.  It's a stage that some people are in, and the ages vary.  You might be past it already.  You gotta go with what you feel and what the two of you discuss - no one else knows your relationship like you do.  Of course, you also have to look at the cons and try to step out of your relationship-bliss and look at it with as rational/objective an eye as you can manage, too."

Drop_,politics,1389902187.0,"&gt;That's not a problem of the government or dependence. That's a problem of companies not wanting to pay a reasonable salary and offer no benefits to their employees.

This is really important.  

The supply side narrative, the fall of unions, and the emphasis on ""hard work"" has made it acceptable to employ people full time at well below a livable wage.  So the problem of ""dependence"" on federal aid is an outgrowth of policies and attitudes which have seen private sector employment stagnate in terms of wages, but steadily increase in terms of hours required.  

If unemployment is preferable to employment, it's an outgrowth of both the availability of unemployment as much as it is the insufficiency of pay from private companies.  "

What do you do if you find out another guy is interested in you? Bring up as much situations as possible to talk through and figure out what's reasonable and what's not. If he thinks that you shouldn't talk to guys in general or anything else that's reasonable to do (versus getting jealous of it but understanding rationally that it's okay), then you have a problem. Also, don't agree on boundaries that simply make him comfortable. If he feels like you should never talk to a guy outside of work... that's too much. He needs to put his feelings aside and decide on rational boundaries. 

Then explain that if you aren't breaking any of the boundaries, it's *his* job to fix things. This is something he has to to deal with. It takes a little time, but overcoming jealousy is doable. If he just keeps stewing and allowing his discomfort to overwhelm him then the problem is only getting worse. If he tells himself, ""What she's doing is okay. I do this with female friends as well and it means nothing,"" and distracts himself it will help improve things. 

&gt; but that he will most likely stay the way he is forever

With that attitude he will. You can control your emotions. It's hard as fuck, but possible. If your feelings and relationship aren't important enough to him to do some serious change then there's nothing you can do about that. If it's so bad he doesn't know how to change this on his own then he should see a professional about it.

I just want to throw this out though... you said recently he has been having these issues? Do you know why? There might be a small possibility that he's projecting his own transgressions onto you.

E2DsIE,AskReddit,1389902217.0,"I guess I should expand. again this is my opinion and its not very well thought out, so im open to criticism and additions BUT in a respectful manner. My basic idea is that as humans evolve (physically, emotionally, mentally), homosexuality WILL become more prevalent, to the point where a sizeable portion of earth's population will be homosexual. If a sizeable portion of the population is homosexual then i would assume that that portion of the population will be unable to reproduce(barring technology), and thus my opinion. I feel that homosexuality takes form when people take/have the time/freedom to explore their sexuality or even to ponder of such things. [Ex.) I dont think starving kids in Africa ponder over whether they like girls or boys, I think theyre too busy wondering what they're gonna eat for that day]. As societies advance, industrialize, and urbanize, people will have more time/freedom to explore their thoughts/emotions. Societies must be accepting and willing in order for homosexuality to flourish, and the world for the most part hasn't reached that level of thinking yet. I might be wrong because I literally haven't done any research on this(although i would LOVE to) and hence why i'm open to hearing more about the topic. But i feel homosexuality is only prevalent in parts of the world that are progressive, industrialized and or ""advanced"". While this may simply be due to societal repression in traditional societies, i believe ending that repression is ""societal evolution"" or ""mental evolution"" and it could effectively combat (not solve) the issue of overpopulating Earth.

I just looked it up on notebookcheck.net: http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Toshiba-Qosmio-X70-A-11R-Notebook.102010.0.html

It has a great CPU and GPU for a laptop. You aren't going to get much better. It is large, has a 1080p screen which is good, but a glossy TN-type panel which is not my favorite. Depends on the price. If you want a laptop for gaming that will mostly sit on a desk, I'd say it's a good buy at about $1200. It is not easily portable and it doesn't have the best screen quality, though it does have good resolution. The 32GB of RAM is just overkill but whatever. Use RAMDISK if you want, just because you can. According to the notebookcheck review, the single-fan cooling system is sub par for that computer, however this could be alleviated by getting a laptop cooling pad. If it is over about $1200, I'd look at some other options before settling on it. 

quick edit: it says on notebookcheck that it is listed for 2k euros in Europe. If it is even close to that price, hell no. Way too much expense put into excessive amounts of RAM. I bet you can find a better gaming laptop than that for under $1500. 

edit: Depending on how much you can spend, I'd recommend the Asus G750JX. Same CPU and GPU, but a better cooling system, better hard drives and IMO a better quality screen and keyboard. I used to use the G73 model with a similar layout, even with much worse specs, it was a great laptop. "

The mechanics are just a way to make that storytelling *fair* rather than *exact*. When RPG rules push towards exact realism the players spend too much time calculating and checking rules, which disrupts the flow of the story. The system you're describing is better suited to a video game, where the calculations can be done seamlessly in the background and the flow of play is never stopped. 

As a side note: whenever I've played RPG's, the player says what they're trying to do, rolls the dice, determines the outcome, and then describes what actually happened (with the help of the GM). That way all those little factors (pools of light, cover, clothing sounds) can be details that are added *after* the math, to add color to the final result. I think a large portion of the tabletop RPG plays similarly and would balk at this system that makes them nail down everything before the dice are even rolled."

NotAPimecone,AskMen,1389902348.0,"They are generally not sex clubs - at least where I am, sex is usually not even permitted. A lot of people confuse kinksters with swingers. There's some overlap, of course, but not really any relation. 

And, while you are right to not want to base your relationship *solely* on a sexual fetish, if it is something important to you, you should try to find someone with compatible fetishes/interests in addition to other areas of compatibility. Kink organizations can be a good place to meet people with similar interests. And, if you're into FemDom, a FemDom club also seems like a logical place to look. 

I went to one FemDom event where all the male servers were required to wear a certain outfit, serve a formal dinner in a certain way, and generally be at the beck and call of the Women attending. The only sexual things that happened that night were ""entertainment"" wherein two of the males performed sexual acts with each other while the Women watched.

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1389902440.0,"This is similar to what we've done; we bought a home 2 years ago, got a joint checking account, and we each deposit money in there each month.

Sometimes we each ""dump"" some money in there so the account doesn't get too low, and I'm the payer-of-the-bills, so I let him know when he needs to add funds for something.  I have most things on auto-debit, but manually handle the things that can't be auto-debited with a gDoc.

We maintain separate checking accounts for now and separate CCs.  Once we get married, we may combine the checking, but I like having separate CCs, for gifts and because I know exactly what I've bought, so when I review my account daily (to be sure nothing is wrong/catch fraud), I know exactly what to look for.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389902454.0,"&gt; That's the purpose of discussion, isn't it? How boring would it be to talk only to those with whom we agree.

After a while you can't get anywhere though. Not to mention I'm very familiar with the ""technological progress"" arguments. As mentioned, libertarians LOVE to make the same argument. We should focus on growth, all other priorities be darned, while I want balance. IN the end, we don't get anywhere.

&gt;I've been a soldier and a government contractor. You live in the realm of theory; I live in the realm of practice. 

Given your military background, that explains the ""order"" thing you got going, but I will say that the world appears to be multifaceted, and different theories can be explained depending on what exactly you do. For example, when I was helping my city write an ordinance, the goal was to make a policy that helped people, to stop businesses from developing on certain lands where it would be disastrous for the community. It wasn't about order, it was about the greater good.

&gt; But that policy must be backed by someone in order to fly, and the process by which that happens causes those who have the power to back it to tweak it--just a bit--for their own purposes.

I don't deny this, and I personally find all the money being thrown around in washington troublesome, but again, multifaceted, nuanced world. Let's not make blanket statements.

&gt;I never said you were uninformed, by the way. I think your worldview is naive, and I imagine you (like most) cherry-pick what information to give credence, but I never accused you of being uninformed.

And I disagree.

&gt;If you care about helping people, why are you not doing your best to make millions and start a charity? You still haven't answered this part of my question. Why must you ask others to carry out what you think is right?

Because charities rely on donations and are often ineffective compared to what government can do.

Also, the ""why don't you X"" questions are really grating on me. Everyone seems to have an unrealistic opinion of what people should do.

&gt;You are correct. These things are not science. They are far more closely related to religious dogma. In a way, many of the ""social sciences"" are worse, because they assume the cloak of science, but adhere to none of its principles.

As someone who is knowledgeable in this subject, I ahve to disagree. I know there's a lot of junk social science out there, but that's not to say the disciplines are crap.

&gt;Biology has been built on winners and losers. Natural selection is based upon competition for resources. That's the answer to ""why"" winners and losers exist.

And society is built to escape this darwinian state of nature. It seems foolish to persist in having it when we can do more.

Also, I'm not against ALL competition. I just think everyone should have a minimum standard of living and then let competition take it from there.

&gt;The only way to escape this, by the way, is to advance technology. Until we have technology that allows us to leave the planet, terraform other locations, and extend life indefinitely--competition will remain.

While I agree, the thing is, I think the time is NOW, at least for the US and other industralized countries. The 21st century. Here's the thing...if you keep putting these things off to the future, expecting things to get even better, then the future will never come because you keep kicking the can down the road. 

Here's why:

1) per capita GDP is like $50,000 in the US. Expecting all adults to have $15k is not unreasonable and could work well with our dying capitalist system. We CAN balance our priorities.

2) We are entering a post industrial society. Income inequality is going up at a staggering rate, and automation and outsourcing is just going to get worse. I think this recession is gonna largely be permanent for the poor and middle class. I see it as a restructuring....the old way is failing...prosperity doesn't come from jobs any more. We need to try something new.

This is not to say we should stop growing, but I think we should balance the needs of today, while striving toward a better tomorrow. Maximizing one at the sacrifice of the other is foolishness. We need to start this transition NOW, becuase society is changing, and if we don't, we're gonna end up with a dark future where the elites have it all and everyone else is stuck in poverty. And this will be justified on the basis of libertarian thought, and the concept of ""progress."" Progress isn't just a technological thing, it's a social thing, and we need to change attitudes and adapt to 21st century conditions."

gametemplar,boardgames,1389902541.0,"Actually, I think you're close with a Mass Effect-style Twilight Imperium. A better implementation might be if the game were more like RuneWars instead. 

Both Twilight Imperium and RuneWars involve different factions fighting for control of the map, with TI being a space opera epic across galaxies and RuneWars being a fantasy epic. Where I think that RuneWars would be a better choice for Mass Effect is its Heroes. Every faction recruits Heroes that can then travel across the map and go on Quests to gain power and Rune Stones (which are needed to win). The Heroes have their own little phase of each turn where they quest or sneak around behind enemy lines.

This could work especially well with Mass Effect, as you recruit a team of operatives to explore different parts of the galaxy for hidden technologies, relics, or just sabotage your enemy's plans.

I mentioned in the comments of the thread that I visited Phoenix this past weekend and had a fan chirp at me, my friend and his girlfriend who came with me. He swore, threw popcorn and was an all around douche and I sat there waiting for him to come try to fight me. But the Phoenix fans in our area told him to fuck off and they apologized to us and wanted us to know they weren't all assholes like that guy. When I saw this happening ill admit, I sat and watched it happen. I watched it happen twice and the third time I got up and got in his face. But still, that Nucks fan is going to go home with that in his head. Not the fact the we stood up and told that guy to fuck off, but the initial harassment from one dickhead and that my friend is what makes me sick. We see the reputation Kings fans get as loud and obnoxious and rude, and that isn't to say that all kings fans are because I know so many great kings fans who are respectful especially in our /r/hockey community; but I don't want the Ducks to start playing well and these bandwagon ducks to get arrogant and in people's faces like this.

badonkbadonk,leagueoflegends,1389902709.0,"As unfortunate as it is, I think Riot's ultimate intention is to force people to either play A LOT to have enough IP to buy the good champions (which are always changing) OR to buy RP so the player can buy champs to keep up with the changes. In addition, changing the flavor of the month champs frequently tempts players to consider buying skins for as many champions as possible. For example, a year ago, there was no way I would have bought the Snow Day Ziggs skin, but when it became available again this year I snatched it up immediately. Don't get me wrong, it's a great skin, but I would not have bought it if Ziggs' weren't OP.

This will kill revenues. Have you even worked out the numbers on this?

We each of us carry with us the seeds of being able to kill and hurt someone, but rarely is it with such a perverse rational indifference to the suffering of your fellow man carried out on such a scale and by people who hold no immediate or significant threat/danger such that the primal fight or flight reaction takes over.

A question can absolutely have intent. It can say things, as you put it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean you have the foggiest notion what it is. It's arrogant to assume that you can consistently tell a stranger's intentions by guessing what they *might* have meant. Just because a question *can* say things doesn't mean it *is* saying things.

&gt; Asking ""where are you from?"" is at best making the statement ""you are not from here"", but more accurately it's ""you don't belong here"".

No, that's not more accurate. You think that the standard reason for asking where someone's from is rejection? It's used for small-talk, for getting to know someone, for finding a way to connect. That's how socially well-adjusted people use that question, because that's how you get along well with people. By finding a way to connect with them."

ejchristian86,RedditLaqueristas,1389902974.0,"Yes, you should only use linseed oil with oil paints. Acrylic paints have their own types of mediums for use specifically with acrylic; using an oil medium in acrylic paint will result in your paints looking really gross and just sloughing off the canvas, as you're basically trying to mix oil and water.

You can get artist-grade linseed oil at an art supply store such as Blick or Utrecht, or you can save yourself the money and get nearly the same thing from a hardware store for a lot less. Be sure to get ""refined"" and not ""raw"" or ""boiled,"" because the second ones will cause yellowing. Mix it with cold wax medium using a palette knife (I like [this shape](http://www.dickblick.com/products/blick-painting-knives/#photos) best), just pulling it thin and scraping it back together until the two mix and become smooth like butter.

You can use linseed oil with just about any other oil medium. It prolongs drying time and increases the glossiness of the paint. It also makes the paint more translucent, so it's great for glazing (though I recommend making a real glazing medium if you want to go that route)."

The spirit of the law is that they need to *prove their age* show ID that will stand up in court. That satisfies them that the information and the age of the purchaser is correct.

&gt; If you know someone is over 18, then this law was not designed to restrict their purchasing alcohol.

This law is designed that someone over 18 needs to *prove* their age. 
Standing up in court and saying ""Your Honour, I *know* this person is over 18"" ain't going to cut it.

&gt; I'm sure this tourist just went to another retailer where they were happy to take his money and not quibble over acceptable forms of ID.

Quite probably true. But they're taking a risk if they're not quibbling over acceptable forms of ID.

The law specifies these 3 forms of ID for the sake of simplicity. Even a New Zealand firearms licence isn't acceptable under the law for the purchase of alcohol. The acceptable forms are specified in legislation. 

People in the industry are trained to question people who *look* under 25. Yes it's subjective and imperfect but it's what we've got. That method is to protect the licencees and sellers of alcohol.

I don't think it's inherent, though.  It's the way it many times IS, but it's not the way that it HAS to be.  Like the top comment says, I think it's more of a problem with society.  A large problem.  

I'd love to see more porn directed towards women.  I'd also love to see more educational and instructive porn (OKAY SORRY IF THAT SOUNDS REALLY WEIRD) -- I don't have a lot of experience with sex, and it'd be great to watch some...idk, healthy porn (for lack of a better word)."

Deceit, Mystery, Enlightenment, Malice, and Plenty can't even be verbs.  So now that we know its a noun we use the noun definition of Abandon, which I provided.  That definition doesn't have anything to do with giving things up other than inhibition and its synonyms.  Also, there is a noun version of the ""abandon"" definition you are using for your speculation: Abandonment.  If it were called ""Temple of Abandonment"" this would be different.

The reason I suggest that your opinion has no merit is that is seems thus far to me that the *reason* you're arguing is that it makes you feel ""annoyed"" that people are ""too sensitive"" or ""too politically correct"". Your argument seems to be ""toughen up and deal with it because if words hurt you you are weak and stupid"".

Cut guys don't like people calling it genital mutilation because they don't like to think of themselves as mutilated, they think it's normal and they don't feel it has done them any harm. Likewise there are plenty of women who have been circumcised, consider it normal and do not see it as a negative. [Like this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsqEyGdLh8I&amp;t=1m12s).

Obviously there are degrees of female circumcision, and the more serious ones are undoubtedly mutilation. But if all female circumcision is genital mutilation, then male circumcision certainly is."

Noone can be expected to memorize the drivers licence of entry country, let alone all fucking 50 of them in the US. If we did accept them, supermarkets would be teaming with ID's that [look a little something like this](http://blogs.mcall.com/.a/6a00d8341c4fe353ef0168eaa3ac8c970c-800wi)

That's *why* we can't accept ID from anyone else. By limiting it to 3 options it protects the sellers of alcohol through legislation and makes it more difficult for minors to purchase.

As this graph doesn't last these kinds of controls,  we do not know what proportions of each are in which types of situations. 

I am a researcher,  so I work with studies and statistics every day. All I am trying to point out to you is that there is not enough information provided here to say whether there are issues with honesty or whether there are other factors that should have been controlled for that are biasing the sample.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1389903628.0,"Well, how you describe your characters is pretty telling. I think a lot of us would pause and say ""what the fuck?"" if the author suddenly, even though the thing is supposed to written in the third person, spend a truly uncomfortable amount of time on a male's character ""straining bulge"" and ""glistening pecs.""

Well, unless it's a bodice buster, then it's actually appropriate to spent a lot of time on someone's tits, ass, and crotch.

Anyways, it's bad writing. It begins to look more like ""this is how this author and his libido sees this character"" rather than ""this is how an objective third observer accurately could describe this character."""

professor__doom,Automate,1389903629.0,"The point is that automation can and does cause unemployment in a particular industry in the short term, but society has been better off in the long term 100% of the time.  I think historic lessons about something so fundamental are particularly valid, because the question at hand is a question of human behavior and human nature.  The human brain hasn't changed in a few hundred thousand years.  Our psychological reward structures, our fundamental desires, our responses to stimuli haven't changed either.

""Unemployment"" isn't the issue here at all.  What society needs to be concerned about is (a) underproduction and (b) the distribution of what is produced, and whether this distribution is fair, equitable, and meets the basic needs of everyone in society.

At the beginning of the 20th century, automation did something miraculous: with the Ford company leading the way, the work day was reduced from 9 hours to 8, and the work week was reduced from 6 days to 5.

This is, by definition, ""unemployment""--time spent not working.  

What do you enjoy doing on your own time?  Something tells me it isn't ""compiling spreadsheets,"" ""collating reports,"" ""plowing fields,"" or ""hammering rivets.""  It's probably traveling, spending time with family, playing sports, watching TV, browsing the internet, etc.

In the poorest countries--the ones with the least automation--everyone, from children to the elderly, works from sunrise to sunset.  They have to in order to survive.  Should this be our ideal?

Wouldn't it be awesome to work 30 hours per week instead of 40?  Wouldn't it be great to retire at 40?  This is the potential that automation offers.  "
wraith313,books,1389903631.0,"We lost a lot of people, but given out huge role in the war we didn't suffer *that* many losses. We had the least out of the major powers involved. In fact, places like Hungary (which nobody ever hears about when talking about the war) lost about 150k more people than we did. I think Greece lost almost as many as we did as well.

Germany lost something like 8.5 million, Japan 2 millionish. US lost 400kish.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties

I am always surprised that our losses weren't higher. When you see movies etc they make it seem like we were losing men right and left. Kinda makes me wonder how Germany even had enough men left to fight. The Soviet Union lost TWENTY EIGHT MILLION people. From what I have read, that is primarily because it was a ""fight the Germans or we will shoot you ourselves"" situation and they didn't even have supplies or ammunition for everyone."

The nearest I've heard is that the urine of a healthy animal is sterile, so, for example, if you need to clean out a small wound and have nothing else at hand, you can use your pee. 

However, I have also heard that though urine contains a small amount of ammonia, which may give it a bit of disinfectant capability, it is an excellent place for bacteria to grow, so you'd need it fresh-squeezed, so to speak.

The tables and cloths were already set up, so we went about putting all the decor and favors on the tables, setting up the gift table, etc.  If your linens are already irons, putting them on the tables shouldn't take long, and thus your time frame shouldn't be too far off from ours with the same number of people.

**We put all the decorations for each table in it's own box before hand** which saved us a TON of time.  It was so easy to know what goes on each table without having to ask the bride a million questions, and after the bride and groom had left, we were able to quickly pack up into all the boxes (admittedly not as neatly as they arrived).

**For my Oct 2014 wedding** We will have 2 hours to set up.  The tables will already be set up, but we'll have to put out our linens and chair covers/sashes, set up our homemade photobooth (thanks to my BFFs new husband), add our center pieces/table decor, and set up the gift table and such.  I plan to follow in my BFFs footsteps and pre-arrange everything before hand, and leave the boxes in the storage room for use packing up.  We'll have my SO and his 4 groomsmen, me and my 4BMs, 2 DOCs, their husbands, and family if needed.  I haven't decided who's doing what yet, but I'm not concerned.

SublethalDose,socialskills,1389903970.0,"&gt; they told us she was textbook case of 'gifted, but socially clueless'

Asperger's.  They told you Asperger's, right?  I'm assuming that because you mention Asperger's later.  Putting it the way you did really bothers me, because Asperger's is permanent, and being socially clueless is something she can improve over time.  People with Asperger's learn social skills in a different way, but they do learn.  Some people with Asperger's who have great difficulty as children learn to cope so well that by the time they're thirty they can even be hard for a professional to diagnose.  To give your child the best trajectory possible, I think you should focus on helping her learn to recognize other children's emotions and intentions.  The fact that you're clued in to her condition is a great first step; many kids with Asperger's are stuck with unhelpful advice from people who make incorrect assumptions about their abilities, such as overestimating their instinctive emotional awareness.  Just teach her like you would teach her anything else, but don't assume anything is obvious to her:

""So-and-so doesn't want to dance anymore.  Can you tell?  Do you know how I know that?""  If she gets that but still wants to bug her:  ""Okay, when someone tries to make you do something you don't want to do, how does that make you feel?""  And so on.  ""Daddy is tired and doesn't want to play.  Can you tell?  Okay, let me explain how to tell.""  Without knowing more about your daughter, I can't say how quickly she'll learn, but she needs to get in the habit of consciously thinking about it, whereas NT kids have more of a constant awareness that doesn't get turned on and off.  They can trust their instincts.  Your daughter needs to learn to think consciously.  It's harder, but compensating intellectually can be very effective, and people she meets twenty years from now might think she's entirely normal.

Okay, now, take a deep breath.  You have a real problem to deal with, but you're also starting to freak out over things that aren't problems.  Such as:

&gt; EVERYONE knew the damn steps except for me and my little Elaine. 

This is because they all learned the steps before, probably at some event just like that one.  Now your daughter is learning them, because you took her.  This is good.

&gt; She was awful. But she was also blissfully oblivious as to how bad she was...girl was having the time of her life.

She's eight.  This is the right time to feel that way.  Nobody feels shame about how much they sucked at dancing when they were eight.  The age of twelve is about the right time to feel so ashamed that you resolve never to dance again.

&gt; It was the first time it registered with me that dancing was a socially-expected norm. If you can dance, you can fit in. WTF. How did I never see this before?

Um, tons of kids get by without dancing?  They're called nerds.  Your daughter is one... like her mother before her.  It's not so unusual even for NT people.  Unless you have grand social ambitions for your daughter, don't worry about her not dancing.  If you do feel a sudden keen desire for her to be in the ""in"" crowd and date varsity athletes, you may be reprocessing your own adolescence.  Have a nice laugh about it and move on.

Good luck!

Defenestrationiste,confession,1389903982.0,"As a guy who is both diagnosed as Asperger's/HFA and as a mod of /r/aspergers , thank you kindly.  Most of us dislike fakers too because it subtracts from our ability to deal with the condition as well as our ability to interact with the rest of the world effectively due to a false image of what we really are and really aren't.  That's not to say that aspies aren't capable of being assholes either but assholes claiming to have our condition and using it as an excuse to not try to get along with others is something we find deeply offensive and counterproductive to our efforts to get on with our lives and be understood.  

For those who may not be familiar with Asperger's/High-Functioning Autism, this article is a relatively accurate (which some find debatable), quick n' dirty run-down of what Asperger's/HFA IS and IS NOT: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergerSyndrome  Even though it's not written with clinical language and relates to TV personalities, many of us find that it's very understandable for most and many of us agree with it's portrayal in this article.  Also be aware that Asperger's was recently reclassified as High-Functioning Autism in the latest DSM release.  There seems to be a fair amount of trolls going around screeching that Asperger's was ruled as not a real condition but they are incorrect, it was simply reclassified, despite that, some of us still like the term Aspie/Asperger's.. and this is a subject which has been in heavy debate by both Aspies and NTs as well as both laymen and professionals, as to whether or not it counts as a separate condition outside of the Autism Spectrum.

Snugglebuggle,AskWomen,1389904127.0,"1) First you decide to have kids. You have sex on the clock every day until it becomes mechanical. You do this for not just for one child but often two or more...This is the most sex you will have for the rest of your marriage.

2) Suddenly shes pregnant, hormonal, grumpy, pukey and expanding around her middle. She thinks she looks like a whale, you think shes beautiful but don't want to hurt her or the baby. You both avoid sex unless there is an itch to scratch.

3) Then you have crying babies who secrete copious amounts of fluid out of every hole and wake you up at all hours of the night. You take turns getting up in the night, feeding, burping, falling asleep in odd positions with baby on top of you. Whichever of you decides to continue working goes to work exhausted, works all day and comes home to relieve the haggard spouse who has been on the go all day trying to clean, cook, juggle baby, feed baby and sneak in 15 minute naps whenever the baby falls asleep. now its your turn until bed time. Rinse and repeat. Both of you feel gross, no one is in the mood to have sex and be reminded that it created the current problem.

4)Suddenly its time to go to daycare/school *phew*. Only they start bring home colds that run rampant between everyone in the house. They have homework as well as multiple after school activities. Add in housework, multiple jobs, bills and maybe...hopefully an independent hobby for yourself, and then finally you get to sleep. You guys chew on the idea that this isn't too bad, how about another baby? Your current child could really use a sibling right?

You start at the beginning again, this time you already have step 4 to juggle while you manage steps 1-3

Sex goes on the back-burner, its honestly the last thing on your mind when you're absolutely exhausted at the end of the day.

If people quite working on something, it will get boring, old and it will quit being fun any more. Any relationship takes work and a marriage is not different. 

I think people need to continue to date each other once they're married and make each other feel how they felt when they were first dating. A lack of this is what leads to the lack of sex. 

People get complacent and take each other for granted and life gets in the way, so you do less together and you just become like housemates rather than partners. People who have successful marriages and long sex lives make the effort to change this, which is why they experience the success.

""Look, it's fine, if you just flick a couple drops of water in the oil....""

""NO!  NEVER do that!  (patronizing tone) I guess you may not have written this down in your notes, but if you add water to hot oil, it will explode."" 

""Yeah, it's a really bad idea to pour water into oil.  My sister torched the curtains that way.  I agree, safety is very important. But seriously, watch, like two or three drops, and you can tell approximately..."" 

They both yanked me back bodily from the stove as I put two drops of water in from my dampened hand, then abandoned me to die as they dove behind the counter to crouch with their hands over their heads like I had taken the pin from a grenade.

1. No gap closer. Tresdin needs to be able to close the distance and get some ganks in. Your kill/assist count is pretty low for a 70 minute game. I would have considered picking up a blink dagger for the initiation (I wouldn't get a Shadow Blade with a Bounty Hunter on the board). The only problem with a blink is sometimes it can cause you to hop into unfavorable positions. You'd need some sort of defensive items...which brings us to....


2. BEE KAY BEE. BKB. Black King Bar. I know the urge to build damage is high, but other than Pudge's ult and the abyssal...they have nothing that can really stop you. The 7720 Dagon5 on Gondar is now worthless. Silencer and Invoker will cry. They have no real right click...almost everything they had was magic damage.

3. Bonus thing. Where's your support? You guys have a greedy lineup. Magnus shouldn't have built Bfury."
fnredditacct,changemyview,1389904291.0,"A couple questions:

Do you think people not on welfare actually vote with their nation's primary interest at heart and not their own? And is it actually bad if we are all selfish this way?  If we all vote with our primary interests in mind, doesn't that equate to what's best for the nation, the largest voting population's voice being the one that's heard?

Restricting voting in this way would get hairy. Who exactly would count as a 'working member of society?' Boiling down someone's contributions to income, or lack of income, restricts their value as a human being to that sole point. How much would you have to make? For how long? What if you get sick for a few years? Or stay at home with children? Or what about your community, state, or federal bank giving you a loan?  Until you pay it back you're in debt to society. You'd need very detailed laws to sort these things out. 

I think the gate would be open for special interest groups to try to restrict voting of other special interest groups. You'd just have to make a convincing case that the group takes more from society than they give.

If we are looking to reward people for getting off welfare, which I think there *is* definite value to, I'm not sure giving them back their vote is the best reward.  Many people don't vote anyway, or see it as a hassle, a chore, or think that their vote really doesn't matter one way or the other.

This is less a reward for getting off welfare and more a punishment for being on it in the first place."

superior22,summonerschool,1389904469.0,"Since you're already behind I'd probably skip the BT completely. Depends on your ADC though. BT is mostly a snowball item, IE is a late game item and BorK is a dueling-item. Since your enemy already forced you back several times you're obviously not going to snowball. Therefore, personally, I'd aim for that mid-late game to get the advantage back.

An ADC with his IE, PD, LW and Vamp. Scepter will do much more damage in team fights than the enemy ADC with his BT, PD, LW and B.F. Skipping your BT for an IE will save you some money and bring you back into the game once team fights come around unless your opponent snowballs like crazy.

But, again, that depends on your champion. On someone like Draven you always want a BT. But lets take Jinx for example. If I'm going 0-3 early I'll grab the Vamp. Scepter and opt for an early IE. I'm not going to win the lane anymore, therefore I don't need a snowball item like BT, and aim to be more useful in mid-late game team fights. You'll probably win most team fights (assuming everything goes well) because your enemy doesn't have his IE yet (since he went BT first) and lacks the damage output you'll provide for your team."

elseedubya,thesims,1389904581.0,"tl;dr: people were not having trouble with their games until the patch, and now their games aren't working - it's their right to bitch, and it's reasonable to assume the patch was to blame at least in part; if modders can fix these problems, EA can; developers are not the enemy, EA is; and the people in this sub *do* self-help - that's how you got around to bitching about all of this in the first place.  We do enjoy the game, we just can't do that if it doesn't work.

I was going to be snippy with you because of your comments in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1v92zm/the_latest_update_has_royally_screwed_over_the/cer3dyy?context=3) where this argument first arose, but I decided you might understand better if I took the civil approach.  I will warn you, however, that calling people ""dumb"" or ""idiots"" is a pretty terrible way to communicate your point.  It also tends to leave others with a poor impression of you, personally.  Just FYI.

Since you took so much time and apparent effort in explaining the game development and patch process to all of us ignorant folk, I will take this time to explain to you the layman's point of view.  Take me for example.  I have spent well over $1,000 in the past 15 years or so buying almost every single Sims related product EA has churned out.  I have spent even more money in the store buying content for the games I already own.  Whether the stuff pack comes with 25 new items or 12, I pay my $30 and I'm grateful.

But then when I spend a few months becoming emotionally attached to a simulated group of beings I created, thanks to these amazing tools I spent so much money on, and they all turn invisible - or the kids can't go to after school activities because they took a field trip once three seasons ago - or I can't build a house because the game crashes to desktop - or any of the myriad ways this game can go *kaput!* I feel my $1,000 has earned me the right to bitch about it to whoever cares to listen, and even a few who don't.

Add to that little drama the fact that the thing that most recently fucked your game was a thing the developers told you would *fix* minor problems (whether because it is an inherent problem in the patch or a perfect storm of mysterious factors that god himself could not fix in a patch) it creates a bit of ire.  

Now let me address a few things from your post here.

&gt;They can't figure out why it happens if they can't make it happen 90% of the time. All patches provide fixes for things that are recreatable almost 100% of the time on any computer.

If you can't make a product that works, you shouldn't sell it.  If your product is not ready by release date, you shouldn't sell it.  If you have not tested your product long enough to catch some of these bugs (just play the game like anybody else around here and you'll find some) you shouldn't put it on the market in the first place.  And if you put it out there anyway, expect backlash.  I am absolutely positive, in any event, that EA can afford to pay for a full team just to sit there and find bugs and fix the ones they can.  If they can't fix it, they need to publish an official guide of warnings and workarounds - don't just let your community fix the problems for you.  How many threads have you seen around here touting NRaas mods or talking about ""must-have"" mods just to make Story Progression work as it was advertised?  If people doing this as a hobby at home can do it, I'm pretty sure Big Bad EA can.

&gt;The people who made this game spent thousands and thousands of hours working on it. They didn't create any bugs intentionally. They didn't break anything for you intentionally.

We know the difference between the people who made the game through hours of labor and the massive corporation (hey, hey, they're people too!) that exploits all of their hard work for a quick buck.  I'm sure there are people working for EA who hate to hear how much the company sucks, just like people who work at Wal-Mart or McDonalds.  But our beef is not with them.  It's with the company policy to push games out before they're ready, before they've been thoroughly tested, and without any concern for what a pain in the ass this might be to fix in the near future.  The policies are the problem, not the people, and I think everyone here understands that.  The people who make the game are the creative ones who come up with the stuff we love to play with - the policies are what dictate how much time they can dedicate to getting it *right.*  And as far as how those people might feel about what random strangers say on the internet regarding their hard work, I'm pretty sure they'll get over it.  Just like we know they're not the ones who would intentionally fuck up the game, they know we don't really think they would do that to us.

&gt;It takes work on the user's end to solve problems, too.

The reason you see so many threads about patches or other problems ruining games and ""ohmigodwhatdoido?!"" is because (a) there are that many bugs and problems occurring, (b) these same problems occur so often that you might expect people on this forum to be familiar with how they start and how to fix them and (c) **people are trying to fix the problem themselves.**  We *do* share tips such as ""did you try uninstalling/reinstalling in this order?"" ""do you have any mods or cc of any kind?"" ""have you tried X mod to fix what EA won't?""  

And then in some of those threads, we make little ironic biting jokes about there being a corporate conspiracy to break your game so you have to buy the new one, because let's be honest here, wouldn't that be in EA's best interest?  It's no reason to call anyone stupid or get in a tizzy.  And in all honesty, it's not unreasonable to assume that if there was an auto-destroy bug incorporated into the patch (the obvious probability is that there is none) that EA would benefit greatly from it and would be reluctant to fix the problem before the new title came out.  That's just business.  It's bad business, but that hasn't lost EA any money yet.  Sure, it probably didn't go down like that, but the joke was only funny to about a half-dozen redditors because it was at least plausible.

pathein_mathein,AskMenOver30,1389904665.0,"Yeah, but I got better.

80% of the time, burnout is that feeling of existential angst about whether one truly is experiencing the feeling of being alive. It's gotten worse in recent years because our ancestors tended to have more ""fixed stars"" over work, family, spirituality, and community. That more of us suffer from it at some point is, arguably, a good thing, and a negative consequence of what are overall positive things.

20% of the time it's just people being lazy.

One of those ""negative positives"" about it is that we've expected something like passion or work satisfaction to be an occupational goal. Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life. I think sometimes that this misses the point, to the extent that something like a positive and fun work environment is shown to be quite beneficial.

Of course, this is where it gets complicated.

Of that 80%, people fall into at least three categories - A) those who have a passion and can work it, B) those who have an unworkable passion, and C) those who do not have a passion. I cannot even begin to speculate as to the split there, so I just assume it to be in even thirds. There's a focus on the As, and for good reason. Someone who does their work with passion does it better, works harder, and provides more than someone who does not. So it's a little tragic when the person with a passion for engineering is flipping burgers or writing poetry or doing anything else for a living. Depending on the profession, people historically have run into this sort of problem, and these are the people for whom the fixed stars of the past served the least.

But the Bs and the Cs aren't necessarily served well by the mythology. Again, I've no way of guessing numbers, but I really do think that there are some people who have what amounts to occupational passions that are either irrelevant (the best augury thrower), unsuitable (a passion for acting without any of the talent), or difficult to monetize and so difficult to focus on exclusively (which, it must be noted, that some *do* find ways to monetize, but it's not a sure thing). And I really do think that there are those people who have no passions, or diffuse ones, or, in a somewhat dreamy fashion that I nevertheless also think may be true, for things that don't exist yet, or that they can't get contact with.

You can focus on skills and look for the octagonal peg to fit the round peg of a B's skill set, but I feel that, at some point, some people, hit a wall if you're looking for a unity of work and love. Running against that wall, and expecting it to give, leads to burnout. Bs &amp; Cs keep looking at the A's more or less bouncing joyously against the wall like a vertical trampoline in gibbering laughter, and get even more burned out and frustrated as not only jealousy increases, but that the brick doesn't even begin to give.

The thing, I think, is that Bs and Cs need to realize they're not As, and they have to find that way some other way. And I'll say it again, if you're actually an A, you need to go off and do that thing because you're always going to be feeling the wall otherwise. Bs get the satisfaction of whatever else they're doing that they do have a passion for, they just need to make sure that their ""day job"" can accommodate it or (in the particular instance of people with an expensive passion for instance) that they make occupation choices to get them out of it.

The way that the focus on the As is particularly detrimental is that there's nothing stopping the Bs and Cs from finding some sort of work satisfaction, even if they have to more or less make up what's satisfying about work on their own. Doing something, and doing it more or less well is a form of satisfaction on its own. You're not going to make your wall bounce, but you might be able to have some fun breaking out the parkour.

I consider myself a B or a C. And things got very dire for me in that burnout and stress sense. But at some point, I decided to stop giving a fuck. Not about the job, but about the burnout. Yes, there's the stress, the annoyance, the general distaste of what's going on, the lack of faith, the sense of futility, the pain of that weird sense of not fitting in - but I think that, again, unless you have that thing that you feel you must do, there's virtue in resigning yourself to your current course and looking for ways to find satisfaction in what you're doing. And basically it took me stopping to think what I actually found satisfying, and remembering to focus on those points when I needed to. It's just not that bad most of the time, for most of us (who are on Reddit at any rate).

It takes a considerable amount of doing to figure out those points, sometimes, but it's entirely worth it."

With more understanding of who and what we are as individuals, there is a lot less stress and trouble when blending with the rest of society.  We tend to get treated badly a lot because we are considered rather odd by most standards, get bullied a lot, and that can break our heads and makes us 'go bad' as it were, and take on damage in the form of depression, PTSD, self-destructive/self-neglecting tendencies, antisocial tendencies, etc., the same as most any other individual who has gone through some serious shit.  Many of us also don't tend to be affected by or express the damage from the above conditions in the same way as those with more standard neurological wiring, which makes diagnosis and treatment harder for professionals who aren't ASD-literate."

Just because someone looks like you, don't assume they had the same or similar life as you. Just because it doesn't offend you, doesn't mean it isn't offensive to a lot of people out there. It's better to protect the minority and be safe (at little cost for those who are not affected/offended) than to mandate that those offended should ""buck up"" and stop being so overly sensitive.

One of them said 8"" (20.32cm), I mean, no one is going to measure that precisely in cm, so my conclusion is that they measured inch and converted to cm.

1. Use phrases that are not necessarily negative, but convey a message. ""He is a person of strengths and weaknesses.""

2. When someone you wouldn't recommend leaves, tell them you wouldn't recommend they use you as a reference. Then you can tell the new company ""I told him it not to use me as a reference."" Or ""It is company policy to not give references for employees that don't give two weeks notice."" 

3. The always important: ""Would you hire him back?"" One time, a now retired office manager answered this question with a resounding ""Oh, HELL NO."" Still the naughtiest word I ever heard her say in my years of knowing her."

NotAPimecone,BDSMcommunity,1389905535.0,"The most simple ice release I know of involves a sock with ice in it fed through a ring. the sock can't be pulled through the ring until the ice melts. 

I used to use locking leather cuffs to bind myself without being able to escape, and usually I or my keys were tethered out of reach by this type of mechanism. 

One of my favorite scenarios was to use a rope ratchet (rope can only be pulled through one way) attached to an ice-sock release, attached to nipple clamps. I'd bind myself using the cuffs so I couldn't reach the clamps to get them off my nipples, then pull on the hanging end of the one-way rope ratchet to pull myself up on my tiptoes and force myself to stay there until the ice melted. Legs get tired, but lowering results in yanked nipples.  At that point, though still bound, I would be able to move over to the countertop a couple of feet away, reach my keys, and release the cuffs. Extra fun was had by involving a ball gag and a butt plug lubed with BenGay. 

I also used to use the ice-sock on my old wood-frame futon couch. I'd attach the ice/sock release to my cuffs and a rope ratchet attached to the bottom/back of the couch, and I had a cheap eletrosex power box and an electro cock ring and butt plug, so I'd wire all that up and then tie my legs spread to the arms of the futon. I'd crank up the electricity nice and high, then, pulled the free end of the rope ratchet until my hands were trapped above/behind my head. Stuck, unable to get away or turn down the juice until the ice melted. 

For the truly daring...

I used to trap myself, bound and naked, outside. I had figured out that a piece of tape could be used to lock my apartment suite deadbolt without my having the key. So I would take my suite key and building key and hide them somewhere outside, then return to my suite, undress, tie up in locking cuffs (ankles hobbled about a foot apart made this extra exciting), leave the suite, and pull the tape to lock the door behind me. At that point I had no option but to venture out to retrieve my key, and even then, it was only the building and suite keys, I'd leave the cuff keys inside the suite so I had to go all the way back still bound. Usually did this plugged and gagged too.

Brightt,Guildwars2,1389905595.0,"Look, as someone who was active in the record scene in GW1, I can tell you, never, ever, use an example of a record kill/run to portray reality. Those &lt;15s lupi kills use highly specialized tactics and builds that are simply not representative. Most of our casual Arah runs don't even use mesmer at all, and most lupi kills are 45s-1m20 ish depending on how well the Wall of Reflection works and some other factors. I simply cannot take you seriously if you keep referring to a record-time lupi kill to make a point, because you obviously completely miss it.

Actually, it is indeed the people that refuse to run zerker setups that cause the deaths of their team mates, because they are the ones prolonging the fights. Not the zerkers. Also, those zerker 'noobs' probably did more damage before they died than the people that were actually alive. I know of someone in the guild that would join PUG arah runs, just for the fun of it on his warrior, and he would use his zerker setup for lupicus. He said that when with PUGs, the time it took to kill lupi was very close to the time it would take him to solo lupi, and sometimes it took even longer because some of them suck at dodging in phase 3, causing him to heal up. So, those 4 extra people would actually do very negligible damage in comparison to the lone zerker that stays alive.

Also, if Arah is so easy in a full zerker team, why then do so many PUGs still suck at it?"

sgt0pimienta,StarWars,1389905671.0,"This is a sort of wishlist of what I'd love to see in the game:

1. Multilayered combat, where space and ground objectives are both important and both **depend on each other** for example, you can use orbital bombing strikes until the Ion cannon is destroyed, but you can't assault that huge base without the help of orbital strikes.

 If they added something like this it would add such a level of depth and strategy to fights that battlefront would become my favorite online fps.

2. HD graphics and sounds, which are sure to come and have me very excited.

3. Extremely cannonic weapons, vehicles, characters/armor and maps, I'd accept some fixes here or there such as putting a medal on the rebel uniform or putting some slight details like warning signs at the feet of AT-AT's or starship engines, but I'd hate to see something like ""We didn't like the a-wing so much, so we made it longer and added a second seat""

4. Remastered sounds that stay true to the original sounds, I'd love to hear better sounds for the tie starship engines, or remastered blaster sounds and explosions, but I'd hate something like ""We felt it didn't have much impact, so we made it sound more like a gunpowder gun""

5. Finally, please NO progression system or customization, these sort of mechanics make it so that new players have a harder time and having a pink/green clantagged AT-ST walker on endor really breaks immersion. New, shiny, mysterious, achievment based, anti cannon storm trooper armors are definitely not in the list of things I'd like to see in this game, oh, and definitely no micro transactions, I'd avoid dlc as well but that's way more acceptable.

 If customization and progression systems were absolutely necessary to ""hook gamers"" or some stuff like that, I'd make it so that everything is kept striclty cannon and in the star wars universe, not funky paint jobs for vehicles and no golden guns or anything like that, also if there was an unlock system, I'd make it so that it would be very, VERY balanced, giving no unfair advantages to players who have played for years, ruining new player's experiences. If they REALLY wanted to do it so that you can play as very advanced units that no one has access to, I'd make it so that it worked like heroes in the original game, you know, you unlock it after a considerable ammount of points, you only use it for a while, you do get to enjoy it but you don't permanently keep it, unless you are good enough to mantain it.

6. Oh, and if lightsaber combat was improoved (*cough* *cough* JEDI OUTCAST *cough* *cough* best system ever) I'd love it, but I see it as an extra, not necessary to keep the game up and running, but I'm sure they will improove it regardless."

As far as your metallic taste. It could be few things that are causing that but I usually get a metallic taste if I dry burn my coil inside the head. I like to get all my torching/ohm checking out of the way first then put it in the head and vape. Oil from your fingers wouldn't produce a metal taste, only a metal object would(ie coil.)

It is true that women are valued, in an evolutionary biological sense because they are women, because they carry the children.  It is the responsibility of the male of a species to attract a woman to him (this is any species) and not the other way around.  That is why women, in the evolutionary sense have inherent value.  Just think about it for a damn second before you get all ignorant in your reply.

As for the second passage, you actually QUOTED me as saying women tend to be more empathetic.  And yet you reply to me and put words in my mouth that I said men are devoid of empathy...

one thing you might try is to give him examples of hetero couples with large age gaps. (the problem with most is that the younger person is seen as a ""gold digger"" because normally the older person is wealthy.) some examples: Hugh Hefner. Tony Randall (who married a woman 50 years younger and had 2 children with her. i wish i could think of examples of gay relationships but none occur to me off-hand.

the real issue is that gerontophillia is not common even in hetero relationships, and when you add in the same-sex aspect, it becomes even more rare. you are going to run into this as long as there is a large age gap between you and your lovers, so you might have to get used to it, sorry to say.

i would say this, however. if he continues to be rude and hurtful, call him out on it. if he is really your friend, he will be supportive of you and your love, whether he agrees or understands it. best of luck to you."

from your comments i have gathered that you are only comfortable dropping a subject under three sets of circumstances:

1.  person accepts you are correct.
2.  person provides steadfast counterexample to your logic.
3.  person admits they are inadequate at communication.

this is pretty self-centered behavior because all of these scenarios rest on what another person owes you in exchange for your advice.  if it perpetually bothers you that someone does not meet the conditions under which you like to give advice you might want to reconsider how much advice you're giving.  you don't HAVE to give someone advice even when they ask for it if the process of acknowledging another's point of view is such a challenge for you when they can't spell it out in terms you understand."

dakru,AskMen,1389905843.0,"&gt; TL;DR: Kindness is just one piece of the pie in overall attraction, not all of it.

Yes, kindness can contribute to a man's desirability as a partner. The problem I see is that women in general focus on kindness way too much when talking about what they want in a partner and when giving advice to men on how to get a partner, and this misleads men about just how high up in importance kindness is. Again, kindness is not itself a negative and indeed it is a positive, but kindness rarely makes up for a lack of excitement, for example. Or a lack of confidence, or a lack of charisma, or a lack of being able to stand up for yourself.

I've met guys before and thought ""wow, he's charismatic, I bet he does well with women"" or ""wow, he's good-looking, I bet he does well with women"". I've never met a guy and thought ""wow, he's kind, I bet he does well with women"". It's a good trait to have but it's far from the most important trait.

It's like if a woman grew up and 80-90% of the dating advice she got was from men telling her how they ""just want a girl who's interested in sports"" (the parallel to ""I just want a nice guy""). If she wasn't doing as well with men as she wanted, it would make sense for her to emphasize her interest in sports when interacting with men because that's what she's been made to believe is very important for a woman's desirability as a partner. It probably wouldn't do all that much good, though, especially if she focuses on her interest in sports to the detriment of more important things (the parallel of men focusing on their kindness to the detriment of their ability to stand up for themselves, for example).

What we need to do is better educate men on what they can do to do better with women. When men hear so often how women ""just want a nice guy"", no one should be surprised when they end up with the idea that niceness is the most important factor in a man's desirability as a partner and that being nice itself will make women want them."

Well, even though sadness sucks, at least you're feeling something. If your friends don't take you seriously, you shouldn't try to talk to them. Apparently they don't understand the severity of depression. ~~Did you consider a psychologist? An expert is probably the best approach right now~~
Sorry, you already said you did. 

What about family? Is there anyone you trust or to whom you could talk? Probably someone who went through something similar, they are mostly the most understanding.
However, don't give up. Don't depression win. 

You need to forget this relationship. We both know this isn't that easy but I'd suggest you spend some time with your friends. Even though they may not take your medical condition seriously, they sure will distract you from it. One big problem with depression is that is especially hunts you down when you are alone, vulnerable and thinking about yourself and your life. Try to avoid this!

If there was a system in place that prevented tanking, I would be all for it. I feel that it is bad for the game to have teams that are making moves in order to be worse. "

obsidianechoes,3Dprinting,1389906296.0,"&gt; any ideas on how to boost the competitive ""Thunderdome"" aspect of this endeavor?

I think we first have to admit that 3D printing is not an even playing field.  The more time and money you sink into your printer, the better your results (generally).  It also looks like these contests are geared exclusively to those with FDM printers which is fine since that's what most people here own (though some will have to sit out).

*I think contests based around creativity and ingenuity stand a much better chance of engaging people* rather than contests that tie up your machine for days at a time and cost you spools of plastic.

The reason people compete is because they have the *aptitude*, *equipment*, *time* and feel they stand a *chance at winning*.

**Aptitude and Equipment:**  Any contest that comes down to how perfectly a machine prints provides no incentive for beginners or those who can't afford a more accurate machine (I would argue that already covers a large percentage of this sub).

**Time:**  I'm going to generalize here but from what I've seen, most people in this sub are either engineers or those with a science and technology background.  To get into the 3D printing game early also demonstrates drive and passion.  These people tend to have no problem keeping busy so they choose to not participate because of the time required.

**Chance of winning:**  Right now, the odds are pretty good due to low participation.  But in the case of this particular contest, unless you can guarantee winning first prize, you take a real gamble at coming out ahead.  Other rewards of winning include ""proving yourself"" and demonstrating your abilities.  But a size contest doesn't really test one's intrinsic abilities so much as the equipment and time they have.  It makes the victory far less personally satisfying.

I don't have the answer to make these competitions a ""thunderdome"" but creativity has to play a part.  I also think challenges that focus on improving current technology could be a really interesting thing to try.  Find a really common problem many users are having (say, bed adhesion or changing filament mid-print), make up a controlled ""torture test"" (say, a model with little bed contact geometry) and offer a worthwhile cash prize for the best solution (factoring in cost, versatility, adaptability to other printer designs, etc.).  That may not be the best example but at least it allows people to think laterally about the problem and try new things.  This type of challenge could also provide a positive benefit to the community while allowing industry partnership.  Personally, if I was a printer manufacturing company and I cared about helping the community, I would offer some serious cash incentives for fixing common printer design and printing issues.

what_the_whale,MakeupAddiction,1389906435.0,"&gt; /u/freethis was directly saying how this guy probably was not misogynistic, but rather made a thoughtless comment.

And yet called it a 'microaggression,' mischaracterizing non-aggression as aggression, ascribing intent, and thus misplacing responsibility. My point is that the ideology encompassing and resulting from the concept of the microaggression is absolutely fucked. 

The rest of your comment is barely relevant due to its extremely condescending, highly solipsistic, holier-than-thou, hypocritical nature. 

&gt; You wouldn't call it coddling if you realized how different someone's world is compared to yours.  Not saying you have it harder or easier; I don't know your life like you do. 

This is comically hypocritical. You know the present state of my life well enough to tell me that *that* is the source of our ideological disagreements (talk about a red herring), rather than my reasoning or knowledge; oh, but you're not claiming anything about the state of my life or experience. Except you are. 

&gt; I'm just cautioning you to remember how other people might feel, not how you feel.

What about what I *think*? Can I caution you to remember that the subjective is not the only relevant thing, that what people *think* matters, that *reality* matters, that *ethics* matter, that it's important to be *reasonable* in attributing blame for offenses, or will that slip right under your floating cushion and elude you?

I don't think I've ever seen a comment so stuffed full of shit as this one. It's amazing, it really is. You've managed to swaddle an ad hominem in so many pseudo-wisened statements of the obvious, in so much false authority and phony empathy, you probably can't even see it yourself. You're just above it all, right? What a joke.

I wasn't aware that some spots in Brooklyn were going for as much, but I know Park Slope is getting pricey. (Gorgeous area btw!)

Really, my thoughts are that men are rarely subjected to this sort of sexualisation, other than on Mills &amp; Boons covers, where women are also being sexualised, usually. So to put even more sexualisation on an intelligent female character who is described enough in the books as attractive as hell, who is already said to be attracted to Kvothe (like all the other females), seems a tad unnecessary, and probably ill-advised."

(Working title, bear with me)

I've had this friend Gil since I was like, almost 13 or so.  I call him love-of-my-life-Gil because well obviously.  But as much as I am reckless, he was *reckless*.  When we were 16, he drove me down to Florida in the back of a beat up white van that had ""Free Candy Van"" scratched into it.  The tail lights didn't work.  I would definitely kidnap someone in it.

On our very first night there, we went to some redneck party where Gil got 11 kinds of intoxicated and then in a fight and then we had to leave.  He asked me if I could drive.  Welllllll I could certainly drive better than him, but I didn't have a license, and learner's permits are only good in the state they're issued in so... no? But something in his glazed over, vacant eyes and whiskey breath told me to man up and take the keys.

Obviously got pulled over like 5 minutes later.  Seriously, that van.  That van.

I started crying you know, as soon as the police lights were on.  And the officer seemed really sorry about my situation after a quick chat with my passenger.  He told me it would be fine and just let me keep driving (?).

Apparently ""fine"" means ""I told Massachusetts on you, and they are an extremely disappointed mother sitting up at the kitchen table for you all night"" because when I got home, sternest letter in the world.  It said I was going to have to take some kind of class to remedy the situation.

lawrencethomas3,conspiratard,1389906738.0,"If you had absolutely no immune system and didn't live in an absolutely sterile environment, you wouldn't last a week.

The more severe primary immunodeficiency disorders can act like no immune system. They are mostly genetic disorders and can leave a person essentially without an immune system because it doesn't function properly -- however, they have a variety of severity and treatments. 

For example, probably the worst is SCID (Severe combined immunodeficiency) which basically forces those who manage to survive it to live in sterile environments for the rest of their lives or undergo painful and/or experimental procedures to correct the problem.

As gene therapy continues to grow as a treatment basis, these types of disorders are likely to become non-issues.  But its not quite there yet.


Also, advanced and untreated AIDS can act a lot like no immune system, although technically they still do have one.

Not only do you have a conceptual hook to [St. Crispin's Day](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/henryv/henryv.4.3.html) Speech out of *Henry V*, which I'm pretty sure has occasionally caused sworn pacifists to reconsider, itself framed in the context of ""man, if more of those lazy guys at home had signed up,"" you get not only the historical context of the British fighting overseas in France (if you sort of blur the details a bit) but that core connection not only to the Henriad in general, which you could argue is the most essentially English of the plays, as well as the connection to Shakespeare and all the glories of English literary culture, but the whole thing is framed in victory. This is a peaceable domestic post-war scene. We've already won, don't you see. It's not so much that we need your help, it's that you need this opportunity.

It's as much for people other than prospective conscripts for that very reason. It both presents the victory as a fait accompli for them, and in the sense that it's the daughter asking, provides *them* the script to use now. ""What are you going to say to my grandchildren, dear son?"" Including both the son and the daughter is brilliant, because they serve as sort of stand-ins for motives. Is it glory or is it duty? Are you going to be ashamed to tell your son you did nothing when he's lauding soldiers, or are you going to be ashamed to tell your daughter when she wants to know how you protected her? 

And that last bit of composition, the look on the guy's face, directly to viewer, inquisitive, thoughtful. It's just blank enough of an expression that you take what you want to it. Is he trying to come up with a rationalization, like you're rationalizing your own non-involvement? Is he trying to express his wartime duty in a thoughtful way to a young child? It's all potential energy.

No, the pistols (which used the release aiming) were fine. But have you tried aiming automatic rifles without firing? See those work like this: lightly (VERY, VERY lightly) press the button to aim, press down harder to shoot. It was really difficult to bring up your weapon without pressing too hard and accidentally firing it. MGS3 had a much more lenient 'sweet spot' for aiming automatic rifles without firing."

Vomiting_Winter,magicTCG,1389907062.0,"Modern Masters limited print run created more demand than it did supply, leading to price gouging by stores and an increase in the prices of many cards.  Modern Masters was a huge success in terms of creating interest in Modern, but a huge failure in terms of making it easier to play the format.  If you consider making Bobs and Goyfs cost $20-$40 each 'crashing the market', then the market has been crashed for years, until very recently.

Legacy Legends is prohibited by the outdated reserved list, the irrelevant promise WoTC made over a decade ago to not reprint more of certain cards.  Of course, not every Legacy staple is included, but they opted to pursue modern instead of legacy, so they could control card prices with reprints; thus creating the irony which is Modern.

I'm not advocating a crash in the market, I just think that it's foolish for prices to be this high, when they were at such a lower cost just a few years ago; these reasonable prices and fun of the game is what created the massive influx of competitive players Magic has experienced recently.  The demand has increased dramatically, but WoTC has refused to significantly increase the supply. "

*And yet its being called a 'microaggression,' mischaracterizing non-aggression as aggression, ascribing intent, and thus misplacing responsibility. My point is that the ideology encompassing and resulting from the concept of the microaggression is absolutely fucked.*

&gt; If I came across as condescending, solipsistic, or holier-than-thou, I am nothing but apologetic my tone came out that way. It's hard to place tone across typing. 

Oh, forget about tone police. I'm not policing your tone. If you can't understand how condescending your *words* have been, this conversation is pointless. Gee, people are different and their intent is relevant *and* isn't easily defined or categorized by anyone but themselves? I had no goddamn idea! It's only the basis of why I think the ideology of the microaggression is absolute bullshit in the first place.

jareths_tight_pants,AskWomen,1389907294.0,"I think that the difference is in how much time you spend together. When you're dating and not living together you go out on dates, then sometimes have sex. It gets pretty regular and since you only spend so much time together you try to cram in as much sexy time as you can since in a day or two you'll need to go back to work/school. When you start living together you spend a lot more of your time together. Suddenly there's no need to get your ""fix"" before reality because now you both have access to each other whenever you want. It goes from having sex 50% of the time that you're together to 10%, not necessarily because you have less sex but because you just spend so much more time together now. I don't think that marriage changes your sex life so much as cohabiting."

The problem is you can't do that twice or it gets ridiculous, which is where Dead Space 3 comes in.

He's not okay with that and is acting extremely jealous. It's not that I want to break up with him, I just think at this point in our relationship we should make it open so we can be absolutely certain that we are meant for each other. He just refuses to understand, he's such an asshole!"" 9 times out of 10, they'll also conveniently leave out the fact that she already has a guy lined up that she really wants to fuck. 

Ironically, I've found that most women have gone through this. But they always think that their situation is unique and special that requires exception. Most women don't do this. And when they do, you just don't understand her perspective which made the situation unique. They fail to realize, ""No, we get it. Most girls are like this. Get over it."""

GSP's really intense, supposedly he's still fully training, and I can see him getting mad over the UFC not **forcing** Johnny to do the tests which is silly because if you listen to the Post Fight Confrence from last night, ***everyone***  on the big cards get tested and they seem to catch a guy every time. Could Johnny have cycled off? Yeah, personally I think he's hiding something, he said he was walking around over 205 [cant remember if it was 215 or 225] which is A LOT of fucking weight to cut, but we dont know.

Should the UFC have backed GSP up and start implementing more drug testing? Yeah I think so. Although, I really think GSP blew it way out of proportion and should have told Dana [if that is on of the big reasons he left] when they met after 167. I think that if they did we would have a crazy amount of testing going on for everyone, which is great! I think everyone should be tested throughout their camp, immediately before and immediately after a fight. 

TL;DR - Dont see all the Dana hate, nothing he said was bad [in my view], Yes UFC should be testing more but I think GSP makes some great points but needs to cool off a bit

JedLeland,startrek,1389907494.0,"Garak is by far my favorite character on the show and possibly in the entire franchise.  I don't agree that he was underutilized; if anything, I almost wish they'd scaled him back since he was so deliciously enigmatic in his early appearances. I can't say that the more was revealed about him the less interesting he became if for no other reason than Andrew Robinson's uniformly magnificent portrayal, but that early air of mystery in which the character shrouded himself was truly something special."

MeghanAM,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1389907502.0,"**Meghan's French Lover**

I went to Arles, France for a summer in college, because I was a French major. Arles, if you don't know it, is a smallish city in Provencal France, and is the scene of a number of Van Gogh paintings like Cafe Terrace at Night. 

We were supposed to stay in dorms and I think we were probably actually required to do so, but I didn't want to spend my whole summer in France hanging out with Americans so I looked on the couch surfing site until I found a guy who was willing to let me sublet his couch. 

In a rare moment of caution, I decide that it's best that we meet in a public place. And I don't know where the hell I am, so I picked the... I wanna look this up because I think I'm blending two names together, but just one of the benches near place du forum, appropriate scene of said famous painting. 

Dude shows up, fabulous curly hair that's longer than mine and some Orangina. He's Florian. Says if I'm going to live in France, I should learn and love it (I do). Insists I must be Canadian because my French is actually good. Flirts a little but not enough to make me feel unsafe. And we go to the apartment. Just a normal apartment, kinda small but only by my too-used-to-America tastes. Does in fact have a couch. Sold. I give him a week's ""rent"" and leave to go buy school stuff. 

When I come back, he says he should show me the best restaurant in the city. Sounds good. We eat at a little dark restaurant that looks like a house. I eat duck for the first time in my life. It's divine. I get kinda drunk on cheap but French wine and his low grumbly accent. 

It's only like 8pm so we go to a bar that us full of Barcelona football fans. I dance with strangers, and with him. He says I should call him Flo. I say I can't do that if I want to be attracted to him. I don't think he caught that, but laughed anyways. We kiss. Barcelona football fans think we're newlyweds and we go with it, they buy us champagne. 

The bed's comfier than the couch anyways. 

**summary: best way to study a language is on a pillow, Flo isn't a sexy name though **
