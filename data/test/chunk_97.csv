My friend was telling me how her most recent lover was (still is) a female to male trans gender person (I'm sorry I don't know if that's the right term) who got as far as getting their facial features changed but kept their breasts because they figured they were a part of who they are.

Anyway, apparently they copped it the worst from the lesbian community in London. The straight community were reasonably supporting and accepting of the choices made, but in her (my friend's) experience it was the lesbians who were the least accepting of her ex's gender choices.

gh0stfl0wers,AskReddit,1391141774.0,"Don't consume any mind-altering substances when driving, for that matter. I know a lot of people who are totally against drunk driving, but have no problem smoking a blunt while behind the wheel. Nope. Don't do it. You need to be at your absolute fullest attention when you are operating a motor vehicle. You are putting too many people into danger. 

And I am saying this as someone who is totally pro legalization. Weed is great and people should be allowed to smoke it responsibly. Just don't drive while you're high.

Edit: A lot of people are like ""but caffeine lololol"", so I'm going to add this here. This is from one of my responses and kinda clarifies a bit more what I mean.

When someone says dont drink and drive, it's implied that they mean ""don't drink to the point that your cognitive skills and reaction time are even the slightest bit negatively impaired if you plan on driving"".

This applies to everything. Have your cup of coffee in the morning to wake you up, that's absolutely fine. But don't drink so much coffee that you get so jittery that it impairs your ability to react safely and quickly. I drink a lot of coffee, trust me, this is a thing.

Have a regular amount of food, but don't eat so much that you're about to go into food coma.

Get some sleep. Don't drive when you're sleep deprived.

Etc. etc. etc.

Your cognitive skills need to be at their very best when you are driving, and your attention needs to stay on the road. If this was something where you are the only person in danger, fine, do your thing. But you are putting so many other people in danger and that is not fair.

Yes, texting and driving is also really really incredibly stupid guys. I don't understand how this became a thing.

Edit 2: If your response to this is going to be ""I drove drunk/stoned/sleep deprived once an it was okay!"", please spare me your comment. Also, FYI, by driving significantly slower than the speed limit you are also putting people in danger by encouraging other drivers to pass you. If they are getting impatient they might try passing when conditions to do so aren't ideal. Yeah, it's partially their fault for not being careful, but if you weren't there driving significantly slower than you should be driving, they would not be passing you."

lendrick,anime,1391141787.0,"It sounds like he's complaining that anime is *made* by otaku, rather than just *watched* by otaku.

And to be honest, I think there's something to it.  The way people act in anime is governed more by tropes than by observation of real people.  I mean, think about it.  How many ""tsunderes"" do you know in real life?  Maybe one?  I've never met one myself.  How many ""kuuderes""?  Probably none.  It only makes sense to compare those character to other anime characters, because there's no analogue in real life.

Even the more true-to-life tropes have a tendency to dominate characters more than they do real people

Think about it.  In a lot of popular anime (particularly moe stuff), you can pidgeonhole most of the characters into an archetype, or in some cases a *twist* on an archetype.  And sure, there are some people in real life who you can give an archetype to, but by and large even those people won't fit it all that well, because real people tend to be more complicated than that

Don't get me wrong.  I'm a big fan of anime myself.  I love moe shows.  The formulas work for me.  The fact that moe shows tend to be full of references to *other* moe shows works for me, for whatever reason.  But on the other hand, the truly stand out shows are the ones where the characters act like real people (and yes, there are some moe shows where this is the case, although they're comparatively rare).

Take something like Stand Alone Complex.  Sure, there are character tropes, but the characters aren't *dominated* by those tropes.  There isn't that temptation to label all of the characters, because they just don't categorize that well, and that is a sign of good characterization.  Contrast that with, say, your average harem show, and there's just no comparison.

Anyway, point is, a lot of anime really is just made by anime geeks for anime geeks.  In absence of known anime tropes, it would just seem really weird and nonsensical; whether you can understand the plot rests very heavily on how much similar anime you've seen in the past.  It doesn't really stand on its own, and I can see where that might bother someone like Miyazaki."

these aren't opinions. they are *factually fucking wrong* statements. they are ignorant, or delusional. rap has been commercialized for *a long ass time* and your denial of that fact is some horrendously retarded, ill-informed backpacker shit.

&gt;In fact, when you come at people like that, it makes YOU look like those things. Your condescending tone just makes you look like an asshole.

who cares? you're spreading around some really, really fucking terrible misinformation. I don't care if my tone makes me sound like a jerk, you're spewing bullshit out your mouth.

&gt;I'm willing to bet I know more about hip hop, music, and music theory than you but I'm not gonna immediately attack you with some superiority complex.

the fact that you don't understand the influence/importance of people like Lil Wayne and Rick Ross, and that you think rap has been ""ruined"" by commercialism and pop influence is enough evidence to prove that you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to hip-hop.

I know a shit ton about music. I play guitar and blues harmonica. I've studied the history of music for hours on end. My favorite genres are blues and folk music. Asserting that you ""probably know more about music and music theory"" than me based on **absolutely no information** only makes *you* look like the one with a superiority complex.

&gt;Fucking obviously commercialism is going to be a part of ANYTHING that's not underground, the question is to what degree.

I guess [being decked out completely in brand names](http://discoscratch.pbworks.com/f/1271328427/14077443.jpg) and [namedropping expensive companies/brands](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phaJXp_zMYM) is somehow not very commercialized? What the fuck?

&gt;If you really want to argue that 80's and 90's hip hop artists including Biggie and LL were putting out the same things that people like Rick Ross and Lil Wayne are doing now then it's very clear who's delusional, or just plainly misinformed. 

No it's not. denying that these artists aren't influential, important, and talented is evidence that you're delusional and misinformed. If you really knew so much about music theory you'd understand why A Milli is pretty fucking impressive, from a technical standpoint if not anything else. Lil Wayne was *incredibly* influential, in a lot of good ways too. 

Furthermore, Lil Wayne is past his prime and basically all of his fans (and the man himself) will admit this. You should *know this* if you're going to try and take jabs at him.

&gt;We can break it down and throw up some sources if you really want to get into it. 

lol, ok. Go ahead?

There are also lots of other modern rappers who are just as good if not *better* than the legends from the 80's and the 90's. 2013 was literally one of the best years for hip-hop, **ever.**

If you can be Dorothy Day for the mentally ill, you will definitely be remembered as a saint by some, even if you aren't religious. I find it amusing how people try to pretend she wasn't an anarchist but if you read the Catholic Worker and read her letters she identified as an anarchist to the end of her life. Yeah, she wasn't an insurrectionist who wanted to disembowel priests, but she sure as hell wanted to tear down statism and capitalism, which would qualify her by most definitions. I'd even venture to say that the full implications of Catholic social doctrine, even if they recommend state action when necessary, would ultimately lead to a distributist/mutualist anarchism in politics when taken all the way.

Theory is fun and I try to read up on all sorts of it, but at the end of the day Edmund Burke was right. Tradition determines social order far more than planning it does, and the French Revolution proved him right.

I really enjoy a few ancaps like Rothbard but it's a bit too theoretical for my tastes. I'm sure a stateless society would develop a decentralized legal system, courts, things like that, people do need social bodies to promote the common good and social order, that's our nature, but this idea that we can plan out ""dispute resolution organizations"" and ""voluntary law"" and wait for it to happen is just silly. People are going to retain their customs and traditions and that's just as important as law, and by law of course I don't mean the vile legislation emanating from the Leviathan but simple natural law that guides human affairs. Ten Commandments kind of things, not the tax code. 

I guess you could say I'm for an informal government based around natural law but neither for institutionalizing power in the central state nor plotting out detailed plans on how to rebuild society. Repeal 1648 and 1789 both. "

Derivatives are useful because they can tell you what the slope of a curve is at a point without using another point. On a non-linear curve, using a second point would just give you an average slope between those two points, but derivatives will tell you exactly what the slope is, with 0 margin of error.

It gets better. The derivative of a derivative gives you the acceleration of the original curve at point. Not how fast it's going up or down, but how fast it's getting steeper or flatter."

amberbramber,AskWomen,1391142218.0,"Oh I got this.

So, I ran into a friend/neighbor from high school in the cafeteria at our college and we were catching up. He was telling me about his boyfriend's upcoming surgery, and then these 2 guys that both knew my friend somehow (he doesn't even know their names) interrupted the conversation. Within about 20 minutes:

Guy 1 was saying how he hates his best friend, one time he peed in a cup of soda and his best friend drank it and he only has this guy as a best friend for sex.

Guy 2 kept complaining about his ""fat, lazy girlfriend"" who has been ""unemployed"" since November. Come to find out she's on effing maternity leave after having a C-section.

Bonus: The dude that works at the campus coffee shop came up and told us all how his landlord was inspecting his house that day and he's not supposed to have pets, so he hid his **SIXTY FUCKING TWO PET SNAKES** in drawers, laundry baskets and under clothes.

I honestly don't know how much of what Guy 1 and coffee shop guy said was true, but at that point I was like ""YEAH I HAVE CLASS NOW BYE"" and sat in my car for an hour because being alone was better than spending another minute in that conversation.

(In my friend's defense, he is a very nice person, the only one of these people he even knew by name was the coffee shop guy)"

Omega037,changemyview,1391142249.0,"This might just be arguing semantics, but the ability to reproduce is not something that is ""given"", it is something that people naturally have.

As for you further points:

Saying reproducing discriminates against homosexuals and the infertile is like arguing that having use of both legs discriminates against the paralyzed.

Attempts to have population control tend to have negative side effects, such as the massive gender imbalance currently in China due to sex selection through indirect (stop after first boy) and direct (abort females) methods.  

It also can be a precursor to eugenics, where an elite choose only certain races/people to reproduce.

Furthermore, we now know that economic development leads to a slowing in population growth.  Most developed nations have quickly falling rates (especially when you negate the effect of immigration).  So if you want to solve the population problem, just solve the world poverty problem.

It's made me pretty harsh towards breaches of trust though, and at my age now, I sincerely doubt I'll ever be free of the deep font of rage, but I like to think I've learned ways to channel it constructively, rather than be ruled by it.

mexican_classic,videos,1391142455.0,"pretty much what /u/quantumcub said but i would like to add that those types of scenes are very tricky because the water has to be at a certain temperature(this is assuming the actors are gonna get wet), if the water is too cold the actors could get sick and you fuck up the rest of the production, but if it's too warm the water will start to steam up and that could ruin the shot.

it's very difficult (continuity wise) to shoot in the rain. in one shot they could look somewhat dry but in another angle they could look drier or wetter than before. so it's better to do it the way they did than to risk illness and a continuity nightmare."
griss0,AskWomen,1391142455.0,I once went to a bar with my bf and some friends. A friend of the guy I knew met me and kept telling me how beautiful I am. And how lucky my bf was.

I'm actually glad my bf didn't react in an angry or confrontational manner. Or jealous.

Ninjatertl,marvelstudios,1391142460.0,"[Here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/o12cuaplgq7ck/GotG%20Stuff) is some more footage of the trailer, and the mid credit scene from Thor 2. 

And how about a write up of the whole thing:

&gt;Footage started with a dusky shot of a man entering a ship of some kind. The whole thing is very dark. The silhouette slowly walks around a few halls until he's in a room with a silver orb floating atop a pedestal. He reaches for it and takes it without a problem. When he turns around we see it's Chris Pratt and we're not the only ones to see him. A group of angry looking men with big scary looking guns rush in (led by Hounsou) who screams at him to drop the orb.

&gt;”Yeah, cool man. No problem! No problem at all!” Djimon: “Who are you?” Music swells and Pratt says: “Star-Lord.” “Who?” In an “aw, come on!” tone, Pratt says “Star-Lord, man. The legendary outlaw?”

&gt;Needless to say, he's arrested. John C. Reilly is like a space cop who is looking over his prisoners, which is the skeleton the footage hangs on. It's their way of introducing these guys to us. There's a deputy of some kind in the room with him and he's talking to him throughout. “We arrested these five on Zandar. Check out the rap sheets. Drax aka The Destroyer. He's killed scores of Ronan's lieutenants in his search for vengeance...” We see Drax standing, cuffed, in some kind of line-up room/observational thing... except super sci-fi'd with electric windows and all that jazz.

&gt;”Gamora, Thanos' adopted daughter... her own personal death machine.” and we see a green-skinned Zoe Saldana standing like she doesn't give a fuck.

&gt;Then it cuts to a little furry guy standing on a box in the observation room and the audience went apeshit. I couldn't hear what John C. Reilly was saying, but he did say “Rocket Raccoon” and “over 50 charges of vehicular theft and escape from lockup.” Rocket looks annoyed and kind of exhales loudly, almost a sneeze.


&gt;Then it cuts to a tall figure standing in the observation room. So tall in fact that we don't see his head. Looks like someone just planted a tree in the room... until it moves, ducking down to look through the window so we see his face. “Groot.” Reilly described him as “houseplant/muscle.”

&gt;Now it's back to Pratt. “Peter Jason Quill. He's also known as Star-Lord.” Deputy, “Who calls him that?” “Himself, mostly. He's wanted for minor theft, avoiding prosecution, fraud...” As Reilly is reading off the charges, Pratt is doing that turn-the-crank-jack-in-the-box middle finger thing, then acting all innocent. “I'm sorry! I didn't know how this machine worked!” The way Pratt sold that moment killed the audience. So funny.

&gt;The rest of the footage was more montage style, beginning with Pratt being led through alien jail. He sees a big blue brute guy (mostly make-up and practically executed) picks up a pair of headphones. Blue Swede's Hooked On A Feelin' can be heard coming from them. “Hey, hey, hey! That's mine!” The alien prisoner defiantly puts them on his head. Quill breaks free, hands still cuffed, and chases after him. “Come here, you big blue bastard! Take that off your head right now!” And he tackles the big guy.

&gt;Hooked On A Feelin' plays throughout the rest, giving a driving, light and fun beat through the rest of the footage. There's a knife going to a sleeping Gamora's throat, her eyes snapping open, Drax punching some poor thing into oblivion and, my favorite, a grimacing Rocket Raccoon double fisting uzis and spraying lead in arcs around him. Bunch of action beats and then back to John C. Reilly.

&gt;”They call themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy.” His deputy: “What a bunch of a-holes.”

Even today, it's common for them to fall back on that since atheism is a word for a single issue... that somehow they don't exist in any groups with similar ideas. Even though they do, many of which directly relate to that. It's not just what's being said. It's that the people saying it do not have the best track record of not saying things in the worst way possible.

How is this not what every group does? The problem though is that you are saying it as if it is a christian thing. Which means that yes, these people are going to consider it an attack on something more wide than the issue itself."

halfwaythere88,loseit,1391142640.0,"I don't do this so much anymore, but in the beginning, it was a god-send. 

I would plan my meals for the day and I would write the time next to each meal/snack that I would eat. I tried to have them as evenly spaced out as possible, both in the time of day they were eaten, and how filling the food was. It takes a bit of practice when you first start out, but pretty soon, every time you grab a handfull of M&amp;M out of the candy-dish, or a piece of cheese from the fridge, a red flag will start going up to remind you that you are on a diet and need to log everything. 

Next tip would be my ""Put it off an hour"" technique. Sometimes I'm not hungry, but I want to eat something, or I'm craving something. Some of the time I AM actually hungry, but this tip still works. Put it off. If I think I want to eat, I'll tell myself ""Ok, vacuum the living room, and then you can eat. Or, read a chapter in your school-book, then you can eat.  Being hungry is not an emergency. Don't freak out. You are getting food, tummy! It's just delayed!"" 

It might seem silly, but if you eat (hypothetically) 6 meals a day, and you wait half an hour before each, then at the end of the day you would run out of calories you have left much later in the day. This can help protect against doing your diet damage when late-night munchies kick in. Hell, if you wait an hour before you eat each time, you can rack up eve more time. Also, it's done wonders for the rest of my life. I almost always have a clean house now, and my GPA is a 4.0.

EDIT: Also, brush your teeth several times a day. That helps wanting to snack. (Be gentle, brushing your teeth too often/hard can damage them)"

Thats when I decided to take more of a proactive approch and eat yogurt to regulate my diet some.  I drink water, ate yogurt(everyday for the first few weeks; then at least twice a week afterwords--worked and still works for me), ate more fiber (not too much, I've had that happen-not fun); the granola bars and cereal bars are good, coffee is my go to poop juice (sounds weird, but it is). When going to the bathroom try to get into as much as a squat position as you can, with your knees above your hips. Hope this helps. It did for me! I still eat my shitty diet but yogurt has been my best friend; it helps a lot to bring my poops to normal. (which is shitting every day at least; going 2 days to 4 days without taking a shit is not normal...at all) Also, Activia is bullshit, regular yogurt is just the same just they trick you into thinking that if you buy it your better for it. It works for any types of yogurt if you take any kind for the time I said above.


Edit: I  hated yogurt with a passion, but I needed something with probiotics to help with my IBS, and the juice I normally would buy for that was hard to come by and expensive so I thought I would give yogurt another chance. Although I wanted to start out with flavors I thought I would like so I got Apple Turnover and Peach. Suddenly I didn't hate yogurt anymore. And it helps even with lactose intolerant people because it has cultures and good bacteria in it. So even though it is dairy, it DOES help. Also, if you have a poop that is sticky and not coming out, it's not ready to come out. It has to ""solidify"" more. I have had this happen to me and I go later on and it comes out fine."

They certainly don't build a ramp onto the front of the door. The ramp costs money because of the materials needed to build it like the cement. 

The real thing that I wonder about is about the bathroom. Yes, most houses already have ground floor bathroom but ADA recommendations for ground floor bathrooms mandate a 60"" turn radius at minimum that is unobstructed which means door swings can't over lap. That can add a few feet in any direction to a bathroom floor plan that eats up sq footage in the near by bedrooms/closets/etc. When you're designing a floor plan you're almost always holding on to any footage that you have. If you have a 12'x10' bedroom next to the bathroom that can hold a queen size bed and you have to take it down to 10'x10' to accommodate a turn radius then you start to effect resale value, furniture accessibility, etc. "

The writers hit the ground running with exploring the new group dynamics by throwing Annie and Hickey together. It took a different way to get there, but still landed in the same place as her relationship with Pierce — her sweetness wins out and she defends the eldest and most curmudgeonly member of the group.

I agree with some of the other comments that all of the guests amounted to cameos. I also hope Brie Larson sticks around for at least a few eps otherwise it's sort of a repeat of what happened last year. (Her appearance was one of the few things I thought S4 did right. Apparently, so did Harmon.) Failing that, Abed seemed to have a good thing going with the sign language girl.

That was a nice redemptive moment for Chang. One scene isn't going to completely change my mind about him, but if we the show continues humanizing him, it will go a long way.

Después por octubre lo volví a intentar, y salieron con que ""como lo compré posterior a un año antes de que entrara en vigor no lo iban a hacer"". Por lo tanto hablé a la PROFECO donde me informaron que tenía que acudir a levantar la demanda y se iba a hacer una junta de conciliación con la compañía y conmigo, ya que la nueva norma no estipula a partir de que fecha se hace válida, pero que sí tenían que desbloquearme mi teléfono. La verdad no he tenido tiempo, pero sí quiero hacerlo.

Pero de cualquier manera, es una tontería el proceso, y las compañías se hacen mega pendejas para hacerlo. El proceso para un iPhone es sencillo. La compañía envía una solicitud a Apple por internet con el IMEI del teléfono, Apple la recibe, y una vez hecha solo conectas el iPhone a iTunes y listo. Para este proceso les toma de entre 3 y 6 semanas.

En otros países solo te metes a la página y pones tu IMEI en un formulario y listo. Pero ya ven... México."

She shouldn't have started dating you if she felt the need to change you. 190 at 5'11 is not fat, and if so then barely. If this was all health related I could understand her side more, but it's clearly not. She's made it clear that she wants you to be her ideal guy, and that's most likely her motivation behind this.

If she genuinely cared about your health it would be less about losing weight, and more about just eating healthy and exercising. No mention of weight loss, just a healthier lifestyle.

Theoretically, if we could establish perimeters that disallowed certain people from reproducing, that might benefit society. However, you assume that the system that would do the actual restricting would be a perfect noncorruptable one, and this simply isn't possible. In reality there is no way to implement a system of restricting reproductive rights that does not end in straight up eugenics.

Nausved,news,1391143534.0,"Shortly before I was born, the doctor needlessly gave my mother a pretty nasty [episiotomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episiotomy). It never properly healed and caused problems when my younger siblings were born. It likely affected other aspects of her life, too—the details of which I was fortunately spared; however, problems defecating and having sex are a common complaint amongst women who've had episiotomies. 

Episiotomies were par for the course back then. The idea was to avoid vaginal tearing, but as it turns out, episiotomies cause more damage to the vagina's perineal muscles than natural tears typically do. Today, they're only recommended in certain situations where tearing is likely to be severe (of which my birth was definitely not an example).

When my aunt had her son a few years ago, she was given a C-section for the doctor's convenience; there were no medical problems, but he didn't want to work over the weekend. Now, she's told that *all* subsequent children have to be delivered via C-section as well, since it can be dangerous to have a vaginal birth after having had a C-section. Unfortunately, [there are numerous other problems with C-sections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section#Risks), and her risk of death increases with every additional child."

Mephrael,AskReddit,1391143612.0,"&gt; I mostly generally like to keep the government out of my life as much as possible along with the idea that some areas should be tightened up and properly regulated

This I can agree with completely. 

As for unified healthcare, Australia's system is somewhat two factor in nature, and appears (for the most part. There are problems, I won't sugar coat it) to work fairly well. For basic services like a GP appointment, basic dental, some common medicines and other things, there's blanket cover. This cover is geared slightly more towards low income and the elderly, and is means tested through income tax to ""encourage"" those wealthy enough to obtain a supporting level of private health cover that is insurance-like, and meshes with the existing common system.

Thus, for any given medical procedure, there's a scheduled amount that the government owned system will cover, and then a gap (I think US health insurance calls it a co-payment?). People can opt for the public system if the procedure involves hospitalization, which has huge waiting lists for non vital surgeries, but is more or less 100% covered by the public system, or they can use their private insurance to cover the bulk of the procedure in a private hospital through whatever agreement they have with the private insurer. In this case, the public system pays the base rate, the private insurer covers a large chunk of the rest, and any remainder is up to the insured party.

It does have issues, and admittedly favours the poor and the elderly, however sooner or later, I'm going to be one of those elderly that rely on the system, so I think it's not unfair to partially support them with my taxes now."

Noumenology,occult,1391143661.0,"----**Scientological Similarities**----

Scientology presents itself as a ""spiritual science"" very similar to some of the literature around Western Mystery Traditions. I'm not going to go into Scientologist theology or language here (that's one deep fucking rabbit hole), but essentially, through training and the acquisition of knowledge, on can realize the truth about their own nature, and eventually gain the power to influence their reality. This also corresponds with some occult philosophy about gnosis and entering into harmony with divine will, so that the impact of an *individual's will* becomes an impact in the *collective will*.

Furthermore, grades are an integral part of the Scientology system. People advance along the ""[Bridge to Total Freedom](http://www.scientologymyths.info/definitions/gradechart.gif)"" as they would through grades of initiation in Wicca or orders like the Golden Dawn and such. Each grade brings with it new revelations, powers and abilities. For occult practitioners, these may be psychosocial (or possibly paranormal for the more convicted). At the top of the Bridge ranks one's spirit no longer needs their physical body, and they escape the reincarnation that is typical for souls.

Likewise, in western mystery traditions, reincarnation is something that is escaped after through the acquisition of knowledge and one's unity with the divine or cosmic, collective sense of self. Blind faith is rejected - belief and understanding are attained through a progressive course of spiritual study that claims to be ""scientific."" "

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1391143801.0,"I think it's too early to say if it's healthy or not, but I do think it's fascinating. I also wouldn't say that Japan's case is a break-down of gender roles, but rather a reaction to a very strict set of social rules that only very recently (in terms of history) have started to become impractical, but still, in a way, are being followed. From what I know, it's seen as socially taboo to just walk up to someone and express interest in them. You're supposed to take baby steps, very polite baby steps, over an appropriate amount of time, which can often be months, before a first date is ever reached. And on that first date, kissing is probably out of the question, let alone sex. It's probably going to take more than one generation for the modern people to let go of the social hang-ups of the past, if that's even what they chose to do. 

I'd even argue that traditional roles are holding them back. Instead of just breaking the dating rules, the young people (men and women alike) are choosing for-pay options. The paid option is the socially acceptable loophole. Which is fascinating to me, as it's so different from America. 

I *do* think it's a good thing for the sex industry to be socially acceptable, because acceptance means that it's much more likely to be safe. When escort services are legal and can operate honestly and without fear, it's far more likely for those involved to have a safe, professional experience. Why should an experience with a professional be shameful? Sure, it's nice to get a backrub from your girlfriend, it's an act of love, but it probably won't compare to the expertise of a trained masseuse. I've lost count of the number of posts I've seen on the internet to the tune of ""I'm a virgin and desperate to get laid but I refuse to even consider hiring a sex worker, it's beneath me and shameful and it doesn't count."" What if it wasn't shameful? What if it did count? What if it was as normal as seeking out any other professional service?

All that being said, I don't think the situation in Japan right now is *ideal* by a long shot. Perhaps in a generation or so, the social rules about dating will have loosened/faded and the *very* competative career oriented attitude will settle down a bit. And hopefully the sex work industry will still be thriving, so that those who still don't want to participate in the dating game have options. "

Adding just a few more:

* [Twelve Kingdoms](http://myanimelist.net/anime/153/Juuni_Kokuki) -- The main character starts off weak and whiny, but gradually gets stronger and learns how to survive after a few rough patches. Granted, she *does* get a ""power up"" of sorts because she literally is thrown into the heat of battle with no knowledge whatsoever of how to fight, but the development I speak of is more character development than physical strength. Eventually, the story expands further to involve multiple countries and a larger cast of characters, and in the last arc, Youko's development is set against the character development of two other major characters.
* [Paradise Kiss](http://myanimelist.net/anime/322/Paradise_Kiss) -- A shoujo series revolving around the studious Yukari, who wants only to meet her mother's high academic expectations, but who then meets a group of eccentric fashion design students who want to use her as a model their outfit for a design competition at their school. As she befriends them and gets into a rocky relationship with their leader, George, she learns to be more decisive and create her own path, one that *she* wants rather than what her mother wants.
* [Nana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/877/Nana) -- By the same author as Paradise Kiss, so it's another shoujo series. However, it's longer than ParaKiss, so it arguably allows more room for character exploration and growth. In it, there are two girls named Nana - same name, same age, and both moving to the Tokyo on the same day, and end up living in the same apartment, but juxtaposed by their totally different personalities and goals in life. They meet, make friends, get in and out of good and bad relationships, and many times, have to make difficult decisions that will gain them one thing, but force them to lose another.

thebumm,todayilearned,1391143985.0,"Way off on so many levels, sir/madam. I encourage you to no longer speak out of your ass before learning more about this practice. I have experience doing this, I promise you, you're way off.



Saying God would exile you from heaven for being unwillingly baptized by another religion is acknowledging that Mormonism would be both true and false at once, so you're the one making self-contradictory remarks.



Let's assume God exists. If he does, one religion has to be His religion. If not, there has to be more than one god, because religions vary by belief and practice. So, one God and one true religion. If there is one true religion, God knows who is a member and who is not, or else who qualifies for admittance to heaven.



Let's say Religion of Squirrels is God's religion. I'm a member in good standing of RoS. Holy shit, I just died. Fuck me, right? Well, now I get to go to heaven. God's like, Welcome. And I'm like, Thanks, God. Good to be here. I've already gained admittance through my works and faith and all that good shit.


What the fuck is this? My mom wants me to be Mormon post-death? I'm already in heaven because I made it there. God isn't gonna boot me for something my mom did after I died. Just as God isn't going to hold me accountable for my wife banging some other dude while I'm living. That's them, this is me. And I'm already in heaven.




Now, from the LDS perspective. Latter-day Saints believe that life after death 100% exists, but that prior to judgement day, spirits chill for a bit before being condemned to hell or accepted into heaven. Because of this, anyone not baptized prior to dying is going to be in the spirit prison portion of this after-life lobby. Mormons in good standing will hang out in the mormon side, sinners (according to mormon standards) are gonna be in the spirit prison side.



Spirit prison has mormon spirit missionaries that preach and try to save others. Everybody has access to marriage and baptism in this stage as well. (Mormons believe you have to be married to get to the top level of heaven, but that's another discussion). Anyway, these missionaries can't baptize according to the mormon belief because baptism has to happen by immersion on earth (it's an earthly test don't ya know) so these proxy baptisms are done on earth. The spirit missionaries then say ""Hey, bro, someone did your church work on earth, you want it?"" and the spirit can say ""Uh, yeah, sure."" or ""Fuck off, square."" Also possible, and more likely according to most Mormons, is the a guy dies, gets into this spiritual lobby and gets taught the Mormon gospel by these spiritual missionaries. He then pleads to his still living relatives (via spirit messengers) to do his work for him on earth, including these baptisms. When they do the work, he's golden.




Assuming there are multiple heavens, the Mormons are the only ones who would afford you the opportunity to switch, but then again, they'd be wrong completely and would be moot. So... that argument is waterless. If there are multiple heavens, you go where you go and that's final.



Side note: They also perform marriage work (not marriages, but Mormons have a ton of shit going into marriages that I won't get into) so that people can have that completed as well. It's called a ""sealing"" so if Dave and Anne get married on earth, but not in the Mormon temple for whatever reason (Dave isn't Mormon, or isn't in good standing, etc...) after Dave dies, another married couple, Steve and Nancy, can go into the temple, get Dave a proxy baptism and a proxy sealing and Dave post death can accept or decline this work.




So, if you're a Squirrel like me, Mormon work can go fuck itself because it has no bearing. Anne Frank was as Jewish as they come, so if Judaism is correct, she wins. If not, and Mormons are right, she still has the opportunity for a big fuck you to Momos and can do what she sees fit. As far as I know, the LDS view of the afterlife is a different structure, and if you don't believe that you have nothing to worry about.



If you don't believe in ghosts, why would you fear them? If you don't believe in Mormons, why would you fear them?"

justgivingsomeadvice,lakers,1391144472.0,"For the record, Kobe has taken on his career 15.6 2FGA (Durant 14.6) and averaged 7.6 FT (8.3 for Durant).

The FT/2FGA rate is 0.487 for Kobe and 0.568 for Durant. That is a *pretty big* difference, would you like me to run some calculations on what would happen if Durant on his career had a FT/2FGA rate?

Here we go, right now if we ignore And-1s and 3 FTs and Techs and assume FTA/2 is another shot (e.g. 10 FTs = 5 shots), then on his career KD has averaged 8.3/2 + 14.6 shots per game:  18.75. On these, he's gotten 8.3 FTs. That's a rate of 44.3% FTs/Total Shots Within the Arc. A similar calculation for Kobe's number puts him at 39.1%. If we use Kobe's 39.1% for Durant, he's getting 7.3 FTs/game. 

**That is one fewer free throw per game.** How big of a difference is that? Well let's see, 1 FT = 0.5 FGA added to his stats. Durant now shoots 15.1 2FGA. He also loses one FT, which is 0.883 points. So now he averages 27.0 - 0.883 PPG, or 26.117. His 3FGA stays the same so he's shooting 15.1 + 4.2 = 19.3 FG and 7.3 FT per game.

*His new TS%? 58% (compared to 59.8%).* Doesn't seem like that big of a dip, especially considering 58% is still higher than Kobe's highest year (55.5% was his career average I think). But for reference, what's MJ's TS%? 57.1%. Inefficiency isn't seen as a weakness for MJ. The drop from 59.8% to 58% is as substantial as the difference in efficiency between Kobe and MJ. Or maybe another way of rephrasing it is, if Kobe got the amount of calls KD did, he'd be right around MJ status efficiency while scoring only slightly fewer PPG!

So what we can conclude is that our intuitions are right: KD is a more efficient scorer than Kobe on his career. That was fairly obvious. Not only does he play more efficiently (fewer bad shots and he also stat hawks about FG% by avoiding last second heaves at the end of quarters), he also plays alongside a Kobe-esque player in Westbrook who ""absorbs"" the bad shots so to speak. On the other hand, he also hasn't entered (or exited) his prime so his career TS% can still get even higher, free throw rate notwithstanding.

This all said, the original point was whether or not KD is better than Kobe ever was. That was what I was arguing about. I prefer *not* to toss out his best season as an outlier. And I don't want to do the calcs for it, but Kobe's 35.4 PPG game would easily hit 36+ if he got the amount of calls KD did, while hitting probably mid-57% TS% on the season . That'd probably literally be the single greatest scoring season of all time (excluding Wilt because pace), and it only backs up my original point that saying KD &gt; Kobe is stupid, though I'm happy to accommodate the argument that KD is as good as Kobe (each with distinct strengths)."

Noumenology,occult,1391144570.0,"----**Scientological Differences**---- 

Scientology makes the claim of being an exoteric system. It claims that all are welcome, yet is aggressively secretive about it's higher levels. When confronted about Xenu and such, church members either do not acknowledge these stories or say that the ""Wall of Fire"" teaches at OT III and above are the sacred mysteries  of the church. The promise of being able to control ""Matter Energy Space and Time"" (MEST) is also something that's less relevant for ""Public Scientology."" 

As it is exoteric (and connected with celebrity culture), it's hierarchical status creates a odd mix of actors: ""public scientologists"" are those who practice and take auditing similar to any lay followers of a church. Celebrity scientologists are expected to give both public endorsements and money to the church as needed, but are always treated very graciously and given everything that's possible. The ""clergy"" or the administration is dominated by the Sea Org, an internal body in the COS where members sign billion year contracts and may be wind up being trafficked, enslaved into strict labor, beaten on by officials, psychologically tortured, and so on.  have compared this to the experience of monks - however, as Wright put it, a monk who leaves his order is not hounded by the abbot or expected to provide backpay for room and board, or threatened with the details of every confession ever made. 

Another major difference between Scientology and other magick systems - the auditing practice depends on two individuals, and many ritualistic exercises also are one on one. Sec checks and ""twinning"" are two more examples of how much their practices rely on pairs. The only people who work alone are those at the very top: Hubbard supposedly audited himself, and so does the current church leader, David Miscavage. Everyone else reports directly to someone else, sometimes several people. The organization creates a metric fuckton of paperwork that shoots back and forth about the progress of practitioners, potential trouble sources (PTS), suppressive persons (SP), and so on. "
thro_way,TumblrInAction,1391144572.0,"&gt;Both the father and the mother would be equally at fault for the death of the fetus in the case of an abortion.

I'm not sure how that contradicts my point, but yeah, they are equally at fault.  Which is why we hold guys responsible for child support; they're considered to have been (half) the cause of the pregnancy.

But-for is the test used to determine proximate cause! They're not separate categories of causation.  If something passes but-for (check) and is a foreseeable consequence (check), then *it constitutes proximate cause*.  A but-for cause that was foreseeable is literally what a proximate cause is!

&gt;I brought it up only as a simple way of naming the concept I was getting at.

When a debate hinges on very nuanced concepts, it's probably not a good idea to try to use ill-fitting, imperfect analogies.  Everyone is quite aware of the concept of bodily autonomy; it seems like think you're under the impression that there are people out there who actually oppose bodily autonomy, rather than believing that, while people have a right to bodily autonomy, the baby's right to life supersedes it.  While it might be comforting to pretend that other's views are less defensible than they really are, bringing this mindset into discussions hinders your ability to grow.  "

thebumm,todayilearned,1391144623.0,"Thought of a better analogy (ignore if you want).


Let's say you are a Harvard guy. You get accepted to Harvard BUT your mom also applies for you to Stanford. When you get accepted to Stanford you can be like... Hmmm, Stanford actually is the right school for me. Or you can say, Fuck Stanford, Harvard for life.



Same thing here. Living Mormons believe 100% that Stanford is the only shit that matters, and they want everyone they love to be invited. They apply on behalf of everyone they are given permission to (once again, Mormons are sticklers for earthly/spiritual work, it's a realms thing) and allow the dead to decide if Harvard is real or if Stanford is real. It's not like if you receive an acceptance letter from Stanford in the mail, Harvard will all of the sudden rescind their offer and send an assassin to blow your brains out. Even if you were wearing Harvard sweatshirts all your life and your parents were Harvard grads (like when you were living as X religion and so were your parents), when you ultimately have to decide on a school and commit to Harvard (i.e. die as a Catholic) you can switch to Stanford (see: Mormonism).  If when you graduate high school you realize Harvard actually is the only real college, no harm no foul on the other application. If not though, you can transfer schools (switch religions)."

evilbrent,Justrolledintotheshop,1391144635.0,"I'm sorry is that normal? 

What system is in place to PROVE that the car cannot fall down? In industry that would be impossible to have happen - that you could even get near a suspended car without some failsafe method of guaranteeing safety.

So, if you hadn't noticed it you would have otherwise been approved to work underneath that car? Faaaaark. 

As a worker you have to be completely isolated from all forms of energy, and gravitational energy is a pretty big one. In my company we're not allowed to buy hydraulic rotary presses with a full guard, interlock, light curtains, foot switch, the whole deal, unless there is a mechanical lock that physically slides into the drive at top dead center because if there is a situation where the power is out AND a person has their hand in the press AND the machine cycles AND the friction brake gives way they could be hurt. Funnily enough that happened last week when a guy was doing maintenance on a press, fully isolated and locked out, and the friction brake gave way and he lost the tip of a finger.

And you're telling me that the systems in your workplace are ""wander under any suspended load your boss tells you unless you notice that it's not quite right""? Faaaaaaaaaaark.

Wow. Good on you for noticing. Hopefully your boss is otherwise safety conscious..."

just_comments,technology,1391144640.0,"I'll make a timeline for you:

January 2009: Obama signs an executive order to close the camp on his *second day in office* creates Guantanamo Review Task Force to figure out what to do with prisoners 

May 2009: Funding for order diverted by congress. Guantanamo remains open. 

December 2009: Obama issues formal presidential memorandum to close the camp. Attorney Marc Falkoff, who represents some of the Yemeni detainees, say that his clients might prefer to remain in Guantánamo rather than move into the more stark conditions at Thomson. (I don't know what ""more stark"" means. This smells really fishy, my feeling is that the prisoners were manipulated)

January 2010: Guantanamo Review Task Force issues report recommending release of many prisoners. 

January 2010 (still): 2011 Defense operations bill put forth by congress which has clauses in it that prohibit prisoners from moving to mainland or a foreign country (either keep them in gitmo or release them all, guess how **that** would have been spun) Obama signs it and criticizes said clauses. 

May 2010: report *finally* released to public. 

March 2011:  Obama gives green light to do military trials (presumably so that those whom are not threats can be released) and issues a mandate requiring assessments done on all prisoners within a year and every three years. As well as ""compliance with the Geneva Conventions and the international treaty that bans torture and inhumane treatment"" (if he can't close the camp or transfer the prisoners, he can keep them from being tortured)

April 2011: Obama states he will ""work with congress"" to repeal clauses of the defense authorization bill keeping him from transferring prisoners from the facility. 

December 2011: Obama signs defense operations bill for 2012 which continues mandate keeping him from transferring prisoners. (Not sure about politics behind this, but this is way later than 2011's bill was signed, so it's most likely that he either could sign it and continue the mandates or not sign it an get no funding)

So there you have it. Obama repeatedly has tried to close the prisons and every time he has congress has used it's abilities to cleverly keep him from doing so. I'm not saying he's not a disappointment (he is in my opinion) but saying he hasn't tried to close Guantanamo is incorrect.

I've been suspecting myself of having bipolar but I'm waiting to change doctors until I can discuss seeing a therapist to look into it further. Although I do have BPD, from my own personal research I think ""bipolar borderline"" would be a better classification but I need to see a therapist before I begin to determine anything.

And I know exactly what you mean. The exact thing happened today -- I woke up feel anxious because I have yet to call my university to withdraw my place but when I finally got around to convincing myself to call them, the line was busy. I've been feeling depressive for months now so it's a good indicator that I've not yet entered the manic episode I'm suspecting will come soon. My sister dropped by with my nephew for a couple of hours and I was ecstatic yet irritable then, and when they left I became depressive again. I started watching a documentary on a mental institution and almost started crying because all I want is to be institutionalised because I feel that's the only way I'll feel safe and secure. I had to stop myself from crying because my other sister was there. When she went to bed, I can't remember what I was doing but I started self harming again (nothing life-threateningly serious at all). This is a rarity but I'm becoming desperate for a way out of this depressive episode and into mania so I'm guessing that was an attempt. I don't know. It's so fucked up. I started crying and have been on and off for the last 6 hours. The funny thing is none of it feels real. I don't know if it's disassociation or denial, just, none of this feels like it's actually happening to me."

They've caught the atmosphere pretty well - singlehandedly, a marine in power armour takes down an army of inferior Orks. It's very much an action game, and strategy and tactics take a back seat.

There's not as much connection to the original board game as one might wish - some rules are changed, some new ideas are introduced, but it's not bad.

For example - when your health is low, you can recharge it by executing enemies in hand-to-hand combat, so a lot of the game will see you charging recklessly into the densest groups of opponents.

It *is* slaughterfest 2000, rather than a game of careful planning and superiority through unassailable tactics, but that doesn't mean it's bad.   
It does mean, however, that it's somewhat removed from WH40K.

lendrick,anime,1391145083.0,"Well, part of the mold that I'm talking about is the fact that a lot of anime is kind of *about anime*, if that makes any sense.  To understand a lot of shows, you need to be familiar with other shows, and so on, whereas Miyazaki's works don't require that familiarity with other anime in order to enjoy them fully.  In that way, he's different from a lot of the people he's criticizing.

That being said, I don't think it's fair to call (for instance) moe anime ""unimaginative"".  Sure, it's self-referential, and the characters often caricatures, but on the other hand, certain other constraints on setting tend to be a lot more relaxed, so they can experiment with odd situations in ways that more serious shows can't.  Kill la Kill and Dog &amp; Scissors are both shows that require a tremendous understanding of existing anime in order to fully appreciate, but it would be ridiculous to call them unoriginal or unimaginative.

For the record, I don't agree with Miyazaki's implication that the genre is somehow inferior -- I just see where he's coming from with his complaints."

sfzen,Saints,1391145184.0,"Grubbs isn't leaving, he was pretty solid this year. Once Evans got healthy, he and Grubbs made De la Puente look semi-decent again.

 I agree about Smith, Harper, and Bunkley, not sure about Moore or Robinson. 

I think Greer stays, because he was great before he got hurt. I have no idea what will happen with Thomas.

Meachem will probably re-sign on the cheap, as will Herring. Collins probably will too. I think Haralson will test free agency, and McCown may just be unemployed until he retires, Griffin will probably move up to #2.

Jenkins, I'm not sure. I'd like to keep him as a rotational safety, but he wouldn't be a huge loss. I think we need to keep Strief for another season since Armstead has shown improvement on the left.

S: I'd rather draft a safety in the mid rounds since the market seems thin. Bush can start if needed, and I think we'll either re-sign Jenkins or Harper will take a pay cut.

CB: We need depth more than anything. I'm happy with Lewis, Greer, and White as our top 3. Iffy on White. I think if there's a talented CB in the 2nd or 3rd, we should pounce. Nolan Carroll would be a good FA pickup that we might get cheap.

LB: I'm really not sure what the FA market looks like here, but we need someone to rotate with Hawthorne as the #2 ILB. Maybe a mid-round draft choice.

OL: I think Center or OT in the first round is the way to go. I don't hate Strief or DLP as average-mediocre starters (still think DLP can be a pro bowler with a great O-line around him), but one or both need to be upgraded. I wouldn't be opposed to drafting a LT and moving Armstead to the right if he struggles on the left, but he shows promise. I think Lelito deserves a chance to compete for a starting C job. I don't think FA is the way to go here.

WR: I think our first 4 draft picks should be OL, WR, CB, and best player available, in whatever order. Moore might leave, and while Stills is great, Colston is getting old. Meachem is forgettable. Toon has disappointed. I'm excited to get Morgan back, but he needs to be consistent. I think a possession guy like Jordan Matthews from Vanderbilt would be a great pick in the 2nd.

We're solid at DE, RB, TE (we WILL re-sign Graham). Maybe a late round NT or cheap veteran to rotate if Bunkley stays, but we should pick up a vet if he leaves. I think Ryan Griffin moves up to #2, we'll find a UDFA for the practice squad.

I think we've got one of the best young DE rotations in the league with Jordan, Hicks, and Foster, plus Walker, Johnson, and Coleman."

fnredditacct,bestof,1391145199.0,"I was mostly replying in context to what had already been posted on the tread at the time I commented.

You are correct that that first post I made didn't go into the right details quite enough.

CMV is about changing the posters view and I spent a good deal of time attempting to establish credibility with the poster, and explaining that I very much understood where his view comes from, and that I think, in fact, it's not actually entirely wrong. *and I definitely did get carried away thinking about all reasons to say no. They were just fun to write. I...I have more saved, because I couldn't stop coming up with them. Could be a problem.*

But despite that fact that it is used very widely to mean many different things, *(which I'm not really a fan of)*, my point was that ""No means No"" still HAS to be the assumption. And not only that, but that such a phrase is needed.

For ""why"" I think ""No has to mean no"" I go into better detail  in my next comment down the thread, if you're interested:

[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1whkok/no_doesnt_always_mean_no_cmv/cf26z3m?context=3)

Haiavaha,AdviceAnimals,1391145227.0,"I'm guessing that when you say ""exactly"" you mean that they say something with the same meaning, but possibly different words. If so, that's because there's a difference between listening to and analyzing someone else's idea, and building up an idea of your own from scratch, and they want to make sure that the one they built or recalled is correct before they put it in long-term storage.

I like those people because they often introduce alternative ways of stating something in English that helps me get a more precise grip on whatever is we're talking about. In math classes especially, they've saved me from running off with completely wrong ideas."

RochelleH,AskMen,1391145230.0,"It's funny you mention hiding your wealth... You finding someone *not* after you for your financial status has an inverse scenario that I'm living...

I appear to be seeing a man that is well-off. I had no idea until he showed me his apartment and his second car on our second date, and I was really taken aback. It really threw me off, because I already liked him, felt comfortable with him, and suddenly felt slightly intimidated, and then worried about making it clear that my interest is about him as a person and not his possessions. He's very, very smart, is great to talk to, clearly very dedicated and passionate about his business and business in general, and I'm very attracted to him physically. I was sure he was doing ""fine"" with that head on his shoulders, but when I found out just *how* fine, I was a little shocked. I still am.

I have a good job and earn very well myself, albeit nowhere near the his proportions, and I have the education and culture to keep up with him, so there are no notable differences when it comes to stimulating conversation for both. I don't feel out of my depth. Now though, I worry about how I could appear *too* interested in his work and success when we talk. I liked him well before the apartment and beautiful car came into the mix and I would hate for him to think it's about anything more than him being a great guy. Now I have the problem of showing him that it's *not* about his status, while still appreciating and admiring his well-earned success... He doesn't hesitate to talk about the size of his plans, his business strategy, investment, returns, etc... He has also talked to me quite candidly about things he wants to buy that are simply not within the realms of most. He's not bragging at all, either. It's very natural conversation... and I'm stumped as to how I should react. 

So, to your point, the flipside for *some* women, I guess, is feeling terrified of someone great writing you off as a gold-digger when the attraction and feelings were there before finding out. "

Hurricane043,explainlikeimfive,1391145260.0,"First you have to understand that at the bottom of the computer, there are a bunch of circuits that perform operations. Each of these circuits will have inputs and outputs, which can be represented with binary (1's and 0's). 

In theory, you could program entirely in binary. First you need to specify what operation you want to perform. The way that this is done is by assigning each operation to a binary string, i.e. ""add"" may be signified by the string 0110. Then you have to add the binary for necessary inputs to this operation. An add instruction could have two numbers. Combine all this binary together and store it sequentially, and you get a program.

Now, obviously programming like this i awkward. This is why assembly exists. Assembly is pretty much straight translation from English to binary. Instead of having to write 0110 to signify ""add"", I will just write ""add"", and then I can create another program (in binary) that will convert that ""add"" text into ""0110"". This isn't a true compiler - it is called an assembler - but the idea is pretty similar.

With a higher level language, you can start making things more complicated. You could create a higher level language like C. Then you can write a program in assembly that will convert that C down to assembly. This isn't a direct translation like assembly to binary - you have to take into account variance. In the end, you want to create an assembly file that is executable. This is a compiler.

**tl;dr** - You start with basic binary programming, which can be done by interfacing almost directly with the hardware. You can then create a slightly higher language in assembly, using the binary language to write an assembler that converts that assembly into binary. You can then create higher languages like C and C++, using that assembly language to write a compiler that converts that higher level code into assembly, which is then assembled into binary. "

Hip-hop being commercialized is *not* an opinion. It has factually been commercialized for well over two decades.

&gt;Once again when did I say anything that even implies this? My entire argument is that commercialism and pop has changed a genre. And it has. There is absolutely no denying that, because the entire music industry has changed. It'd be absurd to say hip hop was untouched.

Bullshit. The music industry has always been full of commercialization. [This song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjyZKfdwlng) is a pretty fucking good example- none of the people in the video ever touched an instrument in the making of the song. Elvis Presley never wrote a fucking song, for fuck's sake. You're totally out of your mind if you think commercialization and pop is a recent development.

Roads being plowed, roads salted, etc. In addition to that, you are more prepared for the snow, and may do things like put on winter tires onto your car. 

I've lived in the north where we would get quite a bit of snow. The snow plow would drive into my neighborhood and plow snow out of the way. Then the roads would be salted. After half a day or so, the roads would be mostly clear and I would be good.

I now live in the south. The only thing that happens here is that the main roads will be salted. Big roads will be plowed, but that's it. That means side roads, particularly neighborhood roads, will be unsalted and unplowed.

Add to this another big problem - warm temperatures. Driving in snow isn't terribly hard. Driving on ice is. When it snows in the south, it will usually sit for a day or so. Then the sun will come out and temperatures will climb above freezing. The snow will melt. Then the sun will set and the temperatures will drop below freezing. What do you think this does? All the melted snow will freeze over on the roads. Now in the morning, the roads will practically be sheets of ice.

Since secondary roads are typically left alone by the plows and salting trucks, this means that most of them will freeze over. Once you get to the main roads it is fine, but you have to get out of your neighborhood first and actually get to those roads. That's the big problem in the south.

**tl;dr** - driving in snow isn't difficult, but driving on ice is. And the roads in the south become sheets of ice due to the heat."

notskunkworks,relationships,1391145918.0,"&gt; She struggled with depression before I met her, her moods are fragile, and her sense of self-image and self-worth are constantly in need of shoring up from me.

This is a problem. When you're with a partner like this and you want to bring up an issue, there's very little margin for error (if any).

Someone who wants to improve themselves, learn from their mistakes, and process constructive criticism has to be able to handle a base level of adversity. They need some minimal amount of resiliency when life throws punches at them.

Someone who can't do that -- someone with mood swings, a history of depression, and a shattered sense of self -- doesn't have the ability to frame their issues the right way. Their thinking is distorted, and they lack the growth mindset you need to get yourself unstuck from unhealthy patterns.

Self-improvement takes a lot of focus and energy in addition to a clear mind and healthy attitude. When there's nothing in the tank to spare, when you're drowning in life, how can you pull yourself up? You can't. People like that need intervention for their life. They need therapy. No, more than that. They need to want therapy.

But what about you? What do you want? Do you want a partner who can stand on their own? Who can find happiness without you crutching them to the finish line?"

Haiavaha,AdviceAnimals,1391146016.0,"No, I'm just a guy making his third attempt at getting through Calc I. This class is cool, but also hard. Calculus is the first kind of math I've encountered where just memorizing rules and processes doesn't cut it. The concepts and the processes are sufficiently complicated that they require a complete understanding to master.

Which is cool, but my high school math classes didn't do a damn thing to prepare me for this. In high school, math was all ""we've got a thing, here's a thing we can do to it. If we do that we get this other, differently shaped thing. Now go home and do this with a bunch of things and you've got it."" And that worked, all the way up to trigonometry. All the rules and all the processes were a lot to memorize but it was still possible.

But Calculus is just too much for that flat, dogmatic approach to be feasible. At least for me.

But I have hope. My Calculus teacher has handed a book. _A Transition to Advanced Mathematics_ by Smith, Eggen, and St. Andre. It's amazing. It's about getting down to pure logic, and how math is built up from that. I'm still only in Chapter 1, but it's completely rewiring how I think about math, and its really easy, too (so far). Seriously, this shit ought to be taught in middle school, or earlier, right along side arithmetic. Math education in this country is ass backwards."

lendrick,anime,1391146294.0,"&gt; Imagine that there is a genre of books that is popular and there are multiple books within that genre that take a lot from the other books and use them in ways which the readers will enjoy and relate to based off the other books they've read. Would this not make sense that these books would be more popular?

I don't have to imagine very hard.  Tolken's mythos spawned a lot of similar fantasy worlds that depend on peoples' familiarity with Tolkeinian tropes (that is, you don't have to explain what elves and dwarves are, because it's expected that people are already familiar with the concepts).  There isn't anything wrong with that at all, and those books *are* quite popular.

On the other hand, to really be recognized as innovative, people kind of have to steer away from those tropes and stand on their own."

I am proposing that when someone goes and changes *all* the information, or at least a good chunk of the information, related to identifying the customer, the account should be flagged for more scrutiny when someone calls up about it. this should be able to be handled by a single person, who has a name and contact number.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391146623.0,"&gt; Personally, I'm not really concerned with whether TRP ""works"" or not. And if it does work, that doesn't mean all or even most of the sub-theories of TRP have any truth. Maybe it's just my scientifically-oriented mind, but when a man comes to me and says that a theory/model seems to describe what he sees in real life, and thus every aspect of that theory or model is accurate, I spit coffee on my keyboard.

Some theories can sound pretty damned stupid and it's easy to come up with counterexamples to them.

When trying to understand some rpers, we can use chess analogies. 

A few of the major techniques used (subconciously or consciously) are recursive analysis, heuristic analysis, and even instinct, just to name a few. 

Some people can think several moves into the future and for them recursive analysis works fine, even on its own.

Some people can even win on instinct, without conscious thought (maybe subconscious) they can just pick the right moves. 

Some people simply cannot go past a certain depth through the game tree. These people need to rely more on heuristics, ones based on their personal experiences as well as those of others (chess history). These heuristics often have exceptional paths in the game tree that counter them.

Some heuristics are pretty shitty, and won't get you anywhere against anyone with even moderate chess backgrounds. However, they work very well against the average person with almost no chess history. 

We could shame or even ban the use heuristic analysis (or censor chess history), so that everyone had to rely on only the other techniques (recursive, instinctive, and others). But not everyone thinks or operates well under the same conditions, so there's an element of unfairness there. 

This might not matter for people who don't care to win. They just want to play a game, and if they lose they lose... and keep losing. But they can also get lucky and blindly bump into victory against the average opponents. 

This also might not matter for those who have natural talents in recursive analysis and can play the game well without little rules of thumb.

RP strategies are basically being criticized by everyone ranging from those who play the game well already, naturally... to people who don't care to play or win at all, and somehow think it's unfair to use heuristics.

It's the same train of thought that made me stop thinking poorly of McDojo graduates and others who follow simplified or unrefined rules of thumb."

&gt; The Oceanos was in a state of neglect, with loose hull plates, check valves stripped for repair parts after a recent trip, and a 10 cm (4 in) hole in the watertight bulkhead between the generator and sewage tank.[1]

It already had a hole, and the valves to stop water from flowing back into the showers and sinks were stripped. 
&gt; 
&gt; Realising the fate of the ship, the crew fled in panic, neglecting the standard procedure of closing the lower deck portholes. No alarm was raised. Passengers remained ignorant of the events taking place until they witnessed the first signs of flooding in the lower decks. At this stage, eyewitness accounts reveal that many of the crew, including Captain Avranas, were already packed and ready to depart, seemingly unconcerned with the safety of the passengers.

The guitarist's wife was on board as well, and she along with the second guy (a magician) were the last off the boat. Not only did Moss get everyone off the boat in an orderly fashion, he knew his wife was in danger as well and they both stayed on together and made sure everyone was safe. That is an amazing couple. 

All 571 people on board were saved. 

&gt; Captain Yiannis Avranas was accused by the passengers of leaving hundreds behind with no one other than the ship's onboard entertainers to help them evacuate. Avranas claimed that he left the ship first to arrange for a rescue effort, and then supervised the rescue from a helicopter. Avranas stated: ""When I order abandon the ship, it doesn't matter what time I leave. Abandon is for everybody. If some people like to stay, they can stay.

Isn't that the exact same excuse the Italian captain made?

Wikipedia says the Captain and 4 crew members were found negligent in their handling of the disaster, but no where could I find any actual sentence. One [blog](http://blog.lipcon.com/2013/08/ms-sea-diamond-captain-gets-12-year-prison-sentence-for-shipwreck-does-similar-fate-await-concordia-captain.html) says:
&gt;  Capt. Yiannis Avarana was charged with abandoning ship, just like Schettino, but the charges were later dropped and he eventually found work as a cruise ship captain once more.

tl;dr I don't think anything happened to the Captain. "

The owner showed up and collected (what was left of) his dogs, and paid us for the goats, so no real harm done, but still.

Dundas1,AskReddit,1391147011.0,"I don't know about any other states but in California there's a ""minors"" license which used to have the picture on the opposite side but recently went vertical.  The older ones had a blue stripe with the year you turned 18 and a red one for when you turned 21 I dont know if they're still the same in that sense or not.

Anyway the real point of this is my first license expired on my 21 birthday however I recived my new one two weeks before the old one expired and it was a minor one as well (minus the blue ""turns 18 in 2006"" stripe still had the ""21 in 2009"") same picture and everything. The best part is that it's good until my birthday this year which means I have been stuck with a picture from when I was 16 for the past 10 years in which I look 12. I'm amazed that I haven't had more problems with it but people and institutions are beginning to no longer accept it as I now look nothing like the picture.

So, while most of the experience was amazing, there were occasional moments like this.  I would sometimes just feel like keeping to myself and go a whole weekend without human interaction.

thebumm,todayilearned,1391147054.0,"So you do believe in Mormons, but not their religion, would be your last point.



I don't believe in God. Whew, glad that's out of the way. I don't profess to know all, either, but you are suggesting you *do* and you absolutely don't on this topic. I don't hate to be the one to tell you this, and I have no doubt you don't give two rat shits about the truth, just about having your point or idea shouted the loudest. Cool, man. I do know about this, a lot. More than you, clearly. But, if you care to read on, I'll continue, if not for you, for others that may stumble on this thread.




Obviously, I said their were assumptions. We have to continue the assumptions through the entire hypothetical narrative, and not just jump in with our own assumptions, or our narrative would be nullified.



Once again, from the top. Mormons believe in one God, one heaven (albeit multiple levels of glory) and one true(st) on-earth religion. Therefore, *assuming they are correct* there is only one God and one heaven. All that I said before, *under this assumption* is still on the table. The pre-heaven/hell lobby idea. The idea that a spirit/dead guy can decide in this lobby to accept or shun this work. From that perspective, all power is in the dead guy's hands *once the work is done on earth*. Meaning, even if he got his work done himself, while he was alive, he can shun that shit in the afterlife. If someone does it on earth, he can accept or deny.



Once again, from the Mormon perspective (their whole entire religion is based on this perspective) there is only one God and one heaven and so **if there is more than one** *Mormonism cannot exist*. If you're with me so far: If what the Mormons believe is false, their religion is not real. Pretty simple stuff.



Therefore, if there are multiple Gods and/or multiple heavens, Mormons and all they teach, preach, and stand for (including these apparently awful proxy baptisms) is not real. Does not exist and therefore does not matter. It would only affect the afterlives of people that believed and practiced on Earth, anyone that bought into it themselves.



If not, other religions wouldn't matter either. Because - again another assumption so I hope you stay with me on this pal - if a Catholic believes in Catholicism and only Catholicism, the Mormons are just kooks with too much time on their hands and their so-called ""baptisms for the dead"" are just some dumb ritual. If I die a Catholic, in good standing, my beliefs are that I am good, saved.



The only thing that makes a Mormon's actions matter are the Mormon's belief in them. If ANALOGY ALERT: I think praying to a Monopoly board will profess Mr. Monopoly in my spaghetti at lunch time, that's on me. If you don't, you'll probably mock me (you seem to be good at that) and laugh it off and absolutely nothing will happen[A]. Or, when Mr. Monopoly shows up in my spaghetti you'll take note and start believing in my monopoly prayer[B], or you won't see what I see[C].



Those two results show up in this Mormon thing. If you don't believe a Mormon baptism works, it doesn't work[A] or you will not see what they see[C] or you will see it is awesome and accept the religion[B]. That seems pretty cut and dry.



I can't speak from other religions, I'm not nor have I ever been Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Scientologist, etc and so forth. Maybe Jews think the Mormons are correct enough to fuck everyone over but not correct enough to save themselves. That makes 100% of no sense whatsoever, so I just left that out of my response. But I guess everyone has the right to their own opinion, even if it goes against all facts and reasoning (as yours does here).




You can be right, dude. You want to be. Just know that you know absolutely zilch about the Mormons, so there's that. You can be right about everything else if you wants. Congrats, my dude."

It seems almost trite now to state that it is wrong for society to expect girls and women to be cheery and pleasing to those around them no matter what they feel. On the other hand, being conspicuously withdrawn or withholding the support/affection that you normally show loved ones and colleagues can be hard (for them, anyway) to distinguish in kind or in impact from, say, making a snippy comment, which is an ""active"" thing.

The Good: 

* Absolute job security. Much of the staff has been there since the Carter administration- and I could stick around for that long if I wanted to. 

* Super casual environment. There is no clock to check in or our- our hours are simply written on a calender. The uniform is somewhat optional. (Which means that I don't have to spend money on workclothes often.) We all have pretty decent relationships, which reduces the squabbling. 

* Decent enough benes/pay. I don't make much now, but after accruing some seniority the remuneration is decent.  

The Bad:

* Seniority sucks if you aren't senior. Most often I have to do all of the grunt work that no one else wants to do. Also, everyone I work with (4 others) are my bosses. 

* The location is in kind of a run down part of the city so we tend to deal with a fair number of junkies/juggalos/rednecks. 
The Ugly:

* Tight margins and shoddy outside management force us to do things that aren't up to code. For example, anything dropped on the floor is put back into the case. All of the guards on the machines have been removed to increase efficiency.  etc,.

Because us bigger girls have less options (especially if we're stickler on accuracy) that means we have to work extra hard on accuracy/fun/detail, because we aren't relying on our body.

I like to cosplay anything that can have a corset worn under it, seems to give so many more choices! And my cosplays always seem to cover every inch of skin. My next cosplay I'll be doing is the new Maleficent. Lots of fabric that I can hide my arms and a corset under!

Funny enough the cosplays I picked are stick skinny, but not worrying about fully hiding my figure seemed to help on other levels.

thebumm,todayilearned,1391147615.0,"Actually, that is their belief. I'll explain it in another way.


Mormons have quite a few practices that require blessings from good standing members. I did some of these prayers for all of the people in attendance (100s of people) and I believed 0 percent of what I was doing and was therefore (and for other reasons too) not in good standing with the church. Mormons believe that the ordinance would work for everyone, but would condemn me.



By the same token, if the person who is being blessed (dead or living) doesn't want it to apply, it will not apply. If the mother was forced to 'allow' it, God would know and cancel and/or the mom would be able to get it rescinded.



To be honest, because of the human element, Mormons can explain away quite a few things. I've never experienced this myself, but I have seen something similar. My best friend's dad was not Mormon, but his mom was. While he was alive, the dad adamantly refused to become Mormon, go to Mormon church (just as a visitor), pray, stop drinking, stop smoking, all that shit. From the Mormon perspective, he was guilty of sins and all. And, he's refusing straight up to convert. Tsk tsk.


When the dad died, my buddy and his siblings (none Mormon at the time) allowed the mom to have his baptism done, because they saw no harm in it. Even though while he was alive he refused it. If the mom's beliefs were real, my buddy says that's a good move. Because his dad (according to the mom's belief) can still say no if he wants. She thinks he'll say yes now though, since he has a better perspective. The kids aren't Mormon either, so they could have asked NOT to have it done, but they didn't see any harm."

halfwaythere88,AdviceAnimals,1391147865.0,"Ok, let me start by saying, I am NOT defending the teacher. I just wanted to tell my story. 

I was home-schooled until 8th grade, and the math book I worked out of taught us how to see a problem and figure it out. It did not teach formulas or memorization. For the most part, it was great. I flew through High School math without any trouble at all because, I knew how to just ""figure it out"". I got a C in one math class sophomore year because the teacher kept docking points because I did not preform the tasks the way he showed us, even though my answer was correct and I showed my work. I HATED him and hated that he did that. 

I got my BA in English, so I avoided math like the plague in college. I am now going to graduate school for Special Education. I took no math as an undergrad, and got my BA in English, so as a condition to be let into the MA program for special Education, I had to take two undergraduate math classes. I got A's, but SHIT it was hard. Sure, I could look at easy problems and ""figure them out"" like I always had, but when they started adding new steps to equations, I was lost. It was hard enough now, that my ""non-math"" brain, could not wrap my head around the extremely complicated math that was in college classes. I had to go back and re-learn almost everything so I had the foundation to build on for more complicated problems. 

So yeah, I get why you are mad OP. You have a reason to be mad. Still, try and look at the silver lining? Maybe it will come in handy later. "

I guess they made it work or at least keeping the status quo since it's been over a decade. I don't know what she's doing these days, but I doubt it's her full potential. The guy is nice and all, but she's not going to get her shit together until he's out of the picture."

Back in the early highschool days, I took a classmate out on a date to the movies and the entire time she wouldn't get off me.  Normally, I would love this, but I paid nearly $40 in arrangements to make the date happen, I want to at least enjoy the goddamn movie!  I am anything but smooth.  The side of my mouth, cheek, and neck were practically drenched before we had even began making out, and once I was ready to reciprocate the time was spent with her practically licking the back of my throat and my wisdom teeth.  Guess who didn't get a second date?

I'll be blunt here, I like making out with somebody before having sex.  Many will deny it, but foreplay is important for men too, and the french kiss is an intimate act.  But if it's something you don't like, then it probably won't have the same effect for you.  I wouldn't be put off, but definitely say something first!  Christ, nothing would kill the mood more than having somebody turn away from something like that.  Maybe it'll be something you come to love, maybe it won't.  Nobody should make you do something that you don't want to do just so that they can get off."

carpescientia,femalefashionadvice,1391148179.0,"I do agree with and respect the POV that legitimately caring about and playing around with fashion is more of a hobby and one should certainly not expect someone to HAVE to enjoy or put time into it. However, I think there is a difference between taking the time to select an outfit with multiple pieces and accessories that coordinates into a well-defined and interesting ""look"" and taking the time to make sure your clothing is clean, in good repair, adequately sized and appropriate for both age and situation. 

I understand that it can be frustrating to be judged by your appearance, especially if you're just having a shit day (looked in the mirror yesterday and was horrified at myself). However, we do this to all things, as it's necessary to be able to judge relative fitness. Say you're standing in the middle of the sidewalk in between two restaurants. Restaurant A has a brand-new sign with a well-designed logo, awnings coordinated to the color scheme of the logo and when you look in, you see a smiling hostess. Restaurant B has two letters out on their generic neon sign, no windows to see inside and the lone little potted shrub by the door clearly died some time ago. Don't even begin to tell me you wouldn't view Restaurant A as friendly, cleaner, safer, etc. 

If we are not idealistic enough to think we can change societal norms single-handedly, we accept that we will be judged on our appearance and behave as such. I'm not saying I haven't run to the CVS near me in my yoga pants once or twice, but even this is a rare occasion. I WANT people to think I'm well put-together and mature. I WANT to look like I have my shit together, even when I don't. 

Sometimes you don't have the time or money to try to be creative. Shit, I basically rotate variations on the same few outfits to an event I attend every week. Because I'm tired before class and fucking tired after work. But every time I say ""fuck it"", inevitably I end up somewhere I didn't intend in my comfy old t-shirt or pants that don't fit. There is a video of me from Tuesday doing a trivia contest dance-off in my scrubs. &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

Thus, If you want the luxury of being lazy, take the time to work out a couple of outfits that are relatively comfortable and you know looks pretty decent. Once you have an idea of a couple of things that you could get away with wearing many different places, you can have these in mind whenever you wanna say ""fuck it"". Go pick the Trusty Old Outfit A pants and shirt from your closet. Slip on some flats or whatever and run out the door. Boom. Look at you all in public, not looking like you've given up on life. "

thebumm,todayilearned,1391148187.0,"Not gonna lie, I got a little lost with your last paragraph, so I'm rereading as I reply to stay level.


Okay, what I understand is if you're a committed Jew or Catholic, for instance, and go to Catholic heaven, but then someone baptizes you into Mormonism, you switch THEN decide Mormon heavens sucks, you can't go back. You may only if you're invited from someone of that church, is what you suggest?



That, my good man, cannot happen, from the Mormon perspective, or from my no-God-but-assuming-there-is-for-this-thread perspective. Mormons believe there is 1 heaven, 1 God. If you don't believe, that's cool, you just can't advance to a high level of heaven (Heaven is three levels). So, if you're a good person (Jesus will say yea or nay on that) you can still get into Heaven, just not all the way up (like you could if you're Mormon elite).




If you suck as a person, Mormon or not, you could be fucked. If you are a terrible person (Hitler, Stalin, Justin Bieber) and never got the opportunity to become Mormon, on earth or in heaven, you can still be in Heaven, but again not the top. This part is the weird one, because it seems that everyone *should* be afforded the opportunity to accept it, but that's only if living people get the work done. So if I live alone in the middle of nowhere and none of the obnoxious Mormon missionaries reach me on earth, and no one knows my name ore whatever to do this baptism for me after I die, I'm stuck in the lowest stage of heaven.




The only way you can go to hell, in Mormon belief is if you want to (feel too guilty to go to Heaven, guilt is huge in Mormonsim) or if you deny God to his face (i.e. pretty much literal there, or if you're like a Mormon elite, prophet or whatever, then change your mind and be a sinner/preach against the church and all that)."

JihadTape,malefashionadvice,1391148268.0,"I went to Nordstrom's and they had some CDB's in my size, so I said fuck it, why not. I tried them on, walked around, and it was literally the most uncomfortable my feet have ever been in footwear. This whole idea that ""they need to be broken in"" is a joke. No shoe can be broken in and drastically changed in the process. Breaking them in just softens the leather, perhaps minutely reshaping or stretching the uppers. But these boots are so far gone from comfort I will never understand why MFA has such a boner over them.


To be blunt, it's made me re-evaluate everything I see on this sub now. For instance, I bought a pair of Sperry Top Siders A/O in Sahara (basically the default summer shoe, I live in LA) and in the store they were pretty comfy. I get home and it feels like I'm walking on a pebble. Turns out the hard sole doesn't extend all the way to the back of the shoe, leaving this ""cliff"" of comfort that makes them unbearable. I just returned them.

My advice? Take whatever this sub dishes out with a grain of salt, and use the information as a very general guide. CDB's aren't nice, Chukka boots are nice. Sperry A/O are shit quality, but boat shoes without socks are fashionable, so move up a notch to a higher quality brand or model. (For instance, the Sperry Gold A/O, at nearly double the price, are worth every penny, yet no one here talks about them like they do the normal A/O)

tl;dr: MFA has style, but reverts to the lowest common denominator in that particular trend. Buy higher.

EDIT: I guess the downvotes confirm the circlejerk of this sub."

That's *some* resistance. After you know you can hold the pin with some resistance, you teach the pin escape, and the person practicing the escape already has resistance as their partner has been taught how to maintain the pin. 

You can do the same with punches, even if you're not throwing full force, or even quarter force, you should still be punching at a target that tries to move. Or, what really is a common problem, if you're practicing slipping punches, you should make sure that if you don't move it would actually at least hit your forehead.

There are certain figures like hot toys that sell out quickly and go up in price a good amount, but they don't just keep going up in value as far as I am aware. They are also in high demand on the second market like ebay so they tend to fetch a high price. I don't know how big the demand is for the hush line. Also check out amazon and even a local comic book shop. But ebay will most likely your best bet if you want to sell some of your figures your self's."

With softer bushings you can tighten them all the way down and keep cranking and they still have a lot of give, where hard bushings will have very little give from the start.

What controls your truck tightness / looseness besides the kingpin nut itself is the hardness of bushings, softer you go, the looser, the harder you go, the tighter.  

If you are riding pools I recommend the Bones Hardcore Medium bushings, but if you are just using the board for cruising and want nice tight trucks go with the Bones Hardcore Hard bushings.  

A plus for the Bones Hardcore bushings is that you don't need to use the bottom washer since they are built in, and they also make your trucks perform a hell of a lot better.  Stock bushings regardless of the company you buy your trucks from will always be lower quality than after-market bushings. "

Ayahuasca also touched me deeply on a spiritual level.

 He looks really excited as I am pulling up and we're smiling and waving to each other. As I got out of my car though his demeanor took a 180. He looked almost angry. He gave me a half-ass hug and said hi. Then he said there was a change of plans. We couldn't eat at this fancy place because he had to work. (Lie: He didn't have a job). So would it be ok if we ate at Wendy's. I begrudgingly said yes but I was really confused.

 So we go to Wendy's which is like 20 minutes away and when we get there he says he isn't hungry but I should get something. So I ordered a shake and paid for it. And we sit down to chat. He talked for a whole hour about himself. He never asked me a single thing about myself. Then he just said, ""Well, I gotta go. You can find a ride right?"". Went in to kiss me and I moved away ya know, because he was an asshole. Then he scoffed at me and said ""I didn't want to kiss you anyways you fat bitch.""

redwhiskeredbubul,PurplePillDebate,1391148850.0,"&gt;If you want to be successful with a 22-year-old, extremely attractive bar slut who’s going to go home with you that night, or the next night at the latest, and you’re not looking to get married ever, and you want to date six women just like this at once, none of whom will pressure you for commitment, you’ll be ten times more successful if you go at this with a Red Pill attitude, even though you might be turning off and chasing away other types of women. Likewise, if you turn that Red Pill stuff off and act “normal” (it’s debatable how normal and abnormal some RP stuff is – a lot of it is just plain jane confidence) you’ll be primed to attract a whole different type of woman, but at the expense of never attracting the type of woman Red Pill guys get.

Here's the thing: the reality with TRP is probably worse than this principle suggests. For three reasons. 

1.) Some men have unfixable disadvantages in dating--they can never be the macho hunk that's assumed as the end point. 

2.) Many men who attempt to live up to this standard will fail, even if they don't have unfixable problems. 

3.) In all probability,  TRP inherently selects for these first two types of men. 

In other words, my guess would be that the majority of men who take the red pill are seeing their chances of nailing bar sluts rocketing from .5 to 5 percent. It's like buying your lotto tickets in strips of ten: the psychological impression that it might work is going to be way higher than the actual benefit.  "

Urobuchi is a big fan of Kamen Rider to begin with, so I'd imagine him signing on to write a season was a big dream of his. There's a reason why people compare Madoka to Kamen Rider Ryuki."
gonjow,short,1391148889.0,"im doing just fine.  

first get over waiting for women to approach you.  that shit aint gonna happen son.  most guys dont get approached and the only ones who do really are the tall ones so get that shit out of your head right now.

you have to be the person that approaches and lets your interest known and be charming as fuck.  dont reject yourself for her.  you need to be the funniest guy in the room and avoid deferring to others if possible.

gotta by stylish as possible.  no kiddie shit like graphic tees and cargo.  get a real man's haircut.  nice tight fitting shirt and ironed pants with stylish boots are the best combo imo.  tall guys can commit the sin of slobbery and get a pass but not us.

and if you can... get huge.  not bodybuilder huge but ripped if you can.  the same female part of the brain still vestigial from the lizard days that responds to height also responds to abs shoulders and arms.  this is your ace in the hole because a great body trumps skinny or fat tall man anytime.  not to mention you'll look like a baller in your clothes too."

schencker,AskReddit,1391148896.0,"Having tried many different types of salvia many different times, I can say that a lot of the stuff you hear about it isn't true. In small doses (7x), all you do is laugh. You're still conscious of yourself and the things around you, but everything's funny, so you laugh for 5-10 minutes. When you get up to higher doses (I often opted for 40x), one of the first things that happens after taking your hit is feeling a pressure on your chest, exactly like someone pushing you into a laying position. It's not scary or painful, it's mostly just ""lying down? yeah, that sounds like a good idea."" Therefore, any stories you hear about people jumping out of windows or running naked down hallways prooobably aren't true.

I never had any bad trips on salvia or any other drug I've tried, and I attribute it to mental preparation. I don't take any sort of hallucinogen if I'm overly nervous or doubtful, I make sure I know what I'm getting into, I make sure that I have a safe space with everything I'll need beforehand...things like that. The closest I've come to a bad trip was about 4-5 hours after taking shrooms - someone had drawn a really big and ugly face in pencil on a bulletin board, and the more I stared at it, the more scared I felt. I had enough wherewithal to avert my gaze, though. I left the room, and everything was fine.

I think the biggest mistake people make with salvia is treating it like a party drug. It's *definitely* not a party drug. If you're babysitting someone who takes a hit of salvia, you'll basically watch them lie down and shut their eyes for roughly 10 minutes, possibly with small movements. It's not entertaining for others to watch, and if people work hard enough to freak you out, they could probably fuck up your trip terribly.

Actually, I often felt a sort of spiritual undertone with salvia, and during my last trip I was brought before some kind of ""salvia god"" who asked me why I was there and why I had music playing (I left my laptop open playing music, and it was interfering with the hallucination), then told me to leave and not return until I was ""ready"" to go deeper into the spiritual nature of the hallucinations. While I was uncomfortable during that trip, I wasn't scared or anything - I felt like a child being chastised by a parent or teacher. Also, I'm aware of how hippy-dippy it sounds to feel ""spiritual undertones"" in a salvia trip. I can't really explain it, but I've heard from a couple friends that experienced similar trips with salvia."

2) I am quick to blame women's flaws on their gender and make assumptions about them based on negative stereotypes. 

I'm kind of just starting to realize how much negativity toward women I have inherited over the years, and how toxic these modes of thinking can be for my own sense of worth. I don't want to build my identity around *not* being a certain way. I have this really strong need to prove myself by highlighting masculine qualities in me, to the point trying to be what I am not. In the long run, I know this will make me unhappy...yet my pride makes it really hard to change. My ego is so bent on trying to prove what a tough, independent, assertive, macho female I am.

&gt;This was never part of the opinion argument, remember you drew that conclusion. Your opinion is what hip hop as a whole is, not whether it was commercialized or not. His original statement of what real hip hop is, which I disagreed even though I'm sure it's a generalization, was his opinion.

It absolutely was. The thing that I pointed out was *not* an opinion was the idea that rap has been ""changed"" by commercialization and pop music. Which is fucking stupid, since rap has always been heavily influenced by those two things.

&gt;I mean, do I really have to explain this again? Once more, this was never even implied. Saying that commercialism has changed something doesn't mean that it never existed before that change. That was your own (wrong) conclusion that you're arguing against.

Except that it *didn't* change rap music as much as you seem to think it did. Rap has **almost always** been heavily commercialized and influenced by pop music.

The reason NFP_'s exist is to allow these organizations to carry on their activities without having to worry about paying taxes because they didn't spend all revenues they collected.

The remaining revenues are then used in future periods to continue their activities.

The reason they are NFP's is because the end result (profits) are not going to a benefiting party (investor(s) of shareholder(s))

In the case of the NFL, it is simply to separate the NFL, which is owned by the teams, instead of the other way around.

But let's go to your argument (valid, props) that there could be simultaneous multiple heavens. Mormons are therefore wrong in their belief and although I can't comprehend how, if they are wrong, they can still be right, I'll keep this assumption to entertain you. So, Mormons are wrong in that aspect, but their heaven still exists, for whatever reason. We also have Catholics and Jews and all other heavens too. Again, can't happen from their perspective, which means their whole religion and its heaven should be gone, but whatever.


So, Mormon heaven and Catholic heaven and Jewish heaven and all other heavens. Anne Frank is poster child for Judaism, so she's up there in Jewish heaven. Living Mormon Guy #7 baptizes her. She can decide yes or no. If she says yes to Mormonism though, she's buying that hook, line, and sinker so she (afterlife affords better perspective) can't go back to Jewish heaven, because if she buys Mormonism *Jewish heaven ceases to exist to her*. That's it. I mean, if she believes, truly, in Mormonism (which she'd have to to gain access to Mormon heaven), she's there, and that's all.



The baptism itself can only give options to the person, by its very nature. You can be baptized multiple religions while living and still only identify as one. I was baptized Mormon and don't believe it one bit (and didn't then either) and so I don't identify as Mormon. Some Mormons believe this will fuck me over because God will hold me accountable for all my [Mormon] sins. My understanding of their teachings though is that *if* they are right, God will know me enough to know that I never knew that they were right, and will give me a second chance. They honestly *could* be right, but I don't believe they are.


Catholics and Jews and Muslims *could* all be right, but the only entity that could ever know that would be God(s), were he/they to exist, so how can I be held responsible for the actions of other imperfect beings?"

The switch to Hardcore and Regular was a welcome one and the best possible fix that could have been done. That way, the people that want to use those exploitative techniques are able to against other people that have the same option. I, for one, refuse to do it and have played FP-only since the very, very early release of the mod -- the same way I played OFP, ArmA, and ArmA 2, and the way DayZ is meant to be played.

You're welcome to disagree about its legitimacy in the game, but there is no denying that it is exploitative."

tyhopkin,CHIBears,1391150094.0,"Marshall, Jeffery, Forte, and M. Bennett are plenty of playmakers.  Marshall/Jeffery are arguably the best WR tandem in the league, Forte is top 3 best all around RB in the league, and Bennett is easily top 10 TE.  2nd in points in year 1 of a completely new offensive system, I'm ok with that. Denver is at the top because of PFM.  They are able to run the ball because of PFM because teams don't line up to stop the run against the Broncos.  Aside from Demaryius and Welker, I don't think those other guys are anything to be jealous of.  IDK, maybe Decker too, but that is a stretch for me.  I would take our 4 that I mentioned over Denver's top 4 any day of the week and by a large margin.

Not trying to say this topic is moot or not worth discussing, but our offense needs consistency through 4 quarters, not more pieces.  We tended to struggle in the first half and still were 2nd in scoring.  Which I think will come with more familiarity with Trestman's system.  We have the pieces, now we need the reps."

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1391150412.0,"&gt;Stern was the owner of the Hornets so he should act in the best interest of the team when doing trades and that's exactly what he did.

Not really, also the commissioner of the NBA. Conflicting interests man.

On the other hand, their GM might've been a man with a plan.

Here's a better question: If Stern were in charge of the Grizzlies in 2008, would he have vetoed the Pau trade? Better question, after Stern vetoed the Grizzlies' offer in 2008, would they have ended up in better shape than they are now?

You guys lucked into Anthony Davis, who's looking like a future MVP in five years, but there was a man being paid to actually be GM. He obviously waited for the best offer, and he determined the Lakers' offer was better than what the Clippers had offered. Maybe he had secondary plans to ship guys out and tank and acquire assets like Boston is doing now. Maybe not. But I think it's silly to justify David Stern acting in spite of conflict of interests because your own armchair GM'ing determined one trade was better than the other (when obviously it wasn't from the perspective of a dude paid to make that decision)."
fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391150415.0,"&gt; I like to use this analogy. Let's say you're baking cakes. You bake two cakes, cake A and cake B, each with 20 of the same ingredients. You use different amounts of each ingredient in cake A and cake B. When the cakes are done, cake B tastes better than cake A. Which of those changes made cake B better than cake A? Was it just one change? Was it many changes? Furthermore, you know cake B is better than cake A, but if cake A is the worst cake ever made then that doesn't really tell you much about cake B other than the fact that it's better than the worst cake ever made?

Unrelated to my above analogy. Still addressed to CFRProflcopter.

This isn't an argument. I just want to point out the Scientist vs Engineer dichotomy of our analogies. 

Yours is the ""scientist"" way of thinking of things, and it's how I thought when approaching science in academia. ""Exceptions"" matter a lot in this context, because we don't have specific agendas. The only agenda is pursuit of knowledge itself.

As a professional who does business as well as engineering, results matter much more. ""Exceptions"" to rules matter if they are significant and have the potential to affect results. That's why we have six sigma and other tools for process improvement. The point is that we are consciously optimizing the results based on limited knowledge. 

So maybe it is just your scientifically-oriented mind.

EDIT: This topic you started brings up one of the many interesting differences I see often between the Western world and non-Western world. This obsession we have with taxonomy and methodology is often not shared by others. It's actually a huge point of conflict between the WHO and non-Western doctors. E.g. some non-Western doctors treat sick Africans and completely rid a village of a disease. They cared more for the results and saving the village, but their results and the studies/work they put into it is rejected by the WHO due to poor methodology. I tend to side on the WHO's side. In general though, I'm wary about taking things too far, and just encouraging people to twiddle their thumbs while we circle jerk to the pursuit of knowledge like we are doing here."

In fact my friend was kind of saying that her ex was quite comfortable staying ambiguously between genders - that they didn't feel the need to be totally male or totally female.

Anyway, this whole thing is very new to me. I only know people who are white or Asian, hetero (usually married) parents. I have to admit that it creates a bit of dissonance to make someone else's gender clear in my head. I mean, I'm sure that each individual has already sorted out their own requirements, but I kind of have to learn and understand as I go along.

thebumm,todayilearned,1391150426.0,"The choice in the Mormon perspective I talked about but it might be buried elsewhere. They afford the choice not on the belief they are wrong, but that they are right.



I mentioned before that they do it mainly to show the belief of a person, dead or alive. Because of the way the Mormon gospel/plan is structured, certain things happen on earth. Everything is connected, blah blah blah. Boil it down to God and person though, and God can just say ""Fuck my rule about being earthly baptized, come on in to heaven.""



The baptisms are for the people in heaven to *technically* achieve all of God's requirements (as taught by the church) to make it in to heaven. Methinks the teaching about the ""choice"" is mostly to alleviate just this trepidation about it. ""No worries, they have a choice!""



Really, they have a choice based on their life and circumstances. China isn't ""open"" to Mormon missionaries, so the church members assume Chinese people have, up to this point, no skin in the game. They can't be held accountable for not being Mormon yet, because they haven't been afforded the opportunity. People that don't believe, or believe in a different faith, are in the same boat. Mormons allow them to believe what they believe, because Mormons think that later, perhaps after they die, they will be confronted with the truth and choose the truth.



To me, that's pretty much the ultimate mulligan. If I'm sitting in Mormon afterlife lobby and they come up to me and are like ""Hey, you want to be mormon?"" I'll say ""You're ~~goddamned~~ right I do."" If I'm not sitting in Mormon heaven, to me, that's my answer right there.



But, also something I addressed in the last post, the choice is for the dead person/spirit too. Mormons teach guilt as the heaviest of burdens. Basically, after you die and get into wherever you get (heaven/purgatory) you will be feeling guilty if you are in the wrong place.



If I believe in the Mormon church, but fuck up a lot, knowingly, and never repent and stuff, I'll be too guilty to advance up the ladder to heaven. If I am NOT Mormon and commit a lot of sins (unknowingly in this case, because I'm not Mormon accountable) I will feel remorse in the afterlife, but no guilt, because of the accountability issue.




So the 'choice' is only called that because that's the 'best' word for it in all contexts. Mormons believe that you had a choice to come to Earth, too. No one remembers this choice because religion, but some had the choice to follow Satan and become tempters. Odd for them to pick *that* because I mean, God is good and right and omnipresent and omnipotent and everything, but they still made that choice for some reason. I guess chalk that word choice up to the craziness only understood beyond this realm.



But yeah, not a choice based on choosing if you believe or not, but choosing to accept the belief or not."

Skulder,teaching,1391150656.0,"Some years ago, still going to teacher's college, I took over a 9. Grade halfway through the year.

It's a different situation from yours, I'm sure, but the most important experiences might be similar.

I took 45 minutes to answer their questions about me, and every time I answered a question, I also asked a question about them, as a class.

I went directly to doing lab work (chemistry and physics), and started out with fun and safe activities (how many drops of water to a ml, how does litmus work), and used those activities to establish safety and rules (no spraying water on each other, esp. Not with the syringes that had just held acids and bases).

Lab work had the advantage that I could assess who was at which stage with regards to following instructions, working independently, and my reactions to their behaviour let them get to know me (I was extremely harsh towards those who broke safety rules, and very lax towards those who just had a hard time following directions or paying attention).

It all went better than expected, with a final exam grade above national average, and only one kid outright failing, out of 29.

 Berserkers greaves is also not a great idea because Vi really doesnt need the attack speed. There is also not really ever 1 build that will work in every situation. Builds are pretty much always situational so what you will build will vary from game to game.

You should really be looking at something more like SotAG, Randuins, SV/banshees, BC, Mobility boots/tabi, and guardian angel or sunfire or something.

You really dont need to build damage to do a good amount of damage on Vi because maxing Q does good burst just with her base damage and her W procs do % damage so it shreds anyone pretty fast, not to mention since E resets your AA you can proc W pretty quickly."

nyanyan_888,AskReddit,1391150948.0,"Well it's obviously a combination of corruption + too much space for first world countries to cover. If you visit the website I listed before it will show the improvements already achieved. These achievements also (most of the time) go towards the millennium development goals set by the United Nations. Most overseas aid also focuses most of the time in regional areas (the most poorest and worst effected) so it is generally hard to gather statistics and see an improvement in the economy (measured by growth/GDP) when they often have a traditional economic system and do not effect the country as a whole's statistics. Africa of course isn't the only continent/region that is in poverty, Australia for example often donates most of it's aid to Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It's also difficult for my country (Australia) to actually make the same difference as it has last year due to cuts in the fiscal budget for foreign aid. 

But of course corruption does happen like the misuse of spending. I can think of an instance where Australia (I think?) distributed aid to a country in which was given to the officials for improving the equality for women (through health/education) but due to the male officials in charge there was obviously some corruption. 

But overall it depends on the level of corruption in the country. Most developing countries will always have at least a medium level (with a few excepts) of corruption so it is difficult to avoid.

Boogie's got better numbers than LMA too, even ones that are actually hurt by being on a worse team.

Carmelo's team is 19-27.  How much of that is Carmelo's fault, how much of it is a matter of his supporting cast being horrid?

Did Durant outplay Lebron last night?  No, he didn't, not substantially.  Lebron's team missed open jumper after open jumper, and Derek Fisher of all people hit 5 3's.  The Miami guards turned the ball over more times than the entire OKC team.

Honestly reading your post it looks like you forgot a /s at the end because that's the kind of rhetoric that /r/nba should rail hard against because of how much utter nonsense it tends to be.

pizzaandburritos,japan,1391151347.0,"There is such a stigma against breaking boundaries and getting too much into people's affairs that sometimes people want to help, but they stop themselves. My mom fell once in Tokyo and hurt her knee really badly, but nobody stopped to help her. Granted, it was not a life threatening situation. But I think in that case either people didn't notice, didn't care, or didn't want to be ""wrong"" by helping. They look around and if no one else is helping they feel it better not to make waves by being the first one. It is something a bit more than the Bystander Effect, I think. It's not just a paralysis of not knowing what to do. I think sometimes there is a conscious train of thought that it is better to not do anything. For instance, people may have thought that my mom would prefer not to be helped because that would be embarrassing for her. People are really afraid to get into other people's ""personal business"" even when it is happening right there on the street. I don't even know if ""afraid"" is the right word. They just don't want to do it because they don't think it's right."

Also what I think a lot of people are forgetting is that at that range they would have no way to find out where he even is (they surely cannot see him) and he can just calmly kill one after another. 

Also as others have pointed out. The first few men will just die (or rather be exterminated / ripped to pieces) before even one shot was heard. Remember at that time they used to walk in a normal formation and just fill up the spots where one has died. If the sniper shot from the front he would rip through a few lines so maybe 5 - 10 would just die before one shot was heard. And following ""orders"" they would at first just fill up their ranks. 

Also after hearing shots from different directions (as the sniper will move after some shots) they will think there are more than 1 enemy and they will also react to that. Also seriously at that time in history what would the people think if people just died without a real cause (I mean they are used to seeing the enemies fire and then some comrades die and not having comrades just get torn to pieces out of nowhere)."

Work side by side with other feminists to make the world a better place. You are a woman, and feminism is your struggle too. It's just not exactly the same struggle. And that's okay.

I don't look at a house as an ""investment"" the way most people do. I look at it as a place to live. That's what it is.

The other thing to think about is, when you own your house, you can do whatever you want with it. even inexpensive like paint and lightswitch/outlet covers make a huge difference. But then again, I love doing DIY projects, you may not.

The flat part of Georgia is in the southern half of the state. [Atlanta is located toward the north of the state, in the foothills of the Appalachians](http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/mapcom/images/ga_h.gif) and, as such, has a lot of hills and cliffs. 

The city skyline is built along a ridge, and the streets in the downtown area are actually built up on bridges (Atlanta is a bi-level city, with two different street levels, but the ground level is mostly abandoned and closed off), so it *appears* flat in shows like The Walking Dead—but outside the downtown area, there is a lot of relief to the landscape, especially on the northern side of the city.

To illustrate, [this is a relief map of the Buckhead area (home to the northernmost cluster of Atlanta's string of skyscrapers).](https://maps.google.com.au/?ll=33.856518,-84.365215&amp;spn=0.059659,0.085316&amp;t=p&amp;z=14)"

Colres,explainlikeimfive,1391152042.0,"A resistive touchscreen depresses when you touch it. You can feel it doing so on older phones, as new ones generally have capacitive touch. When the top layer of the display is pressed down, it causes the depressed layer to come in contact with the layer below. Those two layers have horisontal and vertical lines of electrodes respectively. So first the layer with vertical lines of electrodes is powered with a voltage gradient, meaning each wire has a different voltage. The second layer is then measured, the voltage being higher or lower depending on which electrode is in contact with the layer and thus how far left or right the layers are in contact. Then the process is repeated with the horisontal lines, which provides information on how high or low on the screen the layers are in contact.

There are two main types of capacitive touch. The first is simpler, but less accurate. A capacitor is formed when two objects (called plates)are close together but are not in electric contact. If there is a potential difference (higher voltage on one side than the other) then an electrostatic field is created between them. You can (but if you're a physics major, shouldn't) think of it like magnets on opposite sides of a nonconductive material. They are holding each other in place. This type of capacitive screen forms a capacitor where you touch it, in effect your finger being the one plate, the glass being the insulator and a conductive coating on the other side of the glass being the other plate.

A capacitor in series with a resistor will when measured have lower capacitance than one without. Based on this principle, when you touch the screen the device can measure the capacitance from each corner, the measurement with the highest capacitance being the closest corner to the input and the measurement with the highest being the farthest away.

The second main type of capacitive sensing uses a grid of capacitors. Because of being in a grid, each individual coordinate can be measured individually. When you touch the screen, the electric field for nearby capacitors is changed. That change can be measured, and the affected capacitors can be pinpointed and correlated to a point on the display."

pizzaandburritos,japan,1391152052.0,"Yes, it is risky. In many situations women cannot even get away with it. If you want to be taken seriously you better have black hair, or at the max a very dark shade of brown. My friends who recruited for jobs in Japan all died their hair back to black for the interviewing process.  As a teacher I would not be surprised if you are not able to dye your hair even after you get the position. Many schools have strict rules about how their students dress, including restrictions on hairstyles, makeup, accessories, etc. Even in a school that is not that strict, you would be expected to set a 'good example'. Discriminating against people with dyed hair is taken for granted. 

When I was in high school and hired at McDonald's in Japan, I was shown a chart of acceptable hair colors. Even at a simple baito, you could not get your hair dyed even after you got the job. Interestingly, they showed me this chart even though I am half Caucasian and clearly it was not applicable to me. 

As a side note, I got mildly scolded/given a warning for having a restricted hair style at work. I had shoulder length hair then and needed to put my hair up in two sections so that the hair on the lower part of my head would not fall out of my ponytail. From afar, it looked like a regular ponytail. But somehow this broke the regulation. I was told only one ponytail was allowed. I think the rule was meant to discourage having pigtails but it was enforced to a T regardless. From my point of view, I did my hair that way to avoid getting loose hairs in food. Nobody seemed to care about that, so I had to change to having one ponytail despite the unsightly loose  hairs. "

Think about it.  Why would cities like Birmingham, AL or Atlanta, GA own and operate snow plows when it hardly ever snows.  They could have salted if they had gotten the correct forecast, but the snow ended up being hundreds of miles north of where it was predicted.  My family lives just outside of Birmingham.  They went to work, as if it was just another day.  They both have 4 cylinder FWD cars.  The roads they have to take to work, though they only work about about 10 miles away, are narrow and fairly hilly.  It took them about 6 hours to get from work back home, after ditching their cars and walking for most of the way.  FWD simply doesn't work when it snows, rains, then snows again, and the roads aren't salted or plowed."

schencker,AskReddit,1391152304.0,"I've stayed in a psychiatric hospital voluntarily for an 8 week program providing treatment for depression and anxiety. It wasn't very exciting, but it was a really good experience. Met a lot of good people that I still keep in contact with and learned a lot to help alleviate the symptoms of depression.

The most interesting people I met out at the smoke pit, because that's where people from all of the programs congregated - meaning I met people with everything from schizophrenia to alzheimer's to drug and alcohol addictions. A lot of these people were the kindest people I've had the pleasure of meeting, especially those from my ward (depression, anxiety, bipolar, personality disorders) and the PTSD ward. By the way, does anyone realize how common it is for LEOs and military people (sorry, I don't know the correct term for people enlisted in the military) to develop severe depression and PTSD? The PTSD ward was always at least 50% police officers and military people, and they ended up having to separate the police and military people from the ""regular"" people during therapy sessions because their stories were too traumatic for the regular people to hear. My interactions with police and military people there have forever changed the way I look at them.

A moment that's really stuck with me happened during a self-esteem ""class."" The exercise was to write your name at the top of a piece of paper and pass it around the room so each person could write a little complimentary passage about you. Then, when we got our papers back, we were asked to read the passages aloud and attempt to ""own"" the compliments. No one really ""passed"" the exercise. Most people either started crying or remained stone-faced as they read the compliments because they couldn't see any of those traits in themselves, and didn't really believe the compliments. So basically, it was a room of adults crying because they'd been complimented."

In fact, one time Manswers (I know, don't judge me), this ""scientist"" came out and said that the best way to tell if a woman who's hitting on you is really a woman, is whether their ring finger is longer than the index finger. If the ring finger is longer, she's a he.

Now, I'm a woman and my ring finger is longer than my index finger on both hands. So, it's possible that because of that stupid show a lot of people have been going around thinking that I'm a MtF transsexual.

What's weird is that I'm also *really* feminine. Like, super short, perfect .7 waist-hip ratio, large breasts, I don't put on muscle very easily, I have no noticeable facial hair, never had acne or anything, and I have really soft (almost child-like) facial features. No one would ever confuse me for a man. I have a rather low voice for a woman, but it's not low enough to be manly either.

Anyway that show had me more gender-confused than transethnic gender-queer/fluid MtFtMtF on Tumblr."

Also, being in the same state means that fans of the visiting team can easily travel to away games and add a lot of competitive tension.

heymomayeah,changemyview,1391152509.0,"In the real world of work is exactly when this sort of thing matters.  The whole point of attending a university and doing well is to one day be entrusted to do something of actual importance, where failure may very well have dire consequences.  If your child makes it into that position by exaggerating her actual competence with her boosted GPA, the likelihood of fucking something up is significantly higher.  This applies even more to the supposedly incompetent group members who end up with an A.  

Additionally, this is super coddling behavior.  I don't doubt that your child works hard, but it doesn't even sound like you've let her attempt to see how well she can do without your help.  There's not much of an objective way for you to know that your kid is as smart as you think aside from maybe test scores unless you let her do things on her own.  You also ought to consider that you've trained your kid to depend on your input in decisions.  I would totally accept feedback from someone I trusted, but I'd need to understand the rationale behind each change that person made and decide whether or not I preferred those changes to what I had originally written.  The way I've interpreted this post is that your kid sends you her final draft, lets you have your way with her writing, and hands in what you send back under the assumption that you know better than she does.  How can you expect your child to make good decisions if she's so accustomed to just doing what you want them to?  That may seem like hyperbole based on what you've said about how long you spend revising her schoolwork, but I have a hard time believing that you bother to read all her required reading (e.g. Moby Dick) just to spend a half-hour proofreading a paper.  I believe you've understated how much influence you have on what she hands in to her professors.

There's also a strong moralistic argument to be made - this sort of behavior almost certainly runs against whatever honor code your daughter's school abides by (which, if caught, could put your daughter's entire academic career in jeopardy), and is inherently unfair to students without the ability to use you as a resource.  That you don't feel even a bit guilty about how you're impacting others' collegiate experience is evidence that you aren't bothering to empathize with how hard college can be for some (which, I hate to admit, is understandable if you're as smart as you claim), or that you don't understand the extremely competitive nature of elite American universities."

Angry people tend to feel that they are morally right, that any blocking or changing of their plans is an unbearable indignity and that they should NOT have to suffer this way. Maybe other people do, but not them!

&gt; When you feel that urge, he suggests, picture yourself as a god or goddess, a supreme ruler, who owns the streets and stores and office space, striding alone and having your way in all situations while others defer to you. The more detail you can get into your imaginary scenes, the more chances you have to realize that maybe you are being unreasonable; you'll also realize how unimportant the things you're angry about really are.

I also try to stop focusing on the thing that's going wrong, and focusing on why it's making me so mad. I have setbacks every day but only some of them make me angry, I ask why? Usually because I thought it was supposed to be easy but it turned out hard. "

ImOldGregggggg,AskReddit,1391153114.0,"Photographer:

Good: I get to do what I love, get to meet really rad people in the industry, get paid well during the busy seasons and get paid to travel sometimes.

Bad: Crazy hours, often waking up at 7 and starting to work on processing photos and not stopping until around 10pm-12pm. Have to do all my marketing, accounting, etc. as well as other stuff. It's up to me to make all of my money so if I'm not booking gigs, I'm making no money. Also a lot of the work is seasonal. May-Nov I'll work 60-80 hour weeks, the rest of the time it's random.

Ugly: Really having to bend over backwards for even the most shitty of clients because negative word of mouth could drastically hurt my income. The many people that want free shit/ ask me to 'donate my services' to their fundraising event. No, sorry, if you can afford to pay your employees you can afford to pay me. Friends/family who get offended if I don't want to take photos of them for free during the months when I'm booked solid.

If heads of your comrades are exploding without apparent reason how do you think will they start to react. If suddenly during the night officers explode while in the camp what do you think will they start thinking? 

Remember the people at that time were still quite religious they would quickly assume something like the wrath of god. 

Also if you have never seen a sniper rifle or know of it's capabilities then it is impossible to even consider the options and capabilities of a sniper. They have no idea what to look for. For them it is impossible to think of a projectile that can be shot from 1.5 Km which has enough force to rip holes in people but then again isn't even visible afterwards. 

Even if they were to find a bullet they would think of it as a piece of scrap metal. 

You cannot fight an enemy you don't know. And there is literally no way they would ever find out who he is (except maybe by chance but even that is really unlikely). 

Why should they search almost 2 Km away for the source of the deaths? 

Yes he would lose if they had the information because he just clearly is outnumbered and yes he may not be able to kill every single one but I guess it's impossible for him to lose given the British know nothing and he doesn't have to kill all to not lose."

Getting and setting the height of an element is a little bit simpler with jQuery, but it's not remotely difficult in vanilla either; jQuery just saves you a few characters, and probably not nearly enough to justify its inclusion, from an overhead standpoint. I'm sure there *are* situations where you could justify including both, like if it's an animation-heavy application where you're using a lot of jQuery plugins, but if all you're doing is selecting and changing the CSS properties of elements sometimes, jQuery is more purely convenient than practical, since you can already accomplish these things with directives."

AdamColligan,askscience,1391153245.0,"If I could piggy back on this a bit (and ask if I have it right) -- one way in which I've understood this deformation can be expressed is to say that the presence of a massive object bends the time axis of spacetime toward it. 

This resolves an issue I have with the ""bowling ball on a sheet"" metaphor (if you're a marble, you'll roll down toward the ball); the issue is that on a sheet, the marble can be put in motion by the Earth's gravity, but out there in space, if you're stationary relative to the massive object, there's no extra force of gravity ""underneath"" spacetime demanding that you start rolling because you're on a slope. 

On the other hand, it seems easier for me to grasp that we are all moving at quite a clip along the time dimension, and if that axis is bent even slightly toward a mass, then even if we start out with no momentum relative to the mass to ""deflect"" toward it in the normal three dimensions, we will still ""fall"" into the mass. That is to say, when you examine my straight-line, no-acceleration (from my frame of reference) trajectory at an earlier point in time and then a later point in time, I will be closer to the mass at the later point in time. 

I can avoid this by accelerating constantly in space away from the mass, which will offset the fact that my timeline is angled a bit toward the mass. In that sense, a person sitting on a chair is a bit like an [aircraft crabbing into a crosswind as it comes in to land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMvLuUJFHYk). If I were sitting on a chair at the event horizon of a black hole, I would be maintaining an instantaneous acceleration to the speed of light in order to keep my timeline out of the black hole; any closer, and no amount of acceleration could do the trick.

Is this an accurate viewpoint? It seems a bit difficult to keep (relative) velocity and (absolute) acceleration straight in this context."

Her thesis glosses over the fact that there is a price to be paid for the extreme use of ""traditional Asian parenting"", in terms of mental health, in the modern world. For example, my father was sent to the US for college in order to help out his parents and siblings in Hong Kong, but in the end, his mother ( my grandmother), lied to him about how much money he owed her for decades and almost broke up my parents' marriage. This all in the name of ""success""! Today, my dad regrets his ""choice"" of career and is now unsure of where his home is (he faces daily discrimination in the US because of his non-native accent). In a lot of multiple-sibling Chinese families, there is an unending competition as to whose child is the most accomplished (on paper at least). To the point that parents become paranoid about their siblings and in-laws being jealous of their children's success, or the children end up despising their cousins. On top of that, not all Chinese American families are upper-middle class ones. Are these really the values parents should be imbuing their children minds with? Not for me. If I ever have kids, I will try to raise them to be Chinese American without forcing the negative things onto them in the name of ""success""."

I just recognize it as a problem for some people.

It's just a recognition that labour supply *is* a factor to consider, that I (as an immigrant) often find taken off the table completely even for mere discussion, especially among immigrants and liberal acquaintances.

The main ""problem"" I see here is that there's a zero-sum game. As one group gains, other groups have to lose out within any given Nash equilibrium. This occurs by necessity in competitive environments (e.g. capitalist ones).

It's possible for external factors to push our situation from one local Nash equilibrium to a higher one (*everyone* better off) though. Technology is a factor to consider, outside of American identity power struggles. That comes with its own issues though, like shifting burden of labour from lower skill to higher skill. Another is to take business opportunity from other countries. Taxing the rich/businesses/middle class some more and growing the gov't/military. Maybe, cultural paradigm shifts that are a lot more abstract to me. I don't know. It's a lot to think and talk about and i'm starting to get tired sorry."

You might be able to do a tasting here and there for new products, but that wouldn't be a steady source of income and besides, they want to get a wide sample. Most orange juice is not sold to connoisseurs, so you don't represent the target market. 

Maybe a better approach is to learn about different types of oranges and juicing practices so that you can be a consultant for the orange juice industry. Being able to see what kinds of oranges will make the best juice when weighed with other factors affecting profitability seems like a more valuable skill. You would have to learn about growing and processing oranges. 

Knowing a lot about a type of product makes you a good consumer...that's about it."

I remember feeling so sad inside thinking what kind of pressure I would feel if there was a doll of me like that. I feel like it would affect my entire image of myself and my body to the point where I wouldn't be able to distinguish the real me (being that your teen years are when you have your identity crisis as it is) from the manufactured brand. I no longer wonder at child stars ""going crazy"" because I can't imagine going through my teen years with an audience of millions to watch. I'm a big fan of Taylor Swift though.

mariesoleil,asktransgender,1391154453.0,"I'd like portrayals of trans people that don't focus on transition. Like a portrayal of a black person doesn't have to be about their experiences growing up black. Their skin colour might be mentioned, but it's not necessarily described in detail how it affected their life. For a trans person, it could come up occasionally but just be treated like a surprise, but not ultimately a big deal. 

I'm three episodes into the third season of Warehouse 13. There's a gay character. The first person he told was surprised. When another male character found out, he went crazy and started removing his shirt. The other characters thought he was being silly. 

Mostly bad portrayal: Dark Angel. In this episode, a main-ish character, (not a protagonist) briefly dates a woman. The main character (protagonist) and her friends discover the woman's purse which lets them find her ID with a male name on it. Their first thought runs to disgust and how they can embarrass their boss (the guy dating her) with the information. At no point does any of them hint that she deserves respect and privacy. Eventually they tell their (very conservative) boss and he doesn't mind at all. 

Mostly good portrayal. Bones. The skeleton they examine turns out to be a trans woman. One of the main characters (Bones) is completely cool with it and respects her identity completely. Another main character (Booth) is the complete opposite. He doesn't get the concept and Bones has to continually correct him. Bones is a well educated woman who is socially awkward. Booth is a backward Roman Catholic who isn't very accepting of those who are different. 

See the difference? One made me feel like a piece of shit for being trans, the other made me feel like it's less of a big deal. 

I recommend watching these two examples and whatever other ones you can find. Is the trans person portrayed mostly mocked, or mostly respected? Are characters corrected when they fuck up?"

It's  gotta be even more daunting when you're already established in something similar. Kinda like when Michael Jordan went to play baseball instead of basketball. Maybe that only happened in space jam but the comparison stays true. Everywhere else I've looked in your AMA I've seen shining confidence and a limber wit. But when you talked about this project that you'd like to do but just don't ever feel ready for, it's almost like you're a different guy. I understand that it's hard to potentially get criticized for doing something that you really care about. The thing is though, if you don't ever straight up start working on it, it won't ever get better. It's ok to take a risk, if people don't like it you aren't any less awesome than you were before. The opposite in fact. If you work hard outside your comfort zone, you'll become more awesome for having the balls to do it.

I'm beginning to lose my train of thought here. Damn world and its external stimuli. Really what I'm trying to say is to take a step back. Look at yourself and this project objectively, not passionately, and ask yourself what advice you would give someone else with this exact circumstance.

xthorgoldx,WritingPrompts,1391154990.0,"I've been everywhere in the galaxy. I've seen the shipyards of Octanus V and stood awestruck by the size of orbital facilities that generate a natural gravfield detectable by a baseline human. I've seen the fractals patterns of the Helsing Array and felt my mind reel in confusion as the swarm of solar power stations danced around a flaring star. I've seen the glittering spires and rolling hills of the homeworld, a planet that feels like home even to sapients born lightyears away.

I've been everywhere and done almost everything a Guardsman can do. I've killed more men than I can count, I've fought on more worlds than most people visit in their lifetimes; I've died three times and inhabited five different bodies in the last decade alone. I've fought monsters that defied logic and have sent weaker men gibbering with a glance. Some are dangerous out of their hatred for humanity, some are dangerous simply for existing. I've seen men ripped in half by the power of thought and ships swallowed by *nothing.* The universe is a dangerous place filled with dangerous things, and it's the duty of the Terran Guard to fight back against the chaos.

We'd been expecting resistance, of course. Humanoid anomalies were always dangerous to take down, they always fight back; this group in particular was believed to be the remnants of a genestealer clade that we thought we'd wiped out during the Centauri War. The operation, at the start, went smoothly, a textbook Class-C encounter. First, a directed EMP disabled any high-tier tech the target, a settlement in the mountains of New Titan, might have - fighting paranormal threats is hard enough without them having the same weapons you do. Then, the fun part - the drop. Five of us left blazing trails of fire in our wake as we screamed through the atmosphere, our armor glowing red with heat as we fell from space itself.

The first warning we had that something was going wrong was when Ash imploded into a sphere the size of a baseball. Jack and Miranda were next, killed instantly as bolts of coherent light ripped through their suits, leaving them to be vaporized as the heat from reentry rushed into the breaches.

I almost had time to scream as Peter, who was two hundred meters below me, tried to dodge the annihilation bolt that cut through the night sky, searching for and finding its mark. The last thing I remember was the blinding light as his power cell overloaded and blossomed into a fireball the size of a space station.

I came to in a sterile, white room. As I opened my eyes, three things became abundantly clear.

1. First, when I felt myself breathing, I knew that I was the mission's only survivor.
2. Second, when I felt my restraints, I knew that I had been taken prisoner.
3. Third, when felt her touch my hand, was that everything I knew was wrong.

2) Yes.  A lot of places have rules against dating coworkers.  So if management finds out you could lose your job.  Also if you do date then break up things will be incredibly awkward.  Trust me I've made the mistake of dating a coworker in the past and I dreaded going into work after the split.  

3) Just don't, seriously.  If you're dead set on it I'd suggest setting up something platonic first.  Drinks with coworkers or something like that where you can get to know each other first, then gauge if she has any interest.  But seriously don't do it.

4) Can't speak for how the women will gossip.  However you know how guy's ""gossip"".  Could range from indifference to crude comments/questions.

pizzaandburritos,AskReddit,1391155425.0,"First of all, everyone defines FWB differently and has different expectations for it. This is often the source of it falling apart. Do you hang out? Do you share feelings? Do you go on dates? How much do you expect to be 'there' for each other? Stuff like that is hard to navigate. You need lots of communication. Every FWB I've been in or witnessed has crashed and burned after a few months because of these issues. The problem is that two people always want different things. When you are a couple, you agree on the big things and you find ways to compromise on the little things. When you're FWB, it's harder to make demands or requests. Your needs don't get met, or your partner seems too needy. 

Case in point: I met a guy and we clearly liked each other right away. Very early on, he asked me what kind of relationships I go for. I had no idea because I was inexperienced. I kinda ended up saying I wasn't really ""a relationship person"". Anyway, we went on one date but the rest of the time, we just met for sex and talked in his apartment or on the phone. We liked each other as friends, I thought, so it seemed to be more than just a hookup situation. But he was habitually flaky. He was used to always making and breaking plans at the last minute, so that's what he did with me. I hated it, but I felt like I had no room to raise it as a point because I wasn't his girlfriend. Then my friend told me that even though he wasn't my boyfriend I should still set boundaries. That was a big breakthrough for me. Every relationship needs rules. In fact, the more ambiguous the relationship is, the more rules you need. Ultimately, he didn't really change and I got tired of being frustrated. One of the problems with FWB is that you feel like you don't really owe each other much. It makes it easy to use them or feel used. 

Sadly I had developed feelings for him by that point so it was hard to let go. Part of the problem, in hindsight, is that I would have preferred a traditional relationship. I just didn't know that because I was inexperienced.

Another experience: I was friends with a guy in college for a couple years. He had always flirted with me a lot but he really upped his game when he broke up with his longterm girlfriend. So we had sex a few times. No hanging out to speak of. That was a booty call arrangement as far as I was concerned. I eventually started to ignore him and was probably really terrible to him because I didn't communicate why. I don't know what he wanted to this day. We never talked about it. In hindsight I realize that the reason I saw it as ""just sex"" is because I had no real affection for him. We were sorta friends, but we weren't emotionally connected at all. That's ultimately the issue with FWB though. The thing that makes it a FWB situation and not a booty call situation is that you feel something for each other. Well, sooner or later that feeling will grow and one of you will be hurt. My advice is to either go for a strictly casual sex arrangement or a relationship. The grey zone with FWB is hard to navigate."

The same way a judge can make an error in law that influenced the guilty verdict, warranting a new trial, a judge can make an error in law that influenced an acquittal. 

If a judge excludes evidence from a trial that should not have been excluded, why is it unfair for the state to appeal?  The point of a trial is to find the truth, isn't it?  The process produces that truth, so if the process is wrong, it cannot produce a reliable result. 

It's not just a ""sensibility"" at play here, it's totally devoid of logic or reason. You just like your system because it's your system and therefore must be superior. 

What sort of standard exists for an appeals court to overturn a verdict on the merits of the case?  Because it should be sky high. "

You could try doing a sixty four inch bow, but that's kind of short for a first bow. The point in this is that your bow will need to be braced at six to seven inches, and a shorter or longer string (adjustable by twisting) makes for different brace height.

A bow that is made too heavy too short will fail. The bow I just posted works in part because it only pulls thirty to thirty five pounds at twenty six inches. I can pull i safely back to twenty eight, but it starts stacking (increase in weight slows) after twenty six inches. If I had tried to make it a fifty pound bow there's no way that short thing could have held together at that draw length, and using a short enough draw for such weight to work just wouldn't be practical (probably a fourteen inch draw or something)."

Get as many people on board as possible for other delegations. Even if it's something stupid. Get everyone involved that you can, because it will help in the long run. If you only have two people doing compressions, you're a lot worse off than if you have 3 or 4. And people often forget how important it is, especially after a MVC, to maintain c-spine.

At the same time, this is also the **dis**advantage of the system. You need to be persistent and strong to not only take different courses, but also change schools at the same time, with everything that entails (friend groups etc.).

The Gesamtschule concept gives you a system like in the US, where you can have just different courses for good / bad learners. Experiences in Germany show that this is less efficient than the old German system. Nobody likes the Gesamtschule, at least I wouldn't want it for my kids. It's also worth noting that the proponents of Gesamtschule for ideologic reasons usually don't send their own kids there.

The Orbit Sweet Mint flavor is a really weak mint. Not the kind you chew to get fresh breath. It's more reminiscent of bubble gum with a bit of mint flavor. I don't like strong minty flavors so I like that it is mild. It doesn't make your mouth feel cool or mentholy.

We smoke this fucking thing and then it's like ""Man, food"" we walk into town, go into subway at fucking lunchtime on a thursday. I've never seen so many people in a subway, it was as if they were assembling for a sandwich convention.

Now, I didn't have any money but I knew I had a load of points on my sub card - I wanted a footlong but I didn't know if my points would afford it. I'm not entirely sure what came out of my mouth when I tried to hand the card to someone who wasn't a subway worker, but they didn't seem all too happy.

Eventually I get to my turn to order ""Man, how much sandwich is on this?"" I utter to the guy, he checks. Fuck yes, a footlong.

Now, I completely forget the words for ""Meatball marinara on honey oat"" so ""Cheese and balls on brown"" will do, fits of giggles ensue. I somehow manage to get through my order, getting ""Yeah man, salad, all that salad"" and ""Maaaan, onion sauce"", I grab the sandwich and sit up at the wall - zoned out reading the fucking wallpaper.

My buddy gets my attention ""Dude, are you gonna eat that, we've been in here an hour""

Best sandwich ever, I decided to go to the garden centre after to smell the flowers then a small child kicked a Buddha statue and I lost my shit, went home and watched some tv."

The factually incorrect part is his graph at the beginning. Go look at it. To get the 450% stat she trumpets, she compares the left bar to the right bar. But -- go look -- those are the wrong numbers to compare. Instead of comparing hospitalized low-risk women to homebirth low-risk women, she compares them to all-risk (as opposed to low-risk) women.

Some people do not need the paper. Some people need the learning. For some people, the paper is a hindrance, and reduces quality of life and quality of education.

In my case, despite learning a LOT in college and ultimately winding up in a pretty good career (although admittedly without any real advancement prospects), I never graduated after six and a half years of college. Meanwhile I racked up almost six figures of non-dischargeable debt, and went through periods of depression so severe that at one point I had to be treated for suicidal depression.

Some people can benefit from education but do not benefit from paper chasing. I learned so much in college that I think that every -- well, not every, but maybe 50% -- penny I spent was worthwhile.

Ok, rant over! Disclaimers: No hard feelings, I understand your point, and I am not under the delusion that my story applies to everyone."

Some of your argument is legit. I'd prefer to have more useful maps or be able to measure out and plan a building without the F3 text there. 

Then there is this. In real life, if I was coming to visit your home, I would turn to you and ask, ""Hey, what is the address of your house?"" and then I would plug it into my GPS and go there unless I knew the area in a way directions are meaningful.

I was a pretty intelligent kid and I would rifle through their stuff when they were not home and check to see how much they had in their bank account and what bills they were late on. As I got older, I would help them out with bills, food, utilities, etc. From what a I remember seeing on their income tax returns, my parents made a combined amount around $12k per year. 

What pissed me off the most was two of my older siblings (I'm the youngest) having the audacity to tell me I never knew or understood the how poor our parents were, and that I was, essentially, clueless to the situation. Assholes. 

I still help my parents out with all their bills, despite me going to school and working two jobs. I love them and they're supremely important to me. I'm a first generation American and they sacrificed their livelihood to give me and my siblings a better life in the states. I owe them so much for everything they have done for us.

The first time she said no after I asked her, I didn't feel betrayed or anything, just very sad and stuff. We still chatted online every day, though. What happened was, she said she did like me a while after that, and we talked a lot, and said a bunch of stuff that I don't think friends say to each other.


Then, she went off to the camp, and stopped liking me in such a short while. *That* was what made me feel betrayed, because I feel like she lied to me. And I definitely still want to be friends with her, but like I said, she's been ignoring me ever since then; and the main reason I asked her was because I enjoyed her company, not just because of her looks.


Also, I don't really view girls like that, don't worry. When I said ""anybody"" I didn't just mean girls, I meant everyone. Before all this, I wasn't the most talkative guy, but it's worse now.

If someone dislikes your words, ask them why. If you can see the truth of why, you can reflect upon what you might have done unskillfully. But, otherwise, if you're putting forth your words with right intention, with the most skillful means you know of, rejoice in that effort.

I believed something like that too for a while. I'm still open to the idea, but I've become more unsure of what I really think about it lately. I think that ""Abortion is does not kill a soul, it's a means of denying that soul entry into that body and the life it would have lead in favor of a different one,"" would be a better way of phrasing what you meant. 

So if you'll forgive my rambling, I'd like to share my pondering of this. As for fetuses having souls or not, one would think that those who don't believe in souls would be more against abortion than religious people. Without a soul, there isn't much to separate a fetus from a conscious human being. All the ingredients for a complete person are there from the beginning, and to terminate a pregnancy is to permanently end an existence. If you believe in souls, an abortion would be easier to justify. You could rationalize that ending the pregnancy wouldn't be the end of the soul itself, just the end of that vessel. So I don't really get the logic behind nonreligious people typically being pro-choice and very religious people being pro-life."

There is a difference between being a mentor and being a person's only resource. One could give him the benefit of the doubt and say he meant well. But from everything else you say it is evident that he gets some sort of thrill from controlling them. 

I don't know if he could actually be penalized for these things, but I do think it is worth bringing up with someone. (Maybe after you are done with your class, so it doesn't hurt your grade or performance.) At least put it on people's radar. He sounds like the kind of guy who does a lot of creepy things here and there without every quite crossing the line. He may never get in trouble per se but it needs to go on record that he is a creep. What about the next woman who falls prey to him?

asstasticbum,pics,1391158561.0,"&gt; Let's do the best we can to train a whole bunch of people to kill other people

That is NOT just we are trained for. We only kill as a last resort on a mission like that one. Being in the military is not about killing. Its about protecting, preserving and defending our countries way of life. Sadly, its also about fighting wars we do not agree with and do not feel that we should be mixed up in; they are wars that are brought about by men and women sitting behind desks in suits that you as normal citizens either put into office or did nothing to keep them out of office.

We as soldiers do not pick and chose our battles. We don't sit in a Starbucks outside Ft. Jackson South Carolina browsing CNN, Fox News and the likes of and submit requests to go to places we feel people need to be killed or feel that there are injustices taking places. We take orders, like you do at your jobs everyday; and there are days when you disobey orders and you run the risk of making the right decision for your team and the risk being rewarding, a success, a victory or your risks fails and you and your team are reprimanded for it. But when you in the private sector take that risk and fail the odds of you taking a RPG, an IED, giving candy to a school child that kicks a soccer ball at you who's back pack is loaded with explosives and you watch your best friend blow up before your eyes are pretty damn slim. 

These are the risks that we chose to take on your behalf to keep you in the freedom lifestyle that you accustom to, so you can sit here on reddit at 0348 on 31/01/2014 and debate the very topic. So if you do not like what the military does I offer you two statements of advice, one of sound logical sense and one of harsh words.

1) Blame the politicians and vote them out of office. Be a vocal opposition to the right people, the people in Washington, not the soldiers who have their orders and are doing their jobs and while they are doing their jobs they are thinking of doing the right thing for their countrymen, to stay alive, to prevent innocent civilian deaths every possible time (in this instance is was not possible) and keep your brothers and sisters in one piece to return to the families. 

2) Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. If you are not a part of the solution you are a part of the problem. If you are not willing to do anything other than as /u/Ameerrante said and be a ""keyboard warrior"" then live with it.

Good night.

Nobody shamed me for being a virgin but they didn't have to, I took care of that all by myself. Hated it when friends talked sex because I couldn't relate at all.

But after I started having it turned out to be just sex. It's just another part of life. It's a physical and emotional need, much like food and shelter and friends. It's not some insurmountable mountain which you can't live without traversing every day. It's just two people rubbing funny looking body parts until they spasm a little and then go to sleep, or eat nachos or whatever.

Sure, it's nice and all and I absolutely love every sweat-soaked second of it. But it's rarely such a big deal that people make it out to be, especially young males. 

We'd do good to let off the pressure a little bit. Maybe we shouldn't be preaching the importance of losing your virginity. It doesn't have to be with someone you love, it doesn't have to be perfect. Preaching that just seems to add to the pressure."

Great, now I have to clean up quietly so she doesn't ask why  there is pee on my bed.

I go upstairs, say hi, grab some paper towels and just when I am behind both of them and neither of them are looking, the condom falls off and right onto the floor. I look down, quickly pick it up and get the fuck back to my room before they see anything.

It's not about your ability to stick you dick in somebody, but rather the desire we all have as men to spread our seed,  pass on our genes. 

You sound like you're a man that's given up just because you've had two girls you can say were relationships, but didn't lead to anything sexual, while trying to sound like you've come to some kind of epiphany about how it's all over rated. No, you've just given up. 

It really isn't about anyone else's obsession about sticking their dicks in someone, but yours. The reality is, you care, deep down inside, behind your new found non chalant attitude, you care a lot. Which is actually fine and normal. 

You've said yourself that you're not exactly a looker, and your interests are quite narrow in terms of being of any interest to many women, maybe instead of lying to yourself about having the opposite sex find you desirable not being important, you should change those things that put you at a disadvantage, if it can be helped. Face it, if you aren't asexual, and I really don't think you are, it really does matter what the opposite sex thinks of you. 

You're on a path of setting yourself up for failure, and you're going to wake up someday worse than you are today, and you're going to hate women, you're going to be anti-social, and you're really going to be one lonely son of a bitch who pretends he is just so different that no woman can understand his intricate mind, while stuffing your face with pizza every night and lurking online.

MericaMericaMerica,AskReddit,1391159629.0,"Late to the thread, so this will likely get buried, but I have a similar story.

In January 2012, I got a new roommate, and after a few months, we became friends. By the Fall, we were really close. 

He had a girlfriend when we first met, but they broke up by May. He claimed that they had never had sex, that he was a virgin, and that he was waiting until marriage/long-term commitment (which was odd, because he is an atheist) out of fear of STDs and/or pregnancy.

Apparently, by October of that year, his ex had come to believe that he was secretly gay, which is why he would never fuck her. (Personally, I wouldn't have fucked her either, considering she was very unattractive.)

A few other things happened in November and December, such as him telling me a story about how ""his two cousins"" jacked off together at their grandmother's house in middle school, etc, that made me suspect that he may, at the very least, be bi. Whatever, I have another close friend who's a closeted bisexual; therefore, I don't think much of it.

In December, as his engineering co-op was ending, meaning he could access his university housing scholarship again, he began to prepare to move out. Three times during this month, while I was browsing the internet, doing homework, etc, he came into my room, jumped into my bed, and wouldn't get up until the morning when he had to leave for his co-op. This was despite the fact that his room was less than five feet away. I would give up after awhile and go sleep in the living room on the couch, but something about his body language, etc, suggested to me that he *really* wanted me to climb into bed with him.

This was inherited from laws about copying other copyrighted works, like books or VCR movies, where possessing the copy is, I think, legal (not sure about the purchase itself though, if money changed hands that's probably illegal) but creating a copy is not.

The DMCA changed that though. In some cases, I think, for the better - such as redefining the point of copy. In many cases (take down notice procedure, severity of punishment), though, I think it has failed horribly."

So I understand the impulse to keep it from him, because it will hurt him. If it were a kiss or just once, I may be inclined to say don't tell him, it will do more harm than good. But it was an affair. That's different. He does deserve to know.

This is a very difficult question to answer. I was in a similar situation pretty much 3 years ago. 

My experience tells me that it is almost impossible to get her out of the head. Best advice would be to find another girl and get interested in her maybe start a relationship. 

Honestly I still cannot totally get her out of my head even though I've come to terms with it and accepted that we will probably never be together as a couple. Sounds weird but we are just best friends and I guess that's how it will be. 

What helped me at that time was talking with my friends. Really talking helps a lot. Also you have to accept that it won't work. 

It would help you if she herself would say no so maybe you just really have to ask her out / admit your feelings for her. 

You will either be happy (if she says yes) or be sad if she says no. But any way it will be easier for you to get over it if you know she has not interest in you. 

Apart from that really the only advice I could give you would be to find another girl. Because as long as you don't have another girl you will always fancy the thought that it might still work out and you just end up waiting and walking after something that will probably never come true. "

As long as the actor somewhat resembles the hero I've been reading about for however long, I'm fine with it. But when they completely change what it is my character does and who they are(Deadpool), or completely change how they look(Quicksilver), or kill them off for no real reason(Cyclops). THEN I have an issue with the movies. It's not because wolverine isn't running around in blue and yellow spandex. It's because Scott's younger brother is older than him. It's because Jean killed the prof and Cyclops. It's because Deadpool isn't a combination of Baraka, Wolverine and Cyclops. These are why people don't like/agree with the X-Movies. Not because of what they're wearing, but because of how they're changing the story(ies) they know and love. 

It's different rules as far as other book to movie adaptations go because until now(DoFP), they had never taken an actual comic story and put it up on screen. They've already changed a major factor of the story and that's sending Wolverine back instead of Kitty. I understand that's what sells the tickets, but imagine if they had done that for the Hobbit movies coming out. I'm not sure who's more popular, legolas or aragorn but I'll go with Legolas for this. Imagine they had swapped out Bilbo for Legolas in the Hobbit movies. Because Legolas would sell more tickets than Bilbo would. It'd be a cool movie, but it wouldn't be The Hobbit. It'd be The Elf.

Listen, life isn't always fair, and it certainly doesn't give a shit about your feelings, putting your hurt feelings on a pedestal and calling it discrimination doesn't change the fact that you just don't like being made fun of. 

Everyone gets made fun of, for something, at some point in their lives. You know what they do? Suck it up and deal with it. 

No, I'm not saying because you're a man you can't feel. I'm saying shitty things will happen, or people will make you feel shitty, but you can't always just see that as an opportunity to wallow in self pity and cry foul. 

In this context, about guys busting eachother's balls about not getting laid, honestly, it's pretty mild.

I just don't like PvP. For too many people open world PvP is to kill lower players while they try to level. So the only chance is to log to a different character to fight the ganking player. But that's pretty annoying, because I actually want to play my lower character.

The other part of PvP is often just some kind of battleground, now I am not a hardcore RPG player, but I just don't see any sense in playing capture the flag or something like that in limited teams. Especially if winning the game is worth nothing, nothing in the world changes.

Bunny hopping players who run through me to get behind me is another part of PvP I usually don't like. I want the game to be more about the character and less about the player who has to be able to turn around fast enough, because the enemy runs straight through him.

GaProgMan,cringepics,1391161911.0,"See, this is the problem: some guys think that the only way to get a girl is to be nice to them. That means that people who are genuinely nice and have no agenda (I'd hope that I fall into that category, but I think that I'm more of an asshole) have a hard time trying to get across that they don't have an agenda.

Sometimes people, regardless of gender, are nice to people because they are nice to people.

It really bugs me when a guy-friend (and it's only ever guy-friends who will do this, in my experience) will come to me and complain that

&gt; I did everything right: I complimented her, I helped her out, I fixed her computer, I got rid of the guy who was giving her a hard time, blah, blah, blah.

My response is always: ""If you did that for me, I'd think you were a good friend. I wouldn't think that you wanted to sleep with me.""

&gt; But you're a guy!

The_Fart_Of_God,summonerschool,1391161982.0,"These are the main harass strategies lvl 1-3 : against all adc/supports, push your first and minion wave so you get lvl 2 first. This is important as lvl 2 is a huge powerspike for lulu against adc since they are so squishy and you suddenly get so much range. Therefore don't hesitate to use Q to push the first wave, and tell your adc to push. Lvl 3 I like to put a second point in Q to get even more annoying. The only time I pick W lvl 3 is against leona as you can counter engage her lvl 3 allin if you W her while she E.

Against cait you wanna wait to see if she can orbwalk before trying to harass her. If she can't get one free auto + Q every time she tries to last hit. If she retaliates you get hit once with the damage reduced from masteries + doran shield and she got hit once + Q. If she Q too she will push the lane and you'll come ahead in the end. Stay far from her before lvl 2 would be my safe advice. Take notice of her traps, proc them with your E as an auto shield when she's far enough so you don't get hurt. If she can orbwalk stay close to your adc, Q her, and attack her both at once. Never do this against alistar though.

against a vayne just auto + Q + auto and she'll be half hp if your pix damage got through. vayne half hp will not try to cs anymore and you can zone her out and tell your adc to freeze the lane. You should never lose to vayne from lvl 1 to lvl 6 (after lvl 6 it's another story but you should be well ahead by then).

against ezreal it's a bit tricky as he can deal a lot of damage with his Q so you have to use minions as a shield and predict where he will land his next auto. If you win the mind game you win the lane but it can be difficult against a good one. try to get lvl 3 before him so you can land some Big lvl 2 Q on him and zone him out. Remember to always use your minions as shield.

against ashe, be careful of her early burst when she got 100% crit as one auto + W will hit hard. Once again use minions as meat shield and hit her from far in the meantime. (her range is bigger than yours). Get some free autos when she tries to last hit but be careful. I would wait lvl 2 to E + Q her really quick to scare her, then a couple of auto when she backs away.

against varus, depends on what he leveled up first. If he's smart he picked E first and the slow will be a pain in the ass and will get you autoed a lot for free. If he didn't destroy him with autos and Q. Lvl 2 he can outdamage you so poke him with E, back away, and land a safe Q from the back lane. When he runs away go in for some auto attacks but don't be greedy as you'll get hurt if you get caught in his E.

against graves. I don't know nobody plays him anymore. I think he has more burst but?? in theory stay away from his dash range and team up with a long range adc to poke him.

against tristana, force her to jump away and zone her out of cs like you would for vayne. When you get lvl 2 she can't do anything.

against miss fortune, she out trades you early, but you can shut her down post lvl 3. Stay away from her double up and attack her when it's on cooldown

against jinx, don't try anything before lvl2. at lvl 2 E her, wait a little and go back. Aim carefully your Q and try to aim for and and her support at the same time. Never go in autoattack range she will fuck you up. Ideally you want to alternate your harass with your adc so she gets overwhelmed. Problem is her support will most likely go all in. Your saving grace is if her support is bad and you get to harass him instead of her, making the lane 1v2.

against lucian, wait lvl 2 before doing anything fancy. One passive and he wins the trade. Wait for him to use his Q before trying to autoattack. Your best bet against this guy is to not stay too close to your adc so that his Q can't hit both of you. Land autoattacks when he Q your adc or your minions and shield yourself to absorb his passive.

against sivir, you outdamage her lvl 1 but she destroys you lvl 2. Stay far enough of her so you  can dodge her boomerang blade but try to bait it so she pushes your lane and uses her mana. When you reach lvl 2 E + Q her. When she reach lvl 3, you can bait her shield by E her and waiting for her shield to go back on cd.

against twitch, he's got a better lvl 1 than you so stay safe until you can E him. Your E will reveal him when he goes invisible and you can cast it in reaction when he tries to go invisible. If you can stay out of his reach and poke him from afar thanks to E+Q you should be able to manage him. Really depends on your adc and his support though.

against corki, you will have an easy early game as you got more range than him. His power spike really comes lvl 6 and yours comes way before. The main skill matchup is to dodge his Q which is doable since it not instant anymore. If you want to remain safe just safe your mana until lvl2, E him while he last hits, walk away and secure a Q

never played against urgot. If you ever play against urgot in current patch, this guy is probably experienced so be careful.

against quinn : don't try to be fancy, she outduels you hard at every level unless your adc do something about it. Quinn is one of the best lane bully in the game, her problem is that she isn't good in teamfights.

When you reach lvl 4 is the time the enemy jungler might visit you as you've been so annoying and their botlane have called for help for sure. Traditionally the jungler will gank mid or top first unless it's a fiddlestick ganking lvl 2 after the second wave. If it's the case you're probably gonna have to burn a flash and chug a potion, and chances are you or your adc are giving first blood. If however the jungler didn't come before you reach lvl 4, chug your mana potion and stop harassing for a while until you know where their jungler is. Whenever you see him you get a few choices : first of all ping the jungler

if he isn't close to your lane : back to harass, but be safe with your mana, keep enough to QEW.

if he is ganking your lane :

Either you're too far from your tower and you got to run : W yourself or your adc (the one most likely to get caught) and Q the closest enemy. Use E as a shield and most likely use it on your adc so that he can retaliate with the added damage of pix.

Or you're far enough from the enemy botlane to kill the jungler. EQW autoattack him while your adc auto and uses whatever spells he likes. When W runs out is when you start kiting and when the enemy botlane should be reaching you. If the enemy botlane didn't follow up on the jungler : kill him. If they did start backing. The timing will most likely always be when W runs out so you will have to react to a lot of variables : did the botlane follow up on the jungler? is the jungler low enough to be killed? is your adc doing anything? who is the most likely to die, you or them?

Note that it's sometimes smart to Q the minion wave so that they can't tower dive you. Some games you're just too much of an annoyance and they will gank early with their mid too. a 4v2 gank under a tower will result in a couple of kills for you if you play your cards correctly. You can also run away and nobody gets hurt.

Never use W on the opponent when you run away/chase. Always use it on you and Q your enemy.

Come late game, your adc should be decently fed, sometimes he isn't. It doesn't matter that much. Find the most fed carry of your team and become his bodyguard. Always use all your skills / items to protect and peel for your teammates. Your ult is best used when someone is getting focused and lots of champions are gathered around him so you knock them up and give your team time to react. 

Items by the way should be :

coin / sightstone / mobility boots / mikael crucible if they have cc / locket / all other items will depend on their team composition

Whenever you buy sightstone, sell your ward trinket and get the red trinket.

Ideal teamcomp would be malphite orianna an adc and a jungler with lulu.

I really like to lane with vaynes ezreal and caitlyn. But lulu can carry all adcs.

pro tip, lulu auto attack make a very distinctive sound. When she auto attacks and her pix lands it makes a kind of music. Try to find a music with a bpm close to her autoattack speed and listen to it when playing lulu. I recommend electroswing like grammatik, parov stelar, caravan palace but I'm sure lots of music style fit this sound."

Pure damage? Stopping power? Rate of fire?

Because the M4 is increasingly less common, which is good, but in all my encounters a Mosin is a LOT more deadly. I've been killed a LOT by mosins and rarely by M4s, because M4s have to be a lot closer, they have a high rate of fire, but are less accurate even when single-fired.

While a mosin can be shot from a safe distance, is very accurate (and now has a compensator so its even more so) and often is a one or at most, two shot kill. I, personally, consider the Mosin to be a lot more dangerous.

I wonder if there is a metric anywhere noting how many kills each weapon has, because i would be very interested to see the compared kills between the mosin and the M4."

It's when I feel most like myself, ambitious, powerful. Then I gather my things. I check myself in the mirror, *so much makeup now*.  The door opens... 

   Within five minutes, it's over. Tonight, he didn't even watch me performing. He just sat there, cradling his forehead in his hands. When he spoke, he sounded so tired, so underwhelmed. My training kept me smiling but I should have saved him the time and just left. He told me I wasn't a character actor. He told me I was beautiful but not a leading lady.  The guy said it wasn't his decision whether or not his agency picked me up, they had to make decisions as a team. All in all, he told me I was of no use to him. 
And every second, I'm aging. Every second is one less chance. The anxiety builds and then is suffocated by denial and delusional self-assurance. Every day as a woman if one more shade of gray. One less day of beauty. One day closer to being one of the forgotten many. 40 and suddenly worthless because females can only sell youth. 

The real problem is that I went all in and didn't prepare a back-up career. So one day, you'll see me, smiling in a hallways somewhere, having a few lines in a movie... and ten years from now you'll ignore me completely in my tattered rags begging for change. Whatever. I chose this.  "

Considering Dragic is the #1 guy on his team (especially without Bledsoe) and Lillard is probably not the best player on his team, and coupled with the fact that the Blazers aren't that much better than the Suns (5 games is significant but not massive) it's really hard to argue Lillard deserves it more."

IndieLady,AskReddit,1391162937.0,"We got a computer when I was in high school, I think I was one of the first in my class. It was such an overwhelming and confusing thing that the company we bought it from sent a man to our house to set it up and show us how to use it. At this point it was all MS DOS commands and floppy disks. The game that everyone loved was [Summer Games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zDwjctkF5w). I was really good at the pole vault. I don't think I typed out essays for school until maybe my final year or two, everything prior to that was done on paper

In primary school we had ""computer class"" where all we did was type commands into some kind of program to draw things. From memory, you would type the number of steps and something like ""NE 27"" to turn the cursor, although it wasn't a cursor. That was what ""computers"" meant. Just weird random shit.

When I was 19 I sent my first email to a friend in Scandinavia and it BLEW MY MIND. I kept asking my sister, ""so, they've got it? Right now? No waiting?""

Websites in the mid 90s - or the websites I frequented - were pretty much the equivalent of blogs. It was all personal websites and academic articles, business didn't really get in on the action until the late 90s. And they would load so slowly that I would literally go and make a cup of coffee to kill time whilst one image loaded.

pizzaandburritos,LetsNotMeet,1391163080.0,"This is really creepy. First things first: don't second guess yourself. Write/talk this all out, clear your head. You are not overanalyzing. It is very common to convince yourself that it's not worth reporting, but don't let that be the reason you don't report it! However, I can understand wanting to drop the issue if you feel like that is the best for you. Do whatever it is that makes you feel safe. It doesn't matter who you inconvenience in the process. You are dealing with a megacreep. 

I know you've waited a few weeks and it feels like you should have reported it earlier, but stop blaming yourself for not handling it differently. If you go to the police, just tell them like it is: your device was stolen at a party and you initially decided that it was something to write off as a consequence of that sort of party. Then you made contact with this guy who originally seemed helpful but is displaying aggressive behavior. That makes him a probable suspect for the theft at the least, and very possibly a stalker as well.  

That is all completely legitimate, so don't downplay it when you talk to them. When I got robbed I ended up blaming myself a lot when I recounted events to the police and I think it hurt the investigation. You have every right to want the police to do everything they can to help you. They may not be able to do anything now except make a report and investigate his number. If they have record of it from other incidents, maybe they can eventually trace him. Anyway, it's better to go on record with it now in case this escalates.

I also think it is worth setting up a meeting in public to get the ipad back and asking the police to come with you for a bust. They may not be able to arrest him for the theft without sufficient evidence that he was the one who stole it...but at least you could get his identity so you could file a restraining order against him. 

Does your college have a campus police? It is worth contacting them if you do. They often have a lot more resources and interest in investigating these types of crimes than the regular police force. 

There is almost no chance that his story about how he found the iPad is true. People who skip out on rent don't just leave a several hundred dollar iPad behind. That means he either stole it himself or got it from someone knowing it was stolen. If he stole it, he knows where you live, possibly what you look like. He saw your room, he knows a lot about you. He could have just been pretending to not know those things he was asking you about. He might even just be pretending to be a horrid speller and whatnot to throw you off. It is very likely he stole it with the intent of luring you into a rape or stalking situation. 

The alternative scenario is he didn't steal it but just realized he could prey on you this way. So there is a chance he doesn't know all that about you...but I wouldn't bet on it. 

Sorry to make you feel unsafe, but I think you need to be hyper vigilant about your surroundings for a while and make sure your friends are aware of the situation. You are NOT overreacting to do so. "

On the flip side, some people are absolutely amazing at kissing. As the top comment says, you've just been missing out.

As for sex, I think making out is the most essential part of it. For me, that's how it begins, that's what happens during most of it and that's what happens after. Otherwise the intimacy is pretty diminished.

You should learn controlling the pace a little. I've found that it's helpful when a girl is doing something wrong or going too fast. People tend to learn pretty fast. You can use your lips to steer the pace and rhythm. Biting the lower lip a little is good, it's sexy and can help stopping some little movement you don't like. Just be careful not to draw blood, that's a moodkill. Be playful, tease a little. Vary the pace.

Commod0re,funny,1391163331.0,"&gt; Eh, Bieber is an RnB singer. He's literally all voice. He can't even dance properly.

So your earlier point about how Bieber can totally, like, play all the instruments omg, is no longer valid because you can't come up with a decent retort?

&gt; So, being tossed from label to label is a plus? What kind of label gives up on a cash cow? How many labels has Kanye been on? Looks like Beatles have only been on 5 labels for example. Nothing for Vanilla on this one.

In most cases, this was Vanilla Ice moving to a new label that treated him better, actually.

The Beatles released albums on at least 8 US labels, including Decca, Atlantic, MGM, Swan, Vee Jay, Tollie, Capitol (and Capitol-Star Line), and Apple Records.


At any rate, eliminating the admittedly dubious points on number of record labels and associated act list, I'd still put this at 2:0 in favor of Vanilla Ice.

I'll also take this moment to point out one bit of wording you used:

&gt; cash cow

I would argue that the labels were vying for Bieber's teeny bopper appeal more than his talent. Talent doesn't enter into considerations made by record labels - it's all about sellability. That's why they have auto-tune, sound engineers, and expensive digital audio workstations. For the time being at least, Bieber gets a certain significant demographic of girls, and more importantly, their wallets, excited, and that's all they care about.

I honestly haven't heard much of his music, so I can't comment on my views of his musical ability. I can say with certainty, though, that he's got a shit, self-important attitude, and he makes a very poor role model. Makes me think that making a 13 year old suddenly super famous is probably not such a stellar idea."

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1391163360.0,"Ah those are just a bunch of advanced stats. Most of them are just percentages, like Assist % is what percentage of teammates' shots you (were estimated to have) assisted. Similar deal with the other % (TRBD = Total Rebound, BLK% = Block, TO% = turnovers). It's a way to avoid confounding factors like minutes played, pace, usage, etc. and deal purely in terms of what you are doing per possession (or per minute).

TS% is true shooting percentage, it's basically how efficient you are at scoring (including free throws and 3s), PER is a catch-all stat that people use to make unsupported generalizations about which player is better, and WS/48 is how many ""wins"" you are responsible for per 48 minutes of play time.

But yeah by most stats it's Dragic all the way. I'd say the only meaningful category Dame has him beat (substantially) is turnovers.

As for being on a better team, it definitely depends on the context (as does everything else...) I haven't watched enough Suns or Blazers games to make an informed statement here. The reason I tossed that in isn't because I'm arguing it inflated Dame's stats, but rather because a common argument people toss around is ""Dame is on a top-3 team record-wise, and Dragic's team is a fringe playoff team."" That understates the amount of talent Dame has on his team which is why I felt obligated to include that blurb about team performance."

The best location I could come up with so far is one of the tennis courts...  

Based on some math a skatepark of 3,400 square feet would be a suitable size for our towns population.  I came up with a 40' x 85' area, but that's not final dimensions just an idea of what 3,400 square feet looks like...  Came up with that math from here, this article was pretty interesting too: 

www.skatepark.org/park-development/vision/2010/12/skatepark-adoption-model/

As far as the costs of concrete skateparks vs. modular with wood or other materials, it's not the best option for a permanent park.  Check this out for more information on why modular parks aren't as good over time:

www.skatepark.org/park-development/vision/2012/09/just-say-no-to-modular-skateparks/


And as far as cost concerns go, check out these parks for under $100k:

www.skatepark.org/park-development/fundraising/2012/07/skateparks-under-100k/

The Tonawanda, NY park is the park everyone from my city goes to right now, it's in the list of skateparks under 100k, pretty nice park with a quarterpipe on each side and a funbox with rails and hubba along with manny pad.  It's just a bit of a drive, would be nice to have one in our city.  

I've been looking at Who Skates, they seem like a reputable vendor, and I like their park design a lot.  I went onto their site and found this, which might be what I'm looking for:

www.whoskates.com/Starter_Skateparks.html

Definitely seems easier to persuade the city to build a small area to flow with skate obstacles than a nice skate plaza with a mini-ramp for the first park.

Good: The thrill of getting your story exactly as you want it nationwide. If people knew how little time journalists have to create their own stories and how much they rely on PR people to feed them not just the story, not just the angle, but literally the exact words and phrasing, they'd be horrified.

Bad: The fact that people don't understand how PR works. I'm so sick of hearing people say ""there's no thing as bad publicity"" or ""they're doing it for the publicity"". PR is marketing: you have a goal. And that goal isn't the publicity, it's normally sales or website visits or donations or lobbying.

Humans like it when things stay the same. So if there's a situation that reminds the brain/heart/soul of the ""same"" things, it's going to be something that we latch on to very very easily.

I played the original Falcon flight sim. The precursor to Falcon 4 which was the big study sim until DCS came out. We played Goldeneye all the time and wasted entire weekends grinding in the original Gran Turismos on PS1 and PS2. 

And we lost our shit when the Metal Gear Solid sequel came out. We marathoned that game until we beat it and didn't give two shits that la-li-lu-le-lo made no sense. 

But Timesplitters was revolutionary. It was the first tame I remember that let you make your own levels in a shooter. Sport games like Tony Hawk and as far back as Excite Bike on the NES let you but i'd never seen that in a shooter. And then there's the dual sticks. You know how you use one stick to move and the other to look? You know how that allows you to strafe and fire? Timesplitters invented that shit. 

Go back and play Goldeneye. You'll want to smash that godawful game into a million splinters. We fucking loved Goldeneye, but the second I tried Timesplitters' dual stick controls we knew there was no going back. It was the future. And at the same time it had this amazing sense of humor. It never took itself seriously. It never told you how to play the game. It let you do absolutely anything you wanted no matter what. There's not a single game today that delivers what the Timesplitters series did. 

I'm sorry this turned into a rant but I want others to understand just how a big a deal Timesplitters was. Saying it was your Doom isn't even the tip of the iceberg. I hunted zombies as a monkey in space. Before zombies were a thing in video games. 

Doom was my Doom. But I couldn't care less of I never played Doom again. I have a burning need to play Timesplitters again. The only other game I feel remotely the same way about is Homeworld.

We picked our most slam-poetry-look-a-like work, with lots of gestures and volume changes, and that kind of settled them down a bit. 

As for the workshop itself, it was pretty hectic and, like it was suggested in these replies, we didn't get to do everything we wanted to. But we didn't let it drag on either, we changed the pace quite often and kept them thinking and talking about poetry for roughly 60 minutes (which, according to the school, is ... something special). We tried to pick in on their party mood by having them perform the poetry in all sorts of manners. 

The ""pick the poem you think should not be called poetry""-exercise was pretty successful. You could see the positive surprise on their faces when we handed out the poems and asked the question. All of the groups picked the obvious ""weird"" poems, like E.E. Cummings ""l(a"" and some visual poetry by Dutch poet Paul De Vree. That's something we'll have to work on, since it's not really informative to have the same ""why is this experimental poetry not real poetry?""-question over and over again, with roughly the same answers. But at least it introduced them to some of the less obvious ways of writing poetry, which was something they hadn't seen in class yet. Having them perform a visual poem or something with barely any vowels is also pretty funny, and they thought so too.

In the end we tried to tie it all together, and showed them ""16 bars for Kendrick Lamar"" by Joshua Bennett to get them to see how someone uses the aspects of poetry they just discussed and fuses them with new elements. I'm not sure if they really understood what he was saying though. The class was almost all French-speaking students, with some notion of English, but maybe not enough to follow a native English-speaker without subtitles. That's something we'll have to take into account for next time.

We plan on working on this format some more and then offer it to other schools in our country. We've already been asked to come back next year and also to teach a writing course (which we haven't done yet either so ... expect to see a ""How do you get young students to write poetry in class?"" here next year).

Anyway, thanks for all the suggestions! "

It will depend a lot on the exact event. Some require certain skills or classes to make the ‘best’. 

That said the core of the group will be 3 Warriors. This will give 100% Fury up time and 9 Stacks of Might.

After that, you would probably take an Elementalist with a Might stacking, Lightening Hammer build. This will add 10-15 stacks of Might (more or less capping Might for the party).

Then you have one slot for your utility player. Guardian is the generic choice here, as they can adapt to nearly anything. But Mesmers, Thieves and Rangers can also have their place. 

There are other ways to reach these caps, but this is probably the strongest combination.

Kesshisan,learnmath,1391164894.0,"I think I can come up with a method to optimize the program.  I, too, cannot come up with anything purely analytical with no brute force, but I did come up with something that will greatly reduce the amount of computations necessary.

We need to check all numbers that looks like this:

    2014XXXXXX
    X2014XXXXX
    XX2014XXXX
    etc. etc.

There are 7 such iterations.  Lets start with the smallest possible value:

    2014356789

First off, this cannot possible be it because 2014 is even, and thus has a factor of 2.  No odd number has a factor of 2, which leaves us with this as our smallest number:

    201435698

First perform the mod command and subtraction:

    201435698 % 2014 = 1460
    2014 - 1460 = 554

That is, 201435698 is are 554 integers away from being divisible by 2014.  Now if we hold the 2014 stationary, and rearrange all the other numbers, we need to find a number such that the difference increases the value of 554 in mod2014 world.  That is: (new number - 201435698) % 2014 = 554.  Any value of new number that makes this statement true should yield us a value that is divisible by 2014.

Rearranging the numbers could easily be written into a program.  Furthermore, no checking is necessary when the one's place is odd, so if you add a small check for that to save some computation cycles, too.

Once we're done with 2014XXXXXX we can continue for the remaining 6 positions of 2014.

I believe this process will be a fairly quick way (programming wise) to determine all values which fit /u/kvadrats restrictions."

jaynay1,nba,1391164906.0,"Interesting thought, what if that was one of the conditions to the rigging?

Like draw two orders:  One that makes a good storyline and captivates people, and one that's beneficial from a competitive standpoint.  Then draft according to the second but announce according to the first.

For example, in this most recent draft, the ""real order"" would've been Magic, Hornets/Pelicans, Suns, Cavaliers, Wizards for the top 5.

2 years ago the announced order matched the drafting order early on.  Charlotte couldn't have been rewarded for the pitiful display at the end so  they dropped to 2, maybe 3 behind the Wizards.

And so on.

Maybe Chris Grant really isn't drafting terribly, he's just picking from positions we don't think he is."

Interesting character development goes out the window in favor of quirky traits that create the illusion of depth, while in reality simply pander to otakus. Screen-time which could be used for quality art or plot or whatever is instead used to show off one of the girl's new haircuts. On top of that, it's a bit perverse.

Greggor88,politics,1391165457.0,"The only way to do that would be to alter the zygote's DNA *at conception*, since that is when the chromosomes from the gametes combine to form a single set of chromosome pairs for the future fetus.

Basically, you have a sperm and an egg. 

In normal sperm cells and eggs, there are 23 chromosomes in each. When they combine to form a zygote, the resulting cell has 46 chromosomes.

In rare instances, either the sperm or egg may have an *extra* chromosome (24 chromosomes in one, 23 chromosomes in the other), leading to a zygote with 47 chromosomes. Usually, this results in a miscarriage, as the resulting fetus would not be viable. However, in rare cases, a viable fetus is produced.

The most common *viable* zygote with a chromosomal duplication (Trisomy 21) results in Down Syndrome. It is part of the baby's DNA. The only way to prevent it would be to either:

a) Manually select a sperm and egg, make sure they are normal, and then fertilize them and implant the resulting fetus in a carrier.

or

b) Develop some way to selectively kill off both sperm and egg cells with incorrect amounts of chromosomes in each partner. This would require both partners taking a specific drug tailored to their genetic code.

As you can see, even if this were possible, it would be outrageously expensive and impractical. The alternative (aborting unwanted fetuses) is a less problematic approach to the same problem."

I'm a small percentage of a small percentage of the population. As such I don't really click with most people. Then on top of that I have logic driven social ineptitude. Sure saying ""Hi"" to such and such person might seem normal to other people, but I run it through several layers of thought and generally think myself out of it for whatever reason, or wait for them to acknowledge me first.

Plus I'm not interested in a lot of topics people talk about. The things I know about, no one wants to talk about, and the things I know nothing about are the things everyone wants to talk about.

When someone says dont drink and drive, it's implied that they mean ""don't drink to the point that your cognitive skills and reaction time are even the slightest bit negatively impaired if you plan on driving"". 

This applies to everything. Have your cup of coffee in the morning to wake you up, that's absolutely fine. But don't drink so much coffee that you get so jittery that it impairs your ability to react safely and quickly. I drink a lot of coffee, trust me, this is a thing. 

Have a regular amount of food, but don't eat so much that you're about to go into food coma. 

Get some sleep. Don't drive when you're sleep deprived. 

Etc. etc. etc.

The Player Characters tend to be ruling kings, whose deaths are diagrams back to the waking world ([Sermon Eleven](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-eleven)).

The Nerevarine is functionally immortal and seems to be rather skilled at dodging murder attempts.

The Champion of Cyrodiil is now the Prince of Madness and, as a force of the universe, won't die.

The LDB doesn't actually *have* a soul that the Princes can use (before anyone can bring up Durnehviir, he's not dead; he's bound and very much alive). He's a Dragon, a Fragment of Akatosh, that happens to be wearing a skin that looks awfully Ehlnofex, and can even look like the talking lizards.

The Heroes aren't put in the same positions as mere mortals are when negotiating with princes. The ""favor for soul"" bargain doesn't apply, because their souls are unclaimable. Instead, the bargain is ""favor for favor"" and the Princes are well aware that while still not negotiating with an equal, the Heroes are a very different situation from the usual. Their souls are never sworn over to any of the Princes despite partaking in bargains that would for others result in soul ownership, because they're not your run-of-the-mill worshipper and the Princes are well aware of this."

You don't believe there is a risk but the risk is there. You can't change facts. There is a fact that more weapons will be on streets. In no way you can guarantee in 100% that those weapons won't be used for the purpose not intended. Simple statistics will tell you the truth.

It obviously would be good to have no cars as this would save lives but here statistics take into account the fact the society won't really exist without cars this days. You can't collapse whole society just because cars are not safe enough and take lives. Guns don't bring ANYTHING positive, rather than sole pleasure of shooting at the range. You don't need a gun for your daily use, you do need a form of transport.

In any case, even look at cars. How much improvement has been put into them. Isn't this a ""reducing risk"" which you oppose off? Even look at recent Google car, who know, it may be a normal in a not distant future to ""drive"" automatic cars who at least by their intention should be more secure for other road users than current form of driving them.

You also don't know much about H&amp;S, don't you? It generally aim at reducing fully high risks and removing smaller risks when possible. That's a pretty common sense approach and is in no way nanny. Look at third world countries and their H&amp;S and number of deaths because of such not being present.

Also, this is copied from one of my other comments and sort of clears up my opinion on the whole coffee thing.

When someone says dont drink and drive, it's implied that they mean ""don't drink to the point that your cognitive skills and reaction time are even the slightest bit negatively impaired if you plan on driving"".
This applies to everything. 

Have your cup of coffee in the morning to wake you up, that's absolutely fine. But don't drink so much coffee that you get so jittery that it impairs your ability to react safely and quickly. I drink a lot of coffee, trust me, this is a thing.

Have a regular amount of food, but don't eat so much that you're about to go into food coma.

Get some sleep. Don't drive when you're sleep deprived.

Etc. etc. etc.

Your cognitive skills need to be at their very best when you are driving, and your attention needs to stay on the road. If this was something where you are the only person in danger, fine, do your thing. But you are puttign so many other people in danger and that is not fair."

Cykuta,movies,1391166728.0,"The problem with narrative ""twists"" is that you not only should twist *out* of one audience expectation, but *in* to another, coherent *and equally satisfying* story. Or almost equally satisfying. This is why it's so hard to do them right, and why are they so rewarding when they are done right - because while the story changes, the satisfaction is still there.

This of course means that the twists which have a coherent ""second part"" incoming can be easier to see (like, say, the ""twist"" in Disney's ""Frozen"") or simply anticlimactic (like in Polański's ""The Ghost"" where tension was built up so subtly and interestingly that the actual ""reveal"" just wasn't worthy of it.)

As for your comment about it touching women in special ways; my SO has read it at several stages throughout its writing, as has my mother and now the actress who will portray the female character.

Especially the part about not getting hungry. I only ever knew I needed to eat because I started to feel shaky, weak, and light-headed. Literally, yesterday, I just went almost 35 hours without eating a bite of food without realizing it. I've been trying to eat more, but having been on a diet of about 500 to 1000 Kcal a day makes it very difficult to eat what I need to to gain weight.

Your b/f is an alcoholic.  If he only drinks to get drunk, that's a sign of alcohol dependancy.  I'd be willing to be most of the times he's been fired had something to do with alcohol as well.

Listen, I'm assuming he's the same age as you. 22ish.  Post college age and still living in that era of his life. That's all well and good, and we all enjoy a good party or getting liquored up every so often, but it seems like he has a problem.  And I know you're trying to justify it by saying his arrests are all non violent.  That's good he's not a violent person, but he's still racking up an arrest record and a history that will make it harder for him to get jobs in the future if and when he decides to get his shit together.

Talk to his family, talk to a counselor, stage an intervention, whatever you have to do.  He has a problem and he needs you guys.  If he refuses to help himself, then it comes down to you.  If he can't take care of himself in any small part, how can you expect him to take care of you and any future kids and family you may have.

codayus,BDSMcommunity,1391168536.0,"It depends what you're looking for.  But let's say you're trying to find a serious,, romantic BDSM relationship.

In that case, I think the traditional dating ad guidelines very much *do* apply.  What you want is a normal personals ad, with a line in there somewhere ""Oh, I'm a [dom|sub], looking for a [sub|dom]"", to help filter out the truly incompatible people.  No different than how many ads mention that they are vegan, or Christian, or Jewish, or are only interested in people who enjoy a certain hobby.

Another issue is the initial messages.  Again, vanilla guidelines apply:  Do **NOT** start things off with a penis pic.  Do **NOT** leap into talking about sexual things.  Write a decent message, make it clear that you have read the profile of the person you are writing to, ask them some easy to answer questions about their life and (non-sexual) interests, don't ask too many questions, give them some tidbits about you that help show the compatability, don't just tell them ""read my profile if you want to know more"", don't give them a six page biographic essay.  And so on.

Also, I'd recommend staying away from Fetlife.  It's a good site for finding face to face meetups, and many people have luck finding dates at munches at parties.  But if you're looking for online dating, try an online dating site.  Which one?  Whichever one is most popular in your area; numbers are much more important than whether it's kinky or not.  OKCupid is good pretty much everywhere; some regions have locally popular sites (eg, NZDating in NZ).  In some areas CollarMe is apparently actually used, but my experience with it has been that's it's a wretched pool of trolls, creeps, and abusers, and should be avoided at all cost.

I met my current partner through a vanilla dating site.  My profile was:

""I am [personal non-sexual qualities].  I'm also [personal sexual qualities].  I'm a [career], I've got [education], and I'm [into main vanilla hobby].  I love [other main vanilla interests and hobbies], and a range of kinky hobbies. I have a pretty high sex drive, and I'm also very strongly into cuddles, hugs, and tactile contact.""

""I'm looking for a long-term relationship, not a one-night stand. (In other words, I'm looking for ""strings attached"" fun...in both senses of the word.)  I don't care much about looks, weight, age, or race. Similar interests, intelligence, and compatible personality are key. Everything else is negotiable.  It'd be great if you're smart, maybe a little shy, kinky, maybe a little submissive, and a non-smoker. Bonus If you like the movie Secretary, and maybe identify a little bit with Lee Holloway.  Most of all, you should contact me if you find my profile interesting. If you love cuddles, kinky sex, and shy nerdy boys, contact me! Now!""

In other words, I made it clear that I was kinky and dominant, and looking for someone compatible, but the overwhelming bulk of the profile was about me as a person, with a focus on my vanilla interests.  Because, well, kink is a part of me, but only *one* part.

I found my SO's profile by searching for the word ""submissive"" (like me, her profile was 90% vanilla stuff with a mention of her sexuality), but my initial contact to her was completely focused on vanilla stuff, particularly our shared university major and our musical tastes:

""Nice profile.   The first thing I noticed - believe it or not - was what your studying. I actually have a [same degree and major]. How are you finding it? Fun? Boring?  Anyhow, I tick at least a few of the boxes you listed. I'm [age], dominant, a nice guy (well, I guess I *would* say that...), have a job, don't smoke, don't drink to excess. \*shrug\*  I haven't heard much by [your favourite artist]; what I have heard isn't really my type. What would you say your favorite song is? What metal and rock do you like? I tend to be kinda ridiculously picky about music; I often have 1-2 tracks I love by a band, and then hate everything else they do. But I do love most of [my favourite artist's stuff].  So...uh...you sound cool, and I like your picture. Message me back and we can commiserate about how lame [your major's] homework is.""

Notice that I didn't talk about her looks, make crude sexual comments, ask to meet up for sex, or send her a dick pic.  Rather, I made it clear that I had read her profile, and stressed the ways I matched her list of things she was looking for.  I mentioned in passing that we were compatible from a kink perspective, but the goal of my message was to strike up a conversation about university, or failing that music.  Which worked.  And after a few emails we exchanged fetlife profiles, and only then did we actually read each others fetish list, and start discussing sexual and kinky things.  But *first* we made an actual connection.  And I think that's absolutely critical.

Basically, ""hey, I like [your random fetish] too!  Want to fuck?"" is going to be the start of a great relationship.  I mean, that could be how I first meet someone, but the relationship, as such, starts when we actually form a personal connection which almost has to be about non-kinky things.

Just my two cents.  :)"

You guys engaged in an affair that seems mostly emotional.  When it dawned on her what she was giving up for that affair, she decided to change her ways. She has every right to do that, and as much as it sucks for you, you have to accept it.  As much as you say that age isn't a factor, it really is.  You can't envision being in a marraige for X amount of years with kids, and throwing it away for a co worker who is half your age.  She can, and realized she was wrong, and is doing what she can to get what she wants.

I get that you were, unintentionally, used.  And it sucks.  And I get its hard to accept rejection, let alone rejection for someone else.  But this isn't a straight up 1 for 1 comparrison.  This is her HUSBAND of however long who is also the FATHER OF HER KIDS.  You are in no way able to fill that role.  And that's ok. You're 20 and have a ton to learn.

The best 'functional' exercise I can recommend for this is the standard crossfit Sled Push and series of box jumps. If you don't have a sled (who does?), try 'running' while someone else is trying to hold you back (arms around waist). Timebox this.

\*Edit: When I say ""step up, alternate leg"", I mean ""do this until you reach the top of the stairs"". Keep in mind that calves need two types of stimulus: fatigue (this exercise will do nicely, at +/- 320 reps minimum) and max power short/explosive (Sled push/jump/resistance running).

&gt; 2oz of lean ham

&gt; 1 egg &amp; 1/4c egg substitute scrambled with hot sauce and pepper flakes

&gt; 1/3 tsp bacon grease (pan lube)

Stacked up, open faced sandwich style, it's 363 calories and bigger than anything from a fast-food joint without way less fat (in spite of the bacon grease which is only 13 calories).  

Swap the bagel for half an English muffin and save 70 calories to get it under 300.  Use all egg substitute or egg whites, less ham, swap ham for turkey, slice of bread, more or less jelly/jam, and you can vary it  to your heart's content, increasing or decreasing calories to save them for other meals.

After I hear some random song that doesn't appeal to me ten times, suddenly I realize that it's one of my favourite songs and I go hunt down other songs by that artist.

Music is kind of funny. We tend to like things that are similar to music we already like, but different enough that we haven't heard it before. You can go from any genre to any other genre if you just carefully transition from song to song, but it's hard to just jump right into a genre with no prior experience."

The funny thing about all that in retrospect is that her family was practically rich compared to my own.

Cool things about the car itself is the really good AWD, of course, and the attention to certain little things. For example, all the things the average person should touch under the hood are marked in yellow such as a yellow cap for the windshield washing fluid, the coolant, etc. The 5-speed has short gears but they line up perfectly with the speed limits and they let you easily take off. 

The main differences between the L and the 2.5GT include the interior, stiff suspension on the 2.5GT as well as an LSD on the 2.5GT. Other than that they're pretty much the same with a good amount of trunk space, lots of room for the driver, easy to take care of and do repairs on and compatible with all sorts of newer and older Subaru parts.

It'd be good to note that the 2.5GT is actually not the GT, it's a higher trim level.

A_for_Anonymous,AskMen,1391171288.0,"He needs professional help on his alcoholism, and the fact he's an alcoholic, lazy and unconcerned about his future or work shows he's way, way, way too immature for you.

Your best bet would be to get professional help for him, keep him out of alcohol for good, and support and accompany him for the *years* that will take him to mature into a worthy person, provided he wants to. It's a long-term investment, I'm afraid. I hope it pays of well because you may very well be wasting your life with a person like him.

So on one side you have the big risk of getting an alcoholic kid to want to change and do something good in his life for the very first time, go through it and end up half-usable, *if* he succeeds, which is a huge if, and several more years of nothingness. It's a high-risk investment with doubtful returns after maybe 1 to 5 years.

On the other side you have a broken heart, which will take 3-8 months to heal, and a future with somebody else, hopefully starting with a functional, mature person from day zero (in other word, not another kid, and not drug-addict). It's a low-risk investment with probable quality returns after less than 1 year."

Camper facilities and even some hostels offer shower facilities sometimes as well.

Sadly, Jamie Sanderson at YGB planted the seeds for the 'anti-Frimpong' mentality very early on in his career and many seemed to go along with it, ignoring the context of his slow progress over the last 2 years.

Also, the story seems to have been set now that Frimpong didn't impress when at Wolves. He actually played very, very well in the few appearances he had for them, but sadly he was hit by another very serious injury.

The guy just has no luck with injuries and people have spun that into him being a shit player. No doubt in my mind that he'll be back in the PL if he can stay injury free for a while."

&gt;Expertly contrasting middle-class domestic bliss with sexual yearning, mundanity with exhilaration


*Source: http://www.theatreroyalwinchester.co.uk/the-lover-the-stranger*



&gt; psychology, cognitive dissonance is the excessive mental stress and discomfort[1]experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, and/or values at the same time. This stress and discomfort may also arise within an individual who holds a belief and performs a contradictory action or reaction.[2] For example, an individual is likely to experience dissonance if he or she is addicted to smoking cigarettes and continues to smoke despite believing it is unhealthy.[3]



Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonancefocuses on how humans strive for internal consistency. When inconsistency (dissonance) is experienced, individuals largely become psychologically distressed. His basic hypotheses are listed below:




""The existence of dissonance, being psychologically uncomfortable, will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance""""When dissonance is present, in addition to trying to reduce it, the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance"" [1]

The rest have maybe a superficial understanding of it and just support tidbits of it, while outright rejecting core tenets like patriarchy theory (so I somehow doubt how far they reside on the feminist spectrum).

When you look at other groups of people, they all have their own reasons for not caring at all the lessons of feminism:

When you go down the socioeconomic ladder, less people have gone to college to learn about Women's Studies. Less people can afford to be strong independent women. Some of these people have bigger issues than petty gender dynamics of dating, when a high percentage of the men of their community are being locked up.

When you look at immigrants, some of them are very religion and/or traditional (e.g. West and South Asians, hispanic). Then you have others coming from ex-communist countries (CIS and China) for whom Western feminism didn't really do much for anyway.

Also, in ""left-leaning"" urban areas, most people can believe and accept leftist ideals but still refuse to act on them. They'll talk about racial integration, equality, but when you want them to put it into practice... *""Well, that neighbourhood is too dangerous. I have a child you know! I think I'll be looking at that safer, suburban... [white/Asian] neighbourhood instead. That place has better schools.""*

([You can check racial segregation of US cities.](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-segregated-cities-census-maps-2013-4?op=1) It's not perfect, because of the way they determined and ranked ""segregation"". It's missing out on some areas like SF Bay Area, where there is obvious signs of segregation.)

Same with gender dynamics. Equality is great but... *""Well... I'm kind of shy. I don't want to seem like a slut. And I do want a tall, wealthy guy to support me after all... But I want other girls to break from those traditions, I really do.""*"

genveir,DnD,1391173345.0,"**The wardens of Elmor**

A hundred years ago the world was destroyed. A huge magical war broke out between the elves and the humans, turning the fertile lands of Astra into barren wastelands. Small pockets of survivors still roam about, and fight amongst each other to ensure the survival of their tribes. Food is getting more scarce, and there's not enough for everyone.

Elmor is different. It was once part of a huge forest, where large tribes of centaurs led their lives. When the war broke out Elm, archdruid of the centaurs, created a magical shield over a small part of the great woodlands and saved it from destruction. Through great hardship, a group of adventuring centaurs retrieved five jewels granted to them by their god to assist Elm in this task. The power of the gems is sufficient for Elm to return life to the wastelands. But the shielding spell took a massive toll on the old druid, and he has lain dormant since the cataclysm, protected by his magic.

Life in Elmor is not easy. There were many centaurs inside the shield, the forest barely yields enough food for all of them, and they are constantly beset on all sides by tribes who want what they have. The wardens are the force that defends Elmor, and most importantly, the druid and jewels that may one day return the world to the way it was.

In the meantime, the world outside has heard of the jewels, but misunderstands their use. It is believed that the jewels themselves have created the forest the centaurs live in, and that they can do it again. 

The centaurs are known to be ""good"" in their own way, helping where they can, but they refuse to part with their lifegiving gems. It is widely believed that they're hoarding all the jewels to live well, and could easily spare a few to save many other lives.

The tribe of the adventurers is starving, and they MUST find a way to save their family and friends. The obvious way to do this is to liberate the jewels.

* Over what critical ambiguous issue do the players and the organization butt heads?

   The characters demand that the centaurs save their tribe, the centaurs don't have the means to do so.

* What prevents the players from simply trying to destroy it?

   The centaurs number in the hundreds and are well armed and armored. They're also known to help surrounding villages with any aid they need but food.

* What prevents the organization from simply trying to destroy the players?

   The centaurs are trying to save the world. They fight when attacked, but it's breaking their hearts to do so. They are trying to explain to the world that the jewels don't do what they think they do, but desperate people who believe the centaurs are holding back salvation are hard to convince."

panjatogo,worldbuilding,1391173486.0,"I would imagine that to get magic that powerful, you'd need some pretty serious ritual human sacrifice or suicide. There are a lot of moral implications about that, regardless of the actual magic being done.

In terms of what keeps a Vow in place, perhaps something like a phylactery? A magical container for human spirit? The process would probably be multi-staged: Perhaps a reasonable amount of magic would be required to make something like that exist in the first place, and then a second magic can effect the way spirit can be extracted from blood to make a more concentrated spirit that can be stored in large quantities in a phylactery, then the Vow is made while the other magics are still active, and the spirit can be siphoned from the blood to the phylactery. Since part to the spirit in the phylactery keeps the phylactery's magic in place, but the promise part of the Vow takes place while making the  phylactery, so if it is broken or fulfilled or whatever the phylactery stops being magical and the effect ends?

That's what I would do at least. Feel free to use whatever parts of that you think would fit and disregard as much as you feel like :P"

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1391173548.0,"&gt;What's the point of saving lives if those lives are so boring because there's no risk? Should we all just sit in padded rooms and never leave the house just to remove risk and save lives? You have to draw a line somewhere, and if you can't even show that there's any risk there then you are wayyyyy behind that line.

Yes yes, there is absolutely no risk with average citizens keeping guns at home. You are mad.

&gt;I'm not opposed to reducing risk in all cases, I'm opposed to reducing quality of life in the name of reducing risk when that risk is either very small or non-existent

Come on, why are you so stubborn. Quality of life with a gun? Why do you so desperately need a gun kept at home, even though you can use it only at certain places. This is just a bullshit discussion. You hide behind possible lack of statistics and don't take into account any reasonable measures ""just because"". You can't even give me one reason why a gun kept at home is better than at the professional place? Just because few people want to have fun they can't jeopardize safety of all other citizens as again, it is ridiculously selfish.

I don't trust every gun holder will be keeping his gun in a locked and safely placed cabinet at home and don't play around with it in front of friends etc. Guns can affect my life and I won't be responsible for idiots behaving in a dangerous fashion, just because a person like you justifies made up case without giving reasons and hides behind lack of certain proofs, which can't even be realistically established due to the nature of the research and the fact it would have to be reintroduced first and later judged upon.

&gt;People just don't want to give up the luxury

Car a luxury? Where did you come from, a Wild West? Having a gun and riding a horse? A car is not a luxury any more, wake up. Modern society will NOT exist without transport vehicles and you compare it to guns which don't have any other purpose than shoot a bullet with a usual intention of killing. Just remember that a small margin of people can't decide how the rest of the nation lives, especially that this is a complete no brainer and a fact that guns are very fucking lethal weapons.

When you take a picture of something with a camera that has a longer exposure time, you see that object in all the places it was in. They're all displayed on the picture at the same time. Movies are a bunch of pictures lined up, and show 24 pictures every second, and are produced by building 24 pictures every second. So every picture is exposed for 1/24th of a second. Each individual frame will show an object in all the places it was in during that 1/24th of a second. It doesn't look weird to a human watching, because it's happening just as fast as it would if we were seeing someone do it in person, just a little blurrier.

If each of the 24 frames was taken with a camera with a short exposure time (like what you see when athletes have their picture taken while throwing a ball or something), movies would look much more choppier, but every frame is blurred together so it's easier on our brain. Most of the time it looks perfectly natural, especially if you spend a lot of time watching TV/Movies, because you become accustomed to it.

You have a very weak hand, bottom 10% that will rarely flop anything good. Even if you flop K85, it is hard to know if you are good or not.

You are not so desperate in terms of chips that you need to make a move.

You are oop

UTG+1 is showing strength, and you have no reason to believe he is raising very light.

UTG+1 has you covered.

You raise so small that UTG+1 is almost always calling, even a reasonably loose raise with something like 66 or A8s will often call and see a flop.

At $2 tournaments, many players are loose passive (calling stations) that will call several streets with marginal holdings. On the flop, Villain is never folding a pair of 7s or better and may well call 1 street with overcards. Some players will play back at you with AQ or make a weird move with KJ or something, at which point you have to fold.

You have no real options other than to give up or just barrel your stack off if villain calls the flop bet. The fact that you have such little equity gives you few options.

Your flop bet is the right size IMO, but other than that this is just horrible. Do you have a plan if he calls the flop?

He confessed to one posession and the theft, was acquitted of the second narcotics charge.

But his story was the tragic bit. He came from Iran at age 14 or something. Turned out to be a very talented soccer player, went to sports high school where he also played. Got picked for the Swedish under 21 national team and played in the highest division. Then he got injured, put on painkillers which was the start of his addiction. Got hooked on heroin, but tried to get on a rehab program. Said he had talked with his former team, who had promised him a contract if he got clean. His story was very convincing, and it felt like he really wanted to get clean. Felt truly sorry for him.

In the books, Ned's generation is all late-teens, early-twenties at the time of the Rebellion and therefore early- to late-thirties when AGOT begins. The show already changed their timelines. They kept the younger generation the same age as in the books, which means the Rebellion took place the same distance in the past (because Jon and Dany, for example, were explicitly born right around the end of the Rebellion), but they decided to make Ned and his generation way the fuck older. Upwards of 20 years older. Ned and Cat are in their early-mid 30s at the outset of AGOT, but more like 50+ in the show. That means they would have been closer to 30 or older during the Rebellion, according to the show's bizarre age shift. It wouldn't be workable. In a society so intentionally similar to medieval Europe, those noblemen and women (Robert, Cersei, Lyanna, Catelyn, etc) would simply not have been unmarried at such late ages. They wouldn't ALL have been unmarried, anyway.

- Have you tried taking aspirin and paracetamol together? Assuming you're not allergic to aspirin you can take them together.

Plus it's in a lot of other med like cold meds.

The other thought is that you can build up a tolerance to the side effects, start with a small dose and increase over time.

It felt like boyfriend shit (or at least what I assume boyfriend shit is like) without the sex or physical intimacy. And judging from what she did at my party, she didn’t care much about me (if she did, she would’ve stayed). At best, I was a tool. Well, I’d have no more of that. I decided I’d meet up with her one last time and just state my intentions.

- Full match in 401(k) of up to 6% of my wages

- I get a bonus check every quarter, averages out to a little under $7k a year

- I ""work"" eight hours a night. Two hours are contracted paid breaks. Half hour at the end and beginning of the shift for general ""safety"" and ""cleanup"". Then the actual work is really me just sitting next to a CNC machine and reading books. Every forty minutes I need to do five minutes of flipping and measuring parts and changing programs. They might get about an hour of actual work out of me in one night. Some nights there's no work for me and the crew and I just take a seven hour nap.

- Company is paying for my college tuition, books, lab fees, and materials.

- Lots of room to grow. This last year and a they spent over $100k on training me.

- No responsibility, if shit goes wrong it's my supervisor who takes the blow. (Sorry boss...)

- Benefits are great. Free health/dental/vision/auditory insurance coverage. If I'm sick we have an on site medical mini-hospital, so if I have a cold and want to be babied by nurses and have someone make me jello I can come in to work's medical facility to be treated any time 24/7.

- Hours. If I work forty hour weeks I make $65k. But I mostly work 56 hour weeks, eight hours a night seven nights a week. More money, yay, but I'd like more than one weekend a month off please.

1. Learn proper English. It's okay to make spelling or grammar errors, but at least put some thought into what you write.  
1. Stop begging. It doesn't entice people to help you.  
1. Learn to Google. It's okay to ask for something (if done nicely) _after_ you've tried to figure things out by yourself.  
1. Learn to Reddit. When replying to someone, hit the ""reply"" button under their post. They won't know you've replied to them unless you do this.

1. Don't pester users. If you think they're not answering as fast as you'd like them to, understand that everyone has a life outside of Reddit and that we don't all live under the same timezone. They'll get to you eventually.

Sorry if this sounded harsh, but these simple things go a long way in making this place, and every other subreddit, a better community. :)

So, to answer your question. I'll assume you want to post your run, because your question's as vague as it can be. Make an imgur album and post the link in a new thread. You do that by clicking the ""Submit a new link"" over at the top at the sidebar.

Alternatively, you can post whatever link you want (youtube is a popular choixe for video runs), or anywhere else you might have posted your run."

Yeah, I think this is fairly common.  No one is 100% 'evil'.  That and we (ACoNs) are also fighting society's perception that we're supposed to love and honor our parents.  It's a hard road to travel.  

IMHO I believe it's more a love for what we wanted our nparent to be: loving, nurturing, caring, not love for the actual physical/mental/emotional/sexual abusive assholes we had to deal with growing up.  More like love for your favorite character in a movie/tv show/book: in your head you know it's not real but you feel it anyway.

the fact you use WOW as if that's perfectly valid (its just another type of social cancer).

junoguten,TumblrInAction,1391176114.0,"When a boy or a girl has a late and/or moderate puberty and look younger than they are with less developed breasts/hips/penis/hair on their body and genitals than their peers, they are very easily embarrassed about it and it's not entirely uncommon that people make fun of them for it, sometimes even bully them, or at least freeze them out on the topic.

This might sound a bit contrary to today's narrative, but during puberty or when ones peers go through it, *not* being sexually objectified at all is actually quite damaging to self esteem. Especially when ones peers does receive such attention.

My best guess is women who look very young in porn are quite likely to have been such cases some years ago. A thing you really don't wanna do to an ex bully victim who thinks their victim years are behind them and they found a safe and accepting work environment is pick the exact same topic and a similiar method and go at it again.

It is my contention that telling them by law they're not allowed to express their sexuality outside of a private setting is exactly that. ""I don't measure up. Unlike what those men said, I'm not 'cute and sexy', my breasts and hips aren't large enough; I just look like a child.""

----from here on down isn't arguments on the topic anymore; just my personal distaste for Gail Dines----

Luckily for Professor Dines, being on the receiving end of bullying and looking younger than she is will never be a problem in her future. One might see why she chose the authoritarian anti-sex wing of feminism. The profoundly authoritarian and religious ring of ""Professor"" suits her quite nicely.

Upon inquiries about her former proteges and assistants, the way she's incredibly friendly, supporting and full of life until the second they stop being necessary to her, then drop them like a burning hot kettle, it's my character judgement of Gail that she is cruel and capricious, and I have deep doubts she's even in it for the cause and not just for the personal power."

As of 2007 about 5.2% of Australian adults (765,000 people)[1] own and use firearms for purposes such as hunting, controlling feral animals, collecting, and target shooting.""

nevertruly,AskWomen,1391176192.0,"For me, it is a requirement. People have a comfort in their own homes that leads to different behaviors from when dating, even if you are spending lots of time with each other and at each other's homes. For example, while dating a person may say that they think a 50/50 division of household chores is best, but once you live together, their 50 becomes more like 10 or 20. They aren't purposefully doing it necessarily, but that is the pattern that they fall into naturally. You won't know that unless living with them because they weren't lying to you - they just didn't realize how their pattern would play out in reality. I don't think that everyone needs to live together before marriage, but, for me, it is a necessity. With my first husband, there was a significant change from dating to living together, so I thought we had adapted, but then there was another change when we actually got married, so even living together before married may not give you a full picture if the person has specific and different expectations of a wife vs a fiancee or girlfriend."

Trouble is, this punishes the people who have already bought some/all characters.

My early adopters paid $2 on PC during the Alpha, and they're the people who encouraged me to run with it - the last people I'd want to go pan-handling to.

&gt; Presented here as a double bill with brand new response piece The Stranger from emerging playwright Ralph Jones, this is modern theatre at its finest.""

As you can see, there is no synopsis nor any kind of description of my play's narrative on the website.

You wrote the following:

&gt; So the play is about sexual fantasies which is Cognitive dissonance which is revolving around a middle class couple exploring in mating while being in an abusive relationship only garnered around someone as the victim in this? Who is the victim in this play? It's about domestic abuse so who is the abusive one?

You then quoted the description of Pinter's play. I am not Harold Pinter, I would have thought that was obvious because he is extremely famous and, perhaps more importantly, dead.

soft_puppy_ears,short,1391176577.0,"I've had some reasonable success with women as a short introvert and am married to a younger hottie.  Now I'm sure that things get considerably tougher at, say, 5'3"" vs my height, but I still ran into plenty of women for who I wasn't tall enough.  Honestly, I never really felt short until I dabbled with the online dating sites.  I soldiered on and met some quality women through various sites, but I was blown away at how many profiles list minimum heights of 6' and how if I changed my height a few inches, the number of matches went up by a factor of four.  I'd recommend that the guys &lt;5'6"" go do the work in person as the online game gets too skewed against you.  Buddy of mine is 5'5"" (handsome, great job/education, real charming) and the difference  in girls that he went out with from sites vs meeting in person was like night and day.

As to what's worked in my favor...  I live in the gym and completely shoot down the ""I want to feel protected"" argument by being over 200lb and heavily muscled.  I have a great engineering job and went to a top school, and I spend far more time working on my motorcycle or doing DIY home improvements than I spend playing games.  This stuff matters to women late 20s and up.  Probably won't affect the young guys much.  Everyone sizes up a potential partner on various attributes to come up with a subconscious score as to how good of a catch they are.  While its not fair, being short is a con, so work on developing more pros.  Or play guitar in a band."

AnotherSmegHead,MLPLounge,1391176631.0,"In the Catholic church, responsibilities that are passed on through the Priesthood are very restricted to actual priests directly from the line of the apostles.  If that chain of authority is broken, many rituals that are deemed ""sacramental"" are invalid.  Specifically, the Eucharist (turning the bread and wine in to some kind of quantumish form of Jesus dubbed ""transubstantiation"" where only the appearance of bread and wine remain but in essence become the real flesh of Christ), absolution of sins via confession, and of course passing on ordination (officially making someone else a priest, but traditionally this is only done by Bishops or higher).

Then you have the nun side of the house.  Instead of ritual and mystical stuff, its more down to Earth, helping the poor, teaching kids stuff, and staffing hospitals that do the labor portion of the Church's work on Earth.

There are definitely some interesting genetic phenomena linked to the Y chromosome, but my real issue was with your statements, ""Women tend to group more around the average. For example, intelligence, but there are many,' and ""It also means a small percentage will be better than women at pretty much anything the sexes have in common.""

For print, you want 300 DPI and 1 dot = 1 pixel so take the dimension of your cover and multiply by 300.

Then I would work it into my hair and then leave it for 10 minutes or so. Then I would shampoo it out, twice. My hairdresser would oooh and aaah over how soft my hair was.

skfoto,askcarsales,1391177016.0,"We get dealer cash on Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge vehicles all the time. They usually do it once the previous model year cars hit a certain age.

It's like a rebate in that it's paid by the manufacturer, but unlike a rebate the dealership is free to give as much or as little as they want to the customer and keep the rest as profit, and it does not have to be disclosed on the paperwork the same way as a rebate.

BUT- since we always get it on old age cars, we typically just throw all the money in to try and get rid of the car. So for the customer it's pretty much the same as if the car had a rebate."
SiriusHertz,Parenting,1391177016.0,"These are children - you know, little heathens who think they are the only thing that matters in the world. Mine are entirely entitled to their own opinions and ideas. They are not entitled to broadcast their negative emotions all over the place. 

We try to teach them how to handle the anger,  disappointment, etc. effectively in a controlled way - talking about it instead of hitting,  for example. 

We also enforce the idea that perception may differ from reality, and that you should attempt to verify your perceptions objectively before you commit to them. We often talk with our kids about this when they're feeling persecuted,  working through the situation with them and calmly offering an objective viewpoint and alternative perspectives to situations they feel are unfair. (We make sure to empathize with their feelings as well; this sounds counterintuitive but it works.) 

All of this stems from a couple of basic ideas - that our kids should treat others as they want to be treated, and that they should be able to see things from both sides before judging. Neither of these ideas comes naturally to children; there's no instinct for kindness. It has to be taught. "

Back in 2008, I was interviewing for an IT job on my college campus, and the first thing they asked me to do was diagnose why a printer wouldn't print. I restarted the box, reset the print spooler, restarted the printer, made sure I could ping it, logged into the printer's management page, and still couldn't figure out what was wrong.

The printer didn't have any paper in it.

Then, after graduating in 2011, I interviewed for a position with a local network/server support company. One of the very first things they asked was to have me select valid IP's from a list and then explain which subnet they would belong to. My mind went completely blank, so naturally I started stringing together some incoherent response involving binary and the numbers 255 and 252.

You also seem to be lambasting your husband as some sort of evil monster, but we haven't heard anything that sounds remotely unbiased as coming from his perspective.

elimeny,AskWomen,1391177510.0,"I am in the same camp as your boyfriend. I don't feel like it's required, but I don't mind living together first (I currently live with my boyfriend - he felt it was a must and I was okay with that). 

I would say that you get a better feel for someone's daily personality, their REAL lifestyle, and how they handle day to day stresses and difficulties. Those little day to day things can really break down the intimacy, and living together first helps you learn if you and the other person are capable of communicating through that crap. 

You absolutely see a different side of someone when you live together. Even different than if you spend most of your time spending the night at each others' houses and such. You plan out your life, your household, and your entire lifestyle together - or at least, see if you can. It's a challenge, and you don't really know, for sure, if you can do it until you've tried. 

I love the romantic notion of moving in together after being married, I do. Plenty of people did it and had long successful marriages. Now we all want more assurances, and are less willing to go on faith and hope that we can work through whatever struggles we have. But the fact of the matter is that nowadays, for better or for worse (oh the irony), it is far easier to give up on a marriage and not push through that stuff. So maybe it is better to make sure that you can before making that commitment."

1: ""Up yours"" to their adversaries and zionists just read nazism into it, or  
2: Peace/inverted nazi salute: Last time France was to war, nazies were to blame; the current war pressures they  blame zionists for.

The difference is when you inherit it from your father, then the disease progression gets worse, and might affect him around 40/50's, and continue deteriorating down the male line until it is unable to be passed on.

GetOffMyLawn_,HaircareScience,1391177714.0,"Just posted this in another thread. Hot oil treatment works wonders. I was into the Ayur-vedic thing for a while. I would take cold pressed sesame oil, heat a small container of it in a bowl of hot water, then massage it into my scalp all over and then into my hair, leave it for 10 minutes, then shampoo, rinse and repeat. Left me with super soft and silky hair. Later I started using Ayur-vedic massage oils, which was basically sesame with strange smelling herbs. [link](http://www.aworldofaromatherapy.com/ayurvedic-hair-scalp-massage-oil.htm)

Last year I started using a leave-in conditioner with argan oil and my hair grew an inch for the first time in years. I attribute this to lack of breakage as opposed to increased growth. I had tried coconut and jojoba before and while they conditioned my hair it didn't grow. I think the combination of a leave-in conditioner plus the argan oil did the trick. 

One more option you could try is get [an Indian product that contains coconut oil with herbs like amla](http://www.amazon.com/Dabur-Vatika-Enriched-Coconut-Hair/dp/B001TI8XBU/ref=pd_sim_bt_21). Some of these Indian things have smells we're not used to but after a while I find that I like them. "

So if someone says something mean, hurtful, painful, etc. ""in the bubble"", you're going to be hurt.  Are you not allowed to be hurt by it?  That's a consequence, is it not?

GaProgMan,retrobattlestations,1391178116.0,"**tl;dr** I thought I broken the computer that my parents broke, after an hour. But I didn't. Later, I taught myself BASIC.

When I was, about, 6 years old my parents bought a second hand [Amstrad CPC 464](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) for my brother (who would have been 4 at the time) and me. I remember that it came in a few plastic bags and had tonnes of cassette tapes with it.

I remember being told to take a seat on the chair that was bought specifically for it (after it was set up on a desk). We switched it on, and were instantly given the BASIC prompt. After a few minutes of looking around for an instruction manual, I decided to drop a tape into the drive.

In the case was a small sliver of paper that said

&gt; Crtl + Alt + Enter to run tape

I pressed those keys in unison.

&gt; Press ""Play"" on tape drive, then enter ""Run"" to continue

When it hit the play button, the tape drive motors didn't start up and nothing seemed to happen. I typed ""Run"" and hit the enter key.

Suddenly, the motor started and the tape began reading. After a few seconds the screen went blank and the tape's speaker started kicking out a hell of a racket.

&gt; Beep beeeeep screeeech silence beep booop beeep screeetch

It carried on for a few minutes. After a few seconds, the screen started to fill, line by line, from the top with an image (I think it was a plant in a pot, but I can't be sure). Once the image was finished, there was a (poorly) digitised chord played from the speaker.

I leaned over and pressed the enter key and the screen went blank. I thought I'd broken it, and turned to my parents with a sorry look on my face.

&gt; GaProgMan, look!

My Mum was pointing at the monitor. I spun round again to see ""Animal, Vegetable or Mineral"" printed across the top of screen. The rest of the screen was taken up with the rules of the game. I had to choose an animal vegetable or mineral, and the computer would guess what it was, based on my answers for yes or no style questions.

My brother prompted me with ""Crunchy cucumber"", which is what he has always called celery. We decided to go with my brother's choice, and started the game.

&gt; Is it an animal, vegetable or mineral?

Vegetable - I needed help with typing it, and we worked together to find the keys.

&gt; Is it green?

Yes.

&gt; Is it round?

No.

&gt; Is it long?

Yes.

&gt; Is it celery?

The machine had guessed the vegetable we'd chosen in 4 questions. ""How did the computer get so clever? It was just a bunch of stuff in a bag earlier?"" was what I asked my parents.

My brother shouted that he wanted to try, so I got off the chair and sat him on it.

About half an hour later, we'd all had several tries and fooling the computer and none of us had been able to. Looking back, I think my parents had been in cahoots about not choosing something that it wouldn't have an answer to.

&gt; It's got a thingy!

My brother yelled, when he found the joystick when going through the bags and bags of stuff that came with the computer.

After a while, my parents left us to ""play"" with the computer. My brother asked if we could plug the ""thingy"" in and try it. I started looking for a place to plug it in, but couldn't find it. I lifted the keyboard up and rotated it to try and find somewhere to plug it in. ""Found it,"" I said as my brother gave me the adapter end of the cable.

I set the keyboard back down, but the screen had gone blank. Panic! I've broken it! Tears welling in my eyes, I started to push random keys, hoping that something would make it work. I turned to my brother, who said that he was worried that plugging the ""thingy"" in had broken it, because it wasn't ready. He began crying, my Mum ran into the room worried about my brother.

&gt; I'm sorry, Mum. I think we broke it.

She came over and gave us both a hug and when we'd both calmed down, we told he what had happened.

&gt; Let me take a look.

Mum tilted the keyboard and noticed that the power chord had come out, slightly. She turned to look at us both, we were craning to see what she had done and I had tears in my eyes.

&gt; Hmm... I'm not sure. I might have to get your father.

She called for our Dad. When he got there, Mum beckoned him over and whispered with him while pointing at the keyboard. ""I'm in so much trouble,"" I said to my brother. ""I'll tell them that I did it. Don't you worry.""

&gt; I'm sorry Dad. I broke it. &lt;my brother's name&gt; had nothing to do with it.

""Hmm..."" My Dad said as he turned back to the machine. ""I think you might have to give your mother and me a minute to figure this out. go wash your face, GaProgMan. Then take your brother into the kitchen and get him a drink.""

As soon as my brother finished his drink, he was fine; chripy even. I was dreading what was going to happen.

&gt; GaProgMan! And bring &lt;my brother's name&gt;!

I was being summoned. I walked my brother back into the room with the computer.

&gt; Your mother and I had a long talk, it took a while, but we fixed it.

""How!?"" An air of relief coming over me.

...

Not too long after that, I was bought a book on the BASIC programming language, and would spend my allotted time (my brother and I had to share it, naturally) working through exercises in that book at the computer.

Thanks for the trip to nostalgia-land, OP :)

1. He had asked out another girl a couple of months before we got together. She said no, he said okay. Fast forward like, 3 months and we started dating. There was no issues or anything like that. I had just asked him to make sure that he didn't have feeling for said previous girl. (also, i was in a relationship at that time, so i wasn't that upset).

2. No. It didn't cause any problems for us. It worked out rather nicely. Now, i am sure if we had broken up, that would have been different. Basically, you have to be an adult about that shit.

3. Ask like you would any other date! He asked me out to sushi. We ended up going to an opera instead.

4. Gossip...eh. It is kind of bad at work. Get used to a lot of coworkers saying comments like ""Oh! I didn't know you two were dating. you all are so cute"".

5. Remember to have your own space. Dating someone and working together is a LOT of together time. Which can work out nicely, or be suffocating. Depends on the relationship. ALSO, if you all do break up, don't make it ugly. You still have to see them several times per week."

MrToM88,MensRights,1391178439.0,"Basically there are innate differences between boys and girls that point them towards different interests. Societal norms only reinforce or weaken those interests.

 One of the scientist, an evolutionary psychologist, explains that our interests stem from evolution. For instance children whose mother like doing what a mother do were more likely to survive. And as they were more likely to survive they were more likely to pass on their genes. In this case passing on the propensity to like being part of a group and to like social interactions.

Also they explain that this is why the more ""modern"" a country is the more likely you are going to see these differences in interests. If your country provides you with the opportunity to do whatever you want, then you are going to do exactly that, and that means you will follow what interest you. 

In not so ""modern"" country, as men and women are essentially able to do anything, people will work in fields where they can find work.

In the video people refuting this theory (what you are interested in is genetics and not only a social construct), had zero evidences so their points, needless to say, looked awfully weak.

ANewMachine615,explainlikeimfive,1391178470.0,"&gt;Why didn't he just make Gandalf strong enough to destroy the Nazgul and Sauron?

He probably was strong enough to defeat the Nazgul. In fact, right before the Rohirrim arrive, he's preparing to unleash his power to do just that against the Witch-King of Angmar. Instead, the Witch-King goes off to meet the Rohirrim's charge, and is killed there by Eowyn.

As for what Eru was doing, that gets into the whole underlying philosophy of Tolkien's legendarium. The entire world exists, at least in part, to prove the futility of evil. Not that evil can't win -- it can't, but that's not what makes it futile. No, the futility is that evil seeks to destroy beauty, but more beauty comes as a result of evil than would have existed otherwise. For instance, let's look at what happens after the Witch-King goes to meet the Rohirrim, rather than fighting Gandalf. Theoden dies, but feels no grief, for he died a warrior in battle with a deadly foe, and goes to the halls of his fathers in the afterlife unashamed. Eowyn kills the Witch-King, proving to herself and to everyone that she is a capable, worthy warrior. In the process, Eowyn is injured by the Black Breath, which causes a fever and nearly kills her. During her recuperation, Eowyn meets and falls in love with Faramir. After the War, she goes with Faramir to Ithilien, and fills it with gardens and life. 

So, Gandalf could've been given enough power to waltz into Barad-dur and defeat Sauron utterly, but Ithilien would've been less beautiful, Eowyn would've continued in depression and despair, and Theoden would've died years later, witless and unmanned by age rather than a great lord of a great people in mortal battle with darkness. That is, the Witch-King could've been stopped by Gandalf, but it would've prevented much that was good in the process.

The whole idea is laid out clearly in the *Ainulindale*, the first chapter of the Silmarillion. Basically, Melkor (AKA Morgoth, who was the Dark Lord before Sauron, and immeasurably more powerful) has been screwing up the Music of the Ainur by trying to take it over and impose his will on it. Eru Iuvatar responds:

&gt;Then Ilúvatar spoke, and he said: 'Mighty are the Ainur, and mightiest among them is Melkor; but that he may know, and all the Ainur, that I am Ilúvatar, those things that ye have sung, I will show them forth, that ye may see what ye have done. And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. **For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.**'

That ""show them forth"" part? Yeah, Eru takes their song and turns it into a Vision of the World, and then into the World itself. Their song *is* reality. And that last line is actually mellow compared to earlier versions of the *Ainulindale*. There's an early draft of the *Ainulindale* that says that after the end of Time, those who suffered most will be shown the fruits of their suffering, and say that it was worth it. Their suffering will give rise to beauty so great, they would undergo it again just to have the beauty exist.

Anyway, I could go on, as this is one of my favorite concepts from Tolkien's work, but you get the idea. Eru sent Gandalf back this way to ensure the maximum amount of beauty and good came from Sauron's downfall as possible."

FireHazard11,AskWomen,1391178596.0,"All of the research that I've seen says that couples that cohabitate before marriage have a higher chance of breaking up. 

**But**

I think that if you can't live together with your SO before you get married without breaking up, then you really shouldn't be getting married. Marriage isn't going to change how either of you act (I hope), it just makes it harder and more expensive to break up. 

Moving in together is a huge step in a relationship because you get to see how each of you acts when you're not in the mindset of going on a date. You'll see each other at your best, your absolute worst, and everything in between. More importantly: you'll see each other ALL THE TIME. Sure you can go into another room and not actually see each other, but you're still occupying the same general space. Which can be hard for some people to get over. Unless your relationship was forged by the hand of god, there's going to be some friction when you first move in together. All the little things that you do differently from each other can start to erode your relationship if they're not dealt with. Personality quirks you found cute may start to annoy you after a couple months. Things that you already didn't like about them but could tolerate for shorter amounts of time will begin to really irritate you. Except now you can't go home to recharge after so to speak. All of these things can be dealt with, but it takes patience and communication. You can say that you and your SO are good communicators who can talk through any problem, but you can't really know until you try it. "

So if I am grabbing chips, I stop and think do I crave the crunch or the salt? If I crave the crunch, a plate of raw veggies suits just as well. If I am craving the salt it can be much harder as I am also trying to cut out as much salt in my diet as reasonable. Sometimes I will just have a few salted roasted soy beans, but I really try to keep that to no more than once or twice a month. The planned snacks help somewhat, but not always as much as I would hope for if I am having a really boring day. I find if I am bored, exercising helps more than snacking on a substitute."

A severely wrecked car is not road-worthy. The insurance company determines it does not make financial sense to restore it to proper condition, both mechanically and cosmetically.

When someone rebuilds a wrecked car, they're doing it a hell of a lot more cheaply than the insurance company calculated to do the job properly. Sometimes they'll do just enough to make the car look really pretty cosmetically, but it's still a disaster from a functional standpoint. Sometimes they'll actually do it right. Sometimes (rarely) there actually is no functional damage (hail damage for example). Sometimes there's no crash damage but tons of functional damage (flood car for example). 9.5 times out of 10 the car was totaled because it was wrecked, and badly.

Bottom line is it's a crapshoot. Unless you know what the car looked like before it was fixed and/or know who did the work, you don't know what you're getting."

And I imagined all the applause bursts edited down into uniform 3-second chunks instead of varying in duration and intensity to convey the audience's approval of Obama's talking points.

I wondered what the speech would ultimately boil down to, content-wise. What's the meat and potatoes?

I started with the transcript and proceeded to delete sentences that don't say much of anything, or are redundant. The sentences that were left I boiled down into those labels of utility—is he specifically offering a suggestion? Is he specifically spelling out policy? Is he specifically attempting to make a truth-claim? Some phrases stuck out to me in a way that made them seem like they were inserted obligatorily.

It is interesting to boil down to the message and see what's left.

Scarlet-Ladder,asktransgender,1391179171.0,"My country is pretty developed, but we still have some problems. For the most part trans people are treated with respect, as least in theory. My government does not require SRS to change your gender on your birth certificate, but you do have to apply for a 'gender recognition certificate'. Trans people can access hormones and surgery through national free healthcare, but there are long waiting times, and lots of people are put off by that. 

Transgender and LGB people still make up a high proportion of the homeless population, and it is common for people to be rejected by their families. However, there are cases of really supportive families too. I can't really comment accurately on your other questions about sex work, as I don't know. 

Depending on where they are in transition, people may be put in prisons that are either for their assigned or desired sex. It sucks, but you can appeal. Our legal system isn't that corrupt, at least I don't think.

Childhood and the teen years are generally not good, because other kids are jerks and there's no education on how to treat trans people.

In the media (except for one newspaper that is generally horrible to trans people), we're generally referred to with preferred pronouns. I guess I'm lucky. I'm sorry Brazil is so harsh to trans people."

He was always our number 3 or 4 WR, and was almost always matched up against a 4th string CB or backup safety. Essentially what he does is he gets lost in the matchups, so he's almost always wide open when he gets the ball. Keep in mind he was a 1st round draft pick, so he's not a complete slouch at WR, but he's not starting caliber.

San Diego signed him to a big free agent contract to be their #1 or #2 guy when they lost Vincent Jackson. That's not what Meachem does. He also sat out his rookie year to learn our offense, so it seems like he is a very slow learner on the field. I don't think he ever adjusted to the system, and I don't think he really had the ability to be a #1 WR.

He's back in New Orleans, at least for this past season, doing exactly what he did before he left: catching the ball when no one is covering him."

He said after 30 minutes of strenuous mental work, we start to make mistakes. On average, this is solved with a 5-10 minute break. You can edit this stragety by changing the time but keeping the ratio. In general, I usually do an hour and 10 in the beginning, but sometimes get so unfocused that I have to do 15/5. The only thing you need to remember is to take a long break after 3-5 hours of work, depending on the person.

You can also mix this with another solution I thought of myself. If you feel like you just can't sit still, Do a problem, (read a paragraph, whatever) and then do a full on sprint with your work in hand to a different location to do another problem. Works with pretty much any other physical activity that makes you feel tired.

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1391179905.0,"My BFF had a Friday wedding, and I'm having a Sunday wedding.  There are pros and cons to each, but in the end it boils down to the type of guests you have.

Are most of them traveling?  Do most of them work M-F jobs?  Will there be heavy drinking?

What I liked about the Friday wedding (as the MOH) was that I got to see my friends off to their honeymoon, then have the whole weekend in her city to see the sights.  I didn't like that I had to take 3 days off of work to get there in time for the rehearsal and the wedding.

What I like about having a Sunday wedding is my guests can come into town on Friday night or Saturday, and only have to take one day off of work (Monday) for their travels home.  This means they can drink on Sunday night, but something I don't like is the locals who don't want to take time off of work will have to go in Monday morning."

C_Terror,spikes,1391180059.0,"Interesting deck list with Scion. I have 2 in my arsenal and I'll have to put them in and play test them. 

A couple notes.

- I like your explanation for pacifism over banisher priest. I'll have to consider it. **edit** Why don't you just run Arrest? It's one more extra mana but it deals with Pack Rats, our number 1 enemy in MBD.

- If you're running Ranger's Guile against spot removal, wouldn't Gods Willing be a much better choice? The Scry 1 is also extremely key.

- Putting in the Vitu Ghazi Guildmage is interesting; if you're going to run him, have you considered throwing Trostani into the mix?

- Seems like you replaced Ajani with the Spear. While I like the Spear's anthem and threat, I like the double strike flying for alpha strike more. What are your thoughts and justification for the change?

All in all, you gave me pretty good ideas for a Vitu Ghazi variant of the G/W Tokens/Midrange. I think (with BnG) additions, my deck list would be

4x Fleecemane

2x Vitu Ghazi Guildmage

3x Brimaz

Probably 4 our of 5 geared players i see have Mosins, either because they want them, or can't find the M4. Personally the Mosin, to me, seems a lot more dangerous. A Lone range (the holy grail) or even a PU scope makes them incredibly deadly because of their range and accuracy compared to an M4. I'm hoping that the Mosin shares its spawn with things like the SKS and the Ruger and the Shotgun, meaning that you see less and less of the sniper-Mosins and more of the other weapons. 

That would put me more at least anyway."
AnotherSmegHead,Christianity,1391180104.0,"Every description of Heaven I ever heard is all about how overwhelmingly wonderful it is.

Its not ignorance of knowledge, but an absence of the negative effects of such knowledge.

People are being raped and slaughtered and chopped up and injustice is going on.  Do you let that get to you EVERY WAKING MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE?  Of course not.  What GOOD does sadness serve in Heaven where its too late to do anything about it?  Really none.  

Here it may be a motivator, but once you're done, punch your card and join the party.  Be happy for what you have, not sad for what you can no longer control.  All the more reason to pick up your cross NOW and do your part in leading others to the better side of where the woodbine twineth. "

All the ""rap"" people are referring to when they talk about ""rap,"" is generally the mainstream stuff you hear on the radio, Kanye, Lil' Wayne, Lil' Jon, etc. IMHO I agree that they're all pretty terrible and promote negative traits and values.

Even some of the more renowned rappers, like Tupac, didn't always rap about those things. Sure he had some gangsta tracks like ""Still Ballin'"" but you'd be hard-pressed to find fault with the message of ""Brenda's Got a Baby,"" for instance.

I'm a huge fan of hip-hop, I just choose not to listen to that type of rap. I also don't listen to exclusively black rappers. And sometimes gangsta rap is fun to listen to.

Basically what I'm saying is that hip-hop is a huge and diverse genre of music, and you can't just write off ""rap"" as what you've described. And don't make the mistake of thinking that black culture = black American culture, that's something you guys do far too often. Black American culture is something that exists solely in the US.

These are meaningless statements outside the context of sexism and pomo hyperindividuslism

This hypothetical student is male. 'Presenting' as female in this case means a male person has conciously tried to mimic a normative set of female mannerisms. That is all. It's sexist and degrading. 

&gt;If you force her to go into the male dressing room, she'll be bullied and harrassed for sure, even more than a FAAB would. 

First of all, that's purely speculative and quite visibly not true accross the board. Second, women are not responsible for male violence. The correct response here is to lead the male student body away from judgement and bigotry, not reify gender norms in order to justify putting a male student in the female dressing room.

I'm not sure what makes you think former house slaves had An easier time escaping poverty than former field hands. To white people at the time, a Black person was a Black person. 

Remember that house slaves would be just as illiterate, abused, and unfamiliar with the outside world as a field hand. Due to their farming skills, many former field hands actually escaped poverty sooner, creating homestead in the West. The less skilled house slaves were less successful farmers."

Or a chiseled jaw and has a scruffy beard. Etc. 

Same thing with women. Some girls wear certain clothing/make-up/hairstyles because it shows off their good features making them look even more desirable.

There's a pretty good deal of maturity here, which is nice.

That extra time in between college-because-that's-just-what-you-do-after-high-school and college-again-years-later was essential for me, because I basically had no work ethic when I was 18.

creamcheesefiasco,TrollXChromosomes,1391180400.0,"I get bloated a lot. I also have acid reflux (heartburn, nausea, and excessive burping--when I'm bloated, I burp a lot) and I also suffer from occasional constipation. 

Some things I find helpful that you may also find helpful:

* Avoid drinking too many carbonated drinks. Carbonated drinks, for me, cause burping and bloating. 

* Making sure I drink enough water when I'm eating a lot of fibre. Too much fibre without enough water to 'wash it down' = bloat city. Drinking water with high fibre foods also helps the fibre work better and makes bowel movements more easier to pass. My general rule of thumb is one cup of water for every high fibre food I eat (I qualify anything with more than 4 grams of fibre per serving as high fibre).

* Taking probiotic supplements. This helps a lot with being regular and when I'm regular, I'm less bloated. 

* Try doing an elimination diet for both gluten and dairy (don't eliminate them both at the same time). I did a few elimination diets and found out I'm not gluten or dairy intolerant. I actually had more bloating, gas, and constipation when I eliminated those foods.

* Keep a food diary and note the time and days when you're the most bloated. Try to see if there is a pattern between certain foods and bloating. Gassy vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower make me feel bloated and farty.

* Go on Youtube and look up stomach massages for constipation and bloating. I really like the circular massages that are meant for gassy/colicy babies. They work really well but be prepared to fart a lot after you do the massage.

sunnieskye1,europe,1391180417.0,"There is a legendary ex-FBI agent named John Douglas, who is one of the founders of the FBI's criminal ""profiling"" unit (which Hollywood has made a travesty of). After he retired from the FBI, he wrote a book called *Law and Disorder*, which goes into the many missteps taken in the American justice system. Mr. Douglas was instrumental in getting the conviction of the [West Memphis Three reviewed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Memphis_Three), along with Peter Jackson and his wife. I would say he is an expert in evidence, causation, and has quite some weight in his opinions. 

He was asked by Ms. Knox's family to review evidence in this crime, and he believes Ms. Knox to be innocent. What I read of his reasons convinced me to change my mind - I originally though her to be guilty. Mr. Douglas thinks the murderer is already in jail - that it was Rudy Guede.

I know little about the Italian justice system, and not enough about America's, but I think it's possible that in the rush to solve this, just as with the OJ trial and with the WMT I mentioned above, mistakes were made. John Douglas has proved repeatedly that this happens repeatedly. If it can happen in one part of the world, it surely can happen in others. There is no perfect system, most especially where politics comes into it, and unfortunately careers are made and destroyed by things that occur in trials."

Corporate personhood is the legal concept that a corporation may be recognized as an individual in the eyes of the law. This doctrine forms the basis for legal recognition that corporations, as groups of people, may hold and exercise certain rights under the common law and the U.S. Constitution. For example, corporations may contract with other parties and sue or be sued in court in the same way as natural persons or unincorporated associations of persons. The doctrine does not hold that corporations are flesh and blood ""people"" apart from their shareholders, officers, and directors, nor does it grant to corporations all of the rights of citizens."

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1391180616.0,"&gt;A car completely is a luxury. Quite a few people can't afford one, and humanity survived for centuries before they were invented so they're obviously not a necessity

Humanity survived but won't survive easily without them now. This is again a no good example of comparison of a car to a gun.

&gt;But you're completely unable to show how responsible gun owners using handguns jeopardizes the safety of ""all other citizens"". It just doesn't.

Yes it does. As I have told you, you cannot guarantee all will be responsible. It's like with your car example, people are just constructed in a way there will always be a certain number of idiots. Even if majority of possible gun owners were responsible, even a small number like 5% can have a huge impact, especially that we are talking about holding a weapon, not a pet (funnily though, even some pets - dogs are forbidden to be kept because they were bread with one purpose - to be aggressive and to fight).

You shouldn't introduce a change in the law based on assumptions that ""majority"" will be responsible with a connection of a gun, something which was invented with a sole purpose of killing a person. Just because a small number of people enjoy guns responsibly for a sport, it doesn't mean that more guns should be allowed.

&gt;False, many guns are designed for target shooting. I've covered this already. You just seem to be of the opinion that ""Guns are bad mmmmkay"" and won't listen to reason.

Dude I have told you I have nothing against target shooting. Use your gun responsibly at the shooting range or when hunting. It's not necessary to have more small guns given to people as you still have your sport and can enjoy it with the types of guns you can use now for that purpose.

&gt;Don't want to own a gun? Don't own a gun. Don't like gay marriage? Don't get gay married. Don't like fish? Don't eat fish. We're not interested in deciding on your lives, just our own.

Nobody will force me to be gay, nor gay person can affect me directly. If he hits on me I would just tell him I'm not interested or to bug of. The same applies with fish and other silly examples. A person CAN force me with a gun to do things. It directly affects me. More guns with private people means higher risk of gun crime and whatever you say this is a FACT.

&gt;You're moving the goalposts. We're debating why we can't have handguns when we can have rifles and shotguns. I'd be fine with keeping my handguns at the range.

Maybe because small arms are easier to conceal and more popular with criminals?

&gt;Probably less risk than keeping kitchen knives.

Yeah, but you do need a knife as otherwise how will you cut food at the kitchen? You don't need a gun for any other purpose than for a sport, meaning knifes are useful and risk is taken into account. Guns are not useful in any other way.

&gt;People who keep firearms are well aware of the dangers/risks and are thus more careful around guns than most people are around any other potentially dangerous item.

But we are talking about irresponsible people here who will be allowed to have a gun in that situation and as I already mentioned, you cannot guarantee everybody will be responsible here.

&gt;If these measures are reasonable enough for rifles and shotguns, then why not handguns?

If it was for me I would ban keeping any guns as well as ban distribution of real imitation guns, which can very well be used in a crime just because they look real. If someone wants to have fun at the range then they will supply you with a gun. Around 11k offences with the use of guns for a year is a pretty high number, meaning that more bans and controls should be introduced, not other way around.

Finally, just Hungerford and Dunblane massacre should be enough reasons to restrict use of guns. You are fucking terribly selfish for wanting a gun for a ""sport"" where 17 kids were killed by an idiot who actually was allowed to legally hold a gun. Cumbria shooting gives an example where even rifles should be banned and it doesn't matter that it was only few exceptions. People died. Do you know what it is when a person dies? You lose your loved one? Just because some pathetic morons don't want to accept regulations and safety of guns because they are terribly selfish and think their sport and allowing them to keep guns at home (for fuck sake knowing reason) is the most important thing in the world, it doesn't give them any right to endanger other human beings.

And yes, guns are bad in general. There are required and useful by special forces and in exceptional circumstances but shouldn't be given away like a candy. Comparison with knifes or cars isn't proper as cars and knifes do have other uses and very originally invented with those other uses in mind, not to kill (like guns). Just because a small number of people use guns for a sport then tough luck, take harsher conditions or change a sport if you don't like it or emigrate to an idiotic USA where in XXI century they are still in the Wild West.

Yes, very.

Ignoring the revenues and saying 'but its a not-for-profit' would be the same argument as a small business owner being paid $20M a year because that's what CEO's get paid.

It is not unusual for CEO's to get paid a percentage of revenues or profits.

Mehknic,Pathfinder_RPG,1391180734.0,"The monster you summon has the Int score listed on the sheet, so you may or may not be able to command it.  The creature is there to help you; you do not need to make a check to control it.  That sort of things happens when you're trying to bind a creature or gate in something big - don't worry about it.

While you probably control it, remember to play it like the creature it is.  If it's a dumb cat, it'll probably just jump on the nearest enemy.  If it's a wolf, it'll probably try to flank with your melee (pack tactics).  If it's an archon, you can talk to it, but it's likely to try and help patch someone up before attacking if left to its own devices.

Summoning spells are one round (without feats or metamagic).  That means that your wizard starts summoning one turn, can't do anything until his next turn, and at the beginning of his next turn the creature is summoned and takes it's turn on your initiative. You then have your full set of actions for that round.

You use the stats from the bestiary, *but* with templates applied.  If you're good, many of the creatures get the ""Celestial"" template applied, and Evil/Chaotic/Lawful all have their own templates to apply.  These add resistances and DR, and in some cases Smite [opposed alignment].  The link at the end of my post contains tables that I put together to make things easier. Here's what each of the files is:

SMQR: Quick Reference - includes every base monster you can summon as well as some basic info about each one to help you make your decision at the table a little faster.  Does not include AP-specific ones.  Here's what all the symbols mean:

* Number on the left side = Summon spell level
* Q = Quality - Can be Utility, General-use, Offense, or Defense.  Colors are relative quality taken from Treantmonk's guide.
* T = Template - if there's an asterisk here, you apply the correct alignment template stats as noted in the stat blocks.
* S = Size - Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan
* The column with the colored symbols - Blue/Water (Aquatic), Pink/Wing (Flying), Yellow/Star (has Spell-Like Abilities)
* Special = Special Abilities - Trip, Grapple, Poison, etc.

This SMQR is intended to be printed as a single sheet and placed in the clear front of a binder.  The remaining five files are all set up to be printed double-sided and then 3-hole punched and placed in the binder.  Preferably with tabs denoting spell levels.

SM_Main: This contains the full spell description for Summon Monster X for reference, and then information on the four alignment templates you need to apply to various creatures.  This goes at the front of the binder.

SM1/SM2/SM3/SM4: These are the stat blocks for summonable creatures for Summon Monster 1-4 in alphabetical order.  I got lazy and stopped at SM4 when that game ended...I'll get back to it if I ever play that type of character again.  I basically copied these out of the SRD and cleaned them up.  The first few levels of SM in the SRD had the stats from the Augment Summoning feat applied in brackets, so those appear on some of the blocks.

""'Trevelyan's most enduring mark on history may be the quasi-genocidal anti-Irish racial sentiment [sic] he expressed during his term in the critical position of administrating relief for the millions of Irish peasants suffering under the Irish famine as Assistant Secretary to HM Treasury (1840-1859) under the Whig administration of Lord Russell.[1]'""

""The Peelite Relief Programs that were in operation during the beginning years of the famine were shut down on July 21, 1846 by Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax, on Trevelyan’s orders.[12]""

""A letter from Trevelyan to Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon and an article in Newspaper reinforce Trevelyan’s belief that Ireland needed to heal itself from within without the substantial aid from the British Government. Both were written in the second year of the blight, 1846, when over ninety percent of the potato crop had been destroyed.[13]""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Charles_Trevelyan,_1st_Baronet

This was the guy in charge of the Irish relief effort. Laissez Faire politics is great and all in theory, not so much when you have hundreds of thousands of people starving to death. Soup kitchens, not withstanding.

It doesn't fit within the stricter definitions of genocide, perhaps not even in the looser ones, but it's damn close and at this point becomes a philosophical debate between consequentialism and other ethical systems, especially on the point of whether it being deliberate, which it wasn't really, matters."

It was really funny because after that, she started having me drive her around, going pay for things around town, even helped her run a red carpet party for the imminent film release. It was tiring, but very surreal to rub shoulders with my teenage tv crush. I think she liked me because I was totally unimpressed with who she was (or acted like it) and treated her normally.

Not one fucking leak when he was done. I was impressed and pissed at the same time. I didn't *want* him to fail, but goddamn it who the fuck can tear apart half an engine and put it back together without a manual? This asshole, that's who.

I'm sorry /u/nickknight, if you're certain it's got nothing to do with your mum's reaction - in that case, I agree with /u/brillantezza that it probably just hasn't sunk in for your mum yet and she might react much more as expected when you see her in person."

acouch,sex,1391181169.0,"This may sound a little odd, but amp up your game in kind of a sleezy manner. Your objective should be to convince her you think she is super hot and you love every inch of her body.
  
-Spoil her and amp up the ""hey sexy"" and ""damn you look hot in that"" type of stuff (note they're more sexualized than ""you look beautiful babe"").  
-Focus on complimenting and groping her BODY, not her in general or telling her she has ""beautiful eyes"" or something
-If she's gained weight, tell her you like her ass and give it a handful squeeze at random times followed by a sweet kiss. 
-Take pictures of her with your phone if she looks particularly cute at the time (knowing your guy wants a frozen copy of you too look at randomly is so sweet.)
-Initiate sex with the lights off a few times and see if she bites.  If she gets used to it, during one round of hump-de-bump, say "" I cant stand this I need to see your body,"" turn on the lights and kiss every inch of her.  Get excited. 
-If you get her going, tell her you want her on top so you can see all of her and watch her gorgeous boobs bounce.
-send sexualized texts commenting on her ass or boobs (these parts get bigger with weight so its a good part to tell her you want)

note: all of these wrapped in to one day may obviously be a little much, but the point is to be a little more aggressive than you normally are about how hot you think her body is.  This is a funk and she'll get through it!  If you suggest dates that involve recreation and a little activity, she might be a little happier with herself as well!  Good luck!"

For my part, I feel like it's better to use abortion to get rid of inconvenient pregnancies than to bring unwanted life into the world.  A baby is a human being and should not be a punishment, yet so many people say ""well she knew what she was doing when she had sex, she deserves to have to have it/raise it.""  I dream of a world of infallible birth control where mistakes don't happen, but until that world exists I think we need abortion to get rid of *any* unwanted pregnancies.  I've never had an abortion and hope I never have to have one, but if it came down to it I absolutely would.

Posts like that are sensitive to me because false hope is a very real thing. It's the same as saying (when she'd find out she IS HIV+) ""Having HIV is fine! There will be a cure soon!"".

I'd try to spice up our sex life after a few months of living together by wearing sexy clothes, or texting him dirty things while he was at work during the day, or having a romantic dinner, etc. But he just said he had no sex drive.

One day, I remember vividly. I was making us dinner when he got home from work. I had told him that I really wanted him all day long, and I was beyond horny. He seemed to be reciprocating better than normal. I was pumped - we were gonna have crazy, off the wall sex that night for the first time in forever. I half expected him to walk in the door, strip me down and do me right there in the kitchen. He didn't kiss me when he came into the apartment. He went straight into his office to check his emails etc., barely saying a word to me. He was in there quite a while. I finished cooking and went to go get him, and there he was, sitting in his chair with his dick out beating off. He looked at me, terrified, and tried covering himself and exiting the browser window.

It was such a punch to the self esteem. Here I was - his girlfriend. Trying to be sexy for him, wanting him, needing him - and instead of trying to carry through on that mood from the day, he basically - in my mind - came home, raised the white flag and decided to get himself off.

That's when I knew we were pretty much done. I stopped trying after that. I didn't feel good about myself. I didn't want him to touch me because I felt like he was only doing it as an obligation."

SpectreSC,allthingsprotoss,1391181518.0,"What I do is -  
13 gate  
14 gas  
16 pylon  
@100% gate -&gt; cyber
18 zealot  
@100% cyber -&gt; chronoboost stalker  
@100% stalker -&gt; stalker  
@100 gas -&gt; chronoboost msc  
@400 minerals -&gt; nexus
  
The 2nd stalker and the msc should finish around the same time. Go ahead and send the zealot over about 5-10 seconds earlier than the stalkers due to the ms difference. I hotkey my stalkers to 1, zealot to 2, and msc to Q (control group 10.)  
  
I will kill any overlords I find on my way over, as larva and minerals are at a premium this early in the game. I'll take a queen if I can get it, but just the threat of you reinforcing this attack should force lings out of your opponent.  
  
Don't overcommit to this attack, as these are your only defending units for a little bit. The main idea behind the early poke is to force him to build zerglings instead of drones. You can survive if you lose your zealot, though it's a bit tougher. Losing a stalker can mean gg if Zerg decides to speedling allin (a popular option in my experience.) It's perfectly reasonable to recall to save your units.    
  
I create a wall at my natural, just like with a FFE. The cannon and choke really shine when you're counter-attacked. You can choose to follow up this opening any way you want, though IMO a robo and immortal are a solid choice, as roaches are roughly as popular as a huge wave of speedlings. This also gives you the benefit of warp prisms to harass and perhaps take an earlier expansion.  
  
My second choice would be to go into blink and pressure again. +1 stalkers take 3 shots instead of 4 to kill zerglings, and if you can get them nestled in behind a mineral line or between some structures, you can kill a ridiculous number of units. Obviously this can lead to DTs and archons if needed, but is still weak to heavy hydra pressure. It also tends to delay your 3rd a bit longer for a more aggressive stance, so if you don't do any damage, it could teeter on the brink of an allin.  
  
My PvZ isn't amazing, but since adopting a more aggressive style my winrates have definitely gone up. Even if you decide to take a milder approach, try using your MSC + recall in order to make huge hit and run strikes at your opponent's hatcheries. Combine it with warp prism harass at the opposing end of Zerg's territory and you can slowly chip away at his economy until you can get a solid lead."

(In fact, until 2001, the Seahawks were in the same division as the Broncos, when they left the American Football Conference and joined the National Football Conference, the other conference in the NFL.  But I suspect that the depiction in the Simpsons has more to do with a tie-in with an inter-conference game that had just occurred on Fox, the network that the Simpsons and some NFL games are shown on, as the Simpsons traditionally plays just after Sunday night NFL games.)

Amonette2012,aion,1391181649.0,"Hey there

Firstly, are you planning to try the EU or NA servers? [Here is a link that explains the main differences between the two.](http://forum.mmosite.com/thread/2/16/20130207/Aion_EU_Vs_NA_Free_to_Play_or_Truly_Free-5114711e40b1c5813-1.html) For EU, you need Gold Packs to unlock everything, however these come with veteran wards that are pretty useful. You can buy Gold Packs in game with game money or you can get them from the shop.

I play EU, so I can only speak for that side of things, but servers are all pretty active both sides of the pond, there isn't really much of a P2W element in that there' s not a lot you can buy that actually gives you any kind of advantage without spending a LOT of money. However the veteran reward system in EU has some very nice perks, so I guess you could say that people who have paid for time prior to free to play or used Gold Packs have some advantages.

PvP is probably the best in any MMO I've played, and a lot of people say that. I've also played RIFT, so I can safely say that the PvP is a lot more intense and there are a lot more ways to do it. We have arenas, PvP instances, a very active open world PvP scene (the end game areas are basically huge PvP zones) and also lots of people duelling for fun. Gearing does take some time, however there is now a reasonable end game PvP set that you can get in about two weeks that will give you somewhere to start.

Another good thing about Aion is that levels 1-50 have been nerfed a lot, so if you want to get to end game quickly to check it out, you can. If you are playing as a duo and playing regularly I would say you could reach end game and have a PvP set in a month or less.

Aion also has a pretty large amount of content these days, so you're unlikely to run out of things to do. "

I think this game is a perfect mix of good story, good gameplay, beautiful graphics and charming characters.

I remember the first time I played this game and I was amazed by the graphics. I had no idea a PS2 was capable of that. When I saw specialized media talking about how that game was a masterpiece, and proof that videogames should be considered a form of art, I obviously thought they were exagerating. Suffice to say that I took my words back when I played.

The story revolves around japanse mythology, which I'm fascinated by. The characters are great and very well-written too. I was very amused by the humor of this game.

I also enjoyed the Zelda-like gameplay. The game isn't full of enemies and grinding but it's not boring either. There's a good amount of everything. The boss fights are interesting and challenging, but not to the point you get frustrated, and the some goes for the puzzles.

And the music is just beautiful too.

I'm not from the south, and honestly, I *hate* being called ma'am, especially by my own child. I don't know why but it just sounds... subservient to me. I'm not her master, I'm her mommy. And MIL would get *so* upset about me refusing to make her call me ma'am. I had to tell her many, many times that it's just not gonna happen before she finally dropped it.

It's a different story if you're intercepting data that's already being transmitted. Logistically, it would be harder to configure all these machines to secretly store and upload the images in an undetectable fashion. Keep in mind that the processing is all done locally.

A single scanner (in Texas, I believe), was found to have been storing images from a limited period (it had been used in testing and not properly reconfigured). I don't recall all the details, but it made a fairly big splash in the newspaper. To require all scanners to store this information and secretly upload it would require considerably more effort. And moreover, there wouldn't be that much to gain. Unlike telephone conversations and emails, which can be mined for intelligence, naked photos of travellers aren't as useful.

Moreover, such an action would be viewed as an even greater breach of privacy and considered to be even less justifiable. It would also be on much shakier legal ground. 

Finally, it would require many more people to be ""in the know"" about what was going on (many of whom have less security clearance) and thus even more open to leaks."

I think I'm still a little skeptical, especially considering the already dodgy background on IQ tests (and the uncertainty of whether or not they're an accurate gauge of intelligence), but it's certainly an interesting topic to explore. Psychology isn't my field, but I'm wondering if perhaps the method of testing for intelligence is skewed by the male-dominant hierarchy in our society~ if people *feel* as if they are inferior, might they test that way as well simply because they have been treated as such?

My good friend didnt live with her boyfriend until he became her husband. They had both been living on their own for a while though, and he of course would spend the night frequently. Sometimes the whole weekend, etc. 

But she comes from a pretty religious family, and for her there wasnt really a question of if they would live together before being married or not. The way she explained it to me is that there has to be something that you do that you only do as a married couple, it makes the marriage more meaningful that way.

Anyway, I see her point. But I've been living with my boyfriend for almost 4 years now, we own a house together, share bank accounts... yet I still don't have a ring (not like im keeping track or anything...)

Anyway, to answer your question on behalf of my friend, the only thing she wasnt expecting after they moved in together is just how much he plays Call of Duty. He plays it in the morning before work, he plays it when he gets home from work, he plays after dinner, etc. He's still a loving and attentive husband otherwise though, so it doesnt really bother her that much, and it certainly isnt a deal breaker.

IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,cringepics,1391182080.0,"Vemma is an energy drink that is ""sold"" via a multi-level or referral marketing scheme.

Someone buys into Vemma, meaning they purchase it on an auto-ship program for themselves and gain the ability to sell it to others. However, it's less about selling it to others and more about recruiting them to sell it, too.

You build your ""chain"" of people and supposedly make money from all the chains they start, too. When you sign up, you can choose from different ""packages"" that autoship you different types/amounts of Vemma and ""unlock"" different earning potentials. There are a handful of people who probably make a lot of money from it, but most people just sign up and get fleeced.

Also, it's worth mentioning that the drink itself is worthless. It's got some vitamins and mangosteen. Everyone raves about how good they feel -*I had IBS and then I started Vemma and now I don't!* but they would feel the same if they just slept and took a damn multivitamin."

Who said I would be unhappy until the bully suffered anyway?

Sure, a 3-4 year age difference is nothing once we're older. But in terms of maturity, a freshman in high school is VERY different from a senior. Not just mentally but physically as well. There are a lot of factors that go into growing up and how you're going to mature as you get older. I try to wrap my head around who I was when I was 13 and who I was when I was 17, and they're two very different people. Hell, even now that I'm in my mid-20s, I'm far different than I was when I had just turned 21. 

I suppose it could work if you both are near the same level of maturity. But the odds of that happening are very slim. Plus once you graduate and she's still in high school, you'll want to venture around the real world while she's still growing up and in that school-aged mindset. "

That same school, became fashionable to take a blanket from home to endure the cold during breaks between classes. After 1 month and blankets with multiple students by the school, it was forbidden. The reason? Couples began to bring blankets and several were caught with sexual attitudes. The rumor that was most talked about was that two girls were caught exchanging kisses on private parts while under a blanket.

frackaracka,ABCDesis,1391182631.0,"I wouldn't say I understand both sides perfectly, because I'm still constantly learning.

One of the books that really crystallized my thoughts into words was ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion"" by Jonathan Haidt. The book described the moral foundations underpinning ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" worldviews, and even described a trip to India that finally made him intimately understand the deep relationships and views on identity in Indian society.

I thought this book was eye-opening because even though it wasn't the author's intention, it really encapsulated the entire East-West tug-of-war that we go through, that no one else can understand. It goes beyond the typical first-gen, second-gen immigrant experiences because our American experience is confined within the larger bubble of the heritage that our parents brought over. It's like one cog within another cog, moving in opposite directions but keeping momentum alive.

And some people shun one cog. They stop one and let the other do all the work, but I've seen that eventually that one cog wears down faster without the other to keep up the pace.

Anyways, to answer your question. I do appreciate my rich heritage. I think that there are a lot of things that our ancestors figured out about the human condition, and there is a lot of extraordinary insight, especially when you consider that they arrived at these ideas eons before modern advances. I think it's fascinating that science is corroborating a lot of what our people had already discovered hundreds of years ago.

But - I think that there is a lot that Indian culture can learn from Western culture. And I think that there is a lot that Westerners can learn from Indian culture. I think that we as a group are uniquely situated to pick and choose from the best of each culture - at least, those of us that are interested in doing so. Time will only tell how successful we will be, but for now, I feel self-assured in who I am and how I came to be as a result of navigating both worlds. And I think that if I managed to do that on my own, then I can do anything."

eaglescout1984,explainlikeimfive,1391182663.0,"I will add in that from an American perspective, if the scenario had occurred in the United State (questionable crime scene investigation and all) and the conviction was thrown out by an appeals court based on evidence the original criminal case had misconduct by investigators, attorneys (on either side), jurors or the judge, then the ordeal is all over for the defendant. Since the constitution of the US forbids double jeopardy, that is being tried for the same crime twice, someone cannot be retried if an appeals court throws out the initial conviction.

That brings us to this case where such a verdict had come down from an appeals court, BUT because Italy has no protection against double jeopardy, Italian prosecutors were able to bring up the charges against Knox and Sollecito in a new trial and get them convicted, all over again.

This of course brings up an interesting legal question: if the charges are certified by Italy's highest court and Italian authorities push for extradition from the US, what would the state department do? That's another ELI5 for another day."

bubbish,AskMen,1391182668.0,"I strongly believe that relationships are shaped by circumstance, more than anything else. That person you reject today might become the apple of your eye in two years' time. Being someone's second choice isn't always about **you**, it can be about someone else being simply too much to contend with. Sure, it stings, but I don't see why you should let these matters cut you in the heart. I believe that if you truly have self respect, you won't let other people's mistakes, choices and just circumstance in general have a deep effect on how you see your own value.

And this is the voice of experience. I dated a girl for 4 months and everything was great. Suddenly her ex of 4 years came back and proposed. I'm not too lacking in self confidence but you can't fool yourself into thinking you're going to win *every fight*. You have to pick your battles, and losing one doesn't always mean that you lost the war. People come around. But they won't come back to you if you show resentfulness. That's why I believe that while you do have to protect your own feelings and needs, you will also do well in making peace with every person who is worth it, even if their choices and mistakes getting in the way of your desires.

The group of players (the sjws) are a super sentai force that has been sent back to the past to undo the evil that is the mysterious shadowy force...THE PATRIARCHY!!!...before it has time to fully take it's evil hold on the world.  In the past, the players will find that PoC are a very dominant character type and can be found everywhere in the world but that the evil patriarchal forces of barbaric, cishet, white men are rampaging through the lands and raping, pillaging, and plundering the utopian lives of all the other people (PoC).  

Some campaigns could involve stopping the evil patriarchal forces from either influencing to or impersonating famous PoC armies and invading forces that also ""supposedly"" (seriously, we all know it was the white devil) did atrocious things throughout history.

Eagle-Eye-Smith,Israel,1391182733.0,"I have arab neighbors. I study together with arab students. I went to the doctor to get my eye checked a few days ago, and he was an arab, so was my pharmacist. While waiting in line for the doctor and pharmacist, I sat next to both jews and arabs. There was no special seating arrangement for arabs and jews, nor there was a separate pharmacy. 

Now, does this mean that Israel is somehow a perfect, non racist paradise? Fuck no. Arabs in Israel consistently have more trouble getting a job than jewish Israelis; The predominantly arab towns in Israel are usually poorer than the predominantly jewish towns; The arab sector is one of the poorest sectors in Israel, followed closely by the Israeli ultra-orthodox jews (haredim); And you would, a lot of times, see racist words and sentiment coming out of an individual's mouth.

But it's a weird sort of racism- It's like we live in a state of constant cognitive dissonance. For example, one of my friends from college is pretty right wing and openly stated in front of me that he doesn't like arabs. But he also has arab friends from college. They study together, they play football together, the guy even invited them to his wedding.

It's a strange situation, when ""hating arabs"" is cool but being ""racist"" is frowned upon. So you will get people who vote against pulling out of the west bank, who will vote to the most right wing parties any day, who will openly encourage laws that ignore the Israeli arab population, but wouldn't mind to go clubbing or sit next to one on the bus."

While emphasis should be placed on unilateral work, it should not be the focal point of any strength program. I'm of the opinion that single leg work is accessory work that will complement the main lifts.

Also, this program is meant for intermediate lifters with a relatively strong background in lifting already. It's meant for athletes working to transition from off season training to peaking for tryouts or a combine.

So, for a brand new freshman who has maybe less than a semester's worth of playing time and even less time in the gym probably won't benefit from this program and most likely shouldn't even be doing this.

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1391182925.0,"Okay, I would like to just say something real quick: You're not going to always be the most attractive girl a guy dates. Unless you started dating a guy who's only had one girlfriend or something there'll be a chance that he finds his exes as attractive if not more. Running away from this isn't going to change that fact. Attractiveness is really subjective, so another guy might prefer you over a model. You're never going to be the prettiest women in everyone's (or at least the guys you date) eyes. It doesn't matter if you're a model with big breast, tiny waist, and a beautiful face. Some people are going to find you incredibly attractive, others not so much. 

My problem though is the way your fiance handled this. First of all, he lied to you about his ex. The fact that he didn't stop the conversation, but encouraged it, and lied to you about it is a huge red flag and not okay. His response to your questions were not good either. ""You really want to know?"" Really? It doesn't matter what he says after that because you know what he's thinking is going to hurt you. I think if you're insecure about yourself he might not be the best guy to help with that. 

Mostly though I would be concerned about the fact that he lied to you and tried to get his ex to talk about how much she thinks about him. Relationships are suppose to make you feel good about yourself. If you don't think you're getting that here then yeah you can break up with him and find someone else. You have to recognize though that this isn't just a problem that will disappear because you start dating someone else. It might be better, but this is something you're going to have to work on too."

letsburn00,rocketry,1391182988.0,"The nitrogen in the feed gas would somewhat reduce the ISP, but by using atmospheric oxygen the equivalent ISP is so high that it almost doesn't matter.

ISP is essentially amount of thrust/amount of fuel needed to make that thrust.

Normally for a rocket, ISP ""fuel"" can be defined as both the actual Fuel (i.e RP-1, H2 or LNG) plus the oxidizer (usually O2). Given for a single reaction
O2+2H2= 2H2O and that fact that Oxygen is 16 times heavier, by pure weight you'd need 8 times as much Oxygen as hydrogen by mass. The airbreather essentually (if it was as effective) removes the need to carry Oxygen for the airbreathing section of flight. Fuel for ISP (and efficiency) fundamentally is based on how much stuff do you need to carry at liftoff that will eventually being thrown at high speed out the back of your craft.

One of the ISP equations does have the molecular weight of the exhaust in it, but given water's molecular weight is 18, and Nitrogen's is 28, it's not a massive massive issue. Yes if they could remove the N2 that would be great, but it would make the engine even more complicated before it had ever gotten off the ground.

Projects like Skylon have been killed by technology creep as the designers get a great idea and throw out their old perfectly usable ideas for 5% more efficiency with 20% more cost. Often the best way to make them work is to set the design in stone and only allow changes when they are absolutely critical and save new ideas for the Mark 2. If I recall the Saturn V and the LEM hit this point years before the first test flights just to ensure that the work got done. I work in EPCM and there is a point where unless something won't work, is illegal or will kill someone no changes are allowed.

On the plus side if they did eventually go down this route, Oxygen does preferentially liquefy before Nitrogen when you cool an air stream due to it's higher boiler point."

Wuffles70,fatpeoplestories,1391183130.0,"Sorry it took a while to respond, I was kind of figuring out what to say. I know I was tested for Aspergers so I imagine, if there is a significant link between selective eating and ADD, one of the specialists I was sent to would have ruled that one out. All I ended up being diagnosed with was dyspraxia and my childhood was medication-free. I think my selective eating was mostly rooted in anxiety - I'd always been fussy when it came to food but apparently when I started being bullied at school at the age of about 4-6, it got a lot worse very quickly.

 The range of foods I can eat definitely narrows when I'm stressed but I am way, way less selective now, mostly because I made up my own program when I hit about 18 and decided I'd really had enough of getting nervous every time people suggested going out for dinner or eating at a friends house. It was largely based off a system my Mum had me on when I was little, where she had a star chart and I had to try a new food every day to get a star and at the end of (I think) 2-4 weeks, if I had a chart full of stars, I got a little prize. I think that system was always a little too aggressive (they always wanted to stretch the 'unsafe food' choices a little too far out of my comfort zone and besides, I didn't really **want** to eat them anyway) so I didn't make a huge amount of progress as a child but I do credit it with giving me the tools to figure out how to do it myself as I grew up.

My system was altered depending on my anxiety level so there were few absolutely rigid rules, I just made sure that I stretched myself, ideally every day. I taught myself how to cook and watched a lot of cookery shows, which gave me a chance to get better acquainted with ingredients that made me nervous. I'd make new recipes with ingredients that I trusted but were arranged in a 'new' way and gradually included small amounts of the 'unsafe' foods. I also started asking people what certain things tasted like, how they felt in their mouths, what the foods looked like on the inside (friends and family who knew what I was doing, that is! I don't recommend it with acquaintances, haha!). I gave myself opportunities to think about eating the food, trying to figure out which parts of it made me nervous and rationalise them a bit more. I'd look up what, nutritionally, the ingredient I was thinking of trying would do for me, which helped a lot with the irrational fear of the ingredients being somehow tainted or unsafe. 

I'd remind myself that a lot of foods will taste weird because they're unfamiliar and it can take up to 8 times before you really know if you like something or not and, even then, your tastebuds die off as you age and there are foods that I may well not like now but will 'grow into' later. A good example of this is brussels sprouts - I've been trying them at Christmas every year for the last 5 years and I only actually liked them when I ate them a month ago! Doing it under my own steam allowed me to address the parts which actually scared me, as opposed to what other people thought the issue was and it does really really help. As a child, when I first went into treatment, I ate 8 foods (that includes butter). I think the specialist managed to wrangle it up to maybe 10-15 foods? As an adult, I now cannot count the number of food that I eat. The big groups which I still find difficult are fish (I can eat cod and haddock but that's about it for now), shellfish, offal, blue cheese and meat off the bone or of questionable origins. Pretty much all vegetable matter and fruits are things I'll give a whirl (apart from exotic mushrooms and, for some reason, kiwis). That said, I'm still learning and pushing it, albeit with less frequency than I did 5 years ago - we're hosting a belated Burns night at my house in a day or two and I'm going to be trying haggis for the first time! 

If your son is really motivated and is willing to take it slowly and appreciate that he may not see results for months, if not years, then he may well be able to expand his horizons, food wise. That said, I got better when I was old enough to be self-motivated and to **nicely but firmly** tell my family to back off. Having people try to talk me through eating something made me self conscious and worsened my anxiety and some of my most adventurous foods (like whole whitebait and dum sum with shrimp in!) were eaten amongst people who had no idea that I have selective eating issues - knowing that people aren't watching or critiquing really helps me get over the hump and one of the hardest parts of this whole thing for my family was learning not to hover. It's well meaning and necessarily when someone is a child but as an adult, it can become very counter productive because it makes things tense - I pretty much banned any external stress during meal times or in the kitchen. It was the centre of all the cooking and development of new eating habits so it was necessary for me to turn it into a 'safe space' in my mind - to the extent where, if I had an argument that started in the kitchen, I moved it into the next room. It was definitely a hard habit for my family to break because they were so used to worrying about me eating that they found it hard to let go and trust that I could do it on my own. Now, they refer to me casually as a foodie so I think they'd count it as a success. 

The structure of selective eating is still there, definitely. I've just learnt how to work within it to expand my choices to the point where those who do not know me would never have guessed that I have a problem. If I am having a particularly high anxiety day, I may opt for a vegetarian option on a menu or something like that but, aside from sea food restaurants (my old nemesis!), I can go pretty much anywhere and know that I am going to be able to not only eat, but enjoy my food. That alone makes me really glad that I did it. "

paperclip1213,changemyview,1391183273.0,"Interesting. I'm going through this very dilemma with myself. (I'm not pregnant but I am a female who lives to nurture but refuses to have her own children.) This isn't really an attempt to *change* your view, but just to sort of help you empathise with the opposite view. 

So, my view is that it is entirely understandable because we, as humans, are already prone to feeling a lot of pain throughout life. For those who believe their child will have a life not worth living obviously think so from their experience. I know in my own experience I've had to endure multiple mental illnesses -- [severe] major depression, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, and I also alternate between eating disorders anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder. Knowing that these can be inherited by my children puts me off having kids because the illnesses make me despise my life. I'm a suicidal wreck who's forced to get through each and every single day because she can't just do the deed because her family are emotionally dependent on her. I don't want my kids to go through a similar thing because no one deserves this shit. Life is a great big pile of shit which so many of us would choose not to go through so I like to think I'd have an abortion if I ever fell pregnant because I'd be making the choice my kids would be very likely to make when they're older.

Do they give you injections and/or help you with medications? He tries to remind me about my pills if he didn't see me take them and due to my needle phobia, it's just easier/quicker if he does the injections.
 

What are your expectations? I would expect a partner of any sort to be a partner. I can't imagine being in a relationship with someone who was just ""meh"" about having children with me. I think that is very important. 

What are your desires? Support? Mentally and phiscally. I wouldn't mind if my partner could not make appointments, but I would if they had no desire in being there for me if I wanted. 

What's reasonable? That varies by relationships, they are not all the same. 

EDIT: I just want to say, I am not trying to down anyone else. This poll was on my opinions, everyone and every relationship is different. "

NeverNix,AskMen,1391183408.0,"I dated a generous, loving, loyal, talented man for over 4 years. We were engaged to be married. If you needed someone to drive across the state to help you fix a flat tire at 3 am, or someone to help an elderly woman across the street, he was your guy. But, if you needed him to show up at work on time every day, he couldn't do it. He worked a specific trade, and was really good at it. So good that he was hired, fired and re-hired at nearly every shop in town. I was going to college and working a high stress career oriented job and footing the bill for everything. It took me way way too much time, effort and money to realize that he was not going to wake up one day and realize he had to get his shit together. I broke up with him, breaking my own heart in the process. When people asked why I said ""I need my partner to be working as hard as I am."" He never was, and even though there was love between us, that's not enough to make a life with. 

Your boyfriend needs to hit rock bottom, and your presence in his life will prevent that. Get out, move on, work on yourself and what you want in life. It's going to *suck,* especially at the beginning, and you're going to want to jump in and save him, but DON'T do it. Good luck."

I saw moving in together as a commitment that would eventually lead to marriage. My boyfriend at the time saw it as a convenience and money saving move. He was no more committed to me or the relationship than he was when we were just dating. 

Later, when we bought a house, I saw it as one step closer to a permanent, legal commitment. Again, he saw it as money saving and better than throwing money away on rent. 


Also, breaking up is MUCH harder when you live together. Before you take that step just make sure you are both fully committed to the relationship (yes things change, but be honest with yourself at this stage to save you both trouble down the road).  And make sure you both agree on what moving in together means. 


In the future I would only consider living with someone once we were engaged - once we have made a real commitment to each other and are planning a wedding/life together. "

TorontoMike,toronto,1391183715.0," * During rush hour the train is at capacity and the platforms / trains look like a Japanese Subway

* The cars themselves have reached the ends of their lives and there are no replacements for them ( unless we poach Detroit's RT but that is another story ) because of a number of reasons - Bombardier does not make that model any more only a larger one and the turns and switches are too sharp or narrow for the longer new trains,  so would need hundreds of millions of dollars and years with no SRT while they fix the track ( and most likely have to completely rebuild Kennedy ) . The power system for the SRT is a one off since they changed it on later vehicles so would either have to adapt the vehicles or the track so again $$$ millions .

 * Winter -- Snow interferes with the power pick up so they have to run trains all night when it snows to keep the line clear, if it snows too much then it is a real pain to have specially trained people out with brooms to clean the switches Etc.

* The track width is not TTC size so when they need to be fixed they have to be put on a truck and hauled to another shop ( rather then put in the subway tunnel at kennedy and pushed to Greenwood yard ) as well the Technology is oddball so you can't just grab people off the subway to do work on those cars or that track . 
 


The Big Dilemma is 
It would cost 1/2 a billion dollars just to fix the track and infrastructure with no SRT for 2 years -- Then the cost of replacement buses and Then the Cost of the new train . and you have not gained very much since by that time it will be at capacity once again and for easily one billion dollars you have not made any more stations or more track , you just got back what you had before.

How will we navigate all that?

Anonymous sperm is more expensive, but it kept me from having to figure out the answer to all those questions.  My children will have plenty of male role models - five uncles between my wife and I, plus our own uncles and fathers, and a wide variety of male gender identities (for instance, my older brother does drag, and my little brother is a math major and music geek).  

BUT.  You asked about how you could make it easier and things to think about.  I would say you should have several conversations about what they're envisioning.  You can't follow their lead if you don't know where they're trying to lead you.  And you should probably talk to your *own* lawyer, too, before you just sign papers waiving your rights with *their* lawyer, just so you know everything you're waiving and what potential future legal complications you can head off now.  Other than that... in those conversations, talk about all those questions I just asked.  If these are women you know, then it is likely you'll know them for a while.  Seeing their baby may awaken something in you, making you want to at least be involved as an uncle.  So talking about all this ahead of time is really important."

Gogogodzirra,personalfinance,1391184040.0,"No tax expert here, but I'm going to weigh in with the majority on this.

If I was your parents, and I provided a lot for you (which maybe they did, but I'm taking you at your word), then I would want to claim both of you.

If you gave them that amount of money, and they essentially ""required it"" to live there, then it becomes a non-contracted renters deal. You could have done the exact same with almost anyone who had rooms to rent, and if they were smart, they would have declared the income, but also the deductions of running a business, which could equate to a loss for them.

Declare your child.  Do your taxes accurately and quickly.  If your parents do the same thing, let the IRS figure it out.  I would guess that most IRS agents will see things as I did.  You could have simply done the same thing with roommates and been in the same situation.  

I would also, if possible, ask your parents for receipts from the money you gave them.  It was all in cash, but if they don't, and the IRS actually comes knocking, they'll want to know where all that extra cash came from into your parents accounts if they ever deposited it."

It really brought home the point that sexism often takes the form of paternalism and stereotyping rather than outright dislike, e.g., by framing women as ""natural victims"" who have only themselves to blame if they get beat up or raped. 

That's part of it. Another part is that if she calls the police when the abuser shows up, or calls the police to report an assault, the housing authority/landlord sees her as a ""problem tenant"" because of the number of police calls to her home. 

My city has regulations that fine landlords if their properties have too many police calls to them. The idea is to crack down on landlords who turn a blind eye to drug dealing or loud parties at their properties. After they passed them, someone had to point out - hey, we should probably make an exception for people who are calling the police *from* the property because they are the victim of a crime. "

marty1411,AskWomen,1391184247.0,"I'm in the you **have** to live together camp. I've been living with my boyfriend for 3 years now and it was a big culture shock for me to start with. We have opposing views on all cleaning habits and he can *never* find the wash basket for clothes. I've learnt to live with it, but I would never have known about these without living with him. 

I also have a friend who has been with her boyfriend for 4 years and they are about to buy a place together, without having lived together. Myself and our other friends have suggested renting first, however, she's adamant about buying. However, the longest time they have spent together is 1 week on holiday. This means that it was a happy time, if you move in together you will spend months together without spending a night away from each other. It can be quite daunting. 

Also, it's a bigger change than you think. You become the person that they talk to after a hard day/week/month. Work's consistently hard? That's something you hear about every day once their home from work. You've had a bad day too? You can both share your days, but you've got to be prepared to listen to their day too. Maybe you like to come home and not talk to someone after work, but they like to come home and vent/talk. These are things you really don't learn from living apart. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my boyfriend and I wouldn't change a thing (apart from maybe a bigger place!) but it takes work and it's work that you never even thought about. It's also a lot of give and take, I know that my boyfriend doesn't think about his clothes on the floor, but they bug me so I'll pick them up. I know that he doesn't like it that I sometime leave dishes to soak, so I won't leave them soaking (unless it's a really stubborn bit).

This is totally illogical.  There is no if/then between these two statements.

&gt; it isn't accurate to say, for example, that the state's due process rights have been violated.

But it is accurate to say that the trial was not conducted properly.

How about a case of drug possession where the evidence is excluded due to a constitutional breach.  An acquittal is entered directly after the voir dire due to an absence of evidence.  How is it oppressive or unfair for the state to appeal the ruling of the voir dire?"

By sex propaganda, do you mean the fact that it is widely accepted that desiring sex is the normal and natural orientation for the vast majority of people? Nobody is saying you personally have to go out and have sex (unless you are complaining about not having it). We are just expressing our enjoyment of this activity.

What would make you happy? Do you want us ""breeders"" to stop ""flaunting"" our personal choices?

If you jerk us, do we not come? If you tickle us, do we not laugh... and then come? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?

Do you know what abusers do? A lot of times they'll tear down you're self-esteem and self-confidence so you feel like you either can't leave, he/she's the only one that want's you, or that you deserve the treatment you're getting. 

It doesn't matter how great this guy *can be.* I'm sure every single person on this planet has some redeeming quality. Yes, every single person has their flaws, but that's not justification for what he's doing. This isn't some annoying habit, or him being at work too much. This is him trying to hurt you. Why in the world do you want to be with someone who *wants to hurt you?* Who sees you on the ground and just wants to kick you down further. It doesn't matter that he does that ""when he's angry,"" because that anger is apart of him. His anger isn't some separate person that occupies his body for a few hours. It's *him.* When you sign up to date the good side of him you get the bad too. 

It doesn't matter how much he apologizes, even if he's sincere (which he's not). He repeatedly does this to you without trying to fix himself. It's like taking your money every single day and saying, ""I'm sorry."" Well, if they were sorry why wouldn't they stop? Or why wouldn't they seek help to stop if the problem was too severe for them to handle?

It will take years of therapy to get him to a point where he could be in a functional and healthy relationship. That would only be if he actually *tried* and recognized that he has a problem, and he doesn't recognize that. 

You can try as hard as you want in this relationship but it takes two to tango. It's clear that this behavior is engrained into him and he's not going to make an effort to stop it. The fact that he sees you cry and then calls you weak is proof of that! I really don't think there's anything you can do to convince him to get help. That's something he's going to have to come to terms with on his own. 

The relationship you described is not normal. It's abusive, and you're never going to be happy when you're with him. Yes it will hurt right now leaving him, but you will thank yourself in a few years from now. "

cyberdark10,sips,1391184516.0,"Satire, irony and sarcasm are three different things. 

Satire is when you combine irony and sarcasm and apply it to a certain subject, most of the time to discredit it. The novella ""Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions"" displays heavy satire, it used sarcasm, wit, and irony to discredit the Victorian culture, I recommend this book to everyone who likes reading. 

Irony is when something happens with the opposite effect intended. It's ironic that the US army went into Middle East supposedly to free it from it's dictators,  yet due to the actions of the US army, worse dictators were put into power.

Sarcasm is when you say the opposite of what you mean. If you only change your socks once a year, and someone tells you ""Wow, your feet must be so clean!"" they're using sarcasm.

hafetysazard,AskReddit,1391184559.0,"&gt;The fact that different cultures see certain things as ok does not make so.

Well, of course not, but without getting into a discussion about universal morality, there is some concession that has to be made that such things are dependent entirely on perspective.

Your opinion of certain cultures as being too stubborn is, at least, equal to the opinion those people from those cultures have of your culture.  If you don't believe people from other cultures feel the same emotion of resentment to others who are different than they are, as you feel towards them, then it is obvious you are operating according to some superiority complex.  Quite comically, they do so as well.

I am merely trying to reinforce my point that there is nothing tangible keeping certain cultures different, nor is there any real metric you can use to judge which culture is superior and which isn't.  If cultures are so different, and do things for different reasons, it is like comparing apples to tire irons.

Chances are you are bound to selfishly consider your point of view to be the correct one. While you may concede some behaviours and traditions of your culture are counter-productive, you likely consider them nuances that make your culture unique; not inferior.  However, when others pass judgement of your culture, such nuances are not viewed so warm-heartedly; they are view as justification why their culture is better."

sunofabeeeyetch,AskReddit,1391184669.0,"Never did I say I would go out of my way to make criminals unhappy. That's not my realm of expertise, and I don't expect it to be for quite a while. Regardless, they can be productive members of society stuck in dead-end, if stable, jobs, and I'd be willing to bet they wouldn't want to go back into prison. All I'm saying is that if they get what they deserve (that is, suffering) then nobody besides them are less well-off for it. Some, perhaps the victims, are going to be especially well-off for it, however. Doesn't make it mutually exclusive with a sensible rehabilitation program. 

Free will is only a delusion insofar as every molecule, every atom, every sub-atomic particle affects each other in a multitude of ways that eventually result in some sort of reaction. Insofar as we're talking individual actions and philosophies, however, the nihilistic view you espouse contributes absolutely nothing and only blocks constructive discourse; hey, we have no free will right? Why not act in a presupposed manner? No sense in it at all, stop making excuses.

After a certain point, bullies should be able to recognize that what they're doing is wrong and bad, regardless of their environment or genes. While exceptions do exist, like the bully literally having been brainwashed into following a crude winner-take-all ideology, most human beings in sufficiently developed have at least the ability to realize that they're being the bully; what makes them bad people is that they continue to do it anyway because they just don't care.

I expect vegans to respect my right to eat meat and to disagree with their assessment of the moral situation.  Furthermore, we have too many children born who aren't wanted, to parents who can't handle them.  We shouldn't complain when responsible people procreate as the quality of the product will be higher.

Lastly, the first step towards solving this problem is free birth control for everyone, not shaming relatives.  If the arguments are good enough, then shame isn't needed.  If they aren't good enough, then work on your delivery, don't get pissy at others for disagreeing.

I ended up growing it out in the end because it was triple the maintenance compared to long hair (for me). My hair at that length tended to want to stick up on its own (anti-gravity hair, yeah!), which meant using a ton of product and styling it just right every morning. I also didn't know before I had my hair cut that I have *two* cowlicks - long hair weighs them down enough that they don't really give me any trouble. Short hair have them the freedom to do their own thing. If I was having a bad hair day, it was really hard for me to get a handle on it, because my options were pretty much ""wear a hat"". With long hair, I can wear a hat or I can just throw it in a ponytail or a bun.

Namaha,AskReddit,1391184829.0,"I started at the company a little over 3 years ago (Oct 2010 if memory serves). The NOC position (I was one of about 7 operators) was pretty simple and didn't require much technical knowledge. Mostly just monitoring our custom applications and then notifying higher ups if I saw an error in the logs, queue backing up, etc. We would also manually run certain tasks throughout the day. 

After about a year of that we started to automate all of our manual tasks using Powershell. I got involved with the project, and was bumped up to Senior Network Operator after a few months of writing scripts. The automation project took a little over a year, and by the time it ended the Network Operator position had essentially been written out of existence (since all of the monitoring/manual tasks were being done by scripts). Once that happened I got the bump to Systems Engineer :). 

You should definitely still go to university if you want to get into the job. My situation is definitely becoming less and less common as more companies are automating all of their tasks. We're currently hiring 2 more people for the same position title that I have, but we are now requiring them to have degrees.

That being said, the drive to reproduce in general is an inherent drive in basically all living creatures at the species-wide level.

An RTD changes resistance at around 0.3%/deg C, so you need a precision current source to excite it, and generally a low-offset, precision amplifier to interface with the low signal."

brickfrenzy,AFOL,1391185260.0,"There are so many things available, just pick a theme and go with it.  At the start I'd stay away from Star Wars because the price/piece ratio is screwed up because of the license cost.  Kids LOVE cars, trucks and airplanes, so focusing on city sets to start with won't steer you wrong. 

I personally love the new Lego Movie sets because they're clever, varied, and well designed.  They get you a lot of different pieces in a lot of different colors easily.  

The real reason that small parts are an issue is they're a choking hazard if the kid puts them in his mouth.  As long as he's been taught not to do that, any set that you and he have the patience to build is available to you.  "

Real life matters vs Games

Personal attacks vs Games

being nice in a game is different, people play a game to have fun, to relax, to get away from whatever they have to deal with in their lives, a personal matter is different, being called a criminal and being judged by someone who has never lived in a 3rd world country, never was in a situation that something wasnt available, someone who always lived a privileged life isnt something that I'd remain ""nice"".

if you cant differentiate between those, then I'd say, me and you have totally 2 different values and mindsets in life. think about it, internet isnt that different from real life, perhaps in 10 years, people will be merged online, live their lives in a virtual world, would you still call it : ""its on the internet"" ?

redwhiskeredbubul,PurplePillDebate,1391185294.0,"Because monogamy and marriage are still the social norm. If people actually had sex simply based on inclination, in a social context where sex can be made relatively consequence-free and people run into interesting strangers all the time, it would be impossible to sustain either of those institutions and we'd probably also have to change our ideas about romantic love. The role of limiting the amount of sex people have still mostly falls on women and ideas about who wants sex are still pretty traditional under the surface. 

Here's the thing. We set up marriage to be a (actually _the_) institution of romantic love, but really marriage is an ideology. It's an instrument of economic prestige and priviledge. Like intellectual copyrights or highway tolls, it's a form of manufactured scarcity that supports capitalism. It's not coincidental that sex-positivity in the mainstream media goes hand in hand with greater superficiality and materialism, even in third-wave feminism. 

You're right to feel that the way things work is arbitrarily restrictive towards sex. But it's not so much that it's unfair to men as that women are primarily expected to internalize the role of the gatekeeper. (at the end of the day, assuming heterosexuality, men and women are having the same amount of sex, after all.) It's just that the norms aren't set up for _anyone's_ benefit, except the wealthy.  

So why is it women instead of men? Why do we drive on the right side of the highway instead of the left? It's arbitrary. What matters is that somebody prop up the inflated demand for sex. "

Mulatto_Gelato,AskReddit,1391185295.0,"I've got a friend almost exactly like this. She is super high strung, easily stressed and a control freak. We can't ever just plan things casually, it has to be EXACT times we are meeting, who's driving, what are you wearing, who's going to be there, what's going on afterwards etc.. It can be very frustrating at times when you want to just go with the flow and see where the night takes you. Not an option with her. 

The way I deal with it is by trying to be empathetic, patient and understanding. I know that she deals with a lot of anxiety and deep seated insecurity (she's told me all this). She feels like she needs to be in control of her surroundings at all times because she feels so out of control on the inside- if that makes sense? I try my best to make through and specific plans when I hang out with her, letting her know exact times, dates, places etc… This seems to help quell her anxieties most of the time. 

In that same vein, like your friend, mine also only freaks out around me but plays the “laid back chick” card around everyone else. I’m glad that she feels  she can be herself around me but I WILL NOT under any circumstances allow myself to be her emotional punching bag and neither should you with your friend. You need to establish boundaries with your friend and make sure she understands that while you are there for her, it’s NOT OK for her to take everything out on you, that’s not what friends do. I hope this was somewhat helpful for you. Good luck!

nympherret,sex,1391185296.0,"I mean, a lot of people don't have the mindfulness to stop and say, ""Okay, I can't feel this guy's dick in me, what ELSE can we do."" That's assuming she couldn't feel you inside her, but you know what I mean. She was probably at a loss, like she didn't know what to do and didn't want to embarrass herself or you. Not a good way to handle any of this!

A cock ring will make you harder, which could help! Are you good at fingering? You really should be. Though ladies love to be filled up, a good fingering orgasm can be worlds better than a PIV interaction.

THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT: Sex doesn't have to be so linear. You can have PIV and then get her off another way. PIV doesn't have to be the grand finale, it can be a *part* of your experience. This culture teaches us that you do some foreplay and then hump each other until at least one of you cums. You can rock a woman's world with foreplay, some PIV and then some vibrator play/fingering/oral/etc. The only reason you are ever made to feel badly is because of all these weird expectations everyone has!"

Are you ready to look into the dead eyes of the decapitated head and realize that that absence of life will someday be reflected in your own eyes and that the chunks of meat you are disposing of were once part of a sentient being who loved, hated, thought and dreamed just as you do now?  Does that reality of murder appeal to you? If you are a normal, moral person the idea of that should horrify you and haunt your nightmares. Only a psychopath would feel differently. 

Maybe the concept of mass extermination sounds good to you in a theoretical, distanced sense but are you actually considering what you are suggesting in the real sense?

Belgian_Rofl,WritingPrompts,1391185430.0,"I ran through the alley trying to stanch the flow of blood, petrichor laden air coming in ragged breaths. I had never thought I would be on the opposing end of a friends gun, but I suppose it was bound to happen sometime; it was legal and the money was good. 

A world that was gradually on the decline suddenly took a sharp downturn into chaos. Explosive populations, droughts and increased super storms, were to blame. The angry took to the streets, but the idealists overthrew the government. They thought they knew what was best but there was no way to quell the angry tide that they in part created. Unable to bring about a civil society, everyone was plunged head first into fray. The Collapse.

No one was safe, territorial warlords sprung up like weeds. Each starting petty squabbles with neighbors. One man emerged to bring it all into order, and his rules were simple: kill or be killed, similar to Darwin's theory. Many people were initially tentative about this idea. 

But the hungry get desperate. The desperate do things outside the realm of a sane society. For a while there was no discernible difference from this new chaos to the previous. From the chaos came order, and in this order a warrior class emerged. Paid to keep people protected by any means, schools emerged reminiscent of agoges of old.

I came from the most prestigious of the schools, but so did my colleagues pursing me. Dodging into an adjoining alley, I heard flechette rounds pepper the brick where I'd just been. Interesting. They intended to capture me. Hiding along the wall I slipped out two stilettos, my rank markings contrasting on the black steel.

Sprinting around the corner my attacker had the goodwill to look surprised before I slipped the blade through his neck and severed his brain stem on the other side. What I did not expect was his ready, more experienced partner. He fired his Xiphos at me, a stubby microwave gun tuned to my neural stims, and dropped me to my knees. So much for that black market shielding. 

The rain soaked asphalt came in and out of focus, and I was unable to lift my throbbing head. Though my ears were filled with a slight ringing I heard a familiar laugh ""John, John, John, you never did learn your place."" The laugh came again only to be drowned out as the ringing increased. I had a feeling of falling before I was pitched into complete darkness.

It's a Dakine yoga bag - my yoga mat has its own pouch that slips into a pocket on the side. OK, here we go:

* One thigh high black leg warmer (my right leg is tricky)

* One sage green leotard

* Two pairs ballet tights - one footless, one convertible

* One Gaiam yoga towel 

* Roll of athletic tape

* Small ACE bandage

* Deodorant

* Hairspray 

* Enough bobby pins to pin Rapunzel's hair to the sky

* Yoga mat

* One pair Russian Pointe Sapfirs (currently - usually a spare pair ready to go)

* One pair Bloch leather split sole ballet slippers

* One pair Capezio FootUndeez (I took a few belly dancing classes for fun and bought them, they are actually great for yoga I've found)

* One pair New Balance Vibram Minimus 10 shoes - I have **never** loved a pair of trainers this much. I hate wearing pretty much every pair of shoes ever except for these. They're ""hiking/multi sport"" according to the New Balance website, and I hike in them as well.

* One pair Gaynor Minden shorty shorts

* One pair Danskin shorts

* Black Champion sports bra

* Black Speedo lapsuit, black Speedo goggles, black Speedo swim cap

* Odds and ends I use to make my pointe shoes feel perfect. Don't really need too much in these shoes (I ♥ Russian Pointe! The fitters at the Chicago boutique are absolutely amazing) but I keep them on hand anyway.

Not currently in bag but usually brought with me to the gym/studio:

* U-Haul padlock

* 1L Camelbak bottle (that thing is my constant companion, in and out of the gym/studio)

* Earbuds - I just use my iPhone to listen to music while I work out, sold the iPod. Didn't see the point in having both.

EDIT: I usually have Therabands in there too, but I can't seem to find them currently - still sorting myself out after moving. "

AdamColligan,askscience,1391185528.0,"Ah, thanks very much for that. I guess this gets into why it seems difficult to me to visualize when I should be thinking about a velocity versus when I should be thinking about an acceleration. (Sincere apologies if this constitutes a threadjack -- I think it speaks to the original question, but I'm not entirely sure).
 
With the event horizon example, it's (ironically) a little more straightforward-sounding: the force required to keep you stationary, which is the force you would feel smushing you against the chair at the event horizon, approaches infinity, which is the amount of force that could accelerate you to the speed of light in no time at all. The force between me and the chair on the Earth's surface would be 9.8 Newtons x my mass, right? That's the force that allows me to ""float"", or with an extra nudge, float away from the big mass next to me.

Where it gets a little trickier to me to visualize is the extent to which that force is actually acting over a distance or over a change in direction: not just pushing me, as up against a wall that won't budge, but *accelerating* me along a dimension. I think the crabbing aircraft example also illustrates the ambiguity for me. 

One way to think about what the crabbing aircraft is doing is that it is applying a force to prevent acceleration: the wind is trying to blow it off its line using a lateral force, and it is applying a counterforce by pointing a component of its thrust laterally. Say the aircraft is pointed down the centerline of the runway in calm wind, and a crosswind starts picking up, and the aircraft crabs perfectly smoothly so as to remain on center. As a passenger in the middle of the cabin, you don't feel any acceleration except a slight rotation. And once in the crab, what matters to you is that you are in a consistent position relative to the ground (or at least relative to the axis of the ground that is at a right angle to the runway centerline). The lateral thrust of the engines is applying a force but doing no work relative to the Earth.

On the other hand, you can also adopt a frame of reference that focuses on the air itself as ""stationary"" rather than the ground. The aircraft is moving not only along one axis of the soup of air but along another, sideways axis. And as it enters the crab, it accelerates along the air's lateral dimension. (I know that strictly speaking, this is probably incorrect in relativity, since acceleration is absolute, and it's the wind that picked up, so it's the air that accelerated rather than the plane. Or is it wrong? Is the plane's rotation equivalent to the air's lateral acceleration?). Anyway, once in the crab, the lateral component of the engine thrust *is* doing work: it's moving the aircraft along an extra axis relative to the air. 

But here's where I get stuck: in both of those cases, once the aircraft is crabbed, there is no *sense* of acceleration. There is a smushing force between the engines/wings and the air, but this just has to do with overcoming drag, right? You don't feel anything as a passenger. And that's where my mental image of the mass-bent spacetime breaks down. I understand how introducing the presence of a large mass near me can rotate my worldline from one angle to another. And so I also understand how, as I enter a gravity well, I will need to experience acceleration (either rotation or lateral) in order to avoid impact, because I will need to add a velocity component in a certain spatial direction in order to offset the ""crosswind"" I'm now getting from the re-pointing of my time axis toward the mass. But where I'm confused is why I *keep* experiencing a force even after I'm seated in a chair on the ground. If I'm an aircraft, then once I'm crabbed, you can't resolve whether I'm going straight or going sideways, but everyone agrees I'm not accelerating, right? 

So it seems as though sitting in a chair is actually more like being pressed up against a panel on one of those carnival rides where you stand against the interior surface of a spinning cylinder. And that's what I don't get intuitively yet: when the cylinder is spinning, I feel that force because I am accelerating: my path isn't just deflected once to make a correction and then left alone. It is being *constantly* deflected in a new direction. And the result is of course that my path makes a big circle. But if I'm at a single point in a gravity well, my instinct is to envision that it should be like crabbing: my worldline has been deflected a certain amount, so I introduce a counter-component, and then that's done, so I can continue on without further acceleration. Yet somehow it seems that the truth is that in order to keep my line stable relative to the mass, I really do have to constantly re-orient this counterforce: that's why even sitting still on the ground, I feel smushed into my seat, which I don't feel in any lateral direction when my plane is in its full crab.  But I don't know of any physics reason to think that sitting in a chair causes me to trace a big circle in any dimension or combination of dimensions.  Is there something simple that I'm missing? Thank you for any time you can take to help; I know that was a lot of text."

Flightless_Kiwi,changemyview,1391185534.0,"&gt;Paraphilias all have in common distressing and repetitive sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors. 

Gay sexual urges and fantasies are not more distressing than straight ones.

&gt;These fantasies, urges, or behaviors must occur for a significant period of time and must interfere with either satisfactory sexual relations or everyday functioning if the diagnosis is to be made.

This also doesn't apply. While other people's homophobia does sometimes ""interfere with everyday functioning,"" gay sex or gay feelings themselves do not.

&gt;There is also a sense of distress within these individuals.

Gay person checking in, no distress. And what distress I have experienced in the past is, again, due to other people's homophobia not the gay feelings themselves.

&gt;In other words, they typically recognize the symptoms as negatively impacting their life but feel as if they are unable to control them.

Homophobia negatively impacts my life. Being gay does not.

So yeah, overall you've made a really good argument that homophobia is  a clinically diagnosable disorder. "

cawkstrangla,travel,1391185676.0,"Go see the Canyon for a day.  I've hiked to the bottom, and honestly, unless you are going for an experience like that, hiking along the upper rim trails is not all that exciting.  Seeing it is enough, and most of my better pictures are from the viewpoints that are peppered along the rim.

There is a little town inside the Grand Canyon National Park that has a grocery store and laundry, etc.  There are places to stay there, but I'm not sure how expensive they are.  There are also places to stay in Flagstaff, which is a bit South.

You should look at flights from LA to Flagstaff and work your way back to Las Vegas.  It might be a little more expensive to fly to Flagstaff than Las Vegas, because most major cities have cheaper flights to/from Las Vegas.  However, starting there, and working your way back will save you 4 hours of driving back to Las Vegas.

It is about 1 hr 20 min drive from Flagstaff to the Canyon.  Stay there for a day, see the sights, take you pictures.  Then it is a 3.5 hr or so drive to the Hoover Dam, which is only 40 minutes to Vegas.  If you start with this, then you avoid having to drive 4 hrs after you've drank/gambled/partied for a few days in Vegas, and also you avoid driving 4 hrs back to Vegas to catch a flight.  From Vegas you can fly to NYC, which is probably around a 4 or 5 hour flight.  You could also just look at flights from Flagstaff to NYC.

New York doesn't have to be super expensive.  You can look at hotels that are outside the city a little ways and just deal with a commute into the city.  Check out Jersey City and Hoboken.  There are above-ground trolleys that go through out the neighborhoods, then there are a few stops that are close to the PATH train system that goes into the city, stopping at the World Trade Center, and then all the way up to 33rd street, which is only an 8 block walk (I was always too cheap to pay for a cab or jump on the subway) to Times Square.

Also, if money is a bit of an issue here, then you should consider driving from LA to Vegas, then onto the Hoover Dam, then to the Grand Canyon and flying out of Flagstaff.  You'll probably lose an hour or so by driving instead of flying (maybe), unless you'd be forced to otherwise stay in LA for a day until you can fly to Vegas as per your original plans.  In that case, you'd save some time.  The drive from LA to Vegas is 4ish hours, and since you'll already have a rental car, it will be cheaper between gas and the rental than 2 plane tickets.  There are some National Parks to see on the way, or slightly out of the way, but in all honesty, for this trip I'd go straight through to Vegas.

Hopefully this helps.  There are plenty of things to do in NYC that I could mention, but this is enough to consider for now.  Unless you are both really big into gambling/partying or really into zoo's, the NYC part of your trip sounds like the most enjoyable part ( at least for me).

Intigo,Guildwars2,1391185681.0,"Shrug, not much to be said in a 9-0 victory for you guys against a somewhat unknown guild. It's easier to give some criticism if you guys were fighting a more equal opponent. 

That said, some pointers: 

* I think the Warrior in the video has far too much HP. Plays pretty well for the most part, but there's never a need for 29k HP if you are playing correctly.

* Your meleeball is a bit sloppy. It is not as compact as it could be and your leader could do a slightly better job when it comes to bombing downed players really hard. Grotesk actually does a pretty good job of peeling off and focusing on downed individually, but this is something your leader should be bringing the entire meleeball to do immediately after they go down or they are low in the first place.

* Your leader also seems to pull out for heal regroups just for the sake of doing regroups every X seconds when the meleeball has very little pressure on it. There were a few instances where there was no need to pull out and he could be piling on the pressure/doing Healing Rain regroups inside the enemy.

* I am also not sure if I saw you guys ever really pick targets off one by one. 

* To add to the sloppy meleeball, some of your guys were picked off when they shouldn't be or they were dangerously close to dying in bad positions. Movement and dodging is the single-most important part of GW 2 WvW, that needs to be extremely top notch for a melee player.

* Grotesk also has quite a few instances where (s)he's way too static when the enemy meleeball is on top of him/her. Maybe that's why (s)he's using so much Vitality because you should really be dodging out of that much earlier.

Versus a better opponent I think you would have been punished for a lot of your play. I look forward to you guys testing yourself against stronger opposition!"

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391185717.0,"I noticed something about your two analogies.

 In one case, darts, the heuristic element is minimized. It comes down specifically to knowledge and experience, and there's so little rules to know that heuristics and other forms of abstraction are barely needed.

In the other case, finding the best cake possible through a scientific method. The goal of this exercise is not to bake a cake for an upcoming party with limited time. The goal itself is discovering an ideal and the process.

You are still stuck in the scientist mindset and it does not seem like you're trying very hard to understand. 

 If I were to introduce another analogy, I would bring in what I mentioned earlier about McDojos. Different gyms, honest ones, will go through processes I discovery, but they want their members to, in the meantime learn techniques based on limited knowledge. The ultimate truth itself, whatever that is, is actually unimportant because it's still unattainable, and different gyms will have different approaches to getting there.

It often does not matter if the techniques are perfect or not. I used to ridicule elaborate stuff like sword&amp;hammer, only to later respect the fact that the average karate kid with some training and even sparring experience will still have enough to rough up the average guy with no martial arts history at all.

Most McDojos just provide the baseline through which the individual must build on through experience and other gyms. You kind of just have to trust the individual's own judgment.

Also, given a choice between two gyms , all else being equal, the attitude of the members will be a determining factor. I'd put money on the gym where the leaders can motivate its members to trust the techniques... Rather than the one where the leaders lecture them using the same boring language that the bullied members have heard their entire lives.

A lot of people just work better under high pressure being screamed at by a drill sergeant in a boot camp.

And if I'm being honest, the PC gym really is very boring. 

What your analogies did was remove the human element. Humans aren't perfectly logical, and will operate on limited knowledge based on heuristics. They trust even from limited view based on authority and emotion."

bunniesz23,dogecoin,1391185738.0,"Here's a decent solution, and one that I'm certain has already been discussed. We know that coins get lost, abandoned, etc. What would be nice is some kind of reasonable estimation for coins lost (for example lets say 2%) multiplied by the number of total coins.

For instance if there were 100 coins available, on average 2 of those coins would be lost. After we reach our 100b ceiling, the rewards could simply be an attempt to put back in whatever was lost. In addition, if it's necessary, there probably wouldn't be too much objection to a slight bump in transaction fees if that's what it takes to keep miners out of the red.

TLDR; Instead of increasing the total, just replace the coins that are inevitably lost."

RadiantSeashell,AskWomen,1391185892.0,"I'd tread lightly. When I went to high school, seniors who went for freshmen were usually targeting them because they were ""innocent"" or at least unfamiliar with high school life. They were easy pickings for sleazy guys because the girls wanted someone, *anyone*, to treat them like an adult. I'm not saying this is you.

Your emotional and mental states are completely different, so it would be a difficult relationship to manage. You're going off to college next year, which is going to be a world apart from her, who will be just finally getting settled into high school life. You'll get over the hormonal roller coaster of puberty before her, and will already be planning your life as an adult. I know a guy who is dating a girl several years younger than him, and he deals with a lot of stress from it. When he got into the relationship he believed she was ""very emotionally mature"" but he now realizes it isn't as much as he believed. He has to deal with the backlash of her emotional immaturity on a daily basis, and comments on how he puts way more effort into the relationship than she does.

I'm not telling you not to date her. That's not my business. But I am telling you that it will be a lot more difficult and stressful than dating someone your own age. And if you do get into a relationship with her, DO NOT make the first move when it comes to sex! Wait. And wait long. Initiating that can seriously damage a girl who isn't even sexually mature yet."

Yes, losing weight helps. As does with both genders. Less fat around your tummy/thighs getting in the way allows for better positioning and deeper penetration. 

Confidence is also key. Don't feel like there's something wrong with you because you don't have some monster cock.

The teacher's experience in programming was through manual punch cards, yet she was teaching beginning and advanced programming classes in high school (late 90's).  Oh, and she worked for IBM.

I had already taken the beginner's programming class, and I already knew full well that in her advanced programming class that the final project was to make a game.  I started the project early because I wanted to make a GOOD game.  The libraries we worked with weren't going to cut it.  The only way this would work was if we used the Allegro libraries in DJGPP.

None of the other kids in class had seen anything with graphics before, they were still working with text input and output and simple shapes.  They made a fuss about seeing a ninja (sprites stolen from Shinobi III) walk back and forth on my screen.  That's as far as I got before she pulled the plug on me.

Her reasoning after consulting with the other teachers was that I was stealing code.  I didn't build the Allegro libraries myself, so therefore it was cheating.  Such bullshit.

Anyway, I tossed the code and my final project ended up being a dumb image stamp ""game"" which she absolutely loved."

I don't know how much input he had into the Gleason deal, but that has also shored up the back end for the Leafs.

And lastly, Reimer's confidence has been completely destroyed and he's lost the #1 job totally.  Lucky for us, Bernier is getting confident in the #1 spot and performing well, so we don't miss Reimer.

There is nothing more powerful in sports than winning.  It cures everything.

Sure, its wrong to define anyone by any single characteristic that is statistically anomalous, but virginity isn't nearly as big of a stigma from outsiders as you make it out to be. It is a self-imposed stigma from countless virgins. You may very well no longer care about whether or not you ever have sex, but *many* virgins do. They want it badly. That's not society's fault, that's their natural predisposition to desire sex. Sure society may play into it, but most humans are born to develop a sex drive upon reaching puberty. The nearly-suicidal virgins are like that because they actually desperately want to have sex. That is their personal issue, not society's issue. If you think you have the answer, go lobby the forever-alones about self improvement, not those of us who aren't even bringing up virginity unless a *virgin* brings it up to complain about how hard it is. We don't believe anything about anyone because they are virgins. Get over yourself. 

A good chunk of our society is focused around sex. You're not going to change that just because it makes you or ""other virgins"" feel like they are ""missing out on the party"". Guess what, you are missing out on the party. If you are okay with that, then kudos to you, but we're not the bad guys for posting awesome stories about the party and getting ready for the next one. We're not going to party in quiet because it makes you feel bad. 

Like many of the other posters here, I get the sinking feeling your obsession with this topic in general really betrays your insistence that you don't care about sex."

FailureKnight,AskMen,1391186467.0,"Let me engage you on the subject as a fellow übergeek.  

First, my credentials:  I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons since 1994, and have been a player and Dungeon Master through three different editions and the many sub-editions within them (the Player's Option series that turned 2nd edition into a different game, the conversion from 3.0 to 3.5, the introduction of Essentials into 4th, etc.)  I possess many RPG books I've never played (including a near full run of In Nomine, never having played a single game of it) because I like learning (and breaking) rules systems and creating characters.  I wrote my own game world, system and campaign based on the flavor and world of Earthbound for the SNES.  I've played roughly a dozen CCGs, and I am presently a level 2 Magic: the Gathering judge.  I have purchased and played games for every generation of video game consoles.  I have been an avid reader of comic books since the early 90s, and while I don't collect them, I do possess pretty much everything Thanos has ever been in, and own a full run of Knights of the Dinner Table to date.

I was a virgin until I was 24, though my reasons for that mostly involve a hatred of women that arose in my late juvenile years when geek interests started becoming more accepted and girls started invading what was previously a safe space for male outcasts.  To that end, let me tell you that you have a greater chance of finding a woman your age interested in your hobbies than we ever did in the 90s and before.

I too have been overweight all my life, and though I have lost quite a bit of weight at certain points in my life (in particular during a time when I was playing Dance Dance Revolution 7 days a week) it's never stuck.  I am presently 305 pounds.

In my early twenties, I struggled with the exact same thing you are right now, and only with the wisdom of age have I been able to see it for what is, having dated, lost my virginity, and maintained my geek identity for almost three decades.  I'm now happily married, and have been for a little over seven years.

I want you to think about your greatest accomplishment as a roleplaying gamer.  For me, it was in a fantasy campaign where my gnome psionicist had been afflicted by an unremovable curse and had scant time to live.  With the help of my adventuring party, I tracked down the red dragon that had terrorized my burrow and killed my family from my backstory.  Then, rather than killing him, I blinded the bastard and scattered his hoard across the entire world.

Think about your highest accomplishment as a geek.  Think about all the effort you put into that, learning the rules, trying things out, losing characters to failure, fighting within your gaming group, poring over gaming books, everything that led up to that moment.  Now think about how sweet that payoff was.

You want to talk about your greatest gaming moments with fellow gaming geeks, to relive and share the euphoria of that particular moment.           

That, in a nutshell, is sex.  All the emotion, effort, time, and energy you put into advancing your geek interests?  Well, that's what non-geek men do for sex.  

The worlds are not mutually exclusive.  Geeks totally have sex (I can't tell you the number of people I've caught in the act in public working security at anime conventions), and non-geeks play games and watch superhero movies and whatnot.  However, the majority of men who have not devoted the vast majority of their time and energy to a singular pursuit (in our case, that which defines our geek identity) will never understand just how sweet that payoff is once these pinnacle moments are reached.  And we will never understand why sex is so important to those who make it the most important thing in their lives.

I know I certainly won't.  I've had great sex, horrible sex, and everything in between.  But if the urban legend were true? If I could become a wizard by remaining a virgin until age 30?  I'd have done that in a heartbeat.  If God descended from the heavens and offered me a choice: a full night of carnal passion with Adriana Lima (or whoever you consider the sexiest woman alive), or a night of D&amp;D with Stephen Colbert, Vin Diesel, Wil Wheaton, and the ghosts of Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson?  I'm rolling up a character. 

Because that's the life I've chosen, and most guys will simply never understand that.  Not being understood by ""the norms"" comes with the territory of being a geek, particularly for someone who wants to identify as the übermensch of geeks.

So, onto the wisdom I promised on the subject of virgin-shaming.  First and foremost, if you think that men are the only ones that virgin-shame, you're dead wrong.  Virgin-shaming by women is one of the biggest reasons for my outright misogyny in my teens and early twenties.  The big difference between them is, when women virgin-shame they generally want to hurt you.  But when men do it, it's for one of two reasons:

One reason is, as others have mentioned, they're just a nonredeemable bag of dicks.  Something's missing in their lives, and they're just doing what all unhappy people seem hellbent on doing - inflicting their unhappiness upon others.

The other reason is more benevolent.  Remember how non-geek men talk about sex for the same reason that we geeks talk about our passions (like how we'll tell other geeks, ""Man you just have to see this show - BEST SHOW OF ALL TIME!"") and they can't understand why you don't share that passion?

Because they want you to experience it, and that's just how guys motivate each other to do stuff.  Male friends call each other some of the most horrible stuff out loud in jest; the kinds of stuff women save for muttering under their breath in contempt.  They don't mean to hurt other men by shaming virginity - they want virgins to have that same awesome feeling they do.  What they don't understand is you already know that feeling, but can never communicate that to them (because they'll never understand).   

**tl;dr:**  Assuming non-malevolent intentions, men who virgin shame geeks don't do so out of hatred, they do so because they don't understand us.    "

It's what they're banking on.  And its why I hate their strategy so much.  Just like how they're freeing up their IP's (selectively) to other 3rd parties.  They just want to put *their own* characters into other games to try and get people to buy their console.  It just comes off as arrogant to me.  

Of course, Playstation and Microsoft aren't much better, but they're not so blatant about it.  I mean, Nintendo actually thinks that instead of developing hardware that's 3rd party friendly, they'll just coax them into making games for *their* hardware, by giving them access to *their* IP's.

Food: you should really thaw it and then rinse it as to not put any of that nasty water in your tank. This can cause algae issues. Also how many fish do you have? Are they eating all the food in a short amount of time? If you have any floating around after say 3-4 minutes I would cut it in half and add more as they eat it quickly. 

Are your lights dimmable? If so what power setting do you have them on? Did you acclimate the tank to them when you made the switch? You may need to cut out the lights for a few days and wrap the tank to keep all the lights out of it to start killing off the algae. 

Are you using ro water or rodi? Where is it coming from? 

Do you have a sump? Are you running any kind of gfo? This is debatable but I have used algae fix with great success. Some people think it is a cover up of the real problem and it could be, but it might be something for you to look into.

sunofabeeeyetch,AskReddit,1391186919.0,"Why should enjoyment at a terrible person's suffering be empathetic in any way at all? Empathy is only reserved for those who deserve it, like much of the poor or large numbers of people afflicted by natural disasters; it is not for people who go out of their way to cause suffering for the innocent. And let me tell you, most bullies are not born into unhappy situations at all--quite the opposite, actually. Most bullies are born into rather happy family situations and bully other people for the sheer enjoyment of it. There's no justice, no reasonable justification in what they're doing, as opposed to, say, taking satisfaction out of a bully undergoing immense pain and suffering.

I think this is our main point of contention here. You seem stuck in an outdated and ultimately false idea of bullies being born into terrible family situations that accumulate frustration and anger towards the world, while I present to you the more realistic scenario of bullies just being terrible people regardless of their background. I'm not ""mentally distancing"" myself here, I'm just presenting the facts. Sure, bullies are people, but that doesn't excuse them for their actions, let alone from consequences.

And enough with the nihilistic talk. It doesn't contribute to the conversation at all, not only because it's so low-impact but because it's pretty damn irrelevant. People have more than 7 seconds to commit to an action or not, and that includes bullying. 

Also, hubris? Really? It's not just genes or environment that made me the way I am today, and even so there's a good deal of agency involved in the evolution of my philosophies. Don't excuse bullies' actions by chanting ""but it's not their fault, it's the fault of their geeeeeenes!"""

jhalton3,ModernMagic,1391186930.0,"Hi there.  Good question.

A week ago I was playing RUG Twin.  I went to a GPT and I got stomped.  The deck was bad in the meta and I needed something new.  I started brewing something up.  Something to make the red mage in me happy.

What I brewed up was Burn, but not that 4 color burn deck that people seem to love so much.  I couldn't let go of the blue.  I figured that if I took my old mono red burn deck and modified it with my fetches and Snapcaster Mages, it would be SWEET.  You know what?  It is, and Delver is a big reason for it.

I don't run Serum Visions (mana for anything but damage isn't really burns thing) but having a 3/2 body with evasion that I can invest 1 mana into and not have to worry about again is great.  If it eats removal, it buys me time (uses the opponent's mana) and if it doesn't then it will soon kill them.

As for the general rise of the Delver decks, I would say that tempo is becoming a bigger and bigger trend in modern right now.  As I said, investing 1 mana in the early game for a threat that beats for a lot of damage is amazing.  In the tempo lists, it allows them to hold up counterspells, removal, etc.

**TLDR;** Tempo is rising, Delver is a great tempo card."

If you want to focus more on your looks try to do it in a healthy way. Don't get breast augmentations because of your boyfriend. If you want to do it for yourself then go for it! Honestly just take care of yourself though. Put thought and effort into your morning routine. You don't have to be the standard definition of ""pretty."" If you put effort into yourself though it shows. Dressing nicely (even if it's your style), taking care of your skin, taking of your body, ect makes a huge difference. Don't approach this in a, ""I want to be beautiful for him,"" type way. Try to approach this with the idea that you want to take care of yourself and look the best you can *in your own way.* 

Not every guy wants big breasts, some guys like smaller chested women. Not every guy is going to like tattoos. Some guys like women who are petite, and other guys like women who are athletic and muscular. Think about it, you probably recognize that they are a lot of attractive guys on TV, but does that mean every single one of those conventionally attractive guys are your type? I'm sure celebrates you find attractive I would be meh about, and vice versa. Like I said, looks are truly subjective. You're never going to make everyone think you're the best damn thing ever. 

Also, you don't have to care about your looks. Looks are important in that they help you form a first impression of someone, but that's not the only thing you have going for you. Some people don't care about their appearance at all and that's really fine. You do though, so you either can accept the way you are or work on yourself in a positive way. Either options are fine. Caring about how you look doesn't make you shallow.


Focus on what *you* like. If you like the way you look that's all that matters. If things don't work out with your fiance then you'll eventually find a guy who loves the way you look as well. You shouldn't feel like the only way you could keep your fiance's attention is by changing your physical appearance to suit his needs. I really don't like the way he's handled the situation though. If physical appearance is *that* important to him that it can distract him from the relationship then he shouldn't have started dating you if you ""weren't his type.""

He did start dating you though so I do think he probably finds you attractive. I think you being scared about your looks ""distancing"" him might be just some of your own anxiety and insecurities. That doesn't though that he lied to you about his ex and hasn't been overall ""the best"" at handling this situation. "

genmai_cha,AskReddit,1391187135.0,"Ahh, student life essays.  The good thing about these is that you can do a bit of homework about the school as you're writing the essays.  

**Write with your future in mind.**  Research potential clubs the school hosts, particularly for subjects in which you'll major and/or minor.  Try to match those opportunities with community-oriented activities in which you've participated.  You're basically saying, ""I've done ____, and I see that the school offers a similar opportunity that I'm interested in getting involved with.""

**Write with honesty.**  Mark Twain said, ""If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember what you said.""  Honesty is the best policy with these essays.  Don't talk up something you've done in the community as being a greater feat than it was, especially if you're applying to colleges where there's a chance you might be personally interviewed as part of the acceptance process.  I'm sure the college just wants to see that you care about your community, not to see you prove that you're Community Activist Extraordinaire.

I've helped here and there with Habitat for Humanity projects, but I'd never state to someone that I was a project coordinator or construction foreman or something.  It's disingenuous at best, and at worst, if that person says, ""Oh, really?  Tell me more"" you've just trapped yourself.

**Write with passion.**  Choose things you have done with passion, regardless of how great their impact may have been on the community.  At a previous employer, I helped sell T-shirts and fundraise for a cystic fibrosis walk that my company sponsored.  One of the VP's daughters was affected by and died of CF, and I have small children of my own.  So it hit close to home.  I didn't play a large role, but I got myself out there, contributed toward a good cause, and had some fun working alongside colleagues with whom I wouldn't normally interact.  It's an event I include on my resumé and openly talk about, because I was passionate about what I was doing.

Good luck!"

ladieaupair,PoliticalDiscussion,1391187141.0,"I'm of the opinion that the punishment should fit the crime. You intentionally kill someone, you should die for that. 

Vehicular homicide is a tricky one - it's (generally) not intentional, and not always as a result of intoxication. Unless the person driving has no conscience, they're going to have to live with that for the rest of their life. As you've gathered, I support capital punishment. However, if I drunkenly got behind the wheel of a car and severely injured or killed someone, I would never forgive myself. 

Which brings me back to the punishment suiting the crime: I still don't feel that vehicular or negligent homicide would be worthy of the death penalty. I don't actually believe in ""an eye for an eye"" as most supporters of capital punishment are fond of saying. 

I'm not saying I know the best way to do this; and I'm not the one writing the laws either. I am just a person who feels ways about things because of things that made me feel ways in my life. However; I firmly believe that if you intentionally kill another person, either by your own hand, arranging for someone else to do it, or through some other extraordinary means which you initiate or control, you deserve to die."

Lay on top of him, sit straight up, bounce, grind, kneel with your feet behind you, sit with your legs in front of you by his head, let him do some work, touch yourself, make him touch you, etc etc etc. It's my favorite position and there are so many ways to change it up so that it doesn't get redundant and always feels amazing.

Based on a personal anecdote, I wouldn't agree with your basic premise.

I'm Brazilian, and I really don't think we, as a people, live up to the stereotype of ""smiling a lot"". Sure, people on the movies, TV and tourists appear to smile a lot, but why wouldn't they?

Normal people, on their everyday lives, are as grumpy as most people I met when I went to Europe. In fact, I think it would be fair to say that some Europeans are nicer than Brazilians (like the Spanish or even the Germans!). But, after all, even those stereotypes, I think, don't hold much water: such personality peculiarities are too much personal to be widespread through a country."

Is female genital mutilation a violation of human rights?  It depends on who you ask.  To imagine that tribal elders would have formulated the same opinion on the matter as you have, is unrealistic.  However, where as a Westerner might have no conceivable reason to perform such a procedure, the same can not be said for certain tribes who live in very chaotic environments.  So, if we can establish that reality, then imagine how these tribal elders must resent the notion that by performing traditional rituals, they are, ""violating,"" some moral law.

Malgayne,Christianity,1391187455.0,"""The Great Divorce"" by CS Lewis answered this question for me. Here's a (slightly edited) version of what he wrote on the topic.

""Did you think joy was created to live always under that threat? Always defenceless against those who would rather be miserable than have their self-will crossed?...Here is joy that cannot be shaken. Our light can swallow up your darkness: but your darkness cannot now infect our light. No, no, no. Come to us. We will not go to you. Can you really have thought that love and joy would always be at the mercy of frowns and sighs? Did you not know they were stronger than their opposites?""

(Then, later:)

""And yet . . . and yet ... ,"" said I to my Teacher, when all the shapes and the singing had passed some distance away into the forest, ""even now I am not quite sure. Is it really tolerable that she should be untouched by his misery, even his self-made misery?""

""Would ye rather he still had the power of tormenting her? He did it many a day and many a year in their earthly life.""

""Well, no. I suppose I don't want that.""

""What then?""

""I hardly know, Sir. What some people say on earth is that the final loss of one soul gives the lie to all the joy of those who are saved.""

""Ye see it does not.""

""I feel in a way that it ought to.""

""That sounds very merciful: but see what lurks behind it.""

""What?""

""The demand of the loveless and the self-imprisoned that they should be allowed to blackmail the universe: that till they consent to be happy (on their own terms) no one else shall taste joy: that theirs should be the final power; that Hell should be able to *veto* Heaven.""

""I don't know what I want, Sir.""

""Son, son, it must be one way or the other. Either the day must come when joy prevails and all the makers of misery are no longer able to infect it: or else for ever and ever the makers of misery can destroy in others the happiness they reject for themselves. I know it has a grand sound to say ye'll accept no salvation which leaves even one creature in the dark outside. But watch that sophistry or ye'll make a Dog in a Manger the tyrant of the universe.""

""But dare one say-it is horrible to say-that Pity must ever die?""

""Ye must distinguish. The action of Pity will live for ever: but the passion of Pity will not. The passion of pity, the pity we merely suffer, the ache that draws men to concede what should not be conceded and to flatter when they should speak truth, the pity that has cheated many a woman out of her virginity and many a statesman out of his honesty-that will die. It was used as a weapon by bad men against good ones: their weapon will be broken.""

Unrepentant_Priapist,Guitar,1391187686.0,"&gt; So jazz and metal are doing three things that are very different. First, they explore many 'in between' sounds that are neither feel major nor minor.

Different can be good.  Playing with tonality and exploring alternate scales are ways to accomplish that.

&gt; They also focus on incorporating many techniques like slapping, sweeping, tapping.

This does happen a lot, and it's a very backward approach to making music.  A good composer first determines the emotional impact they want their piece to evoke in the listener.  From here, the composer, because they understand music, knows the groove, maybe the time signature, and melodic elements they want to use.  They compose the piece based on these elements.  A composer mostly won't consider technique at all, except as a tool to properly convey the music to the listener.

Metal, in particular, suffers due to the focus on composing songs around technique rather than emotional impact.  It's a mark of beginner-level guitarists who feel insecure in their abilities, so they are driven to demonstrate how fast they can play as frequently as possible.  It's nothing new, either; all of those awful 'hair metal' bands were doing it thirty years ago.  But, 20-year-old guys are the ones who like to start bands, so it's going to happen.

&gt; Last, they experiment with odd time sigs which can give the music a nice entrancing groove when done right.

Using an unconventional time signature for the sake of being unconventional is just going to make your music sound odd.  If that's what you're going for, that's perfectly valid, don't get me wrong.  I've done it myself; I've done a couple of compositions with the explicit purpose of making the listener feel a little uncomfortable.  However, if you're listening to a piece with a nice groove, bear in mind that the composer wanted you to feel that groove, and whatever time signature he/she chose was chosen as a vehicle for that groove, not the other way around."

I challenge anyone to go to 22nd and International, eat your favorite meat taco at Sinaloa, then drive down International to the lake, stop at Tacos Mi Rancho and order the exact same meat taco and compare. How each handles their tortilla is the biggest difference.

**Bonus for Sinaloa**: FISH TACOS! Even if you don't mind TMR's bland tortillas and consider both a tie, access to the wonderful fish tacos makes Sinaloa worth the trip even if you live by the lake.

**Bonus for TMR**: Do what the menu says over and over again and ""ASK FOR CHIPS"". Their ""bootleg"" Doritos are better than actual Doritos! I usually ask for chips when receiving my food instead of when I'm ordering... that way they're always free instead of the few random times that I was charged 50 cents for chips.

boredwaitingforlife,AskReddit,1391187960.0,"I have two best friends whom both have boyfriends they've met online and haven't met in real life. Every single time I hang out with them, it us always at their place so we can Skype with their boyfriends. And on some miracle I get them out of the house and way from the computer, we always end up talking about their boyfriends and their Internet friends. 

Now don't get me wrong, these guys are hilarious and smart and genially like talking with them. But if that's all we are going to talk about, I'm not going to hang out with you that much anymore. 

And one of them is probably a catfish. My friend and the guy both know I feel that way, and weirdly, it's my nickname for him. But he still hasn't proved he is who he says he is. 

But I love my friends so I put up with it. I do tell them ever once in a while that I want to hang out without talking about their boyfriends, but that usually is forgotten a couple hours later. And I do understand I'm probably one of the only people you can talk about him, freely, with. But please not all the time. "
