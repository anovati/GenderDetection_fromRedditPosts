You might like this bit from *The Book of Tea*:

&gt; It is much to be regretted that so much of the apparent enthusiasm for art at the present day has no foundation in real feeling. In this democratic age of ours men clamour for what is popularly considered the best, regardless of their feelings. They want the costly, not the refined; the fashionable, not the beautiful. To the masses, contemplation of illustrated periodicals, the worthy product of their own industrialism, would give more digestible food for artistic enjoyment than the early Italians or the Ashikaga masters, whom they pretend to admire. The name of the artist is more important to them than the quality of the work. As a Chinese critic complained many centuries ago, ""People criticise a picture by their ear."" It is this lack of genuine appreciation that is responsible for the pseudo-classic horrors that to-day greet us wherever we turn."

Can just straight out ask her. You'll know when she sees you again. Perhaps take note how she interacts with others before and after you. Tell her you're unsure and you want to know if she's just being friendly or she wants to actually see you again.  

Or just ask, 'Is there any good places around here for a first date?' and just smile and have a twinkle in your eye as you look directly at her and listen for her answer. If she's all helpful and casual she might not get the hint, but if she laughs and wants to know why, you can tell her you want to get to know her, take her out for a hot drink and stimulating conversation.

I had too much jealousy to maintain that relationship for very long, though I did give it a shot. I just felt too much like I was simply a place holder for his long distance gf. He was still with the other woman years later, last I heard, and he was good friends with her husband as well and I still see her posting on his Facebook page so I think their core is still together.

The second one I know of ended when the wife left her husband for a boyfriend. I met them when they invited me for a threesome a few years ago on adult friend finder so they seemed to have a mix of swinging and poly in their relationship. That divorce is still ongoing and I only have the husband's side of the story so I don't know the situation in greater depth."

Areat,Politique,1390314684.0,"J'insiste sur le sujet des salaires parce que ce n'est pas la première fois que je vois ton message sur différents fils sur le féminisme, et que de mémoire celui çi se focalise en partie sur cette question, alors que les théories du genre ne s'y focalise clairement pas.                       
 
Cela revient souvent sous la forme d'annonce médiatique sur des écarts énormes entre les deux sexes, ce à quoi est à bon droit rétorqué que les différences de salaires à emploi et poste équivalent sont bien moins importants. Le problème est que ce contre argument certes véridique est souvent présenté comme mettant fin au débat. Or, même s'ils existent et se doivent d'être réduits, ces relativement léger écarts ne sont pas du tout le point sur lequel se focalisent les théories du genre.                          

Ce qui fait l'objet de l'attention des féministes à l'heure actuelle, ce sont les raisons qui amènent à cette situation où un individu ne se dirige pas de la même manière vers un emploi donné selon qu'il s'agit d'un homme ou d'une femme. Nous élevons très différemment nos garçons et nos filles - notre société toute entière traite radicalement différemment un petit garçon et une petite fille- ce qui les mènent en moyenne vers des carrières différentes, et celles choisies par les filles payent en moyenne moins que celles choisies par les garçons, et c'est là l'origine de ces grandes disparités de salaires.                       

Oui, à emploi égal, les hommes ne gagnent pas tellement plus que les femmes, mais *justement*, pourquoi est ce que les hommes et les femmes n'ont pas les mêmes pourcentages d'occupation d'un emploi donné? Hors emploi réellement physique, pourquoi il y a t-il beaucoup plus d'hommes ingénieur et de femmes assistante sociale ? Les théories du genre tentent d'analyser ces faits et concluent à l'importance déterminante de l'éducation de l'enfant,  même lorsqu'il est en bas age.                              

Tu me dit que les ""garçons ont besoin de plus d'attention que les filles parce qu'ils meurent plus"", mais quel rapport avec l'éducation? Parlons par exemple des faits analysés dans le lien que je t'ai fournis.   
Dans une école maternelle, les garçons sont-ils bien plus sollicités et encouragés parce que les professeurs se disent que les garçons ont plus de chance de mourir?  
Favorise t-on davantage certains traits de caractères justement énergiques chez les garçons parce qu'ils ont plus de chance de mourir ? N'est ce pas un peu contradictoire?                           

Les jouets des garçons et des filles sont ils à ce point sexués parce que les garçons ont plus de chance de mourir?                    

Non, cet argument n'a rien à voir avec les théories du genre. D'ailleurs, pour le reste de ton message, je ne vois vraiment pas le rapport entre pyramide des ages, fertilité à l'age adulte, compétition sexuelle et ce sur quoi se concentre les théories du genre : **Pourquoi éduquons nous radicalement différemment les enfants selon leurs sexes?**

ivegotgaas,confession,1390314721.0,"My husband is like this. He's probably the worst gift giver in the history of the world. A couple Christmases ago, he got me a snuggie and a couple of vampire-romance-fiction books. I think he picked them up at the 24 hour pharmacy on Christmas eve. 

I used to let it bother me but then I reminded myself that he makes my lunch every day. He's the first one to jump out of bed if the baby wakes up in the middle of the night. He reminds me to schedule trips to go out drinking with my friends. When he starts my car in the morning, he pushes the button to turn on the heated seats (it's around 15 degrees here). When my mother calls him at work to help her troubleshoot some poorly articulated IT problem, he takes the time to listen to her and help her out. If we're going out to eat or ordering take-out, he always lets me pick the place.

I've had relationships with guys who have put a lot of effort into Christmas and birthday presents. However, they did not put a lot of effort into not being assholes. I've learned to expect less (or nothing) around the holidays because I get so much more out of him the rest of the year. "

This was a careful test by the TuV (German state-sponsored standards institute). They dressed up dead pigs in kevlar and leather, then dragged them behind a lorry on a standard road surface. Apparently the kevlar fibres suffered by being too strong (in the technical sense of stretch per unit force). They caught on road protrusions and failed individually, ripping the fabric. Leather is less strong, so the individual fibres distorted, distributing the load to other fibres. The leather abraded, but did not rip.

It would need to be narrowly tailored to address a specific government interest.  It could not be overly broad or unduly vague.

Ultimately, most regulations on speech are ""unknown"" as to whether they pass Constitutional muster, until someone is arrested/sued based upon them, and a court rules.

To address the case here: I think most, if not all, of the Frisco, TX, sign code is ""Constitutional"" as written.  However, it is still possible to apply a Constitutional regulation/law in an unconstitutional manner, which is what happened here."

Obviously this is using some of the compression that's there for emergencies, so only use it for minor adjustments at specific pressure points (your forehead in this case), not to upsize the whole helmet. As ever, it's at your own risk.

To do it, strip or fold back the lining if possible to get to the white  foam compression lining. Take something like the handle of a wooden spoon and run it in lines, compressing by a couple of millimeters.

crankypants15,FeMRADebates,1390315278.0,"Interpretation of divorce laws is a big issue for me. I just talked to a lawyer last week and found this interesting info: 

1. Alimony is rarely given in Michigan anymore except if the woman is disabled. (It's about time Michigan came out of the 1950s!)
2. Prenups used to be totally ignored in Michigan, but they are now starting to be taken seriously, as long as they are fair. However, one cannot negate alimony or child support with a prenup. State law takes precedence for those.

It absolutely would be sharing a sex partner, while his friend isn't actively having sex with her they have in the past, so they would be sharing a sex partner if OP continues to see her.  I'm really amazed at how many people don't understand that boundaries are different for everyone.  Just because it wouldn't bother you doesn't mean it wouldn't bother anyone.  Everyone has a past, yes, but it's ok for there to be circumstances from their past that make you uncomfortable.

Though the difference between Vario and Preciso isn't that huge, the latter still has hundreds of settings and is quite consistent.

FWIW, I use the Hario Slim for Aeropress and have it at about 7 clicks back.  It's pretty fine, but I wouldn't consider it fine enough for espresso nor consistent enough.  My guess is you're adjusting for this with your tamp, whether you realize it or not.

wwwwolf,halo,1390315387.0,"I think the only thing that sucks about Halo 4's Action Sack is that people play it too damn seriously and competitively. Nobody seems to remember that that wasn't the point - the gametypes were supposed to be crazy and unusual and relaxed and *fun*. In Reach, nobody gave shit about who would win, as long as proper craziness ensued in maximal amounts and everyone was having fun.

I got a great example a few days ago ([game details](https://app.halowaypoint.com/en-US/Halo4/WWWWolf/home/match-07104b43d509b274), [film](https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/games/halo4/fileshare/details/2ad5c9d2-5034-454b-b686-a1e7768a216c)). Yes, it lists 2 people who finished the game on my team (the other being a JIPer - yes, at a few points, I was the only one playing on my team) and fucking *5* who quit, because the opposing team had fucking ridiculous campers - I didn't quit because I had to witness 16 minutes 13 seconds of this absolute unfettered bullshit first-hand. Let me state that again: 16 minutes, 13 seconds, for a lightning flag game that ended 2-0. How the fuck did they get outside of the Simplex's safe volume to snipe everyone from the roof is anyone's guess, I always get killed if I as much as *breathe* that way. All in all, *not exactly the sort of fun people are looking for* and I don't blame anyone in my team for quitting. Time can be wasted on more fun endeavours."

Star Citizen looks like it's going to rock. It's got a *rabidly* dedicated fanbase, which from all outside perspectives, appears to be attempting to *drown the Dev Team in money*. The game appears to have an equally excited Dev Team, speaking of- and they've said a couple times before that all the ""million dollar milestones"" they're hitting is only ""adding content"" that was going to make the original release time anyway; getting SC up to 34,000,000 only *assures* that said content makes it. But it's not like they're securing another ten million and then, with fingers arched a la Monty Burns, scheming, ""*Eeeexcellent, now we can shoehorn the SECOND expansion in with the 1.0 release! Smithers! Bring me the Spruce Moose!*"".

That said, I do think that the Star Citizen sub tends to get... how should I put this lightly... *overpoweringly circle-jerky*, and a lot of the posters seem to view Roberts in a cult of personality light. The delivery will not *possibly* live up to the hype, because the hype is essentially that SC is going to cure taxes, stop the terrorists, whiten your teeth and win Leo an Oscar. 

In closing, Star Citizen seems like a safe bet if you want a very good EVE-like game. As long as you're not expecting the second coming, you could certainly pick a worse release as your ""last major gaming purchase""."

Of course you don't want to go around insulting people but you do it so doing things that are socially accepted. Let me present you an example.

Let us imagine that I find your last comment insulting. It is a well written, polite, insightful and repectful comment and I'm sure that 99,999999% of the human population wouldn't find it insulting BUT because you aren't agreeing with me I find it insulting.

I find ok that a woman doesn't want to get hit on by someone she finds unattractive and she should politely reject him but... find it insulting? Take a chill pill lass, don't let your pride go to your head.

Noneerror,AskMen,1390315595.0,"&gt; You'd still be bound to the lease until it ends and your share of the rent still needs to be accounted for (by you, since you're on the lease).

Almost correct. The rent needs to be accounted for and ultimately she is on the hook for it. However she can talk to her landlord and possibly get removed from the lease. Also she could sublet or assign the lease to someone else.

The landlord generally can refuse all of that. But if the landlord refuses then generally that's reasonable grounds to terminate your lease even if early termination is against the terms of the lease. The landlord-tenant laws always supersede the lease. [For example.](http://www.ontariotenants.ca/law/act06.phtml)

tl-dr: You probably can move out and break your lease if you want. You just need to do the proper legal dance."

An Apache carries up to 16 ATGMs, all fire and forget.

coreythestar,relationships,1390315719.0,"Delete and block her on facebook so the temptation to snoop is not there. To be blunt, it's your husband's decision whether to be part of the child's life, and you can only stand by and support his decision. It will be hard for you to support him if you doubt that his decision was the right one. It will also be hard for you to support him to cut ties if you're trying to maintain them, albeit in a distant and observational way.

2nd piece of advice (even though you didn't ask for it) is to get something legal in place ASAP absolving your husband of financial responsibility toward the child (if it's not already in place). I'm not sure where you live but in Canada a woman can file for child support at any time until the child is at least 18, and she can also apply for retroactive child support. It's a bit dangerous to have an informal agreement that your husband is not part of the child's life without having something legal to support it.

Cheating has many reasons to it, that was just one possible one. Your thoughts on cheating differ from others, so you can't define what cheating means to others, only to yourself. However, I do feel that if you truly love someone. Cheating on them destroys not only them, but yourself too. You have to live with the fact that you fucked up and hurt the most important person in your world. You have to live with that in your conscious and every time you think about it, you hate yourself. 

What I just explained is an example of how I view cheating from my perspective as the cheater. Could be different from your perception, especially if your the one being cheated on. It all gets complicated but bottom line, whatever you make yourself believe about cheating, is what you'll believe about it. Whether it was because of past experiences that changed your perception or outside influences shaping your perception.  Whatever you make yourself believe about cheating, is what you'll believe about it.  "

tangerinelion,Coffee,1390315824.0,"Essentially what you're asking is how to remove the finest particles from a non-uniformly ground sample of coffee.  I don't see how water helps you in any way.

There's two ideas that come to mind.  One is you use it as-is, and after plunging allow the coffee to settle.  The fines will mostly fall on top of the plunger and if you slowly decant you can leave them behind with a bit of brewed coffee.  This is by far the easiest method.  FP is not supposed to be a clean cup, there's supposed to be some body to the coffee but I can see not wanting a centimeter of sludge in your cup.

The other idea involves metal filters/mesh strainers.  If you have one that has a gap just big enough to hold in the particles you want then you can filter/strain the (dry) grounds and remove the finer particles from it.  If you look into, say, scientific equipment you will be able to find various metal mesh with a specified grid size for your needs but this approach is somewhat comically impractical yet completely plausible."

crankypants15,FeMRADebates,1390316006.0,"&gt;  Child support to be actually spent on the child, 

I agree but the only way to do this would be to use an escrow account, where BOTH parties sign off on every expense. This would create an administration headache for the state and increase their costs. And one parent could harass the other by not signing off on things. 

Example 1: Kid keeps breaking his Ipad, and he broke his second one, so he needs  a third in 3 years. Teacher ""recommends"" Ipad but doesn't require it. Why should both parents pay for this when the kid could use the computer lab instead? 

Example 2: Kid keeps ruining shoes, he's on his third pair this year. Buying him new shoes every time does not teach him to take care of his stuff. 

Example 3: Kid wants to go to summer camp which is $5000 for 4 weeks. Father cannot afford it and won't sign off on it. Kid cries. Mother cries ""neglect!"" Is this expense really a basic necessity for a child? 

In order to resolve all these cases they'd have to be heard in court, taking up much of the court's time. If you know anything about family court, they are overflowing with petty cases, but if the case has even a small change the child is being hurt or neglected, the case gets heard.

Add milk, grab a big ol' glass of juice and settle down to see what's on the tube.

Eventually, I find my way to Nickelodeon and I grab the start of some new superhero style anime show and I stop thinking to myself, ""Wow, Nickelodeons really fallen off."" Suddenly the main character enters, he's completely different from everyone else. Thick black borders, very simple features and obviously phoning in his lines. Suddenly the scene goes wrong, stuff starts falling, characters are getting weirdly distracted. 

**CUT!**

Turns out it was a part of a TV show, Japan's hottest TV show, which in a bid to attract new viewers casted a completely unknown struggling American actor in the lead after he wins some kind of Lottery Raffle.
What the show later becomes in a completely self aware satire of the social and cultural moreas of Eastern and Western cultures as shown through the actions of a character in a typical ""fish out of water"" tale.

We got two seasons, but due to low viewership state side, no more than a few episodes made it across the water to UK and Ireland, and the ones that did were often outta sequence, but still really enjoyable.

* first person has had 2.  She hated it both times  and was the person being brought into an existing relationship.  The first time was with her brothers roommate, and she snuck in through the window so her brother wouldn't find out.  The second was with a couple with a failing marriage and she got mad that the husband kept getting ""too involved"" because she was only interested in the wife.  She had terrible experiences from what I understand, but she tends to make very poor life choices all around and never thinks anything through, especially when it comes to sex, so I'm not surprised.


* second person has had 2, the first being all women, the second being with a friend and her boyfriend.  She had a blast and said she would definitely do it again in the future, but not with anyone she was romantically involved with.  Things aren't awkward between that friend and her boyfriend, they seemed to enjoy it as well.  She typically has her head on straight and makes responsible thought out decisions with her life, including who her sexual partners are.


* The third is a couple and they've had 1 that I know about.  Again a very pleasant experience from all around.  Husband and wife are both bi, and both express interest in doing it again with a partner of either sex.  They make some questionable decisions sometimes, but overall have their heads on straight and are responsible.  They've never used condoms, with anyone, and both have a pretty decent sexual history, so it's lucky that no STD's/STI's have been an issue.  Aside from not taking preventative measures seriously I'd say they were both pretty responsible, and lucky to have partners who were honest aboutbeing clean.



While I've heard that most people regret it, I've only heard that from people who have never tried it.  Personally, it's not my thing, I don't share, neither does my husband.  If the decision is thought out and with people you trust, it seems to be a positive experience overall.  There are a lot of things to take into consideration though, especially if you're romantically involved with someone."

The same is true for many things in our world: the image of an ideal female body, what a ""good"" boyfriend should do in a relationship, what is typical behavior of a person of another race. The movie makers may not be trying to tell you that psychopaths are one way or another, but psychologically we adopt those images to be reality if we don't know otherwise.

digitalpencil,todayilearned,1390316222.0,"There are, but they're not as pronounced. Social segregation simply doesn't exist in the UK in the same way it does in the US. Segregation in the UK is more largely based on socio-economic class, to which there are parallels with race (minorities tend to be empirically poorer).

I think it's a result of several compounding factors, not the least of which is simple geography. There isn't enough space in the UK to geographically segregate communities based on arbitrary factors such as race; there isn't enough space to have separate poor white/black/asian areas only poor, middle, wealthy.

I should preface this by saying that racial division is still obviously a problem within the UK, simply that it manifests somewhat differently than it does in larger countries like the US.

edit: had to include my favourite quote on this subject

""We have no slaves at home – Then why abroad? Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs receive our air, that moment they are free. They touch our country, and their shackles fall. That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud. And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then, And let it circulate through every vein."" *- William Cowper - 1785*"

Without going into a lot of detail (though I can, if you'd like), I don't *know* there is a god, but I do *believe/want to believe* in a sort of god, and while it doesn't affect me very much, I suppose I get a certain calmness or zen from it.

maowsers93,texas,1390316275.0,"While I can totally relate to the being ""too rich"" for aid making $9/hour that has nothing to do with whether or not you should receive child support. The father of the child legally was obligated to financially support his child per the Texas legal system. I'm not sure what argument you're trying to make that negates that. 

She didn't lie about anything. Davis never hid the fact that she was married when she went through law school. In fact, the recent voter ID articles pertaining to Davis and Abbott not being able to vote brought up her marriage because her name was different on her voter ID. Her bio has always stated that she remarried when she was in school. Her daughter, Dru, who was born in that marriage has been a part of her campaign. Do tell how it is possible for a person to simultaneously lie about a marriage while acknowledging the child that came out of it? The article doesn't even say that she lied about her marriage. You're making leaps that don't even pertain to the piece. 

The fact that so many people lack the critical thinking skills needed to see that she didn't leave her husband really saddens me. The article even says that her husband was the one that filed for divorce. How in the hell can anyone say that she used him and then left when she wasn't the one that filed for divorce? Furthermore, she graduated from Harvard in the early 90's and their divorce wasn't until 2005. If she was just using him to get through school she sure as shit missed that mark by about a decade. 

You don't insult me, you insult the critical thinking skills needed for an educated populace. Davis was a single mother at 19 and living in a trailer but because the divorce wasn't finalized until she was 21 and the author of this laughable article didn't think she lived in the trailer long enough she isn't reliable? This entire situation is a joke. It doesn't matter how many good people line up for office, as long as all it takes to lead the voter base by the nose is an ambiguous title and nonsense about the discrepancy between ages during a divorce then we're never going to get anywhere. 

[Even the most hap-hazard google search regarding her bio with a setting set for prior dates will reveal that her marriage to Jeff Davis has been repeatedly reported on and talked about by Wendy](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-09-04/harvard-law-put-davis-on-path-from-teen-mom-to-texas-politician). But facts don't matter right? We can just make up shit as we go apparently. Wendy has repeatedly talked about her previous marriage and her ex, who she still has a respectful relationship with, has done at least 2 interviews regarding her. But no matter we can just run an article saying she hid her relationship because reality doesn't matter. "

lynxz,deaf,1390316282.0,"You could technically take this as a reason to learn ASL. There's honestly very, very few men that are willing to go the extra mile for deaf women. So, if you really put yourself out there and get involved - there's likely a chance. If you want to see her again, just start frequenting ASL groups. There's a high likelyhood that if she is deaf, she'll either go to them or be friends with someone that goes to them. The larger gatherings/events that occur yearly (like theme park visits or gigantic picnics) are your best bet for seeing her again. Even if she isn't deaf herself, she would likely know someone involved in them somehow. Just stick around it a bit then ask and describe her ;)

The hardest part of the whole process is putting yourself out there and trying to overcome your fear of signing badly or offending someone etc. Going to the events will teach you a lot about deaf culture and will ultimately teach you how to sign proficiently as well. Who knows what happens though? She could very well be one of the frequenters and happy that you decided to come and see her!

edit: meetup.com or go up to your local college's ASL professor and ask about the events. Maybe even facebook has info on them? You literally just have to search for 'deaf event' or ""ASL meetup""."

I got my dog from a backyard breeder, a Rotti x German Shepherd mix and she is the love of my life. I knew she came from a good family though (she's almost two, and I'm still in contact with the family, sending pictures and all that. We visit every once in a while as well). Anyway, the money I paid for her was to cover the vet fees. They gave me the paperwork of the mother having an ultrasound, the booster shots, and of course the work of caring for 13 puppies for 8 weeks.


My dog also cost less than a rescue fee, and no rescue near me had the mix I wanted. Anyway, I'm on the fence about backyard breeding. Some people are in it for money, some people want to start breeding quality animals, and some just want their fur babies to have babies, and unfortunately they don't just have one. "

With that said. I don't think the broken hand is the issue here. Everyone seems to conveniently forget the abdominal muscle tear he had that required surgery. This surgery kept him out all of not this offseason but the one prior. He was unable to work out at all. Consequently, what we saw all last year year a player who was unable to workout due to a broken hand and a torn abdominal muscle.

For those of you that do not know, the abdomen is the most essential muscle when it comes to hitting a baseball, especially for power. 

As you were trying to say: The dude has been hurt.

He's finally had an off season to rest and to more importantly, work out. Also, like you said, he is 29. We will buy him out of his option after this year regardless of how he does. i.e. he won't be paid 17 MM next year. It just wont happen. We just have to hope that he doesn't go off and someone offers him more money in free agency next off season.

He was arrested on June 30 and charged with ten counts of sedition.

&gt;His trial defense called no witnesses, asking that Debs be allowed to address the court in his defense. That unusual request was granted, and Debs spoke for two hours. He was found guilty on September 12. At his sentencing hearing on September 14, he again addressed the court, and his speech has become a classic. Heywood Broun, a liberal journalist and not a Debs partisan, said it was ""one of the most beautiful and moving passages in the English language. He was for that one afternoon touched with inspiration. If anyone told me that tongues of fire danced upon his shoulders as he spoke, I would believe it.""[37]

&gt;...

&gt;Debs ran for president in the 1920 election while in prison in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. He received 919,799,[40] write-in votes (3.4%),[41] slightly less than he had won in 1912, when he received 6%, the highest number of votes for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the U.S.[4][42]"

Kofi comes to the ring and grabs a mic ""Since last week, I've been receiving tons of emails and tweets. People asking me 'Why did you do that, Kofi?'. All I can think of is: weren't you listening? For those still wondering, here's why I did it""

*Recap of previous week, where Kofi turns on Cena and rips on the Boston crowd.*

Crowd cheering Kofi. Again, big typical Kofi smile. He leans on the rope. 

""After having to be in that Hell hole that is Boston last week, it's really nice to be in New York City!"" 

*Big pop.*


""It's really nice to be out here... so I can tell to your stupid hypocritical New Yorkers' faces that if there's worst places than Boston, it's New York City!"" He smiles again.

*Huge boos..*

Still smiling: ""What? You'd think any thing I said last week about Boston fans meant I somehow liked you guys? You know, that's so typical. Typical New Yorkers, thinking the whole world revolves around them. If there's anything worst than a hypocritical, stupid Bostonian, it's a pompous, arrogant, stupid New Yorker""

*Defeaning boos...*

""I might not like Boston, but I really hate New York"". Kofi laughs.

*More boos...*

""In fact, New York is like... the John Cena of American cities. Always pretending to be the nicest, the most progressive, the most resilient. But in reality, you're always hogging the spotlight, thinking yourself better than everybody else, and always ready to stomp and hold down anyone else that tries to earn a living. Like John Cena. Each and everyone of you deserves what he got last week."". His smile turns really sinister.

*Boos*

""In fact, I might just do that"". 

Kofi drops the mic, steps out of the ring, and starts jawing at first row fans. Then he grabs one (a plant) and beats on him. Throws him in the ring. The fan is begging. Kofi smiles, helps him up, says he's sorry, then gives him a Trouble in Paradise. Kofis goes out of the ring, picks up a chair, and gives the fan a SOS on the chair. Kofi stands up and smiles. Officials/security comes out and Kofi high-tails it. He stands on the top of the ramp and smiles some more.

beefcakez,bodybuilding,1390316557.0,"I can see why you would think that, however, that isn't really the case. 

The waist ideally shouldn't hypertrophy at the same size and rate that the other muscles do. If it did, then no one would have a V-taper. It would be impossible to increase the shoulder to waist ratio. In any case, I don't ever do direct oblique training, but I do strength training for them. 

Anyway, by effectively cycling my cutting and bulking around these guidelines (the 33"" is really just a number that closely corresponds to me being around 13% bf), I am able to maintain my bodyfat levels, while still increasing lean mass *over the long term*. 

[Check out this little diagram I've made](http://i.imgur.com/UxnTR1v.jpg).

This is how your progress should (*ideally*) look over the years (not exactly, of course). Bodyfat increases along with the lean mass, then as you reduce bodyfat, you should lose minimal muscle mass, then you repeat the cycle. Over a long period of time, as in this example, you've gained a substantial amount of lean mass while keeping your bodyfat in check. This is known as the 'tortoise' approach, which I believe is best, especially for natural bodybuilders. 

Keep in mind, that this is only applicable if you have well thought out contest preps/cut cycles. If you solely focus on weight as the measure, then your body composition may shift to a non-favorable ratio for bodybuilding and you'll just keep spinning your wheels for years. 

Edit: grammar

When your friends have thier faces beaten in for walking down the street, when you lose your job, when a landlord denies housing-you cannot lie down and let these things just happen. You cannot have children and divorce with no protection for one parent. You can't have life partners die alone in hospitals.  

Tom Daley is now Tom Daley the gayly exactly because of homophobia and that is exactly why a guy like him needs to come out. Gays are in professional sports and always have been. The only way to remove a stigma is to break it down. Once we have more Tom's, sexuality will cease being an issue. But as long as guys have to have fake girlfriends to play in sports, it isn't over. It may be hard to understand when you don't have to but, it is no more fair to the Tom's to have to live an unauthentic life than it is for straight folks to be a little uncomfortable.

So her brother was a member of Sigma Alpha Mu and they threw these insane parties, like Ferris wheels, carnival rides, and live bands. I'd graduated high school and worked for a living, but she was in her last year and wanted to go check out college life, particularly her brother's fraternity. I had no idea what I was getting into, so I drove us the hundred or so miles to his school.

So we get there and score some ecstasy for the party and drop at her brother's apartment. By the time we are peaking, we hit the scene and I'm grinning like the fucking Cheshire cat at everything and everyone. I've always been afraid of heights, but with the proper chemical motivation and her tugging at my hand, she get's me on the Ferris wheel.

Up and down, around and around, I still recall the fearless sense of belonging in the universe. I had a beautiful girl next to me, I had conquered my fear of heights, and the night time view of the party below us was amazing. We kissed forever and I made promises I never kept.

I should have man'd up and gone to college with her like I said I would. I should have man'd up gotten over how intimidated her high class family made me feel. I should have converted to Judaism and married her like I promised. Instead I let her get away, and even though I'm in my mid-forties now I still think about the way she looked to me that night.

I've healed tanks with much less than 40k, but the margin for error was much smaller and my healers' gear was raid level. Low tank hp means that the healer is unable to focus efforts on group members who need healing because the tank needs fairly constant heals.

I started tanking with my riftstalker with 42k hp and things went fine since I had tanked up until 60. Just do a good job of utilizing your cooldowns and interrupting.

On a side note, purifier is really good at keeping tanks with low max hp up since you're extending their max hp above normal and doing most of your healing from 90% of their max to above their max by refreshing shields and whatnot."

Cut forward several months, it is the end of the summer- we're watching some movie featuring a bunch of kids eating watermelon and happily spitting the seeds out.

Manziel has great pocket awareness (and courage), progresses through his reads, keeps his head downfield on the scramble, rises to occasion in big games and under pressure, loved by his teammates, said to be a hard worker. He reportedly also has the psycho drive to win gene. His negatives are his arm strength, size (durability) and the gun slinger mistakes that he'll have to work through. The gunslinger plays style is partly due to his team's horrible defense which led to him having to score a lot of points to stay in games. Real concerns will be durability and arm strength to hit small windows in the mid range passing game.

bored_criminologist,news,1390316911.0,"The death penalty isn't my specialty in criminology, but the general consensus amongst those criminologists both inside and outside the US seems to be no. It can't be made cheaper while preserving justice, and even with the already high expense it remains fallible. Also troubling is that its imposition seems to be skewed along racial lines (interplay between race of the victim and race of the accused being more important than either race alone) even when controlling for the details of the offense. Additionally, it does not appear to reduce crime through deterrence anywhere that it is present, which makes sense given the nature of the offenses to which it applies . Given this information most argue that the death penalty is fundamentally out of place due to its irreversible nature (reversibility being important in a fair but fallible system), high cost, and lack of crime reduction utility.

It's important to note that most criminologists put almost no value on the retributive value of any punishment because history shows a steady trend away from retribution as a legitimate justification for punishment in most westernized nations."

To start up with cloth costs somewhere between $200 and $500 and the diapers tend to be one size and fit babies up until 35 lbs! I got a great cheap starter pack on JustSimplyBaby.com of like 20 pocket diapers with 40 Microboo inserts, a laundry wet bag and a travel wet bag for like $150.

I visited a local baby shop that specializes in cloth diapers and natural baby products and ask them questions. They were so helpful and explained everything I needed to know! I was convinced after talking to them. Does your city have a cloth diaper class or store? Stop by and talk to them and let them know that you are curious. While Baby is exclusively breast-feeding the poops are supposed to not be stinky I hear and they are completely water-soluble. You can just throw it in the washer and it's really easy. When the baby starts to eat solid food it gets a little harder, but they have these liners that you can put in the diapers to catch the solids so that you could scoop the liner up and throw the solids in the toilet so it's just the water soluble left over."

sleepyj910,DebateReligion,1390317063.0,"Religion's value is mostly in it's ability to provide answers.  Science then has provided a direct challenge to religion's traditional role.  

Religions must either cede ground to science, or rework their claims as metaphors, and be content with have answers in the remaining gaps of science.  Or of course, they can attack the science.

Evolution, stem-cell research, heliocentrism, global warming.  Many examples of religious beliefs working against science, and it's perfectly rational human behavior to want to squash a teaching that goes against what you believe is 'good'.  All religions are open to fundamentalism, and all fundamentalism excludes that which does not completely agree with it.

It's true that sometimes religion's power has allowed for scientific inquiry, for example, monasteries allowed great thinkers like Mendel to work unbothered.

But Mendel's story didn't require faith in God for his experiments, so his success was in spite of religion, not because of it.

So because religion's stakes are so high, usually one's soul, there is a strong tendency to reject any new information about the world for fear of losing the path to heaven.  And when organized, this rejection turns into persecution.  So long as the core of religion is accepting claims without evidence, there will always be believers who reject evidence as a valid way of understanding the world."

&gt;And if your girlfriend/wife prefers a bigger penis than yours, then it's just a matter of time before she cheats on you with a guy who has a bigger penis.

...whaaaat? Speaking as a girl who 1. Prefers large penises and 2. Has cheated; this is not even in the top 10 reasons why women cheat.

If I was truly not happy with the size of my man's junk, I would never be in a relationship with him in the first place. If the sex is good enough for me to commit to him as a partner, then I'm not going to cheat on him because another guy is better at sex or has a bigger dick. It's not worth risking a good relationship over that.

Why did I cheat, then? Because I felt neglected and unappreciated in my relationship. And I didn't have the guts to dump him, so instead I stayed with him until I resented him so much that I didn't care if I hurt him by cheating. Essentially, I convinced myself that he didn't deserve my fidelity or honesty. Why did I stay with him instead of dumping him? Ironically, it was in large part because I didn't want to give up the easy access to sex. I think most women who cheat, cheat because of the same reasons (feeling emotionally neglected or wronged in the relationship). "

Is Nick Markakis highly overpaid: Absolutely yes. 

I was unaware that this was the discussion point. He is highly overpaid. However, he is a much better player than we have seen, and much closer to what he is being paid, when healthy.

Which, I also believe, you will see that this year. 

Also, the idea that he is a plus defender is highly overstated. -7 DRS last year, among other things. 

But yes. At the end of the day. Nick Markakis brings much more value to this team, at his pay, than that of Matt Wieters. Again, as OP put it, he gets away with it because he hit 22 home runs last year. His nearly an automatic out every other time.

Same applies to people that work in hospitality, from restaurants, to hotels and airlines. It's customer service. When I was in early 20s I used to think those sales/CSR ladies were flirting with me. Just like I used to have crushes on actresses and women on TV, they've got hair and makeup done! It's fake. I don't fall into that trap anymore.

Amonette2012,HIMYM,1390317303.0,"Lily leaving for SF was good for their relationship. If she hadn't had a chance to pursue her dreams it might well have become a huge source of resentment between them. Bear in mind that Lily grew up having her dreams crushed by her dad's obsession with board games, and that people's biggest regrets are usually the chances they didn't take. This Italy thing is pretty much the same - Lily has supported Marshall's career for years and he goes and makes this huge decision and she's the last to know. He could at least have said 'I'l going to accept this job, but for the sake of my marriage you have to let me make a phone call to my wife first, I will call you back in ten minutes' - if he'd done that she would have told him to go for it. Marshall is in the wrong over this, even if it is probably a bigger dream than going to Italy and I think most of us are behind the idea that giving up a judgeship would be career suicide, it's not in the least bit surprising that Lily is furious and feels that Marshall doesn't consult her when push comes to shove about something this huge.

zakificus,dogecoin,1390317363.0,"As a piece of advice related to this, if you really do want to gamble, come up with a hard set of rules to follow.

For example, I took the left over fractions of dogecoins from mining, or anything from faucets and put it all in a second virtual wallet. If I decide to gamble doge, it'll be that small amount that I occasionally add to, and if I lose it, I'm okay with that. I might make 145.12341235 doge after mining for however long. So I'll take 125 and keep that for later, and take the remaining 20.12341235 and put that into my ""spend it all now"" wallet.

With that said, if I lose it, I do my absolute best to make sure I at least am enjoying it and consider it an entertainment cost. So if I spend 2 hours playing doge-poker, and lost 100 doge. In my mind the excitement for that period is worth the potential cost."

Which sucks, by the way, since many first-year middle/high school teachers are very good at whatever their subject is, but will never have actually dealt with kids before their first day of class. They don't have *one* class on classroom management, legal requirements, child psychology...we've got a kind of mentoring system, but that's about it.

And of course, since they're civil servants, they don't get to choose their first-year posting, so they get put in the worst schools with the hard-to-manage kids. So these schools have a two-years average turnover rate, which means they stay shitty.

Good luck!

ANewMachine615,changemyview,1390317541.0,"&gt;I just feel like that much dedication should correlate with a substantially above average salary.

It is. [This](http://healthland.time.com/2012/04/27/doctors-salaries-who-earns-the-most-and-the-least/) states that, on average, the lowest-paid fields take home $150k or so a year. That's in the top 3% of income earners. You claim that doctors make ""barely more than a teacher per hour,"" but average teacher salary is [$44,917](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/03/average-teacher-salary-around-world_n_4037534.html), or one third of a family doctor's salary. Does a doctor really work 3x as many hours? I mean, even if the teacher does no work outside of the normal school day, that's still 6-7 hours a day. The doctor works 18-21 hours for their entire career? I doubt it.

The debt load is significant, and something should be done about that (most countries with universal health care have much lower college and grad school costs as well, thanks to more generous state support). But let's not pretend that doctors are poorly rewarded by the current system."

DERangEdKiller,Music,1390317599.0,"I've got a dozen of them, but the craziest:

It was either 01-02.  My band mates and I decided to go to Santa Cruz to catch The Dropkick Murphys' Single Loud, Sing Proud show.

We were on the balcony (2 floor venue), hanging out high as fuck when a skin head just over the stage reached over the balcony rail, and grabbed one of the speakers over the stage.  The idiot swung over the rail and hung from it, and then dropped onto the stage right next to the bass player.

The idiot skinhead grabbed the mic and started yelling ""sieg heil!"" while throwing up Nazi salutes.

As the band started stopping, realizing something wasn't right, we could hear the bass player ""Get the fuck away from my mic son!"".  Then he swung his bass on his strapdown his side and behind him, and gave the skinhead a fucking Mortal Kombat uppercut that knocked the skinhead off the stage, and into the crowd.  Then all hell broke loose.

You could see shiny heads spotted throughout the crowd, and they converged on the stage.  There must have been 20-30 of them in a venue that holds a few hundred at most, and the band beat the shit out of them.  The audience started to jump anyone with a bald head, and this went on for about 10 minutes which was when security managed to get all of the skinheads out of the club.

Once they were out, Al Barr, the lead singer shouted, and I'm paraphrasing, ""Is this what's become of the scene here in Santa Cruz?  We don't play for hatemongers.  If that's the best this town's got, then we will walk off this stage right fucking now.""

Through chants and such, the crowd got them going again, and they played well after their set finished."

There needs to be something to strive towards, and it needs to have unique content that people want to see badly enough to work towards.

No amount of sex restores it and it has to be fixed within the relationship for it to come back.

Not an interval one with ABA or other rotations, but one that hits upper, lower, push, pull, legs, shoulders, chest, back, arms, etc. all in one go.  Do it 3x per week.  You will most likely need to back off the weight you have been lifting to handle it.  Most of these programs will have Squat, Deadlift, Chest Press, Shoulder Press, Row, and a Calf Raise.  They will have a ""heavy day"" (usually the middle day) and the other two are light (80% weight on all lifts except deadlift which is 70%).  This is to build strength.

If you can, after you are done lifting, walk briskly (or jog) enough to pant slightly for 20-30 minutes straight.  Stretch everything very well afterwords.  Please try to do this, it will help to prevent injury, begins active recovery to handle 6 days of activity per week, and gives a nice workload to the cardiovascular system when performed after lifting.

Between the lifting days, 2x a week, utilize the park to jog enough that you are definitely breathing heavy but could speak a sentence to someone and ""converse"" with short sentences.  This usually indicates that you are still in the anaerobic zone.  A heart rate monitor can be used if you so wish.  Work your way up to 60 minutes.  You can use a Couch to 5K program if you want, on these days.  This is to build endurance.  An elliptical, treadmill, or cycle can be used as well and may be superior as they can offer resistance once the 60 minutes becomes ""easy"".

1x per week, do Fartleks.  Warm up with a steady jog for 10 minutes.  Then jog for 60 seconds, run hard (3/4 pace) for 90 seconds, jog for 45 seconds, sprint for 10 seconds, jog for 30 seconds, run backwards for 30 seconds, walk for 30 seconds, run hard for 60 seconds; repeat 3-4 times. Cool down at a steady pace for 10 minutes.  This is to build VO2 max.

Do NOT be surprised if your lifts suffer.  If the running does lead to failures later in the week, use the program's deload... especially for squats as your thighs will take a beating in the beginning.  Week 3 is killer.

WATCH for overtraining: complete lack of appetite ALL day for multiple days in a row, insomnia for 3+ days in a row, etc.  If this is not enough recovery for you, halve it all, but try to keep the 6 days per week of activity.  The walks and jogs will eventually be active recovery.  Once there, you will begin to build fortitude (strength at the end of endurance... this is where it matters, when you are the last speedster left in the 85th+ minute).  Be mindful of hydration."

I'm not a lawyer, though, so I'm not 100% sure. Plus laws vary by province/state/country, so it's best to speak with legal counsel to be sure.

If $$ are a problem, check to see if there are any free family law resources like [these ones offered by Legal Aid Ontario.](http://www.legalaid.on.ca/en/getting/type_family.asp) Also, some lawyers offer a free/low-cost 30-60 minute consultation to discuss issues (meant to help if you're 'shopping around').

In Ontario, you can also download all the forms you need to make public filings directly from the internet, so you could potentially fill out and file the forms on your own at minimal cost (though I would be reluctant to do this without at least some advice from legal counsel).

Or, your husband could just sign the paperwork that would allow the mother's new husband to adopt the child. Then that person becomes legally (and financially) responsible for the child and the mother would not be able to take your husband to court for support payments."

Amonette2012,HIMYM,1390317842.0,"Lily, and here's why.

Marshall is a great guy, but he's never taken Lily's dreams seriously. He's nice about them, but he's stuck in some 50s mindset about it and sees his career as more important. Now while that's understandable given that he's passionate about his career, he's fricking married. In a marriage you do things together, you consult each other about huge decisions. Lily turned Italy down initially until she had Marshall's full support, because she didn't think it would make him happy - she was prepared to never even consider this huge opportunity to do something she'd always wanted to do, and she didn't change her mind until she was positive that Marshall was 100% behind the idea.

In contrast, Marshall takes the judgeship. Now while I think that's obviously an Italy deal breaker, the way he went about it was pretty much the worst way to do it. He was so afraid of what she would say that he didn't even tell her, choosing instead to confide in his mother who has undermined Lily since day one. If he had just said 'look, I'm going to accept this job, thank you for offering it to me, but for the sake of my marriage can I please take half an hour to call my wife so that this doesn't end up being a live grenade tossed into my marriage'. I bet that if he'd called her up and said 'Baby, I've just been offered a judgeship. I have to give them an answer right now' she would have given up her dream right then and told him to take the job. 

She's justifiably pissed off, and I think she's running away because it's her way of dealing with being that angry."

TheColorOfStupid,MuayThai,1390317880.0,"&gt;Gloves in MMA have been almost unchanged since the late 80's.

Huh?  The UFC didn't have gloves for the first few events.  They added them to satisfy lawmakers. 

&gt;I don't see them being more of a help/hindrance to either strikers or grapplers to be honest.

Did you not read my explanation?  They make rear naked chokes much more difficult and make punching easier. 

&gt;The unified rules were just the adopted rules directly from the UFC. 

Which the UFC put in place to help get MMA re legalized in many states.

&gt;Banning knees &amp; soccer kicks on the ground disadvantages strikers more than grapplers  

Did you not read my comment?  Those techniques are most advantageous in side control or north south position.  Grapplers are the ones who know how to get into those positions.   

Kickboxers don't grow up practicing knees and kicks to the head of a downed opponent, so how would they be the only ones to know how to do them properly? 

&gt;Banning strikes to the back of the head/neck/spine hurts strikers on the feet just as much as grapplers on the ground

No because grapplers are the ones who are good at taking the back.  There aren't that many opportunities to hit the spine or back of the head while the fight is standing. 

&gt;Wraps and gloves certainly help protect the hands, but 4oz gloves in a fight do next to nothing, especially if your a hard striker - just ask those in MMA with a career full of endless broken hands

Could you imagine how many broken hands there would be if there were no wraps or gloves at all?

Go look at videos of mma fights from the bare knuckle days.  Most fighters back there were much more careful with their punches.  Gloves clearly help strikers.  


&gt;But again - these rules were brought in gradually and specifically in the UFC in the first place to advantage grapplers.

Nope, it was an issue of legality.  Always was, always will.

&gt;Because it will prevent wrestlers and grapplers from blanketing fights to a guaranteed decision.

You think the UFC makes money of these kinds of fights?  These kinds of fights hurt the UFC because people don't find them interesting.  You think American fans love it when Jake Shields just smothers a guy?  

If the UFC loves those kinds of fights, why was Jon Fitch cut?  Why does Dana White refuse to sign Ben Askren? 

 &gt;the WEC had a significantly smaller cage

Because they had smaller weight classes.

 &gt;It made a clear difference and stopped wet-blanket fighters from just being able to run &amp; shoot from distance all night long.

More space makes it easier for strikers.  It's easier to take a guy down if he doesn't have the option of backing into a fence when you're grabbing his leg(s).

&gt;The UFC literally has the biggest combat area of any professional MMA organisation on earth - including those with a ring instead of a cage. 

And the PRIDE ring was still dominated by grapplers like Coleman, Randleman, Barnett, Noguiera and Fedor.

Sex definitely can bond you to someone but that will not necessarily be the case every time.  Of you have multiple partners it doesn't make you damaged or trashy, it just makes you an average adult.  I spent a few years in the church so I know how you're feeling, but when you're taught these things it's out of a place of fear.  Sex is wonderful and should be enjoyed responsibly.  Own your sexuality, do research into contraceptives and keep yourself safe.  The first guy you sleep with could be the person who ends up as your life partner, but realistically they probably won't be.  Just make sure you trust them and are comfortable with them.  When you have sex you are sharing a very intimate side of yourself, but you're not giving it away.  They won't own some piece of you forever unless you let them.  This kind of thinking scares me, as many many many friends of mine from the church ended up in really shitty marriages because they got hitched after 3 months because they were ""in love"" when in reality, they just needed to explore their sexuality without feeling like the whole world was watching/judging."

bored_criminologist,news,1390318061.0,"Unfortunately, that's not how appeals work.  Appeals are issues of procedure not fact. They are indeed appealing the sentence, but they are appealing the sentence based on some flaw in procedure (jury instruction, admission of evidence, etc).  Even if the case was air tight that does not mean the procedure was. We can't simply have a separate system for those who we believe are air tight guilty because even then we sometimes get it wrong. Sometimes people are remorseless because they're not guilty. Eye witness testimony is also the least reliable evidence out there.

Next, dead people don't commit new crimes sure, but there is no evidence the dead person would've committed a new crime to begin with. Homicides are exceptionally rare events to begin with and the vast majority of those convicted are exceptionally unlikely to commit the offense again anyway so what crime are we preventing through their death?"

Amonette2012,HIMYM,1390318187.0,"However...

Point three - given that this whole show is about Ted meeting one particular woman, and given that Ted has made some truly horrible dating decisions, I think that's understandable. If your best friend constantly made decisions that were utterly horrible you'd eventually get sick of standing by. It's still over the top, but hey, it's part of the storyline. 

Point 4 - People seem to be so up in arms about this San Francisco thing. I think it was a really good idea, because otherwise Lily would always have regretted not going, and it would have caused resentment later.

Lily also puts up with, lets face it, a lot of crap. She's been stabbed with a sword for one thing. She's married to a large, adorable manchild who hides crazy things from her, does mental things like shaving his head right before his wedding ceremony and makes life changing decisions behind her back, and lets not forget that he was lying about the nature of his job in the first place. I mean clearly that job was going to end soon, and if he hadn't been offered the judgeship he would have been relying on Lily's income while he found a new job, something he hadn't prepared her for. If you think your job is going down the shitter you tell your partner, you don't just pretend you're super busy. I don't think Lily gets enough credit - if you take out Marshall's personality he's actually quite a trying person."

Areat,france,1390318229.0,"Je dirais que c'est un peu la langue française qui t'a jouée un tour, en donnant une définition aussi large au mot ""fille"". Si tu lis cette phrase en pensant à des adolescentes, forcément que ça t'interpellera, mais il s'agit ici de la description de nourrissons. Les écarts fille/garçon pour un bébé en très bas âge sont assez peu perceptibles si ce n'est pour un professionnel, d'autant plus que le temps de grossesse est au final très aléatoire, sans parler des prématurés.                 
       
Sur ce sujet, les médecins te diront généralement qu'en moyenne les filles sont à partir de quatre ans et jusqu'à la puberté un chouïa plus grande et plus fortes que les garçons.                     

Pour revenir au paragraphe, ce qui est étudiée, ce ne sont pas ces légères différences physiques, mais la vision très différente que l'on a de l'enfant -et même, donc, du nourrisson - selon que l'on pense que c'est un garçon ou une fille. Les descriptions, les jugements, les mots utilisés ne sont pas les mêmes, et ça montre bien l'existence de ces préjugés totalement inconscient que l'on a tendance à avoir.

Sunfried,AdviceAnimals,1390318320.0,"&gt; all men are potential rapists.

Just now I think I got what this is actually supposed to mean.

Now I think I see it as ""Women shouldn't discount the potential that any given man could be a rapist just because they think they know him.""  Maybe they should say ""Any man is a potential rapist.""

It's less problematic in my head now, but still problematic. Either way, I'm in favor of people not being easy targets. What you say about the perception of faceless predators is a perception shared by men as well, which is why we are incredulous and horrified at a movement that basically accuses us all of being those predators.

I'm not sure how to make it much clearer.  I just got done explaining how these rules hurt some of the poorest and weakest in society, and don't even efficiently achieve their intended purpose.  If you don't find that immoral, then I fear we may differ on some very important axioms!

&gt; As I see it the whole reason we have it is because business, like McDonalds, would pay you far less than that if they could.

The same is true of Goldman Sachs, yet we don't set the pay of investment bankers at a minimum of $2m/year to make sure MBAs aren't victimized by the Vampire Squid.   :)

In a market, everyone will try and obtain the goods and services they want and need at the lowest possible cost, while selling their products and labour for the highest possible amount.  Prices are set by the intersection of demand and supply.  Trying to fudge the price (via minimum prices or price caps) has significant negative effects.

(Also:  Look up what percentage of people actually make minimum wage.  In 2012, there were 128m workers, of which 1.6m made the federal minimum wage or about 1.25%.  In fact, most McDonalds employees already make more than the federal minimum wage.  If it's not the federal minimum wage stopping McDonalds from offering lower wages, what do you think it is?)

-Get a nice stainless steel brew pot.  You'll need at least 10 gallons, but honestly, I recommend going for 15 gallons, even if puts you a little over budget.  Think of it as a longer term money saver, since you'll be able to do 10 gallon batches in a 15 gallon pot, but still be limited to 5 gallon batches in a 10 gallon pot.  I recommend the kettles from Spikebrewing.com because my experience with them has been very good.  They also have horizontal coupler arrangements so you can have your thermometer low enough for 5 gallon batches.  Granted, the thermometer was usually a couple of deg-F different from my electric thermometer, it was pretty good at giving me a general idea of what my temperature was at.

ANewMachine615,changemyview,1390318740.0,"&gt;Teachers spend about 6,400 hours training after high school, the amount of time it takes to get a bachelor’s degree

There's one problem with his estimate. [More than half of teachers have a master's degree or higher.](http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=28).

&gt;Most teachers also receive a pension. We will assume their gross annual pension including the value of benefits is $40,000 which is a net pension of $35,507.

But a doctor, who likely invests some not insignificant amount of their income, is not credited with the interest and capital gains on their retirement savings? He's adding another 15 years to that accounting with this, but doesn't apply anything similar to doctors (who will likely earn better returns on their money than teachers will with their pension contributions).

He booked an appointment right away, and asked me to come with him to the doctor, since he was anxious about talking to his doctor about it (the doc had treated him since he was a baby). I went with him and we discussed the test results as they came in (all normal, thankfully). He ended up taking Cialis about 3 times, and then his anxiety went away and he didn't need the meds anymore.

My bf tells me that he really appreciated the way that I handled the situation, and was impressed when I accompanied him to the doctor. It brought us closer together and fostered mutual trust and open communication right from the outset. He also liked my approach - instead of talking about feelings, I just tackled it like any other problem to solve in life.

We often complain that we let our talented players leave when their rookie deals are up, and now we have the opportunity to show that this team is going to be different, that we're in it to win it.

This isn't about overpaying a guy like Whitner who wanted top-3 safety money despite not being a top 10 safety. Byrd is one of the best in the league and he wants to be paid as such.

Bearmodule,AskMen,1390319229.0,"I've always been quiet though I was quite outgoing and active as a kid. Had a stupidly strong fear of embarrassment and making a fool of myself when I was younger so I rarely spoke to anybody outside of my small social circle. These days I'm not so shy, though I retain a little of that still - mostly I just prefer to keep to myself (though it's still usually an entirely pleasant time if someone wants to talk to me; I'm not *that* introverted). I do enjoy listening to people talk, in fact I do much prefer conversations where I can mostly just listen to the other person rather than have them expect me to have a lot of input. Also I am very helpful and handy, so if anybody actually does ask for my help I'm normally able to give it. Oh, and I just about never get angry. I might get irritated at something, but I've not felt actual anger for a very long time. I'm incredibly chilled and relaxed (bit too much sometimes).

Not really much to say except I'm just like most other people, but instead of going to clubs or pubs and having lots of friends I'm much more content staying at home playing video games with my friends, watching TV or movies and reading.

This is the difference between her and them:

Guys - ""Dude, we need to handle this garbage disposal thing.""

Her - ""So I was in the kitchen the other day, and while I was using my dishes (inflected in a way that sounds like a question), I flushed some food down the drain, and when I tried to turn on the disposal, it didn't work.  It was really frustrating, and I couldn't unstick it so it worked.  So basically what I'm thinking (question inflection again), is that we should deal with this problem as soon as possible.""

My response after them:

Guys: ""Yeah, I know, I've emailed the landlord.""

Her: ""Yeah, I've already emailed the landlord.  No, I don't know when they can get to it.  Yes, I tried to unstick it myself.  No, it didn't work.  You put the metal sieve thing over the hole, and throw the food in the garbage.  What do you mean the toilet isn't working either?  Yes it is, lift the lid on the tank and untangle the chain.

Other than over taxing a simple issue, I also have to deal with how the frustration makes her feel (even though it was a bone from her gnarly assed food that wedged the blade), and whether or not she wants me to just listen, or engage in the discussion.

Ladies, after you've shared a hardship with me, I do reply with a well I would have, but that's not to offer a suggestion on how you should proceed, I'm just trying to visualize the situation, and empathize with you.  Part of that is me seeing how I'd react in that situation, and sharing it with you is a means for me to get into your head by hearing why that would or wouldn't have worked in that situation."
littlestray,AnimalsBeingJerks,1390319246.0,"Cats all have their own individual personalities (how outgoing they are, etc) but they need to be socialized when it comes to cat-human interaction. There's a species gap and we don't have the same communication systems so they/we need to adapt.

Cats are considered semi-domestic, and if they don't interact with humans before eight weeks of age they are feral. A feral cat can later be socialized to humans but in that case the cat would likely be far more aloof and most likely only bond with one or a handful of specific people while remaining wary of strangers.

I think the born-with personalities you're describing might correspond to each individual's outgoingness, dominance, strength and curiosity. So your vicious face jumper would be trying to initiate play fighting with you to see who's tougher, and the sweet explorer might be curious but less dominant."

Lost_Afropick,todayilearned,1390319272.0,"I'm from London but even growing up in the 80s I saw ""paki go home"" all over the place.  Usually underscored with ""C18"" underneath.  Or ""NF"".  I went to a Catholic school so no Pakistanis there even though I lived among them.  But the white kids we went to school with were comfortable and happy to express to me as a black guy how much they hated 'pakis'.  That was back then.  And that was back before I think they even knew what 'Islam' was so it wasn't that.  I've no doubt when I wasn't there it was me they enthusiastically hated but eh... that's what it was.  We played football on the local estates and it would be blacks and whites against the pakistanis and bengalis.  That we did that without being all sensitive as kids I look back as very weird now.  But the Asian lads were certainly the ones who were 'other'.

Look I'm not saying it was rosy.  A white girl I went to school with got ostracised by her circle for dating a mix raced guy (back then we said half-caste can you imagine?) who she is now married to.  Those ""friends"" of hers didn't speak to her for the rest of school though I note they're now on her facebook acting nice as punch.  So that was the kind of racism I saw.  Fights and graffiti and police harassment with the sus laws and stuff.

But nobody was trying to catch and and hang us from trees in England, you know what I mean?

In general I agree that it varied from people to people and city to city but I just think that where you say the Pakistanis settled into London easily, that's a bit rosey eyed."

wraith313,relationships,1390319287.0,"I'm confused. If he is trying to call you maybe he is trying to rectify the situation, isn't it a little childish to just completely ignore him now? Including reading texts etc? Seriously. I realize you are upset he didn't wanna talk about it, but it kinda seems like your getting up and leaving may have been a tactic to *get him to talk about it* and now you ignoring his attempts to?

This is all very strange to me.

Also: Please don't everyone gloss over this:

*was introduced to his daughter after 6 months after long discussions of commitment and that the girlfriend freaked the fuck out and openly told him afterward that she didn't like the daughter or her mother's existence, which then led to a quick breakup*

If I was this guy, I would be VERY careful who I introduce my daughter to after something like that happened. I probably wouldn't do it until she *was* my fiance *for sure*. You act like he has an issue for being careful with who his daughter meets *after his ex freaked out about his daughter right after he introduced them to each other*. 

He probly doesn't want a trail of girls meeting and confusing his young daughter in her formative years. Honestly, I know you need to do whats best for you, but I really think maybe both of you are being childish about this. He has every right to be careful with his daughter but is, maybe, being too careful. You, on the other hand, are perhaps misunderstanding why he is being careful and assuming a whole bunch of things, all of which happen to be malicious.

In conclusion: Talk to him. It's dumb to go and hide and ignore him. If you definitely want to break up, then make it absolutely clear to him and have that be it. If not, then talking to him will help reconcile. Hiding is not a proper response in either case. And talking is the proper response in both cases.

In any case, it is his daughter. He can love you all he wants and all you want. But you have to know that you will *always be in second place to someones child*. That's just life. So if it comes down to him believing he is protecting his daughter and him trying to make you happy by introducing the two of you, you are going to lose. It would be better to try to explain your side of things and discuss how you want to meet her etc than to confront him about why he won't let you. Two entirely different discussions.

NOTES: Please be civil in responses. I realize my post is going against the grain here but if you are going to downvote, please explain why etc. I presume most people will respond with ""well hes lying so and so"". The thing is: OP hasn't put any evidence anywhere that the guy is lying to her at all. Everyone is *assuming* he is lying, but based on very little evidence, other than the fact that she hasn't met the guys daughter."

all i'm trying to say is that it isn't inherently better or worse, it changes person to person. and it certainly isn't always harmful

edit: and also if OP is claiming that it's because of separation boys will view the girls as a distraction i think they have very little understanding of hormonal boys around a pretty girl. it doesn't necessitate the idea that girls are simply nothing more than distractions and sex objects. it just points out that hormonal boys are prone to lose focus around pretty girls. it doesn't mean that they *only* see them that way."

borkedhelix,Jeep,1390319410.0,"I had the same problem.  I put on new tires with less backspacing, and I noticed that only one side would rub at full lock.  If you've lifted your Jeep, the track bar will cause the axle to shift to one side as the axle droops.  It's one of the (relatively minor, imo) downsides of a track bar suspension configuration.

The easiest way to tell if it's shifted, and how far, is to measure the distance from the wheel rim to the frame in the same location on both sides.

I did a 4"" lift, and it shifted my axle about an inch to the driver's side.  Now that I've got this trackbar in and adjusted it's within an 1/8th of an inch or so from center, and it doesn't rub anymore.  Now I just need to adjust the drag link to straighten the steering wheel, so I can see the gauges again."

EgregiousWeasel,MakeupAddiction,1390319544.0,"**Best:**

* Voluminous Mascara. Great volume with minimal, easily manageable clumping.

* Magic Lumi concealer. This stuff is wonderful for under my eyes. I don't have dark circles, but I do have bags. I use this in the shadow cast by my bags, and it camouflages them very well.

* Magic Nude Liquid Powder foundation. This stuff is very good for light coverage. I'm oily, so it doesn't have wonderful lasting power, but it's not much different than most other foundations in that respect. The texture is perfect for me, and I would consider it a dupe for the Armani Maestro foundation but without the fragrance. So it's even better.

* True Match powder has been my go-to powder for years.

* Lineur Intense felt tip liquid liner is really good. I'm terrible at liquid liner, and this stuff makes me feel competent. It's easy to use and stays well with primer (never used it without).

* Edited to add: Magic Lumi Light Infusing Primer. I made the mistake of putting this on my face like a normal foundation primer and ended up looking like I rubbed fried chicken all over my face. I almost threw it in the trash I was so disgusted. Then I decided I would instead mix a little bit with my foundation, and it looked fantastic. It's very nice for foundations that may otherwise be a bit cakey. It thins them out and adds a touch of dewiness. 

**Worst:**

* Power Moisture Conditioner with Hyaluronic Acid. It was terrible. After one use, my hair felt like straw. Never again."

They got a Pro Bowl QB and turned him into a mediocre QB when Lovie was the HC.  One year under a competent coaching staff and he posted career numbers.  A lot of players come into this league with all the talent in the world, but get shafted in coaching quality.

devonclaire,relationship_advice,1390319642.0,"Hey, your situation sounds sad overall, but I wanted to specifically comment on your husband's views on dominance theory and dog training. 

Please show him [this article about how dominance theory has been discounted in dog training](http://www.apdt.com/petowners/choose/dominance.aspx). Dogs do not see members of other species as part of their ""pack,"" and therefore, dogs don't try to ""dominate"" humans, and humans can not ""get dominance"" over dogs. If your husband is hitting your dog, not only is that animal abuse, but in the dog's eyes, all your husband is doing is making himself seem like a very scary person. The dog is not learning that your husband is ""dominant"" — just that he's scary and untrustworthy.

One quote from the article: ""In addition to our new understanding of wolf behavior, study into canine behavior has found that dogs, while sharing some traits with their wolf cousins, have many more significant differences. As a result, the idea that dog behavior can be explained through the application of wolf behavior models is no more relevant than suggesting that chimpanzee behavior can be used to explain human behavior.""

(It seems like you are already aware that dominance theory is outdated, but I just wanted you to have some evidence to back yourself up when you talk to him about it.)"

The first 3 years they were basically a ""get to know your class a bit better"" or just ""yey, no school for 3 days"" trip, but the 4th year, they were called ""Relationship days"". Or that's what the school called them. The students (and some teachers) all called them ""sex days"", because that entire trip was oriented around relationships and sex. We spent the days talking about relationships, there was a big quiz, some board game type shit and all that stuff. Talked about sex with the teachers and other students, had some debates etc.

That's on top of all the biology crap we got in the second and the third year. We were basically flooded with sex ed.

kaiouap,AskReddit,1390319822.0,"One of the main reason I started smoking, years ago, was that my sense of smell was too... strong.

I had serious problems with every strong smell, floreal ones more than anything. Perfumes, close places, exhaust emissions from cars gave me really bad headache and nausea, just to give you the idea.

Online there was/is a lot of literature about anosmia (lessened sense of smell), but not as much about hyperosmia (enhanced) and his effects on everyday life. Mostly they deal with temporary hyperosmia, as a side effect to other problems.

Smoking for me was a really ""easy"" way to fix it, because the smell of smoke covered everything around, and ultimately reduced every odor even while not smoking (while not being too bad itself).

Get a job for now - even if you get into a PhD program, you don't start for a little while and it will at least get you out of the house/away from your parents. Plus you can stash some of that money aside to have some cash in grad school. Depending on your field, your stipend might not be too high and you will be thankful that you have some extra money. Also if you end up not getting into programs, you will have some money saved up if you want to move to an area where you can get more research experience. 

I worked for a year in between college and grad school. My town did not have any research opportunities so I commuted 45 minutes into the city (each way). I then went to the gym directly after work.

If you carry a 45 and can hit a man sized target in low light conditions at gun fighting distances, I was taught out to 50 feet, then that's great carry 45. If you can't manage the recoil on a 45 but can with a 9mm then carry a 9mm, and so on. Knock down potential, sights and grip panels, it's all bullshit unless you train with what you'll carry enough that you can perform when your heart rate is jacked and you feel that mortal danger is knocking on the door.

bleeker_street,Advice,1390319935.0,"So the first thing you need to know is that I'm not a doctor.  I'm an epidemiologist and public health specialist.  Sex and sexuality are one of my primary areas of focus, but I can't provide you with medical advice because I didn't go to med school and also because in my country giving out medical advice when you're not a doctor is is illegal. 

That said, yes it does sound like a condition I know of.  The good news is that if she can cope with girth or width than probably (of course I can't be sure) this more likely a medical issue with emotional and mental pressures, guilt, and frustration contributing to it rather than the cause being primarily psychological.  Generally speaking, when psychology plays the primary role the vaginal muscles involuntarily clench making penetration either very difficult or impossible.  Of course, this can also be a learned response to anticipated pain.  However, usually being able to accommodate some girth would suggest that the muscles are not involuntarily clenching shut, and the pain is being caused by something else. Please note how I used words like ""generally.""  This isn't a hard and fast rule. 

Another thing you mentioned was the depth to which your finger is able to penetrate.  This caught my attention. Particularly if the burning sensation is towards the posterior wall of her vagina.  If you think of the vagina as a hole with a clock face, then ,with a woman laying on her back, 12 points up towards the clitoris and is the anterior wall, and 6 points down towards the anus and is the posterior wall.  This sounds like Erythema of the vagina and vestibule, probably caused by a sub-clinical bacterial or yeast infection.  Another condition that causes similar symptoms is blocked Bartholin's glands' ducts.  To determine if either of these conditions play a role in your wife's condition she'll have to undergo a manual, digital vaginal exam.  

Let's talk about the exam - she can ask for the gyno to use the teenage speculum which works almost always.  She can also request medication to calm her nerves.  This is a good place to practise the relaxation exercises because this is the kind of environment that can be stressful.  The exam will involve digitally stimulating parts of the genitals between the labia minora to determine the location, severity, and sensation of the pain.  The doc will probably want to take a few swabs, etc etc. And they'll let you know. 

Treatment of these conditions can be really simply yet not pleasant.  Let's say the condition is the result of hard almost microscopic like yeast guys blocking important ducts.  The solution is is have the patient apply a cream of clotrimaderm once a day to the inside of the vagina specifically where it hurts.  So the patient has to get right up in there and deal with the pain every day.  But the good news is it works.  

I can't tell you that this is what your wife has.  Again, I'm not a doctor, and I don't even know your wife let alone have checked out the inside of her anatomy, so please take this with a grain of salt and don't get your hopes up.  These are the conditions that the symptoms reminded me of, and it might be helpful to talk to your wife about them and make sure she's talking to her doctors about them, but it's not diagnosis.  I just have to make that very clear so I don't get sued or put in jail.  I don't think they let you reddit from jail.

and

&gt;so before our marriage our sex life was not that great, I figured since I had the ghost shift

I see three problems.

1) You made the assumption that the ""not that great"" sex life was due to your shift work. You expected that to change, but (from what I can tell) never had a serious discussion about it. The solution is simple: Have a serious discussion about it. Not now, though. You have more pressing matters to attend to, and the timing of that discussion is terrible because.....

2) She had a kid less than 3 months ago. This will most likely fix itself. My wife and I went through serious dry spells after each kid, but once her body recovered everything was back to normal. Give it time. Childbirth ain't easy. And don't even THINK about asking for an open relationship. At this point, that's like jumping up and down on a land mine expecting it to give you candy.

3) **This is the big one**: Her highly negative mom is living with you. This needs some serious work right away. If her mom is trash talking you to her behind your back it's bad....REALLY bad. You say ""This effects my wife more then me""; that is incredibly wrong, and I don't just mean the grammar. 

This has an enormous impact on your life, and you need to address it right away. You need to talk to your wife about this; confront her on it and don't let her wave it off as meaningless (she will; she'll say it's no big deal). Tell your wife that you expect her to stand up for you, just like she should expect you to stand up to your parents in a similar situation. Tell her that if she doesn't face her mom on this, you will do it yourself. The important relationship in her life is no longer ""her and her mom"", it's ""her and her husband and child"". She almost certainly knows this, but it's hard to beak old habits.

Last, know that this isn't unusual. Most married couples go through some kind of ""missed expectations"" thing like your sex issue. Most married couples have rough patches after having kids; it's a major adjustment. And most married couples go through the parent adjustment thing. When you get married, you are supposed to put more weight on your spouse than your parent, but most people don't do this until they have kids....and that magnifies the problem through delay.

My wife and I went through all of these and more. We got married about 20 years ago, and we are still going strong. You don't *have* a marriage, you are *building* one. And it's these hardships that will forge the relationship."

Feroc,WildStar,1390319975.0,"&gt; I honestly don't see how WoW has so many players when the majority of players now hit level 90 (within 50 hours and smaller now a-days) then go to the timeless isle, kill the same enemy's over and over for a full set of epic gear, then do LFR. 

I think that's just one of the things WoW does right. There is more than just farming epic gear. My wife spent hours over hours doing solo runs on old instances, because she wanted some of the gear to transfer the skin of the gear to her current gear.

I spent most of the time in front of the auction house, flipping items, transforming them, selling them. None of the other MMOs I've played (except Eve-Online) was able to give me an economy working as good as the one in WoW. Either the crafting was so bad, that I couldn't do anything good with the mats or the auction house was so bad, that I would never spend hours in it.

In addition to those two there are many many other things you just could do. Your farm, achievements, collecting pets, doing the pet battles, collecting mounts, etc. Of course, at the end of the day all those things are repetitive. But as there are so many of them, you can always find something to spend some time with.

&gt; A 2010 study of all adult twins in Sweden (more than 7,600 twins)[9] found that same-sex behavior was explained by both heritable factors and individual-specific environmental sources (such as prenatal environment, experience with illness and trauma, as well as peer groups, and sexual experiences), while influences of shared-environment variables such as familial environment and societal attitudes had a weaker, but significant effect. Women showed a statistically non-significant trend to weaker influence of hereditary effects, while men showed no effect of shared environmental effects. The use of all adult twins in Sweden was designed to address the criticism of volunteer studies, in which a potential bias towards participation by gay twins may influence the results;

And from the American Psychological Association:

&gt; ""There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation."" - http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx

As I said earlier and the above reiterates, in truth, nobody knows with any certainty. Research into the area has not been conclusive in finding a singular root cause, (such as the fabled 'gay gene' which is oftentimes regarded as unsubstantiated hokum). What is of confidence, is that there are likely multiple factors at play and that the root cause of a persons' developed sexuality is a compounded result of these factors, sociological included."

Förutom det läser jag så mycket jag kan av Neil Gaiman, Stardust är kort och härlig och en bra början till hans verk och sen skulle jag ta Neverwhere. Hans mer kända American Gods och Anansi Boys är lite tyngre men absolut värt det om man gillar hans sätt att skriva :)

i think a significant portion of the pronoun confusion came from the fact that she lived a significant portion of her life as a man and will have been identified as such (not necessarily self identified) so the writer is only guilty of ignorance to the proper usage of pronouns regarding a trans individual.

to me, when you attempt to gain public notoriety through lies, your entire life becomes public, so if that's something that you may not want, don't lie to get there"

roughl,oculus,1390320383.0,"They are struggling with 60 FPS because they prioritize graphics. If 90 fps was the target, of course they could aim to optimize it for that. It might not look as good as a current 60 FPS title (but then again, when they learn to push system boundaries farther, it might).

I think the new consoles could probably pull off decent graphics optimized for 90 fps 1080p. I don't think it's very realistic to hope for, because it would require devs to focus on VR as a top priority, and it's gonna take a while before that'll be profitable (if ever, compared to normal console releases).

At this point, I think we should just be happy when consumer versions are out, and full PC games are actually optimized/designed for the Rift."

* *Do you move out?*- Yes.

* *He cares and is just somehow emotionally stunted?*- Possible but irrelevant. If the answer is yes or no, you should take the same actions in both cases. So ultimately it doesn't matter.

This heartbreak is worse because it never got off the ground. You were emotionally involved and he never was. A relationship where one person falls out of love with the other is hard for the person who still loves. In that situation they are sad about all the things they lost. Loss is tempered with all the good things they shared and by all the problems that ultimately made it nonviable.

In this case it never got off the ground. You are sad about all the things it never got a chance to become. It's the loss of the [infinite](https://parttimenerdblog.wordpress.com/2013/04/09/doctor-who-review-the-rings-of-akhaten/) possibilities."

After Testament and Motorhead played, Heaven &amp; Hell came on. For those who don't know, Heaven &amp; Hell were basically Black Sabbath but with Dio singing instead of Ozzy.

So just keep going on dates, and also don't be too aggressive (a common mistake).  Focus on the future and things you like to do for fun, and don't go into the past so much until the time is right.

2 and 5 go to Worf, who becomes a captain at a certain time, I believe. But if we only count the ""regular"" ones, I believe captain Cisco (is he written like that?) from deep space 9 takes it. He is a badass.

4 may go to Captain Kirk. He is shown as being perceived inside his universe as insanely suave.

BooksofMagic,TheBluePill,1390320765.0,"I respectfully disagree with you generalizations.

&gt; TRP's version of biology equates us to nothing more than a brain stem and a lizard-level limbic system. It completely ignores the frontal cortex and all of the behaviors and drives that result from it, which is a huge disservice because that is probably THE defining feature of our species.

No they don't.  Simple fact is some people have stronger, more robust frontal cortex than others.  As a result some people will be more influenced by their ""lizard-brain"" than others.   TRP doesn't ignore individuals, but when trying to point things out it does generalize things quite a bit in order to highlight their points.  It's not obvious at first but becomes more so as you read through everything.

&gt;They ignore the fact that most evolutionary drives pertain to both men and women because at the end of the day, we both had the same environmental pressures, which are also very different than the pressures that wolves had to face 

Yes there is evolutionary drive in men and women - but to assume they are the exact same is foolish.  Men and women have different  chemical cocktails in their body that will absolutely cause them to behave differently.  Is it really so much of a stretch then to say that since these ARE different chemicals will also affect attraction and desires?  After all, looking at Testosterone alone, we have been told how ""evil"" and violent it makes men, who have many times the levels running through them as with women...

Oh and most TRP'er know that the wolf analogy sucks but its still useful in helping people understand simply because most people don't know how wolf interactions really work anyways.

&gt;Our thinking, functioning, drives, and behavior is still 98% the same.

Got a source for these numbers?  I would love to see them.  I may conceed 2% PHYSICALLY different (simply because I don't have information to the contrary) but I have trouble believing that the chemical differences have been taken into account."

holyerthanthou,AskReddit,1390320855.0,"Im not one for NASCAR, and I find it unentertaining to watch, **BUT** you have to give it some credit.

""Stock Car Racing"" Evolved from a time in the nations history where we had the brilliant idea to ban alcohol. What we naturally did was drink it anyways, but transportation of that great golden nectar required people to transport it.

We call these guys ""Bootleggers"" they would take cars, strip out some of the insulation, hide liquor, and drive it to wherever it was needed. Of course this didnt go well with the ol' black and white, so you had to upgrade the cars so you could out run the law.

**EVENTUALLY** one bootlegger turned to the other and said... ""Bill, I bet my cars faster than yers."" So they went out back to the empty field and drove around in a circle to prove who was fastest.

Compared to formula racing that was started by rich playboys with money to spend, and time on their hands, NASCAR was started by the common man, and played by the common man. In fact the rule is that you can not use parts or vehicles not available to the ""common consumer"" and must be made by the company whos car you are competing in, hence the term **STOCK** car racing. 

It is also the largest SPECTATOR sport in the US. Which means it is the sport that has the highest live attendance. There is a pretty obvious reason for this when you actually sit down at a track.  The action is constant, you wait seconds for a lap to be made as opposed to minutes. 

There is also huge fan interaction by the drivers. The cars are mostly stock so you can easily bolt in a passenger seat. Which means before and after the race there is usually a driver taking fans on laps around the track.

Even the race itself take loads of skill. It focuses completely on drivers skill and precision. Yes it's a circular(sometimes triangular) track. Which means that there is only a limited number of ""perfect"" lines you can drive so you have to fight your way through 30, 40 other cars just to get that perfect line. You have to maintain a perfect speed, going down the perfect path, at the perfect angle to even think about winning. 

All in all... I dont like it, but I respect it.

Also! fun fact. Light contact is not penalized which means it is *technically* a 300mph... contact sport."

Actually if you consider the value chain created by $1 of US military spending, you'll find that our defense spending is actually a social/corporate welfare program in disguise. 

When the Defense Department orders an aircraft carrier from General Dynamics, a huge amount of that cost goes to pay for materials that probably will be sourced from the US (Steel), all the labor, and finally the part that goes to General Dynamic's bottom line. You can get into corruption arguments, but the fact remains that a worker or contractor making $50K a year working on that aircraft carrier is being paid nearly directly by the US Government. 

If you were to cut military spending and shift to ambiguously defined ""social programs"", you would actually hurt A LOT of the 99%ers that depend on military spending to support them. 

All I'm saying is that it's a catch-22 situation and not a simple question of cutting military spending because we don't care about social issues and those need the money instead. "

***Sex, Ecology, Spirituality: The Spirit of Evolution* by Ken Wilber**

So far, a pretty good philosophical text. I liked reading about [holons](http://bit.ly/1ano08R), which I never heard of before, but it reminded me of what I had encountered regarding Leibniz's monadology, which I remembered feeling an affinity for. I might be about 40% through this book. Largest text with which I have experimented using the text-to-speech computer lady voice, haha

***Life and Death are Wearing Me Out* by Mo Yan**

This landlord gets executed during communist uprising in China, in the land of the dead he insists to the gods that his death was a mistake and that he should be granted life again, so they troll-reincarnate him as a donkey on his own property. Great book. Best I've read in a while. There is something of a folk tale feel to the way it's written, which makes it calming and endearing. Has the best hot steamy sex scene. First book I downloaded using Audible.com. $14/mo for two audiobooks a month, I just couldn't justify it. Couldn't finish the audiobooks in time, either, so my credits kept piling up. But I am a very scattered reader, jumping from title to title without finishing.

***The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho**

I think it so satisfying because the book itself is like a blessing unto the reader. Very life affirming. Deserves all the acclaim. Wish I read it years ago.

***The Prophet* by Kahlil Gibran**

Rules for living a fulfilling life, I guess. Felt kinda preachy. Somehow epic, but didn't have the balls I was expecting. Maybe this would have been better when I was in the 7th grade or so. Read *The Alchemist* instead. Or read them both.

***Eight Lectures on Yoga* by Aleister Crowley**

I enjoy me some Crowley. This book is exactly what I expected. Don't know how that description helps you much. If you want to understand magick and yoga, read it. A good short read. I will be following it up with *Raja-Yoga* by Swami Vivekananda.

***Red Hot and Holy: A Heretic's Love Story* by Sera Beak**

I enjoyed this book. Had to finish it before I got back to any other books. She really puts herself out there with this personal spiritual journey, exploring many aspects of the divine feminine and spiritual sexuality and the higher self and tangential comparative religion studies. It's hard to say what I got from the book other than I really appreciated the vulnerability in offering such intense personal anecdotes, and I feel like I got a little spiritual peace after reading her struggles and misgivings. I cringe reading my own ""vulnerability"" comment, but it is true."

bisousdarling,MakeupAddicts,1390321061.0,"**Revlon Age Defying Lifting and Firming Foundation**

I bought this because my skin tends to turn ""normal"" in the winter with the only oiliness being on my nose, meaning that it can handle the extra moisture that anti-aging formulas tend to have. I also take my dog on walks in the afternoon and it helps to have a moisturizing formula when I'm going outside and getting my skin whipped by 5 degree wind chills. I searched at Target and saw that the lightest color was really pink, but that the next shade was way too dark for me. Apparently, Target doesn't carry all of the shades, so I went to Ulta to look for Bare Buff.

Bare Buff is definitely a warm toned foundation, but isn't overly yellow on my skin. I almost always have to use the second lightest shade of foundation with Revlon because the lightest is always pink toned; no difference with this line. I never think to compare foundation colors when I'm in the store (i.e. hold the bottle up to another foundation that I know matches me). I did the bottle check when I got home and I already knew that this would be a touch too dark for me. It's quite a bit darker than the Revlon Colorstay (Oily/Combo) in Buff and it's even a little bit darker than NARS Sheer Glow in Gobi. 

The foundation is a very light medium coverage. I have some red marks on my cheeks left over from a previous breakout and it didn't do much to cover them, so a concealer would have been necessary. Since the coverage is fairly light, the color issue isn't that noticeable, but it's definitely a shade that would match my skin better in the summer (if I happened to get any color). That being said, I would never be able to wear this in the summer. Even right now, when the warmest weather we've had recently has been something like 60 degrees, this stuff does not stick to my skin. Perhaps with a really awesome primer underneath, it might, but it was completely gone from my nose in about 5 hours and by the end of the day when I went to remove my makeup, there was very little color on my cotton pad.

I'm taking this back to Ulta since it is too dark and doesn't have any staying power.

**Revlon Age Defying Targeted Dark Spot Concealer Treatment**

I think that I've posted before that I pretty much absolutely hate concealer. I put it on my under eyes every day, but beyond that, I would pretty much rather walk around with a bright red zit than put concealer on it. I don't know why and I don't know when my concealer hatred started, but it's very much real and alive. I picked this concealer up at the same time as the foundation, because again, I couldn't find this at Target (despite all the coupons I had...). Unfortunately, the shade range on this item is extremely limited and comes in only 4 shades; not surprising for a drugstore concealer. I picked up the shade Light and it is veeeeeery light and is definitely yellow; it would probably work on NC10(ish) to, at the very max, NC15ish. If you like to  highlight your under eye area a la the Kardashians, then you could also pick up light. 

I'm about to fan girl a little bit here, so stick with me... this is maybe one of the best drugstore concealers that I have ever used. If you apply it too thinly, it can get a bit sticky, but even at that point, it's still easy to blend and work with. I apply this under my eyes and on blemishes and it stays put all. day. long. Honestly, this stuff has outlasted my foundation on certain days (which looks really weird, but you know, this was in the name of science). Even though it can feel a bit sticky after applying and blending in, it does dry down very nicely. Since it's anti-aging, I find it to be non drying and it doesn't crease much, if at all, on my undereyes.

Now that I'm done fangirling, I do want to say that this might not be everyone's cup of tea when it comes to concealer. It has a lot of coverage, but can also be blended out to be a bit lighter, but I think that if you didn't know how to work with it, you might hate it. The first time I used it, I was really put off by how sticky it got when I blended it out, but once it dried down, I was in love.

And, as a side note, the applicator is multi-functional. It comes with a hard plastic tip covered in felt (so not like the Maybelline Instant Age Rewind thingie), but it is removable and underneath is a needle nose tip for ""precision"" application."

ebonlance,Warmachine,1390321208.0,"I don't really recommend trying something like a ""calvalry army"" unless there is a very specific value in doing so. I think Horseshade and a handful of other casters can run a max unit of Riders in place of one unit of small-based infantry to use as a very potent alpha strike or flanking unit. Taking a second unit of calvalry in place of small-based infantry starts to seriously impact your model count, and with it your ability to use defensive formations, withstand single-target shooting, and hold objectives.

My Horseshade list was going to be something like 
Horseshade +5
Seether 9
Nightwretch 4

Max Riders 11
Max Knights 10
Max Raiders plus UA and solo 12
Combine 5
Bloat thrall 2
Bloat thrall 2

The idea being that the combine plus free cast lets me use the riders and raiders as a first wave by upkeep cycling Scything if I need it, and I can save points on Tartarus since the Knights won't need the bonus to movement and everything else can handle high-def targets. "

One of my goals for 2014 is to get gold trophies for both NQs on my lookup. It's gonna happen! Also, I'm going to borrow someone's Coconut Jubjub for the avatar in February. Exciting! I traded three GBCs for that handheld flippy golden fish from that one MME and the Lab Ray background, so I'm really happy with that. Oh, and I had a good PIFF! I gave out six nerkmids, some other gambley stuff, fulfilled a lot of wishes and gave out a lot of dubloons, and got things I really liked, including a killer picture of one of my pets and a whole bunch of red codestones. IraGrass is closing in on 750 Str/Def/HP. Should I stop training Str and Def once I get to that point and just do endurance and level? Weigh if you know something!

I'm sick! And gross! It's not so bad. I sleep a lot. It hasn't affected my appetite. Oh, well. 

We're all caught up on Sons of Anarchy and I don't know what to do with my life. ALL THESE FEELINGS. We've also seen all of the Sherlock episodes from this season (series? I don't know, Brittish shows are cray), so I've seen a lot of good TV lately. Oh, and /u/ERTW82 and I saw Frozen! And it was great! I didn't mention this last time, did it? It's such a cute movie! And he hasn't seen Tangled and we're gonna watch that soon! Diiiiiiiiiiisney!

AnJu91,radiohead,1390321211.0,"After seeing a string quartet cover posted I wanted to share Zapp 4 with you, a Dutch string quartet I saw half a year ago.

They have a whole album of Radiohead Covers, and some other covers not on the album. I highly recommend them! I once went to a concert of theirs not knowing what to expect, but it really was amazing live. My Iron Lung was one of my favourite renditions, but really most of the covers are awesome, as they really do a personal rendition rather than blindly covering them. They really utilise the sound of string instruments aptly for their covers, especially the sounds of dissonance and tension that some songs seem to be so full of.
 
Some other covers:
 
[""How to Disappear Completely""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM8oRodlihw)
[""Paranoid Android""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vndV0NbGAlI)

jarwes,raisedbynarcissists,1390321315.0,"&gt; I assume everyone is out to fuck me and everything they say to me is a lie even if it is factually backed up

This was my biggest issue.  Learning to trust people is hard to do after growing up the way we did.  Professional help can assist you in getting over this but ultimately it's up to you.  

&gt; I nitpick everything they do and I can't shut it off

Sounds like you may have picked up some N-tendencies from your parents.  Being aware of it should help you get over it.  Get help, professional if you can afford it, self-help books and maybe some self-help groups if you can't.  As painful as it is you HAVE to talk about this to someone.  Everyone needs some help now and then, you are no different.

One exercise I did back in my 20's when I felt someone was out 'to get me' was to realistically look at their position, and mine, and see what exactly they could 'get from me' if this was true.  I usually found there was no reason for me to feel this way and once I realized this it was easier (not easy, just easier) to let go of the feeling.

I also found a funny t-shirt somewhere that said something like 'Never assume malice when ignorance can explain it' or something like that.  I don't know why but that just stuck with me for some reason and ended up helping me a lot over the years get over my distrust of everyone.  

Good luck!  Healing isn't going to happen overnight, but it's worth the journey.

Some people can't go back to being friends after a relationship - it's hard to change that dynamic.  Some people just see an end to a relationship as an end to a friendship in general.  A relationship means incompatibility, so let it go and move on.  

Or maybe it's even you.  Maybe they don't like being around you.  Maybe your bending over backwards is too much for them. 

There could be a bunch of reasons.  I can tell you that I've remained friends temporarily with a couple exes - even for a few years.  It never stays.  It always ends up fading away over time.  Maybe they realize this and would rather just end it early on.  

As much as it sucks, you need to realize how many things are working *against* a friendship with an ex.  Other friendships don't have that - they're a lot easier.  Look at all the reasons I gave - I'm sure that's not even all of them.  I may not have even touched on all the reasons that they specifically have.  That's quite a bit in the way of a friendship. Most other friendships don't have to work that hard to keep from falling apart."

However, if you structure a new business right **and can raise enough clean capital** to get off the ground, you can use your fake revenues to generate positive cash flow which can be sunk into growing the business by buying additional fixed assets, which are then depreciated and you would in effect pay no taxes on this revenue (besides sales tax on your fake revenue if required).

SwayzeCrayze,dresdenfiles,1390321548.0,"I voted Summer Knight as well. In addition to what you've already said, I just think Summer Knight has a lot of good scenes and concepts to work into a movie. Starting off Harry in his crazy unkempt phase and the rain of frogs, it seems goofy and silly. Then enters Mab, which introduces the Fae (specifically the Sidhe), and sobers things up with the debt/letter opener scenes. After that, we get to see Harry get his head together and suit up, showing that he's a bit more capable than we thought. As an intro, that's some good stuff, and the rest can be handled with exposition/flashbacks.


There's also a lot of scenes that I think would translate well to the silver screen. The [Book Spoiler](/b ""underground party where Harry meets Maeve"") would be cool to see, and I think the [Book Spoiler](/b ""final struggle over the Stone Table with Aurora"") would have great cinematography and be fantastic as a defining character moment."

dominus138,explainlikeimfive,1390321644.0,"As far as I understand it:

* Ukraine and EU were in negotiating about a trade agreement, the first steps to joining EU.
* Ukraine also needed a loan to sort a deficit.
* The EU loan was to be combined with mandatory austerity measures (cutting of public funds, privatization of public institutions).
* Russia offered a loan with cheaper interest rates and no mandatory austerity measures. However on condition that the Ukraine does not sign the EU trade agreement and sign one with Russia.

(on a side note, Ukraine and Russia have been in disagreement about the pricing of Russian Gas. Russia wants to set this price much higher and has been in conflict with Belarus and Ukraine for some time about issues about Gas delivery. These have their own wiki pages. As it is now, if Russia wants to cut it's gas delivery to these countries it is also cutting the gas delivery to western europe. This dependancy has prompted Russia to build a gas pipe around these countries through the Black Sea to reach western Europe. This new gas line is almost finished.)

* Ukraine makes deal with Russia.
* Pro-Russia and Pro-EU political sides are mostly geographic, the east of the country favors Russia, the west favors the EU.
* The pro-EU side started protesting against the deal with Russia.

Then we get to recent events.

* Ukraine makes a law making it illegal to protest in pretty much any way, with very stiff jail sentences.
* Ukraine does not have a judiciary that can revoke this law on grounds of unconstitutionality, it is impossible for courts of law to take this step (in a modern western democracy this is always possible).

* People go protesting en masse.
* Rumors about pro-government groups being bussed in from the east of the country. These are instigators, not only attacking protesters, but also escalating the rioting by setting fire to businesses. People assume this is so that the national guard can be called in to control the situation.
* Rumors are confirmed.
* Tonight the ultras of Dynamo Kiev will ""eject"" these groups from Kiev, or try to do so.

TL;DR Most likely a bloody night tonight for Kiev.

London, as the capital, and being significantly larger than other districts in the UK, has its own culture, sometimes markedly different than the rest of the country.

Again though, perhaps you're right.. it's simply harder to see. In my mind, it most certainly exists, but simply manifests itself differently. People more commonly are segregated on socio-economic grounds to which there is an obvious parallel with race; (poor people live in poor areas, go to poor schools, interact with other poor people).

With regard to hispanics. As we're European, we don't really have them per se, however there are obviously people of Spanish and Portuguese ancestry here in the UK (although not many, too cold! ;)

your DPS is worse with everything but Gleam. And even on range-bonused ship like the Omen you can only hit to like 5km with gleam.

Conflag can hit out to 10+3 for almost the same DPS. If you have a scram+web, tracking is an none-issue anyways. And once you have to swap to multifreq, because someone is kiting you inside scram range ... pulses beat quad-light-beams tracking and range wise at almost the same DPS.

mkvgtired,news,1390321863.0,"&gt; This is true, in different degrees, for every state in the world. 

The definition of capitalism you're using is so simplified it encompasses all countries that have ever existed, and virtually every person that has lived on earth except maybe the very first humans. Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, the Kims in North Korea are all capitalists by your definition. Your definition includes the countries Adam Smith, the ""father of capitalism"", was most critical of at the time he wrote the Wealth of Nations. They traded with each other, but in very protectionist ways.

&gt;If we're not living in a capitalist world, then what is it called?

The developed world is mostly capitalist, but many developing countries are not. Many are Statist, or Mercantilist or some other ideology. Just trading with other countries  does not make a country capitalist by definition. I am not sure why you seem to want one word to describe the entire world. It is far more complex than that. 

As I said there are countries today that behave in similar ways to the ones Adam Smith was most critical of in TWON. The countries of his time traded, and so do the countries now. That does not make them capitalist. They need open markets, freedom of movement of people and goods, they need to be friendly to private enterprise, and they need to remove trade barriers. Places like Vietnam or Venezuela, etc. have none of these features. "

So... in a nutshell. Reduce our military might, and we will no longer have access to funding to support social programs, and our economy will be much less important on the world stage.

If you do this it will make the recovery time longer.  What if you invest time into getting her back and keep your hopes up and she never returns?  You're going to be stuck in an emotional cycle of hurt and rejection.  Don't do that to yourself, it's dangerous for the healing process.  First things first, cut ALL contact.  No calls, no text, no e-mails.  Take her off your fb and any other social media.  Try not to dwell, it's easier said that done.  Workout, it works wonders.  Work on imporving yourself, not for her but for you.  Find a new hobby, surround yourself with friends and family.  TALK about it to people.  It makes it worse to bottle these emotions in.  Regardless if you feel like you're bugging friends with it, talk anyway.  The pain of not being able to eat, the emptiness you're feeling right now, the feeling that she was the most beautiful woman ever and you'll never find someone you love like her will all go away, with time.  Time is the best thing, just keep in mind that you WILL get over this in time.  How long it takes is completley up to you.

Smerphy,todayilearned,1390322078.0,"Of course they pioneered it, but Psychedelic Rock at the time they were taking part wasn't fully developed. The Beatles were never properly Psychedelic Rock as we consider it today. A lot of the Psychedelic Rock of the mid-60's was just regular rock compositionally. The Beatles brought the Sitar into play, but they just had a regular melody played on it in most cases. The backwards guitar solo was new and innovative, but you don't see it in a lot of songs.


While they may have been after The Beatles, they were still around at the same time, why should we not hold The Beatles music to the same standard? I'm not saying they themselves should've, how the hell could they do that? But in comparison those bands did far more for the advancement of modern music than The Beatles did. The Beatles were more influential, true, but not necessarily more progressive. 


I will agree that, as far as pop music goes they were extremely radical. They did revolutionize pop music, that's undeniable, but in no way music in general. Jimi Hendrix for example had far more to do 70's rock music, I'm not going to bother explaining why because you clearly are knowledgeable about the subject so I don't want to patronise you."

He was thrashing around and gasping for about half an hour (~25 minutes) before he finally died.  It is on record as one of the longest executions in the US in the last century.  

If I recall, the reason lethal injection was introduced was because cyanide gas took too long and was deemed too painful to be a humane execution.  Those executions took between 10-20 minutes.  So, this Ohio execution was a fairly large step backwards toward the inhumane executions of decades ago."

jianadaren1,explainlikeimfive,1390322160.0,"&gt;Yes, but I think the population desnsity has to be incredibly low to support a natural monopoly - lower than really exists in many places in the US.

It really depends on the industry and the economies of scale of the infrastructure. Very large cities often have still natural power distribution monopolies for the simple reason that multiple power networks take up too much space and incur redundant costs. It would be ridiculous if one company built and managed the network for your power distribution, but a separate network needed to be built for your neighbour.

A couple points on David Friedman (I though his opinions looked similar to Milton Friedman's so I looked him up - turns out Milton was his father)

&gt; Even a natural monopoly is limited in its ability to raise prices. If it raises them high enough, smaller, less efficient firms find that they can compete profitably

It's more complicated than that - the smaller firms *still* won't enter if they believe that the monopolist will drop prices in order to drive the new entrant out. Basically, new entrants need to be niche players,  have strong anti-predatory pricing protection, or be willing to fight a major war if they want to enter the market. Potential competition actually helps drive new entrants out because it's much easier and less permanent to drop your prices than it is to invest major capital in building a competitor.

&gt;A famous example is Alcoa Aluminum. One of the charges brought against Alcoa during the anti-trust hearings that resulted in its breakup was that it had kept competitors out of the aluminum business by keeping its prices low and by taking advantage of every possible technological advance to lower them still further.

That's awesome. Although it's ridiculous because that's extremely competitive behaviour (good thing or all) as opposed to anti-competitive behaviour. I guess that's what he's going for when he says, ""[t]he methods government uses to control such monopolies do far more damage than the monopolies themselves""."

Remember, he still had the Ocarina of Time at this point, so she'd probably be like ""Whoa timey wimey. That's some good proof.""


After that, he's like ""Whoa, Navi wasn't so bad, I gotta go find this girl.""
This leads to the events of Majora's Mask.


Ganondorf, meanwhile, is apprehended, and presumably evidence of his treachery is found. Hyrule Historia:

I'd be lying if I say I don't get hard sometimes, but her personality is a turn off to me.  She's not a horrible person or anything, but it's a couple of things.  I'm almost 30 and she's a typical college 21 so she's more impulsive in a flighty, unfocused way.  She's smart, like quantum physics smart, but she's not clever in a whitty manner that turns me on.  basically she's physically a woman, but she lacks the maturity that real women possess that I just find lacking in most undergrad coeds.

Also, she shows a general lack of consideration unless she's actively worried about it.  When she's in the kitchen making herself breakfast, she bangs the shelf doors, she clatters her pots, pans, and dishes while cooking, and cleaning after herself, and she opens the door and lets it self close with a resounding BANG.  Our other roommates are students too, and we all sleep at odd hours.  Also, other tenants in our building are med students, so banging a door can be heard on the floors above and beneath you.  That's rude, but I'm trying to just let it go.

Also, she sets her alarm clock on weekends to ""start the day on time"" (0730-800), but she just keeps turning it off.  It's only after the 4th or 5th time when I'm like, ""Is there something you should be getting to?"" and she replies with a ""No, I just didn't want to waste the day, but I don't want to get up now."" FUUUUUUU!!!!

The hardest thing is that she sings.  I don't mean like singing ""Royals"" or something, I mean like Snow White singing random made up melodies as she does everything singing.  I've also caught her singing some disney songs on the regular too.  Usually ""Part of Your World"" from The Little Mermaid.  It makes it pretty easy for my brain to shoehorn her into little sister status."

Plus, plenty of women in ASOIAF seem to take moon tea regularly and seem fine mentally, like Asha. 

So if moon tea can have psychological effects, it must have to be in strong and regular doses. And I don't think Lysa's case would really fit. 

However, the theory of the Tyrells poisoning Cersei is intriguing. It's really the only explanation I've seen for the moon tea, other than the most obvious, of course.

How does the decision to fast track or eliminate the appeal process not diminish our ability to ensure that we have not erred?

Also I didn't mean it as a cherry pick. I was just pointing out how unreliable it is since it was included in your list of components of an air tight case, and you made no indication that you knew it was extremely unreliable.  Given how a witness can color how other evidence is interpreted I believe it is important to point out that if eye witness testimony is essential to any air tight case perhaps that case isn't as air tight as we'd like to think.

Diallingwand,soccer,1390322557.0,"Typical racism is built around the idea of ""scientific racism."" The idea that there is a hierarchy of races, generally with Caucasian at the top and a descending list of other 'inferior races.' Its development came hand in hand with slavery and later imperialism, partly as a way to justify the brutal behaviour of slavers and colonists. Racism as we understand it know is a reasonably modern concept, dating back only a few hundred years, 
unlike Anti-Semitism, which is far older and rooted in idea around the Jews being subversive elements in a society, outsiders who threaten the main population, this fear of Jews as a group with a desire to control or harm the societies they live within is the reason for Medieval ideas such as Jews poisoning wells and sacrificing children and more modern ideas of International Jewish conspiracies. 
The prejudices actually have a different history and come from different roots, racism is a justification of the brutality against other races during the 19th century, whereas Anti-Semitism is based around long standing fear and hatred of the Jews, not due to a view that they are inferior, but due to the idea that they act in a malicious and sneaky way towards white Christians.

Not saying that a short man can't do that, but that's how they perceived it.  

Could also be the fact that tall men are seen as more authoritative by society. 

Research was also done a few years ago that showed men's and women's faces at different angles. Women thought the men in the pictures were more attractive if the camera was looking up at the man's face, while men thought the women were more attractive if the camera was looking down at the man's face.

SurpriseNinja,AskReddit,1390322585.0,"My best date happened last weekend, actually.
We met up at my apartment mid-morning and headed over to the fancy new museum in Downtown Dallas. It's by far the best museum I have ever visited, and it also happened to have the Animal Inside-Out exhibit going on (Plastified bodies), so seeing that was a cool bonus. 
Anyway, we spent about 4 hours there and then had a lunch at an uptown cafe called Bread Winner's Cafe &amp; Bakery (GO EAT THERE IF IN DFW, I recommend the Chicken &amp; Waffles). We sat outside and ate/drank on the patio for an hour and then spent the rest of the day just walking around Downtown Dallas looking at the beautiful architecture and gawking at the occasional supercar passing by (458 Spyder and a MP4-12C were the highlights). 
It wasn't anything extravagant, we didn't even chat a whole lot; we just walked around smiling and enjoying the world and the absolutely perfect weather. 


Then we went back to my place and got into an argument and I made her cry and felt like an ass. Whoop whoop."

topgirlaurora,todayilearned,1390322591.0,"Apparently not being able to handle something hasn't stopped teenagers before. Drunk driving? Teenage pregnancy? Ignoring something doesn't make it go away, for you or them. They're going to be adults eventually, wanting healthy sexual relationships with their spouse. And let's face it, teenagers masturbate whether adults say to or not. It's a matter of, ""do they have to hide and be ashamed of their bodies?"" Because that's what your version of self-control is. Body shaming. Suppression is not freedom. Freedom is finding a healthy outlet. 

You want an example of unhealthy control? Anorexia nervosa. People get it in their head that they can control their hunger, and that somehow makes them more powerful. And then they die. They die if they don't get treatment. Treatment is learning to eat healthily, and to learn that your body is beautiful again.

So you guide them into learning that the body is ugly, disgusting, base, something to be controlled and suppressed like an animal. I teach that our bodies are wonderful things, capable of giving us delicious pleasure. That sex has driven human development, and the greatest thoughts in philosophy and art. But like a fire, it can be dangerous, and has to be respected. Release the pressure in a way that keeps you safe, until you're old enough to handle the grownup stuff. You wouldn't give a 16 year old the keys to a Ferrari, and then tell him not to drive it. Give him an old pickup truck that only goes 30.

Your children are going to be driven through life by the demands of their bodies. Hunger, sleep, need for warmth. That's how life works."

I know he knows that it happens, but do you just turn it down, or is it more like, ""hey, it's that time again, I'm sorry, just let me push through this and I'll let you know when I'm good.""  Also, letting him know that it takes about a week if he doesn't know already would help.  He doesn't need to know what happened in your past, but the more he knows about what you need to deal with it now would be the most helpful.

Similarly (and I'm speaking only about the week long change in behavior, not the mentality), my ex used to be a bit ""crazy"" during her period.  These dumbass doctors had her on way too strong of birth control (which they have since fixed), which was really screwing with her hormones.  Basically, she was normal until she got her period, and then it was the biggest mood swing in the world.  She would be super sensitive, overly emotional, etc.  But when it happened, she knew it would happen, so she'd give me a heads up (this is once she started noticing that it was the birth control and *not* her normal self).  At first, before I knew what was going on with her, it was tough to deal with.  But when I realized it was something that wasn't her fault, completely out of her control, I was 100% okay with it.  It sucked, but once she started getting emotional, she'd just say, ""sorry, it's that time,"" and everything would be cool.  I understood, and there's no way I'd hold it against her.

I'm sure he'd be the same way with you.  If he knew exactly what was going on, that it had nothing to do with him, and that it takes about a week, then I don't see why he'd be bothered."

digitalpencil,todayilearned,1390322726.0,"Several factors i'd wager, racism included. There's also the socio-economic previsor that poor people, who live in poor areas, go to poor schools and receive a comparatively poorer education, go on to do less well-paid professions and consequently, rinse/repeat that cycle on a generational level.

Racial minorities are obviously, a result of international migration which almost exclusively consists of a lower socio-economic status, to a higher one. Migrants however tend to work initially in low-skill areas from which elevation, is difficult.

I'm beginning to think i phrased the above incorrectly so please don't construe that i'm attempting to explain away racism, inherent to UK culture or pretend that it doesn't exist. It most assuredly does (albeit primarily focused upon Asian minorities as opposed to black), it does however manifest itself rather differently than it does in the US. My visits to the US have always been pleasant but the observation of the social segregation along race-lines, was readily apparent and somewhat jarring at times. I know others from Europe who've experienced the same thing. It is not as pronounced in the UK, which again isn't to say that racism does not exist, simply that it is markedly different in how it manifests and I daresay, subtler."

But if you want that to be the host for your media, you'd have to leave it on all the time in order to not be inconvenient when you want to watch movies on either TV. Otherwise, you'd have to boot up your machine every time you want to watch something. Might as well get a NAS and throw the drive in there and just leave it on, with PMS running. Get a smaller drive for your gaming computer.

Just through it onto your home network, and your Chromecasts should be able to connect to it via your wireless router (assuming you have one)."

If someone wants to look at my penis while I'm toweling off or between when my swimsuit comes off and my underwear goes on, it doesn't bother me, but it also doesn't mean I'm showing it off to try to attract them. 

If someone doesn't want to see that, they should keep their eyes on their own business and not mine.

Takeaways:

* Training with multiple sets to achieve a higher volume of training appears to lead to greater hypertrophy, irrespective of training status and age.

* There appears to be a dose-response to volume of training to a degree, although it is not clear at what point increasing doses cease to be increasingly effective.

* The law of diminishing returns seems to apply to hypertrophy training: the first set appears to be the most important and each successive set offers a steadily reducing stimulus. Therefore, for those who are short of time, fewer sets may be appropriate.

OrangeredValkyrie,AskReddit,1390323412.0,"These people wouldn't vanish into thin air, though. Let's talk about the nuclear power plants, eh? If the staff is too small to run the plant properly, the plant is shut down. If death is on such a broad scale and happening quickly enough to be able to kill 6,300,000,000+ people (meaning quarantine and treatment attempts were worthless), then that means emergency plans are being put into action all over the place. The nuclear plants will be shut down because the skilled crew needed to work them are either sick or dead, therefore people will be moved from cities that require that power source into cities that use simpler sources of power.

Power grids themselves would take anywhere from a few days to a few months to shut down. Hydroelectric plants, for instance, can run for quite a while without much supervision. What would eventually bring them down is gunk in the turbines. They would get clogged and eventually stop working.

700,000,000 people would not be the only ones left in a matter of minutes. They would be the only ones left in a matter of months. As the power grids become more and more difficult to maintain with skeleton crews, people would start coming together, mainly because they would be moving to where the electricity is. This is assuming quarantine efforts aren't stopping people effectively or aren't taking place at all. These people would be closer together and they would eventually figure out how to get along. The internet likely wouldn't be a reliable source of information anymore due to outages and the like, but libraries are still very prevalent and would have the resources needed to build wind generators, teach how to tend gardens and farms, and all sorts of other necessary survival skills.

Because there would be so few people left to tend fishing vessels, people would likely be migrating toward the coasts in order to keep iodine in their diets. You can fish with simple nets. You don't have to have people fixing complex ships. If you have fewer mouths to feed, you don't need them anyway.

Insects would be a problem, but again, there aren't as many mouths to feed, so a locust swarm wouldn't be as devastating to crops. Plus, the locusts wouldn't necessarily be in the area where humans are growing their food. They would likely stay in the farmlands that had been tended before the virus, since those crops will re-seed themselves if conditions are right. They won't be as healthy as they would be with proper care, but they'll keep some of the larger problems at bay for a while.

Humanity will still have a pretty good chance in all this because humanity will have time to figure things out. We have warehouses full of canned goods that we can live on while we sort out farms and fishing. It would indeed be a hard life, but the remaining 10% would still have a vast advantage over other past civilizations because we would have the benefit of knowledge that we had been working on for centuries, recorded in books and known to people who already study things like farming and engineering. Hundreds of past civilizations have made do without electricity, but they didn't know how to build a generator from scratch, so we still have the advantage. They didn't know about germ theory, but we do, so we'll be able to make our drinking water safer than they ever did. 

Humanity will survive. The next fall of civilization isn't exactly going to be an unprecedented event."

Example. I'm running across a road and get shot at with an M4, some shots land, some miss, i'm grey, but alive and i escape to bandage and shoot the guy dead as he runs away.

Half an hour later, i'm moving from one hill to the next, i hear a distant shot and i'm dead, just dead.

No idea where the shot came from, or where they were, i was dead in a second.

This is sort of par for the course for me. If i'm shot at with an M4, i can usually escape or at least trade fire, if i get shot at with a mosin, i almost always die on the first shot."

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1390323427.0,"Sorry if I came off overly harsh. Applying multifamily financial metrics to single family often yields nonsensical numbers. In multifamily, value is determined by NOI and cap rate, so those are extremely important numbers. In SFH, neither cap rate not NOI have any bearing on value, it is determine by comparable sales. 

You will pretty much never buy a multifamily property with significant equity capture, and any increase in NOI results in an increase in value, not cap rate. The value play for multifamily is to buy a property that has poor occupancy and is not achieving highest and best rents for one reason or another. You can then clean the place up, fix management, whatever, raise rents per door and occupancy rate, which will raise both cash on cash return and value. Even on a larger deal, following this strategy you should see return of initial capital via refi in 18 months or so, plus maybe 10-12% cash on cash on top of that (maybe a little more). That's how it works in a perfect world anyway. This is mostly from taking with other investors who do a lot of multifamily. Single family tends to make more sense from a numbers perspective til you have enough money that it becomes logistically impossible to do enough single family deals, at least around here. 

Single family is a whole different beast.  You can buy single family for well under market value. The reason for this is that, while value is determined by comps, often a seller in a distressed position will need to unload the house, but due to foundation, HVAC, plumbing, whatever the house is not habitable and won't qualify for conventional loans. Repairs would require too much cash for the seller to afford, so they sell to a wholesaler or investor at a significant discount to accommodate risk and profit. The sales price is more or less arbitrary. Cap rate is not terribly relevant, because it doesn't factor into sales price, after repair value, or rents (it is a function of rents and ARV, but those are determined by the market, not the financials).

 Long story short, you pay $50k for a house, sink $20k in repairs, holding costs, etc. into it. You finance the deal via hard money and rate and terms refi on the backend, an end up out of pocket $20k. It is now worth $100k. You have made $30k in equity (roughly $20k after cost of sale, or 100% return on capital gains). You rent the place for $1200/month, PITI comes to $600. Management, vacancies, and maintenance comes to another $300.  You net $300/month or $3600/yr. That is an 18% cash on cash return, and a 12% return on equity, not including equity pay down or appreciation. Note that the relevant metrics for single family are different than multifamily (though you can still calculate cap rate and NOI and use them as a basis for comparison against multifamily deals in your long term strategy). 

Hope that is helpful. "

avantvernacular,FeMRADebates,1390323431.0,"Prior to the invention of currency, trade would have relied on a sort of barter system, resulting in low ""wealth gaps"" and relatively classless societies. (With a few rare exceptions) the only form of wealth was goods, a for the most part you could only hoard what you could hold. 

Currency changed this by allowing the hoarding of wealth in the form of a manageable (and hoard-able) representation of potential goods: money. Some individuals become more successful and in turn their lineage becomes the upper classes of societies. 

If gender roles do not emerge until after this happens, then your objection is valid. However, if they predate currency, then they would already be established prior to the emergence of wealth based classes. The formation of a wealthy class would not erase or reset gender roles.  

The question ""why do men and women born into the same class have different lives?"" Could be simply answered with: ""because they did before there were classes."""

Then, since they have that monopoly, the government looks to offer incentives to improve the network and only the established provider can do that.  Somewhere along the line, the company basically decides that this undertaking would be too difficult, and just *doesn't do* what it's being paid by the government to do.

We'd met through a friend, and had been flirting from a distance for months, but never got to hang out for long because she worked in shitty bars that I couldn't stand and our mutual friend wasn't helping as much as I'd hoped.  After a crazy night at work, she got suspended for a week, which meant she could finally come out and party on a Wednesday.

It was the first time we'd hung out outside of the bartender-patron scenario since we'd first met.  She was out with a couple friends and I showed up with our mutual friend.  We'd recognized immediately that we were still interested.

We stepped out for a smoke, and while she was explaining the serial numbers on zippos, I noticed the opportunity, figured ""fuck it"", and went ahead and leaned in to kiss her.  Within 20 minutes we'd ditched the group.  We hit about 6 bars - fully enthralled in conversation and drink, including two lock-ins (after-hours).  And finally, we stumbled out of one and I noticed we were downtown manhattan and the sun was coming up.

I suggested the Brooklyn Bridge for the sunrise, and she agreed.  We stumbled our way to the middle of the bridge, laughing and teasing and stopping to make out on occasion.  We found a bench around the middle of the bridge, and snuggled into the chilly morning to watch the day break.

And then she got up, suddenly.  ""Hold on a second"".  She walked up to a group of 3 french tourists with a bottle of champagne.  I couldn't hear the conversation, but there were laughs and cheers.  She took one of the guys' camera and snapped a picture, and then walked back to the bench with 2 full plastic flutes of champagne.

Life-in-Death,bestof,1390323644.0,"That is great for her.

Maybe she teaches in a school in a good neighborhood where students show up, do their work, can read, and care about grades.

Maybe she works as a elementary teacher or in an established school where they have curriculum

Maybe she was like all of the teachers I mentored and they got to tons of support and all of my materials.   

Maybe she teaches an English class and has the kids do independent reading 3 days a week.  Or an art class with minimal lesson planning or grading.

Maybe she has been teaching the same course for 4 years so most everything is prepped.

Maybe she is a coteacher in a classroom in which the primary teacher does the work.

I don't know your fiance.

But why the hell would I lie anonymously about the facts of my last job?   Why would so many other teachers chime in with the exact same thing?

I taught in South Bronx schools.  My ex had an ex who was a teacher (same subject/grade) in a wealthy neighborhood in Long Island.  He said he never saw her take work home. She could stand and lecture, students would take notes.  Then there would be a test she could take from the public domain.  Yes, different situations are different.

Notre système pénal et civil, les forces de l'ordre, et les entraineurs sportifs justifient que l'on associe machinalement le sexe d'un nourrisson avec sa force physique ? Excuse moi mais tu n'as pas un peu l'impression de partir hors sujet, là ?                            

&gt;Parler de privilège masculin est ridicule. Si les femmes se retrouvaient soudain à être un forte majorité en prison, une forte majorité à perdre systématiquement la garde de leurs gosses et à devoir payer des pensions en cas de divorce, à être systématiquement l'être fort qui abuse de l'être faible lors des problèmes judiciaire... bah, on parlerait pas de privilège féminin. Même l'abus sexuel est un peu mignon et coquin quand il est commis par une femme.          
                
Parler du privilège masculin dans certains domaines n'empêche pas de parler du privilège féminin dans d'autres, et inversement. Le fait est que ces mêmes différences d'éducation des enfants dès leurs plus jeunes ages conduisent également aux problèmes que tu cites. L'association garçon/agressivité qui influe sur les comportements et plus tard pénalise judiciairement les hommes, ainsi que l'idée que c'est en priorité aux femmes de s'occuper des enfants, aux détriments des hommes lors de divorces. Et la façon dont notre société considère le viol des hommes est vraiment à vomir.                  

Maintenant, je le répète, parler des privilèges des uns n'empêche pas de parler de ceux des autres, et surtout ça ne les justifie pas. On a parfois un peu l'impression dans ce genre de débats que citer une discrimination contre l'un des deux sexes ""compense"" aux yeux de certains une situation défavorable pour l'autre.             
   
Il manque vraiment en France une association pour l'égalité des sexes, au sens de la lutte contre les stéréotypes dans les deux sens. Beaucoup d'hommes sont sur la défensives parce qu'ils se sentent constamment accusés sans qu'ils n'observent en contrepartie de défense contre les stéréotypes dont ils sont injustement victimes.                                 

Pour autant, ça ne rend pas les argumentaires féministes de facto invalides.

Here's what I did. Hold the hand you want to paint with the underside facing up. Use your thumb of that hand to pull gently the skin of your other fingers away from the nail while you paint. Use thin coats and really don't load the brush much. Immediately after you have painted one underside, grab an orange stick or toothpick and scrape most of the polish off the finger, especially near the middle (or the deepest section of the C) because you will not want to bring any acetone near there. For me there was sometimes a bit of clean up with acetone to do later, near the sides, but you have to avoid touching that underside or else you know what happens. Good luck!"

Yes, snooping is wrong... but cheating and betraying your partner is even worse, don't you think?

You've only been together for two years, you haven't even moved in together - if I were you, I wouldn't try to work things out.

PirateCodingMonkey,gayyoungold,1390324035.0,"good question. to me the difference between confidence and arrogance is that confidence is believing in yourself and not caring what other's think, while arrogance is believing in yourself and making sure everyone else knows it. so someone who is confident, just is.

example: take two people who are good at a task. the confident person does the task and doesn't require that anyone else knows it was him that did it, while the arrogant person does the task and makes sure people know he did it. it's not so much about taking credit, it's about making sure that there is credit.

in terms of sexuality, a confident person shares the energy in a relationship, while the arrogant person takes energy from the relationship. also, arrogance is usually a cover for someone who is insecure in their personhood or ability. unless and until someone else acknowledges that they are ""all that"" they aren't sure that it's really true."

But you cannot say that ALL of the Beatles music is overrated. Whether you like it or not, when they hit, they *hit*. If the Beatles didn't exist and progress the way they did, rock and (good) pop music as we know it wouldn't exist, based solely on how much they influenced other artists."

Mehknic,rpg,1390324239.0,"I'm currently playing one!  For reference, I'm a 6'2"" male, my 5'2"" wife is playing a 1500lb centaur, and our party members are a human, tiefling, and werebear.  It's a fun nonstandard array.

That said, this character is based off the [Atomie](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/atomie) race in Pathfinder, and I'm playing it at LA2 as a rogue focused on dagger-based Sneak Attacks.  Since I was drinking at the time of creation, I decided that Orin would speak in a high-pitched Scottish accent while being relatively unfiltered.  He also makes tons of false assumptions about the ""bigguns"" in the party (not racist, more along the lines of ""Why dinn't ya just ask the bear what he wanted instead of killing it, you weirdos?"".  Give me some vodka and I really tend to get into it.

Sneak attack rules combined with some of my racial SLAs (Reduce Person, Invisibility) allow me to keep up with damage dealing for now.  LA2 is going to kill me as we get beyond level 4, though, so I'll probably find an excuse to change characters sometime in the next few months (slow levelling).  It's fun for now, but I imagine the novelty will have worn off by then.

More hilarity:

* After learning the werebear's secret, he has taken to calling the Tiefling-that-won't-define-her-race as ""weregoat"" - he actually managed to convince her to headbutt a prisoner we had with her ram's horns.
* The DM finds the idea of a tiny rogue hilarious, so she tends to over-narrate Orin's kills. Guy on a platform gets Sneak Attacked? ""You hear a cry and look up to see the guard fall to his knees as twin streams of blood spurt from his neck, but no attacker is in sight.""
* He gets in arguments with the Paladin fairly frequently about the ""stick up his arse.""
* Before he joined the party, he snuck into the tent in the middle of the night and started talking to the ranger's bear.  The party woke up to find a very proud bear cub warpainted in berry juice.
* I've managed to prevent a TPK with my 1-nonlethal-damage arrows."

""Republican State Representative Bob Barrett from Lindstrom worries a law would make it easier for young people to start smoking pot. ""

This really irks me though, as being a frequent tree smoker myself living in the suburbs, and only being 23 with my high school years just back behind the bend, its this type of attitude that makes me want to slam my face into my keyboard. 

Alcohol is sold to 21+, yet consumption was so common at our school that it was not uncommon to pay someone a few bucks at lunch for a few good swigs of the Svedka in their water bottles, and on a daily basis. The point is that if a teen is determined to get FUBAR over the weekend, they will. A medicinal bill simply takes the illicit drug trade back behind the building and beats it to death, and replaces it with better funded, better regulated, and better understood operations that are more successful at getting quality products to patients who actually need it. 

Having suffered from depression since as early as the age of 12, and having been self-medicating on a weekly basis with MJ, I can say that there are certain instances where it works effectively. I'm not a real big proponent of retail/recreational legalization, at least until more sciencey type stuff is done, but regulated medicinal use is a MUST.

So even if they really were only concerned with casual sex, they pretty much almost HAVE to think of the object of their sexual desire as subhuman in order to engage in some of the many unsavory tactics they advocate to obtain sexual gratification. It's much easier to abuse someone if you remove the possibility that they have complex feelings too.

I don't mean to bring up a ""literally Hitler"" analogy but this was the motivation behind concentration camps in Nazi Germany. You might ask, ""Why not just kill them instead of torturing them?"" The guards and soldiers were people too, and normally would have objected to mass murder but by dehumanizing the Jews and other prisoners, made it easier for them to carry out such atrocities."

&gt;I have personally been told to go howl at the moon for bringing up radical feminism.  Also, [this is pretty much what trans women think about us ""TERF""s](http://31.media.tumblr.com/6bebe32fd05915c02c4f0029c20e7a50/tumblr_mt1vfq7GUI1shrov7o1_500.jpg).  It's very charming that you think we don't get this kind of BS all the time though.

I have personally never witnessed this kind of BS, and I spend a hell of a lot of time interacting in the trans community. Please forgive my incredulity. However, it should be obvious by now that trans people are not a monolith, we are individuals with different beliefs, and saying ""this is what trans people think"" is ignorant and offensive, as such generalizations would be for any minority group.

&gt;And, there are PLENTY of trans women who feel that their sexist gender standards are what make them trans.  

You are actually right about this, and it's one of my biggest pet peeves. In my experience, though, (which I am confident saying is probably more than yours) these beliefs are the minority.

The problem I have with this is that radfems often state that trans women believe they are women because they prefer ""women stuff"" or whatever, when this is actually rarely (again, in my experience) the case. It's like there's this entire strawman-mythos thing going on in certain radfem circles, with very little outside input to contradict it."

He seemed like an undersized college star that had no place in the NFL, but before long Saints fans were pretty happy with him as Brees' backup. He played well in the preseasons and Kansas City signed him and are paying him decent money now to backup Alex Smith, so he's shown some success in his very limited role.

[it was announced here](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1t4ubn/hoverzoom_for_chrome_is_infected_with_malware/) and while calling it ""malware"" is overblown, he started collecting marketing data without telling anybody, then when people freaked out about it decided [to make this announcement](http://hoverzoom.net/aboutdatacollection/) where he makes some conflicting statements right on his own announcement:

&gt; Your personal data was not collected.

okay...

&gt; This partnership was made with a trustful american company who has owned extensions in the past and has always been open about its methods and policies. The collected data is completely anonymous and is used for market research purposes only. The form data collection was designed to collect anonymous **form data used to determine demographics**. This is an accepted and very common practice in internet software nowadays. Lots of products and companies rely on this monetization system.

bold is mine. form data used to determine demographics being called 'anonymous' is sketchy at best. how can you guarantee that form field you're collecting doesn't have anything personally identifiable?

also, I'll repeat his last part of that paragraph:

&gt; This is an accepted and very common practice in internet software nowadays. Lots of products and companies rely on this monetization system.

""accepted"" by who, exactly?

at the very least, people should've been notified of the practice. better still, they should've been given an opt-out option.

With the GPU efficiency of scrypt mining, and the massive boost to AMD sales (with AMD currently being well behind Nvidia in the gaming GPU department) this should boost the competition. If AMD have any sense (we can assume they have at least a little) they will be working on upping their production capacity right now, and probably developing at least some form of ""dumbed down"" GPU card that wouldn't work for gaming, but that's more effective for mining. That would essentially kill the scrypt ASIC market for the foreseeable future, and garner AMD a whole lot of cash to drop on their GPU-style architecture development. And with the increase in volume of products being sold right now, end-component cost *will* go down, meaning you guys get cheaper graphics cards, too.

TheGreenShepherd,Seahawks,1390324668.0,"I've seen a couple of times now where people have speculated that Sherman is going to cross the line and come after Peyton Manning. I don't see this happening. Sherman is confident in who he is, especially when it comes to his ability versus his colleagues and counterparts (CB's and WR's, respectively). However, he is not an ignorant thug that he is unable to give credit where it is due. 

Whether Peyton decides to challenge Sherman or not *in the game*, the only way that hype is going to be generated is if someone starts talking shit about Sherman beforehand. If Peyton says that he's not afraid to go after Sherman, it might be ""on."" But, I don't see Peyton doing that. There's a difference between foolhardiness and confidence. Sherm knows who he is and what he represents. He's so sure of it that it blows his mind when people doubt him. 

After this season and that game, the doubters are going to be few, and only the haters will remain. Peyton is no fool and I doubt he'll challenge Sherman."

CrymsonRayne,Christianity,1390324718.0,"Joke 1: It is the end of time, and Jesus and Satan are getting ready to duke it out for keeps! However, they decide to mix it up a bit, and work a programming battle! The Accuser and the Living Christ sit at their respective computers and get to work, furiously coding, debugging, compiling and otherwise. This goes on for weeks straight, until there is a massive power outage! When the lights finally come back up, Satan has lost all his work, and is furious, while Jesus picks up where he left off. The Devil looks on, flabbergasted, and accuses Christ of cheating, for he had lost all of his progress. Jesus looks up at him and queries him ""What do you expect? Jesus saves.""

&amp;nbsp;

Joke 2: Hell is rocking tonight, and Satan is throwing a party so raucous that he accidentally destroys the fence bordering Heaven and Hell, because, as you know, they're neighbors. Jesus comes down and inspects the fence, commanding the deceiver forth and demanding that he fix the fence. The next day, Jesus comes back to inspect the fence and finds that it's one foot on His property. Christ once again commands Satan back and confronts him about it. Satan refuses to rebuild the fence, figuring that it was good enough. Jesus, at that point, has had enough, and threatens to sue Satan, to which Satan replies ""And where are you gonna find a lawyer?""

&amp;nbsp;

Joke 3: Three men die and go to heaven, and St. Peter asks the first man how he died. The man begins to explain ""It started when I discovered that my wife was cheating on me. I decided to come home early from work and catch her in the act. I come in and begin searching for him everywhere, soon finding myself on the balcony, where he was clinging to the balcony of my seventh story apartment! I began to stomp on his fingers, eventually getting him to fall, but can you imagine my disappointment when he fell into some bushes and lived? I decided to grab the fridge and haul it off the balcony, but it caught my leg and brought me down with it, killing me."" Saint peter lets the man in and then queries the second man on the manner of his expiration ""Well, I was exercising on my eighth story apartment's balcony, when a gust of wind blew me off the edge! By some miracle, I caught the balcony below me, and before I know it, some maniac is coming out and stomping on my fingers! I fall and land in some bushes, even though I have a broken rib, I look up, and what do I see? He's hauling a fridge off of his balcony.""

at that point we've hung out a bunch of times, some alone and some not, but we were just friends.

i met up with him to take a 16hr long sleeper bus from shenzhen to guilin. i was actually LATE which caused us to miss the bus. but he did not show any sign of annoyance or anger (tickets were approx $20usd pp) so we just bought tickets for the next day. stayed over at his since we were already in shenzhen (i was living in hong kong/home for the summer, which is about an hour away and across the border)


so the next day, we took a 16 hr bus ride. got to the beautiful rural area. we got hustled by a tour guide, found a cheap hotel for $10usd, unloaded our stuff. showered, and rented a tandem bike.

then we biked all over the beautiful countryside and found a hike. we hiked up this moon hill, this was actually the first time i went hiking in years. he peed on the top of the hill and i climbed up this unsteady pole.

after that we took a raft along the serene river. i had the best and freshes grilled fish from the river.

afterwards, we went to a stalacite cave. it was dark and chilli. we also went in a mud bath.

in the evening we just found some restaurant. we walked around the town and i think we showered again.

then we had a tickle war

then we had our first kiss.

and we were together for a year after that. he moved to shanghai....
i've had many great dates, and even a 3.5 year relationship with a guy i shared beautiful memories with. but i think this stuck out the most because it was a transition from friends to more. it's been nearly 6 years and i have yet experience one quite like it.

Enough fighting human nature. We need to get the money from point A, to point B, and these convoluted schemes of incentivizing and asking them to do it willingly isn't working, because let's face it, most rich people are greedy jerks. They won't do it on their own. You have to do it for them.

Also, basic income gets around a lot of the ""the money goes to the government"" crap....sure, it technically does, but unlike our current patchwork of social programs which are inefficient, basic income is about giving the money straight to the people, no strings attached no BS. just, everyone gets a check."

hopewings,Diablo,1390324850.0,"&gt; UI is still shitty

I just don't understand how, with years of UI mods in WoW under their belt, they reverted to a completely non-moddable UI for Diablo 3.  I spent hours upon hours tweaking and modding my UI in every game that allows it, and it's a great part of changing one's gaming experience that D3 simply doesn't allow.

Case in point: look at all those skills with cooldown timers.  There is no cooldown tick timer (minutes or seconds) on the skill bar, and no good indication of when a skill has come off cooldown, with different sounds or visuals, PowerAuras WoW style.

Another one, from playing Torchlight 2 recently -- I played around with a D3 UI mod, and you get a HP/MP bar over your own head, so you can focus on the action instead of constantly looking down to see your health/resource globes.  How ironic that in D3 itself you don't get such a feature!

That's near the end of a match, that explain why we don't score close to the 6-7 goal hauls that City are getting with the first 75 minutes or so.

3? Bringing on a fresh striker like Fernando Torres counts as a defensive sub? Sure, kid.

- Par qui les femmes sont elles moins considérées? Par nous. Par la population, hommes et femmes, qui éduque ainsi ses enfants, qui éduquerons de même les leurs, ce qui nous amènent au deuxième point.         

               
- Tu en es visiblement étonné, mais oui, au delà des discriminations hommes/femmes les victimes d'un stéréotype intériorisent profondément ces différences de traitement et en deviennent très souvent à leurs tours les acteurs.       Pour prendre un exemple très extrême, ce sont les filles excisées qui une fois devenus mères exciseront à leurs à leurs tours leurs enfants, et cela vaut sur toute l'étendue des discriminations et stéréotypes, même pour les choses qui prises à part sont d'apparence insignifiantes.                       
  
- De base, il n'y a d'un point de vue scientifique, hormis l'horloge interne régulant le cycle menstruel, pas la moindre différence entre un cerveau de femme et un cerveau d'homme.             
  Les hommes et les femmes sont différents physiquement, mais l'on parle ici de la façon d'éduquer les enfants à une période de leurs vie où ces caractéristiques sexuelles secondaires n'existent pas.  Ces différences d'éducation provoquent des différences de goûts, d'envies et de vocations qui se traduisent à l'age adulte par des choix de carrières différents, au détriments économiquement des femmes.          
     


Oui, les hommes vont actuellement davantage vers les sciences et les femmes vers le social.                         Maintenant, soit l'on estime que c'est quelque chose d'inné, soit que c'est lié au fait que l'on éduque de manière radicalement différentes les petites filles et les petits garçons.                                     
L'auteur du texte en lien estime que c'est la deuxième option qui est dans le vrai, et en énumère les façons dont cela se manifeste dès le plus jeune age, ainsi que ses effets. Ses arguments me paraissent valides.

I agree that the current problem is that it is being considered more ""feminine"" (I'm female).  Unfortunately in our society: male = cool, female = lame.  So many women adhere to this too, sadly, ""I'm an awesome gf, I love burgers!!!""

But if it's all about victims, punishment and vengeance then you end up with something completely different.

Borror0,changemyview,1390325223.0,"Consumers making choices based on the information put in front of them is rational behavior. If they are told that an item is on a 20% sale, then purchasing the item while its on sale is a wise choice. The alternative - waiting, to see if one truly desires the item - may wind up being more costly. 

The issue is that consumers are being lied to. By your own admission, these are deceptive tactics. Misinformed consumers are bound to make inefficient decisions. That's textbook economics. 

As for the boarder argument you're making, that consumers are not perfectly rational, no one disagree with that. There are opportunity costs to determining whether one is making the best decision. Past a certain point, consumers won't consider the efforts worth the savings. The time expended could be better used, even if one would come ahead financially. For example, it would be extremely time-consuming to research all ingredients present in your groceries. It's why government food standards can lead to more efficient consumer decisions: the ingredients that few consumers would willingly eat (poisonous, cancerous, mutagenic, etc.) are prohibited by experts. It's division of labor. 

Besides, the assumption of rationality is just that: an assumption. Friedman was famous for saying that models should not be analyzed based on the realism of their assumption but rather the precision of their predictions. There are a few studies from behavioral economics that prove that humans aren't perfectly rational. It simply means that the assumption isn't 100% true. It does not prevent the model from being the best approximation of reality we have. 

Pretending that proponents of markets believe that humans are perfectly informed and money-starved individuals is disingenuous. Outside of a few radical libertarians who don't read econ blogs, no one believes that. Competent economists recognize that there are ways that government can intervene to make market more efficient.

GoNavy_09,worldnews,1390325316.0,"Typical statist response. When faced with observable facts, statistics and reason you resort to name calling and personal attacks, completely ignoring anyone else's view point. Do I disagree with you? Sure. But I'm not becoming an enraged asshat... before you get angry at someone disagreeing with you, why don't you at least consider that maybe, just maybe there are other legitimate view points. I find it very intriguing that the people who cry for fairness are always those who show none. How those that call for tolerance give it only to those with whom they agree. The intellectual gymnastics that statists must preform to legitimize their ideals is simply astonishing. 

That being said, I fear our little debate may be over. Not because anyone actually won, but because you insist on acting like a child. I could bring up actual statistics, like how under Reagan's economy, though not perfect, the middle class shrunk because the upper class grew. I could show again and include sources showing how the wealthiest Americans already pay 70% of all taxes and budgets (I would't exactly classify that as pushing children out of the way), I could show and give specific examples of how redistribution of wealth has always lead to a weakened middle class. But can you? Can you show me actual statistics and examples of heavy taxes working? Examples of socialism and statism that don't destroy individual rights? Because so far your arguments are fueled by emotion and not reason, anger and not observation. **In fact you haven't addressed a single thing I've said, that's pretty pathetic for someone who knows the solution to every problem in the world.** Let me know when you can have discussions like an adult, until then, have fun in /r/highschool."

Rolten,MensRights,1390325485.0,"It is sometimes amazing how women treat each other.

As a student I became a member of a 'studentenvereniging' (student association) here in the Netherlands. It shares some similar characteristics with a fraternity.

One of the differences is that it's mixed gender and each year about 80 people join (we're small, some associations have hundreds new people each year). These newcomers should then, among themselves, make little groups. These groups are men or women only. These groups are nice since they immediately give you a few people that you're forced to hang out with. They are very important, since you tend to spend a good chunk of your time at this association with this group. 

You had a few weeks to try to form groups. Most people manage, but there's also some groups that don't have enough members, maybe too much, or some people left over.

One night everyone had to come together to finalize. The men and women split up into different rooms to sort it out.

The men were done in 15 minutes. A guy that didn't have a group simply asked around, and most groups were like 'Yeah, sure, we'll have a few beers together, sounds fun'. As easy as you would expect from guys. It took another 15 minutes to come up with names for our groups. We then went downstairs to start having a few beers.

It took the women two more hours to finish up. During that time three girls had come out crying. Two girls didn't even get a group, since others did not want to accept them since they weren't good enough. This meant that these girls basically didn't really have a place at that association anymore. 

I know these are generalizations, but for me it showed some of the key differences in the ways in which men and women socialize among themselves. 

Tl;dr If you have to make social groups, men love buddying up and just having some beers together. Women are mean.

Why is that so unrealistic?

When he doesn't do what he says he's going to do, I get disappointed, but I'm never abusive. We do a lot of talking, but I don't ridicule him. And it's not for me to approve or disapprove of his behaviour, but it is ok for me to express the impact his behaviour has on me.

I don't have a list of obligations laid out for him, I have reasonable expectations that I can rely on my partner to be present in our relationship for me the same way I am for him.

Hola-Mateo,Music,1390325521.0,"Finally a chance to share the horrific shit show that was Phish's ""final"" show/festival at Coventry Vermont in 2004.

Phish was my favorite band from the time I was in high school and I had never had the opportunity to see them in the 10 or so years I was a fan. (Which was do to over protective parents in highschool and being piss broke through college)

So on hearing of their eminent break up. I had to make it to Coventry. 

I made great time from Westchester NY early Thursday evening, and quickly fell inline with the rest of the people who were instructed to pull to the side of the road for traffic and logistical reasons. 

It's there where I sat for the next 48 hours.. I literally watched the sun come and go as I moved marginally inches closer to the road sign infront of us. Some time Friday afternoon I ventured out from my car to see how long the line went, 

I walked for 4 miles till I found the exit we were all trying to cram through, I was able to buy a gas tank and subway sandwhiches from my car and headed back to report the news of our situation.

It wasn't until late Friday night that I freaked out from anxiety and cabin fever inside my car, I got out of line and started driving until I was a little less than half a mile from the exit. 

I finally made it to the last main road some time in the early hours of Saturday morning. 

It was then around late morning when Mike Gordon the bass player finally came on the Phish radio station and gave the low down to the attendees what the fuck was actually taking so long.. 

Apparently the festival grounds were saturated with mud and many of the fields they were going to use for parking and camping were unuseable. As a result they were towing many of the cars into place just to make room for us all. 

Then what happened next would of caused a riot at any other type of festival of this size.  Mike announced that they would be turning cars away. 

Well I wasn't going to leave, ""Fuck that! I payed for my ticket, I'll walk in if I have to!""  Immediately after the announcement a small camper in front of me turned around and GTFO.  

Mike came back on the radio.. ""To clarify, we'll be turning away anyone who's still on the high way. But if you park your car out there on the road, cops will not tow you..""  This resulted in 25 miles of parked cars along the highway as people began to abandon them for the daunting hike towards the festival grounds. 

We didn't make it in to our spot until well after the 1st set of music Saturday afternoon. It has been a full 48 hours of waiting in traffic just to attend the festival. 

That alone was one of the most insane things I ever had to go through to see a band..

But not only that, port-a-potties were already unusable by the time we arrived, with mountains of feces protruding from the button up since the trucks couldn't get in to clean them. The walk ways and roads for pedestrians where completely washed out with mud, I actually lost my shoes by Saturday night and ended up walking around barefoot most of the festival. 

But after it's all said and done.. I would do it all over again for the experience of seeing one of my favorite band's ""Last Show"".

You can cite whatever you want but if it isn't actually in the divorce papers it isn't the legal reason for divorce.

&gt;Not to mention cared for her children. And yet: dumped like a hot potato the instant he ceased to be useful.

This is the nonsense I'm talking about right here. Davis had her second daughter with Jeff Davis. The daughter he got custody of was his biological daughter who was in high school by the way and the article even states: 

""she (Wendy) said. “I will tell you it was very important to me that Dru stay in her childhood home. It was a very difficult time in our life.”

So by allowing her youngest daughter who was soon to be out of the house to stay in the home she grew up in by allowing her ex custody she ""Dumped"" her family like a hot potato? Furthermore, her husband was the one that filed for divorce! Not Wendy. You are saying that a woman who was divorced by her husband who allowed her daughter to remain in her childhood home dropped her family like a hot potato. This is absolutely ridiculous. 

Far less??? Are you seriously insinuating that cheating on your ill spouse and then using campaign finances to hide it is far less than getting divorced by your spouse? Even if she did cheat on her ex it still doesn't equate to the two people you mentioned. Gingrich was married three times. He left both of his wives when they were seriously ill for younger women. Edwards also cheated on his wife when she was seriously ill battling breast cancer and was accused of using campaign funding to hide it. Wendy Davis's husband divorced her and she allowed him custody of their daughter. These situations are not comparable and the fact that you are trying to make a connection is absolutely absurd. The fact that this even registers in anyone's mind as equatable exudes just how ridiculous this topic is. "

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1390325684.0,"I guess I was a little harsh. I was mainly referring some of the worst Bronies that we see. The guys that ruined the MLP movie, and do videos of themselves talking about their ponies.

Some of the more well-rounded individuals would find a hobby that doesn't have feminine connotations, like drawing or writing, and interest in topics that are not conventionally masculine, like medieval fantasy, goth subculture or star gazing, or jump onto novel bandwagons for which society has  yet to categorize, like working with/on/through computers. 

Others will go the opposite way, they will turn that inner anxiety into internal hate at their feminine interests, and they will conceive of a hypermasculinized version of themselves. Like how most of the people that fight homosexual legislation have gay tendencies? These guys do the same thing for their feminine tendencies. They stick fiercely to a dichotomy of what men are allowed to do and what women are allowed to do. They delude themselves into thinking that they are Conan the Barbarian and James Bond in one, conquering women to reaffirm their own bloated masculine image, whether they are successful or not, as long as they play into that culture, they delude themselves into thinking it works. These men think that The Bro Code and The Playbook from HIMYM were great ideas and not just jokes.

Now, this is not to say that the majority of young boys don't actually have genuine interest in masculine culture. There are plenty of well situated adult males that play sports, work out because they actively like working out, they hunt because they find it exciting. If you are interested in things, there should be no reason to not do it.

Here's another point that follows this idea. This is why I dislike the notion of ""Male Privilege."" I feel that girls can do anything they want to in our society. While the culture can seem poisonous at times, a girl is never seen as odd for liking sports, working on cars, or breaking into other perceived ""men only"" hobbies. But the moment a boy expresses the slightest interest in ballet, make-up, or sewing, people start losing their minds. Where is the privilege in that?

I bring this up to Feminists all of the time. I call them out on not fighting for the boy that wants to do ballet as much as they fight for the girl who wants to do wrestling. They dismiss the problem as even more misogyny. Men apparently think that women are so revolting that the concept of a boy acting like a girl is abhorrent. It's a stupid argument, if men thought women were *that* revolting they would not nearly be as welcomed into ""boy"" spaces as they are now. ((If you think the girls at fighting game tournaments get treated bad, you should see the guys on the cheer-leading team during a cheer-leading tournament.)) No, it's because one of these kids has fifty years of progressive attitudes to empower them and the other one does not.

I actually believe that the next step that both Feminists and the MRA should work on for better gender relations is curing this clusterfuck. Please help me in putting the ""Men"" back in ""Fe*MEN*ine."""

DieMensch-Maschine,AskHistorians,1390325730.0,"Ancient history may not be my specialization, but as an academic historian, perhaps I can offer some contribution to the discussion. First of all, the term ""Judeo-Christian"" is an invention of the 1930s, (initially used to promote a more inclusive American social model intended to combat antisemitism), gaining particular traction in American social discourse only in the 1990s, during the so-called ""culture wars.""  Applying it to ancient history is problematic at best.  Secondly, the Romans were not strangers to state-organized redistribution of wealth.  Some of the earliest examples include Tiberius Gracchus' Lex Sempronia Agraria (133 BC), a massive agrarian reform program which entailed a redistribution of land that had been conquered by the Roman military, but then was illegally held by aristocratic Roman families.  An excess amount of this land was then confiscated by the state, and then redistributed to destitute Romans, which turned a onetime underclass into tax-paying, military-serving stakeholders in the Roman republic.  The aristocrats were then compensated from state coffers for their alleged ""losses.""  Tiberius Gracchus' brother, Gaius, supported broadening these measures, while also using the state to secure grain from North Africa, which was then rationed to Roman plebeians at what amounted to a below-market prices (the Lex Frumentaria).  This insulated the poorest of Roman society against market fluctuations of a basic life necessity.  These efforts, of course, were far from a nineteenth century idea of a ""welfare state,"" but they do demonstrate the Roman state's deliberate intent to manipulate resources to improve the lot of the poorest in society."

slapdashbr,buildapc,1390325772.0,"Honestly, it's hard to get accurate measurements and manufacturers often flub the numbers. I would look for reviews from good websites before buying any monitor. TFTcentral reviews some monitors, very in-depth, but they do not review a large selection. Unfortunately the larger modern monitors often have worse input lag due to the amount of image processing done in the monitor itself to make colors, etc. look better. It's always a tradeoff. But assuming a 60Hz monitor, any input lag under 16ms should be virtually undetectable. I'd shoot for a lower average input lag if possible, but anything listed as under 10ms should be excellent. 

The monitor I use has a ""game mode"" that supposedly reduces input lag by bypassing some internal operations, from ~15ms to 5ms. I can't even remotely tell the difference. I think if you get a nice big 2560x1440 screen, you will love the resolution and image quality much more than you might miss the microscopically lower response time of a smaller monitor.

Jrodicon,Drugs,1390325792.0,"&gt; there exists a single, universal set of objective truths. 

While I completely agree with what you said, I feel a need to point out that we do have a set of objective truths. Math is a logical tool which helps us derive absolute truths, and scientific discourse is approximate truth. I think LSD helped me realize that, but by the same token, it helped me realize why what you are saying is right, my experience was subjective. It took me several trips to get this in my head. I was convinced that my ""acid truths"" were perfectly objective until one trip slapped some sense into me (and convinced me to stop doing psychedelics for good). This is one of the reasons LSD inspired me to pursue an education in physics, because I felt a need to acquire some approximate objective truth of anything that we could figure out about our reality. I still can't answer meta-physical questions, but I feel like this is about as close as you can rationally get. And who knows, there is so much innovation and new discoveries in physics these days that we could be on the tip of an iceberg.

Necron_Overlord,TheBluePill,1390325800.0,"&gt;Ok first, earnest, well-thought out arguments are reserved for people who are capable of doing the same. You aren't, so you received sarcasm.

Spin.  You resorted to sarcasm because you had no real argument, and the best you could do was fall back on attempting to emasculate me by pointing out that I have emotions.  You have to do it sarcastically because to do it earnestly would reveal you as the disingenuously hypocritical piece of shit you are.

&gt;Secondly, as a ""writer"" you should understand the value of a tool like sarcasm.  It not only communicates and displays how ridiculous a thought/statement might be, it also tends to leave a more lasting impression on people.

Sarcasm mostly leaves the impression you are too stupid to make a real argument.

&gt;I could have said, ""Misogynists typically believe all women are governed solely by their emotions and are prone to hysteria because of their gender."" 

Which would have a been a weird non-sequitur, and wouldn't have been insulting or dismissive at all.  You could have said that, but you didn't because it wouldn't have made any sense and wouldn't allow you to both claim that my argument is dismissible because I displayed emotion while also pretending you hadn't ""really"" engage in such base sexism.

Lionhearted09,AtlantaHawks,1390325823.0,"&gt;What can you tell me about the Hawks that's awesome?

The great thing about the Hawks is that they play team basketball. Last night we had 7 people score in double figures. We lead the NBA in assists. No one is selfish. When you watched the Knicks game you probablly noticed Carmello took 70%+ of the shots and many of them he got the ball, stood there, and then tried to take his defender 1 vs 1. You see that on a lot of teams where the star or the top 2 stars do the majority of the work. Not on the Hawks. You also never hear about locker room fights or people not liking each other. Everyone seems like brothers. If you watch the Heat, they yell at each other a lot and sometimes get in each others faces. Most people on the Lakers don't like one another and on other teams like the Rockets you have a few players that aren't happy. The same isn't true for the Hawks. 

&gt;Who are the best players?

Well going back to my first point we really don't have a lot of guys that stand way above the rest but if I had to rank my top players. 1. Horford (Out for the rest of the season with an injury) 2. Paul Millsap 3. Jeff Teague 4. Kyle Korver 5. DeMarre Carroll. Antic is just a rookie but is playing great. So is Shelvin Mack and Mike Scott. Lou WIlliams should be a top 3 player but I still think he is coming back from a knee injury he had last season. 

&gt;What's the crowds and supporters like?

We may be few but we are proud! Arena rarely sells out and for big games like the Heat you get just as many heat fans as you do Atlanta fans. A big reason for this is that Atlanta is a transplant city. I meet very very few people that actually grew up in Atlanta. Most people come from NYC or California or Florida or somewhere else so they have already been a fan of other teams before. That's why we get so many visiting team fans in our arenas each game. 

&gt;Expectations?

The eastern conference is not the strongest and considering 8 teams from each conference make the playoffs, we are pretty much a shoe in to make the playoffs. I think we can make it though the first round but then we will face someone tough like Miami or Indiana. That is a tough task but I always keep hope for some upsets. Even if not I think we are building a better and better team every year and things are only looking up for the Hawks. 

&gt;And why the hell are jersey's so expensive!?

Stupid licensing. So not only do you have to have a contract but you have to pay licensing fees to use the Hawks logo. So if you want to manufacture jersey's, it's going to cost you a very little bit of money to make it and a ton of money to get the rights to sell it. Unfortunately there isn't much of a black market for jersey's but you can usually find one on Ebay for under $35 "

Dsf192,destinyknot,1390325847.0,"Some Pokemon just don't need speed IVs, Trick Room or not.

Honedge (Aegislash) is one of those, unless you're running an Automize set.  Why: Because of Stance Change, Shield Aegislash's defensive base stats (150) don't carry over to Blade Aegislash whose defenses (Def &amp; SDef) are only 50.  

The general strategy (and desired outcome) is for the opponent to strike Aegislash in Shield form, then he switches into Blade form and attacks.  After that, use King's Shield to go back to Shield form (and protect) and gain your defenses back before the next hit.

-- All this pends that you're not running an Automize set --

Now, other pokemon function *very well* on Trick Room teams (Confagrigrus or Slowking for example) so making them as slow as possible is generally sought after.  Slow Payback users would also want to be as slow as possible.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TL;DR: It depends on the Pokemon.  Some are just so slow that 31IVs does them no good.  Some need 0IV for strategies (Trick Room, Aegislash)."

Then, by pure luck, I got to know my SO (who I had been buddies with for a year) better, and I fell in love.

When he asked to date me despite all my insecurities, and when he told me he loved me back, I was elated. I thought, surely, this is too good to be true.

Half a year later, he's still the brightness in my life. I no longer put him on a pedestal and can now see his flaws, but I love him so much more because he's so human, so real. I love him more each day."

It did surprisingly well, and it wasnt very high pressure.


Sales
Marketing
Hr
Finance
Vendor and supply chain management
Customer relations
Etc

Then list out the important things you did. projects you worked on. big companies or people you worked with and pepper them in the relevant headings. 

Lastly jot down education and other skills you have. 

Put on naukri.com under your relevant industry. If you don't have a designation just talk to your uncle and make an excuse to get one to print on your card. Get a printout on the letter head stating your duration of job.

While this is true, it's not a great asset class as /u/taniquetil mentioned, here's why: even though it eliminates currency risk, it introduces lots of political risk which, let's face it, is the biggest source of currency risk in the first place. It's not a safe asset class if the government can easily confiscate its value without compensation (through higher property taxes).

If you fear the risk of Argentinian currency, buying Argentinian assets is not a good plan. Just as the Argentinian Government/ Central Banks can destroy the value of your currency so too can they destroy the value of your real estate."

I decided that I really wanted to take a walk in the countryside so I messaged a few friends to see if they wanted to go with me, but none of them were free, so I asked a girl I had recently met/made out with if she fancied coming along. 

I picked her up, and we drove out for this walk, which went terribly. I forgot my boots, and I sank in a shitty mud puddle several times. I think I even fell over at one point. Nevertheless, we talked and laughed and took silly photos and kissed as we crossed kissing gates, it was fun. 

After the walk we were hungry but I was completely soaked from my knees down, thanks to falling and sinking, so we had to go back to my mum's house for me to get changed. She met my mum, I got some nicer clothes on, and then we went for a Sunday roast at a local gastro-pub. 

After dinner we drove back to my house and walked a little way into the woods to look over the city from a cliff edge, which my area is famous for. The sun was setting over the hills in the distance, and the lights from the city were all twinkly and pretty. We made out a bit standing up there on the rock, looking over the world.

My mum asked me if I could give her a lift into the city, as she was going to a concert in a building 5 minutes from where my date lived. I dropped my mum off with the intention that my date and I were going to go and watch a film with some friends, but when we arrived at their house we realised we had missed it (I got the hour wrong). 

Finally we decided to go back to my house and watch a movie on my laptop. We got into bed because it was cold, and I lost my virginity whilst my laptop lay forgotten and my housemates cheered and jeered at the X Factor results which they were watching next door.

Went on to date her for 4 months, until her boyfriend made her end it.

The amount of Fermaid-K he recommends in the step-by-step there runs afoul of TTB limit on thiamin hydrochloride. It's about 120% the legal limit. That ain't no thing for a home meadmaker, but if you're the sort of person that might like to go commercial or get your recipe used by a local winery, you should keep that limit in mind.

Notice also that his step-by-step is for musts with a gravity of 1.120 or higher. Before that part, he says:

&gt;I have been utilizing staggered additions of a combination of 1 gram diammonium phosphate (DAP) and 0.5 gram Fermaid K (Lallemand’s micronutrient blend) at pitch and at 24-hour intervals for three days.

Lastly, I'm not going to argue with the Master, but do those numbers seem low to anyone else? It looks like he's only adding 50 ppm nitrogen in musts below 1.120, and 100-125 ppm N in higher gravity musts."

On a more pragmatic level, where I'm from there's the option to officially declare an exclusive bond that is not marriage but confers most of the advantages, for two people who don't want to *marry* but still end up forming a household together. It confers most of the benefits of official marriage. For example, someone living with a surviving parent or two people who aren't related and used to live with a third one that tied them together but who is now gone. There are no restrictions though, you just have to live together, but since it didn't provoke a host of abuses, I though I'd mention it to show that it's possible to have some arrangement where rights and duties are sufficiently balanced to integrate it smoothly into existing society."

Fernis_,AskMen,1390326171.0,"In my opinion it’s really unhealthy to stay friends with your ex (not in a way “I can hang out with that person without it being weird” but “we meet quite often and like to spend time together”). Even if you and her are RELLY over the relationship and are just fiends it will always be weird for your current partner, even if she says she’s ok with it. It will always be in the back of her head, it will always influence her somehow. And if your ex do not want to stay in touch and you keep pushing… that’s just creepy.

Generaly, it is VERRY rare to be able to stay friends with someone, who you had feelings for at some point in the past, not to mention being in a relationship. In your case, you say there are few such girls and you feel strongly protective over them. I think you are just fooling yourself and still have feelings for them. As it is quite natural and normal to feel this way, I strongly feel that you should try to avoid these girls as much as possible, best if you would cut them out of your life. It’s very unfair for any current or future partner, it’s unhealthy for you, your ex and your future girlfriends, and it’s really bad foundation for a long term relationship.

In case you are teenager, disregard everything I said. Have fun and experience life and love. Just keep it in mind that creating a serious relationship is not easy, someday you might have to make some serious life change for the sake of the other person, even of you believe what you’re doing is not wrong.

tallavery,AskReddit,1390326210.0,"It was incredibly challenging to find the line between protecting my children and allowing them to form relationships with people who didn't share their worldview. I was so fucking isolated and controlled as a kid that to this day, I don't really believe anyone supports/loves me. I didn't want to pass that terror and loneliness on to my children.

When I only had two children, I was never really around my folks. Once the third was on the way, and I decided that moving home and accepting help for a couple of years was the most prudent choice, I came up with some ground rules. I spoke with my mother and (though at that time she still denied anything bad had happened) demanded that she never allow my father alone with my children. Keep in mind that I was working full time and relied on them to a great degree to take care of my older two after school. I was forceful and took an angry tone, telling my mother that it didn't really matter what her opinion was, these were my children and I would keep them safe. Surprisingly, she agreed to my terms. At that time, still telling me that I was ""ridiculous"", but she took good care to follow my instructions. She also managed to never tell my father, so he didn't catch on that he actually wasn't allowed alone with my kids. Kudos to my mother for pulling that off.

Meanwhile, I spent a great deal of energy teaching my children about people. I wanted them to know they were loved and that people were mostly good, but that they had every right to defend themselves and to disagree with people -- even people that they loved, even me.

My father never raised a hand to them. I think he fell in love with his grandchildren in a way that he never could his own kids. My children adore him, and they know a different man entirely than I did as a child. They don't agree with his ideology, and they don't approve of many things he says or does, but they know that he would drop anything and everything to help them with whatever they need. They see all of his good character traits in a way that I simply couldn't because of my baggage.

My father is a scarred man who passed on his anger to me. I have not completed the cycle. My children are better at loving and enjoying and trusting than I ever can be. They know that it's okay for people to think differently than they do, but it's not okay for someone to try to control how they think. I know I didn't do everything right, and I have regrets of my own, but I'm incredibly proud to have children who aren't afraid of the world."

maowsers93,texas,1390326237.0,"I think maybe I'm not communicating well either. I'm not saying you have to vote for her or anyone else for that matter. In fact, her background serves little to influence my opinion of her because I tend to hold legislative history more importantly than personal biographies. That said I've said it 3 times now and I'll say it again. She did not lie about anything. 

You are certainly free to your opinion. If you'd like to formulate an opinion of her based on her legislative history or her background feel free, but you keep mistaking opinion for fact when it comes to her lying. She did not lie. That is fact. Facts are fixed you cannot change them because you don't like them. 

What I take issue with is people repeating falsifications about individuals. You by definition are repeating (for the 3rd or 4th time now) that she is lying after I've linked you examples of how she wasn't. Here is another. [Here is a google search regarding Wendy and Jeff Davis from before this article was posted](https://www.google.com/search?q=wendy+davis+divorce+jeff+davis&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1080&amp;bih=520&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QbDeUtr3O43JsQSOlIDgDw&amp;ved=0CB8QpwUoBg&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A7%2F2%2F2013%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F2%2F2013&amp;tbm=). There are dozens of hits. Her marriage was never hidden by her or her ex husband. You don't get to take something as mundane as a divorce and claim that she never acknowledged it when years worth of news pieces suggest otherwise. That isn't opinion, that is just incorrect. 

When you base your opinion off of an article that has no factual claim to the topic it is trying to frame your opinion is going to be skewed. When you are shown that your opinion is factually incorrect you are no longer just uninformed but you are willfully denying reality. When you claim ""Texas can do better"" based off your assumption of a false narrative with nary a moment to bother with fact checking you do indeed become part of the problem. 

Texans do deserve better and part of that is an educated populace. When you base your opinions off candidates off false information and propaganda you are no longer preforming your civic duty. So, to repeat, again, you don't offend me and neither does your opinion. But when I see people repeating false information I'm not going to keep quiet about it. You are certainly entitled to repeat false information if you'd like but you also have to accept that when you do people will likely take issue with it.

&gt;I suspect this move of repaying foreign debt means their economy is performing worse than they're reporting, and they're desperately trying to get back in creditors' good graces

I wouldn't go that far. The reason they're prioritizing it is because they're in [investment treaty disputes](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=5546cffa-46d3-4421-a47d-e86817aee4e5). If they don't pay, then creditors can legitimately seize (admittedly only foreign-based) assets owned by the Argentinian government.

AC1colossus,consulting,1390326448.0,"Again, student perspective, but my University always seems to pump up Big 4, and I wouldn't have known about Protiviti if not for their on-campus presentation. Their folks totally blew me away to be honest. Very knowledgeable, very interested in the students, and they had great stories to tell. If you trust what you see, I don't see how you can go wrong with Protiviti. I found from the Big 4 that offered me, they didn't seem quite as interested on a personal level, and they certainly didn't seem like they were fighting for me (obviously they don't need to, as they will always get great candidates). The entire appeal was the brand (I didn't take that offer either).

I was lucky enough to have plenty of offers, and I'd say Protiviti would have been my second choice. Word of note, though: the culture seems to be of the work hard, play hard variety. Very frat-like in a good way. I thought of it as a strength. A perk, even.

Good luck in your decision! I wouldn't let anything negative I've said affect it too much. I had to make some assumptions in my decision just because Protiviti simply isn't that well-known."

I can't imagine shaving again, I feel so much happier now!

In terms of reactions from other people, there's always the occasional assholes (all genders) who try to make me feel less feminine for choosing not to shave my body.

I usually say ""go with your gut"" and you definitely want your wedding to be a priority.  However, florists usually drop off their product at the beginning of your wedding and then never show up again (unless they're contracted for clean up), so it's wholly possible that she could do your needs AND another full wedding on the same day.  

Get a contract signed that includes a clause about what to do if she fails to deliver.  If she can't provide that basic information, you should not hire her."

It seems daunting at first, but once you lean a few things you can experiment on your own with pretty consistent success.  Here are some of my go to combos:

* olive oil, black peppercorn, minced garlic: very easy, goes on almost anything
* olive oil, thyme, rosemary: roasted veggies (especially butternut squash), and pork loin or chicken
* crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning, minced garlic: toss green beans in a skillet with some water and a splash of olive oil if you want, the spice makes them more interesting than just regular old green beans

I keep these items in my cabinet all the time: garlic, thyme, rosemary, crushed red pepper, cayenne pepper, adobo pepper, ancho chile, italian seasoning, basil, black peppercorn.  There are others that I use but those are my standards.  

Also pay attention when you are at restaurants and you can easily pick up on new seasonings to try.  Don't think of this task as retraining your palette to not like what you used to like, think of it as finding and liking new things.  I'm a southerner, I feel ya on the comfort foods.

A week later she asks me for piano lessons and by reaction was to make the lesson as professional as I could because I feel I shouldn't take a student for ulterior motives so when she mentioned that she had no interest in learning it ""professionally"", I went on a spiel (what I thought was a good srsbsns motivational speech at the time) learning an instrument is a commitment and not something you take out of whim and etc. Not sure how I sounded but I according to my parents, I was a bit discouraging and abrasive at least when I recounted the story back to them.

MrDubious,medicine,1390327111.0,"[Here's one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15115628). There are a fair few out there. 

&gt;Many studies indicate that herpes simplex virus (HSV) seropositivity increases the risk of acquiring HIV, with fewer studies also indicating that HSV-2 infection increases the risk of transmitting HIV. In a recent meta-analysis, HSV-2 infection increased the risk of HIV-acquisition two-fold. This increased risk may occur by HSV-2 reactivation disrupting the epithelial barrier and recruiting activated CD4 cells, which are target cells for HIV infection, into the lesion. In vivo and in vitro studies assessing the effect of HSV-2 on HIV transmission demonstrate that HIV-infected CD4 cells are recruited to HSV-infected lesions and that HSV regulatory proteins (ICP0, ICP4, VP16) may upregulate HIV replication, thus increasing the frequency and titre of mucosal HIV shedding. This may occur during both clinical and asymptomatic HSV reactivation. Plausibly, antiherpetic therapy could reduce HIV transmission by decreasing HIV plasma load and/or mucosal HIV shedding, but a proof-of-concept trial is needed to demonstrate this. It also appears that individuals co-infected with HIV and HSV-2 have more frequent HSV recurrences than individuals infected with HSV-2 alone. There is a strong correlation between decreasing CD4 count and increasing rates of HSV reactivation, suggesting that reactivation is linked to immunosuppression. The IHMF recommends that individuals with HIV should be serologically tested for HSV-2. HSV-2 infection should be targeted as a modifiable risk factor for HIV acquisition by testing, counselling and preventing acquisition through behavioural interventions, treatment and antiviral suppression."

I think Emer O'Toole makes a fine point, yeah, it probably is the Beauty Industry that pressures us to shave. Worse, it becomes culturally ingrained and we just do it without thinking. 

But at the same time, *I don't mind*. I have girl friends who don't shave their legs, or arm pits, or face! It never comes up, unless we are all together man hating ranting about social beauty standards and at those times I have complete Solidarity for my sisters who want to challenge the conventional ways we've been raised in. But at the same time, don't hate on me for shaving!

I've been pressured, from my mom to shave, I've had people make comments when I was young ""shave your legs, girl, damn!"" and I assume that is probably wired deep and contributes to my ""whatever"" attitude with shaving at this point. 

As far as pubic hair *I trim*, and I've had guys ask me to wax, or shave, and I tell them flatly NO. I DON'T want to shave my genitals and deal with annoying bumps and nicks, and I don't want to pay for waxing and bend my ass all in front of some random. So I'm already on board I guess in someways with challenging the status quo, but I can't go as far as Emer O'Toole is suggesting.

Chechnya is a Russian territory.  It's been that for over two hundred years.  Before the war of 1994, from the end of the 80's, using the momentum of the crumbling Soviet Union, the territory of Chechnya turned into lawless hell, where murder, kidnapping, rape, torture and expulsion of the non-Chechen population became a norm.  The republic was ruled by a handful of war lords, who were getting infusions of radicalized Islamic fighters from abroad.  The central government of the republic was completely dysfunctional and tried to achieve the same goals: killing and expulsion of non-Chechens.  So explain to me, why should I feel compassion for them?
Russia restored semblance of order in one of its territories, the methods were sometimes cruel, but the goal was achieved."

Whenever I start a story. I write a small bit and then gameplan for characters. 

Even if you make a tropey character, that is better than no character at all.

EDIT: Try to define John's origin and life story. Also decide who he is. Does he love dogs and hate people? Does he like mint in his coffee? Would he think of it as overly feminine? Or would it be the one thing that he'd allow to soften his image? Would he accidentally shoot the wall or is he such a drunk that he still has good trigger discipline?"

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1390327434.0,"My advice is to show her this post.  You've outlined your feelings, and that you're confused about where she stands.  

It sounds like either a miscommunication (maybe she wants to have a date close to yours, but doesn't want to upset you, but it's her wedding and she needs to do what's best for her and her SO), or like one of you isn't being honest with yourself.

So totes show her this post and talk it out.  Get on the same page about what you want in an MOH, what she wants in her bridal party, and how you can help each other have your ideal wedding.  

When it comes to the dates... you're never going to please anyone.  Maybe she has selected her date because it's ideal for the most people, even if that means more stress for you personally.  Maybe saying NOW that you can't be in the bridal party is a better option, so she knows she can rely on you for ideas, but can go ahead and plan her bridal party without you, knowing full well she's not hurting your feelings because you both mutually agreed it wouldn't be fair to you to be stressed about being in a wedding RIGHT after your own.

**Story**:  My BFF got married in Oct 2013, and I'm getting married in Oct 2014.  Clearly there was a lot of overlap in talking about wedding ideas, but hers always took precedence because hers was soon and decisions needed to be made.  

That meant that sometimes we were on different pages:  She was in stressed-mode where everything needed to be done and she had no energy left to do it, and I was in day-dream mode, where it's still fun to think about options for decor and favors.  I would stress her out with questions, because to me it was still fun and games; nothing had to be set in stone or paid for yet, but for her everything was getting to crunch time and she was exhausted.

My BFF and I have a very communicative relationship; she would simply tell me when I was stressing her out, and it would have been easy to be like ""Fine, jerk, plan your own shit,"" but the whole point of being so close with someone is understanding how they operate, what works for them, what stresses them more, and how they communicate.  

I can honestly say there are moments when I was frustrated ""dealing"" with a stressed out bride, but I wouldn't have changed a thing.  I was there for my friend when she needed me, just like she'll be there for me as my MOH."

Essentially,  you need to feel that you are validated yourself and not rely on external motivators. How to get to this state of being is a bit more complicated and it's not a switch you can just flip. However realizing that this is the issue at hand is the first step. Are you happy with life? If not, what aren't you happy about and how can you change it? If you're not happy with your job, perhaps it's time to start looking for a new one. If you're not happy with your social life, perhaps join a few meet up groups and expand your social circle. 

I think once you reach a point where you are happy with who you are as a person, you'll find that you won't seek the external validations from other folks and it'll be something that supplements your self worth, but doesn't define it.

IAMA_dragon-AMA,QuotesPorn,1390327497.0,"*The Hobbit* from Smaug's POV is actually kind of sad. He finds a huge wealth of treasure, and proceeds to single-handedly conquer an entire kingdom, securing his spot as one of the most powerful beings alive. Now content with his treasure, he decides to take a rest after such an exhausting battle (firebreathing takes energy, you know). A hundred years pass, and ~~my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang~~ he's rudely awakened by a thief. In an attempt to lighten the mood a bit and perhaps coerce the thief to not steal things, Smaug starts a slight game of riddles. Despite his wordsmithery, however, the little nobody who crept into his home takes what is possibly Smaug's most valuable possession and flees. Keep in mind that this was not a show of dominance, but rather cowardice, as the hobbit never once challenged the dragon's superiority. Enraged by this blatant show of disrespect, dishonor, and dishonesty, Smaug flies towards a nearby village, where he suspects the thief was tasked with his underhanded plot. A single shot, which, at Smaug's speed and distance, had to have been incredibly lucky even with ridiculous skill, pierces the only part on him that could have been affected, and he quickly dies.

To recap: Smaug proves himself the stronger force when capturing the dwarven stronghold, takes a long sleep, and, when woken up, is shortly killed for events which transpired generations ago."

This uses the idea that sexual acts and gender identities are not fundamentally built on gender, and it challenges social constructs formed around gender identities.  Also, feminist studies is integrated in queer studies, so it's all encompassing.  But I have no clue what feminist technoscience means.

freelanceryork,AskReddit,1390327568.0,"Last summer I mustered the courage to ask this girl from my old movie theater job. She said yes, and I decided I wanted to do something fun and outside. I had gotten into slacklineing recently (tight-rope walking for hippies), so I took her to the park and set up my slackline, some camp chairs, a speaker with music, and some munchies. We spent a few hours talking and teaching her how to balance on the slackline. 

This is now my go-to first date because it has a number of added benefits. First, she gets to see me walk all the way to the end of the line, which is impressive to someone who has never slacklined before. Second, when ever she falls, you are literally there to catch her. Easy first physical contact. Worked out wonderfully, because there was also a farmer's market going on that day in the park. So we went over and walked around there for a little while before I took her home.

It was just a short summer fling so nothing came out of it, but just spending a day outside in the park with her was just so much fun.

 I never said they were. 

&gt;Having gloves makes punching easier than not having gloves, obviously.

So it clearly helps strikers.

&gt;Again, soccer kicks and knees to the downed opponent are always going to be the realm of a strikers strength

No, because getting an opponent to the ground in the first place is the speciality of grapplers.  

&gt; The number of grapplers who used knees on the ground or soccer kicks vs strikers to end a fight is absolutely minimal.

That's absurd, wrestlers used knees on the ground all the time.  How do you think Coleman became the first PRIDE champion?  He took Igor down and kneed him in the head. 

&gt;Commenting that strikes to the back of the head/neck/back is only a negative to grapplers is completely ludicrous. 

I never said only.  But it's obvious that the advantage of back control is diminished when you can't strike the back of the head or spine.  And grapplers are the ones who specialize in getting into that position.

&gt;It's there primarily as a safety measure to stop grapplers having their takedowns stuffed via getting their heads/necks/spines caved in by elbows during any takedown attempt.

This is insane.  When have you ever seen a takedown stuffed by an elbow to the back of the head?  This is wing chun levels of crazy.  

&gt;There was no issue of ""legality"" with the way the UFC introduced it's original rules

We aren't talking about the original rules, we're talking about the modern rules.  Besides, the original rule set had very few rules and yet grapplers still dominated. 

&gt;No one in here is advocating the use of bare knuckles. 

I never said anyone was.  I just pointed out that gloves help strikers.

Also one of the main reasons the US's defense spending is so high is because multiple other projects that most people would not think of as defense fall under the DoD for funding. For instance, the US State Dept gets a huge chunk of the DoD's budget to build infrastructure in its host countries as well as pay for defenses of said consulates and embassies.

 I'm not saying we shouldn't find ways to bring down spending, because I've seen first hand the fraud waste and abuse our government spends.

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1390327693.0,"Then they're wrong. This is a common myth self-perpetuated from tradition that it's men alone forcing these women into such a situation. It should be obvious, but it's almost always the one higher on the socioeconomic ladder who has more options at his/her disposal. 

Higher class women have no shortage of poorer, shorter Chinese men to pick from. It is as /u/useitdontlose writes below:

&gt; and men at the top are marrying less successful women, all the way down the line and there is a large group of men of low socioeconomic status who don't have wives.

It's not a guaranteed thing, but a tendency that the problems at the top slowly trickle down until it becomes a flood to the underclass. In the worst case, you end up with bachelor villages. These guys have almost no options (unless their families pool resources to buy a bride from an even *poorer* Asian country, thereby continuing the cycle further). I've talked to the men near the bottom. They would not mind *any* woman to marry. It's ridiculous to think that their standards are keeping anyone single.

There by reductio ad absurdum, we see more clearly how absurd it is to believe that women at the top don't have options. It doesn't even have to be so extreme. It could be someone only slightly lower class within the same city. The possibility just doesn't cross their minds due to pride and prejudice. Supermajority don't think it's an option to marry down or marry someone shorter.

Theirs are upper class complaints.

This is also why I find it funny when some people complain about hypergamy in the West and then I later see some of the same people apotheosizing Asian women. By its most standard definition, hypergamy just means the act or practice of marrying up, *socioeconomically*. Personally, I don't see much wrong with it as it's a natural consequence when men tend to experience more occupational socioeconomic mobility, but it by far is more commonly and obviously expressed in Asia."

I apologize; I didn't mean to offend. I was trying to make a joke and keep an otherwise gloomy topic lighthearted, but you are correct; it was bad judgement for me to make one at your expense.

Maybe you can try to find a middle ground; something between asking her mom to move into a home or stay with you indefinitely. That may or may not be possible depending on your circumstances, though. From what I can see, all you really need is for her to stop with the criticism. It's a wedge between you and your wife, and if it's left unaddressed, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Did she move in to help with the kid? Is this more of a permanent thing? Or was it that the former sort of turned into the latter? 

&gt;That fact alone (that i question she would immediately pick me) destroys me inside.

Try not to let that bother you too much; it's a natural doubt. If it came down to my wife having to choose her dad or me....I think she would eventually pick me but it would seriously harm our relationship. Ultimatums are usually bad things, especially in a marriage. "

The Snowman

One must have a mind of winter 

To regard the frost and the boughs 

Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;



And have been cold a long time 

To behold the junipers shagged with ice, 

The spruces rough in the distant glitter


Of the January sun; and not to think 

Of any misery in the sound of the wind, 

In the sound of a few leaves,




Which is the sound of the land 

Full of the same wind 

That is blowing in the same bare place



For the listener, who listens in the snow, 

And, nothing himself, beholds 

Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.

A relationship is a relationship, as far as I'm concerned. If someone is in a poly relationship when it's not right for them, then they'll react. In that case, things could have come to a head because they weren't honest with themselves, or they didn't communicate their boundaries or needs.

And the running game is something of a strength for us - we have a big, powerful line and a lot of good backs.  There are some situations where we could be a little less predictable about running - for instance, its been my perception that we always run between the tackles on 2nd and short and never try to take shots downfield - but given the personnel we have I don't think our identity as a run-first team will (or should) change.

I think Roman takes a lot of flak on r/49ers, and I don't know to what extent its justified.  I don't think he's the best OC in the league, but he's also far from the worst OC in the league.

Afterthoughts: 

* This is why ""Mitochondrial Eve"" refers to the most recent common female ancestor of humans. 

* Mitochondrial DNA is maternal because it's copied from the larger egg cell; it's a logistical thing mostly. 

* Finally, the idea of a sperm finishing in first place or second place is a misconception based on a useful but incomplete heuristic: that relatively fit sperm tend to fertilize the egg. In a more detailed view, the egg has a physical barrier that is beaten down by a large number of sperm cells, one of which happens to get lucky and fertilize the egg."

I mean, foundation helps make pretty much anyone look more put together, as long as it's not cakey, but you don't really need to use a ton of foundation. I prefer high coverage foundation, simply because I feel like a super thin layer of that is much nicer looking than a thicker layer of lower coverage foundation. 

Also, if you want a product for acne, you're better off looking to /r/SkincareAddiction. Your foundation shouldn't cause acne, but it's not able to cure it either. 

All that said, I'll say that if you're interested in a mineral foundation, look to Meow Cosmetics, with the warning that the lightest shades are pretty much white. They'll have a color match for you though. I like to put some sort of cream (sunscreen, moisturizer, whatever) that leaves a somewhat sticky feel, so that it helps hold on a powder foundation. 

Also, you might want to try Revlon Colorstay (either for oily/combo skin, or whipped), in Ivory.

javatimes,socialjustice101,1390327973.0,"On the basis of sex, anyway, I think it helps to think that certain traits [very late edit: I meant things like genitals or chromosomes as traits] are correlated with being female or male, but that doesn't encompass the whole of the human population, and there can be a lot of overlap. 
I think part of what is missed is female or male already includes populations under their headings that aren't cis *or* non intersex. 

It's also important to remember that social constructions are real, and often have tons of human history behind them.  And they aren't evil--necessarily, though some are. 

Also, and I bring this up all the time so I will here, gently--I understand why trans people are being used to counter really engrained categories and constructions, but I think cis people would say similar sounding thing about themselves if they had to. Considering cis people generally don't *have* to, it's rather unfair to skewer trans people. For instance I had to have a therapist write me a letter asserting my maleness in binarist, silly terms to get my state to issue an ID that wouldn't out me or cause me problems. It's not language I would have chosen and it's not an activity I would have chosen. But in doing so, I presumably could be criticized for propping up false categories, but we must consider duress as part of this all.

Edit: also please don't think all trans people think calling gender socially constructed is transphobic. I haven't heard that much, but I see where that comes from and can reasonably conclude those people don't speak for the majority of us."

_________

Somehow, things had gone terribly wrong.  
  
The barstool on which I sat did nothing to support the immense weight I felt on my shoulders. I nursed my whiskey, fingers trembling each time I lifted the cool glass to my lips. Nervousness biting at my tender skin and sending chills through my body, I couldn't help but entertain the thoughts nagging at me: *Would Eira believe me? Does she love me enough to understand? Does she love me enough to trust me?* and the big one I had successfully avoided until this moment, *Does she really love me?*  
  
A small chime filled the room as the door swung open and a cooling breeze blew around the tables, smoke quickly filling the empty space on its escape into the streets. In her usual way, she stood frozen in the doorway and searched for a familiar face, eyes connecting with mine as I tipped my glass and gulped the remainder of my drink. She smiled and proceeded my way, drawing attention as she always does though she was too grounded to notice, much less care, which only added to her attractiveness. She was still in her business casual attire, a professional beauty with her soft rose lips and dirty blonde hair that bounced just slightly as she sat next to me.  *You're too good for me*, I thought. As if she'd read my mind, she squeezed my shoulder and gave me a look of adoration before waving the bartender over. ""Feelin' a beer?"" She asked me. I nodded. 
  
""Two MGDs, please."" She said, turning to the bartender and then to her pocket for a tenner. Reaching into my own pocket, I wrapped my fingers around the envelope that I had arranged this date over. The beers delivered, she let her flats slide off of her heels and leaned back in her chair to take a long, slow drink.  ""So, what's the matter honey?""  The look on her face revealed how much she was picking up on; her calm demeanor was only a protective guard against the maelstrom of confusion and angst that swam behind my eyes.  
  
I pulled my hand from my pocket and sat the folded envelope on the table between us. ""**AMERILINE**"" scribbled across the front in big, toddler-like penmanship.  
  
""What's this?"" She asked, a hint of nervousness in her voice as she held the envelope and observed the tattered edges.  
  
""An escape, Eira. A really important one. I need you to trust me."" I mustered, fighting back the urge to let my emotions spill out. I had to stay calm or else how could I expect the same from her?  
  
""But Jon, "" her expression suddenly changing to that of surprise and worry, ""what- what happened?""  
  
I paused, taking in the sight of her, how perfect she looked and how innocent she was. *Why does she have to want* me? *All I've ever been is trouble.* Taking a deep breath and speaking as low as I could manage, ""Eira, I ki-"" the words got stuck in my throat and I choked, my face getting hotter by the second.  
  
Eira reached over with her unoccupied hand and rested it on mine, ""Jon, please, it's okay. I trust you. Whatever you think I'm going to do or say... I love you, no matter what. What's going on?""  
  
*I trust you. I love you, no matter what.*  
  
I took a swig of my beer to wet my dry throat, ""Eira, I killed a man today."" I thought the weight would lift at that moment, provide me with some semblance of release that would get my mind back in order. Instead, I felt the weight gain mass, making it harder to breathe and even harder to control my trembling. I set the foaming beer down and waited for hell to open up and suck me into the flaming chasm.  
  
Instead, Eira took a deep breath and opened up the envelope. Inside were two plane tickets to Norway and three thousand dollars cash. She looked back up at me, her expression impossible to read.  
  
""We have to leave tomorrow. If you choose not to come with me... I don't know what I'll do without you, but I can understand.""  
  
""I'll go with you Jon,"" She countered, putting the tickets back into the envelope, ""but I just have one request... tell me everything. Give me one question. That's all I want."" The sound of her voice made it clear how much she cared, and all I wanted to do was make her happy. Her reaction was more than I could have asked for.  I nodded in agreement, gesturing for her to follow me as I stood up and walked towards the back door leading to the patio.  
  
Outside in the fresh air it was a little easier to breathe, the scattered puzzle of events piecing themselves together to form a gruesome memory I wished I could erase. We sat down on a wood bench, each lighting up a cigarette and taking a few drags before I spoke, ""It wasn't supposed to happen the way that it did... I went over to his place. The guy I offed. He owed me some money... a lot of money, Eira. A lot of *our* money. But when I went over there, he acted as if our agreement had never taken place. 'What do you mean *your* money?' he said. That five grand I said was stolen from our bank - I pulled that. I loaned it to him because I thought he truly needed it more than us. He said he'd pay it back with his incoming check in a couple months, a lump he was supposed to get for something or another. Gave me a whole spout about how he really messed up with some people and if I could just help him this once, he'd make sure to make it right. I mean, shit, I felt for him. I know what it's like to be down and out, a victim of the world and your own stupid mistakes.""  
  
I stopped to take a drag of my cigarette, Eira's eyes watching me closely and taking in every detail, waiting patiently for me to continue.  
  
""So, I waited, and waited, wanting to hold onto the small hope that he'd be just another day. The call never came through. Needless to say, I was wrong. The thought of looking you in the face and admitting my mistake scared me then... but that's all water under the bridge now. I went over to his place and banged on the door, but no one answered. I could hear the television on inside, an occasional cough echoing against the door. So.. I kicked it in. I stormed in and he must have known I'd be coming because he was prepared. A gun, all shiny and engraved in Norsk, dangling in his hand as he looked me up and down. I asked him where the money was and all he could do was laugh, 'what do you mean *your* money?' he said and aimed the gun at me. I swear I blacked out then. All I can remember is coming to with the gun tight in my hand - the smell of gunpowder in the air and blood sprayed across everything. I didn't know what to do, Eira. I took the gun and left, bought the tickets, and now we're here. All I have to do is toss this gun, and we're gone.""  
  
I pulled the gun from my shoulder bag, just to show her something that may express the reality of the situation.  
  
Eira looked up at me, horror and shock washing over her face as she spoke, ""Jon... this is my Dad's gun."" "

**Zero** is, I think, coming to a close on the first arc or sorts, which is damn exciting. Been loving this series.

**The Walking Dead** is my last issue with this series. I don’t care. I don’t care. I. Just. Don’t. Care. Whatever.

**Hawkeye** is back to Clint, which is damn exciting since I flipping miss him, even if it’s only been an issue since we last saw him.

And **All New X-Factor**… was kind of weird for me. I need #2 to be great. I don’t want this series to flop given that issue #1 was very… off. Maybe it’s a bigger story. Maybe it was the art. I just can’t tell at this point.

Finally, **Cable &amp; X-Factor** is coming close to it’s end, and I’m okay with that. It’s been fun, and Forge + Doctor Nemesis will always be a great pair of scientists/crazy people. It’s sort of Sad to see the series go, though.

Woman's perspective here - yeah, this was probably a mistake. It would be a problem for me, if I was her, that you didn't take her at her word and you didn't have any good reason not to. She was really busy with school, which you acknowledge is valid. Honestly, when I'm super busy and overstressed, sleep can be a #1 priority because I can't function efficiently without it. Do I go on a date or do I get some sleep so I can complete everything that needs to be done? I get some sleep!

I'm not sure why you thought she was just blowing you off, but surprising her by showing up at her door to test your theory was the wrong way to do it. The fact that she gave you a specific time to reschedule suggests she really wasn't blowing you off, but not believing her when she gave you a legitimate reason for cancelling and then showing up at her home unannounced may have creeped her out. If I was in that position, I wouldn't have proceeded either. Too busy to take the risk of getting involved with a guy that sent me a red flag so soon after getting to know him. "

I imagine Bandos players might have had more fun though, at least sometimes. Since Armadyl was the easier choice, there were not all that many players on that side that took the ""war"" part all that seriously. Most just did construction xp, with a small handful actually bothering with the PvP and convoy aspects. By contrast, it was quite impressive to see Bandos underdogs occasionally rise up into large, powerful groups that could decimate Armadyl players and rapidly take over nodes. On the lower population servers, Armadyl players seemed to have a pretty decent stranglehold, but at least on World 2 I regularly saw Bandos players kick ass due to most of the Armadyl people mass constructing on the same one or two nodes and not really caring about defense."

As for the other comments, no the kid didn't lunge but he was still walking towards the officer with a deadly weapon after being told to stop more than enough times. This officer wasn't unpredictable he did exactly what he was supposed to do.

phantom_eclipse,MakeupAddiction,1390328520.0,"So, I'm subscribed to both Ipsy and Birchbox. I actually like them both a lot- but I actively take the time to review everything and make sure I have my preferences right on the site so I don't get shit items (even then though, I sometimes get shit =/).

Anyway, I like ipsy a lot because it's sort of a grab bag of random cosmetics that I wouldn't have tried before. This month seemed more skincare oriented, but last month I got a Nyx lipstick I adore, an eyeshadow trio I'm still using, some fake lashes that seem fun but I haven't used yet, etc. I basically like it because it's a bunch of shit I wouldn't otherwise get that I can try out and see if I like or not.

Birchbox is a bit different. It seems like it's usually a big sample of something, then smaller samples. I got a face wash I absolutely love this month, but last month I didn't get anything I particularly liked. I do feel like Birchbox is geared more toward skincare *in general* than ipsy, versus cosmetics. I also get a fuckton more perfume samples from birchbox. You also get like.. snack or tea samples in your birchbox usually. Two months ago I got a full sized ghirardelli bar in my box, which I was like fuck yeah and immediately ate it. But this month I got tea which was ok. 

They're both kinda hit or miss, but for $10 I feel like they're both fun sample services."

scatmanbynight,QuotesPorn,1390328637.0,"From Goodreads (re: His unpublished book being at 4.7 stars, December 4, 2013):

&gt;Patrick added:
While it's nice to see folks out there giving this book five stars, and in some cases even reviewing it, I'll admit that I'm kinda puzzled. 

&gt; After thinking it over for a while, I've realized there's only one explanation for this:

&gt; Time travelers love my books. 

&gt; This is strangely reassuring, as it lets me know that, eventually, I do finish my revisions, and the book turns out good enough so that I still have a following out there in the big ball of wibbly-wobbly.... timey-wimey.... stuff that I like to think of as the future. 

&gt; I would also like to say, future readers, that I appreciate your taking time to read and review my books. It's really flattering knowing that even with time-travel technology at your disposal, you'd rather read my stuff and mention it here on goodreads, rather than, say, hunt dinosaurs, get drunk with da Vinci, or pants Hitler. 

&gt; Secondly, I'd like to say if you're The Doctor, and you're reading this, I would make an excellent traveling companion. I know you normally tend to hang out with pretty young women and robot dogs. And honestly? I respect that. 

&gt; Still, I bring certain things to the table. Humor, witty banter, and a beard that will allow me to blend in seamlessly with any pre-industrial Germanic culture. I'm also an excellent kisser and play a mean game of Settlers of Catan. 

&gt; Just throwing it out there. 

&gt; Lastly, if any of you happen to have a digital copy of the book you'd like to e-mail me, I'd really appreciate it. I'd love to see the five-star version of the book, because right now, **the one I'm toiling away at is about a three an a half-in my opinion. It would save me a lot of work if I could just skip to the end and publish it.** 

&gt; Sincerely yours,

He is the type of guy who can't have sex and enjoy it when he's super stressed out. 

We had a serious discussion about everything and worked our problems out. We've been having sex at least a few times a week since our conversation and things couldn't be better.

e.g. If you're facing a lane that has a lot of burst magical damage, you can max out your Flame Guard before your SoF/Searing Chains, since you can't get last hits if you're dead most of the time, right?

If your enemies need to get close to you to efficiently kill you (Ursa, Naix, etc.), put a single point in Searing Chains (so if they get close, you have a means of escape before you get your lvl 6) and max out your SoF, so you can efficiently outlane them.

Also, keep in mind that keeping your Ulti to lvl1 (meaning using it only as a means to initiate/escape) depends on the situation, because sometimes you need the stats more so than the Ulti damage."

silverionmox,changemyview,1390328883.0,"&gt; If an action reduces injustice, how is it unjust?

It's very limited, just a bandaid on a wooden leg:

- you can only compensate for known discrimination

- you need a separate program for every set of characteristics that might be discriminated against

- you haven't changed the discrimination itself; worse, you have reinforced and justified it

So it's mostly something like giving alms to the poor.

&gt;If they wouldn't discriminate anymore, affirmative action would be unnecessary and wrong.

That's the problem: if the discrimination situation changes, then your programs become gradually unnecessary and wrong.

&gt;I am not aware of any racist intention that has a calculation of leveling the playing field behind. Do you have any evidence of that?

If affirmative action does level the playing field, then the people that discriminate have to *keep* discriminating, or they would put their in-group at a relative disadvantage."

They also said that when FMCs are 'swooping', they move exactly like Jump MCs with the following exceptions listed in the BRB (Pg 49), which does not omit the ability to Deep Strike.


Deployment is not movement at all. That is explicitly stated in reference to scouts/etc.  I'd like to know where they're getting 99% of that information, Because it's almost entirely wrong.

&gt;you declare if a model is deep striking before you declare how it's moving (i.e., before the first turn),

Correct me if I am wrong, But this sounds as if it implies that the model is already on the board. If that is the case, then there it CANNOT deep strike. 

&gt;therefore if it can move as a Jump MC or not

The answer is not. Jump MCs function entirely differently than FMCs

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1390329278.0,"How are your finances? What kind of lease options are available at your boyfriend's place?

How about this: assuming you can afford it, when your lease is up, move to his neighborhood. Maybe even get an open apartment *in* his complex, since you say that's an option. He, in turn, can go to his landlord and point out that he is a long-term tenant who has (hopefully!) been a good tenant and always paid his rent on time, and would they be willing to offer him a 6-month lease instead of a year lease? If he can secure a 6 month lease, then you two will be much closer for those six months, your relationship will have time to mature without too much pressure too soon, and you two can move in together in your new place at the year mark.

Or, alternatively, you can see if you can find a place in his neighborhood on a month to month or six month lease, and he can ask his landlord if they would be willing to transfer a year lease to another unit in his complex at the six month mark. Then, when you two have been together a year, you can leave your place and you both can move into a new unit in his complex without breaking his lease. Most landlords will be willing to work with good tenants who have a good record with them.

Point being, you have more options than you think you do. However, you should think very seriously about some of the advice other posters have given you. I think you're crazy to want an engagement *before* sharing expenses and a life with someone. In my opinion, marriage should only be considered after you both have proven your compatibility with each other on all serious issues. 

Finally, why on earth are you living out of a suitcase if your relationship is so serious with him? You should have some of your stuff (or duplicates) at his place if marriage is really on the table for you two. "

billybadhands,AskReddit,1390329284.0,"My business partner and I were going through a tough period. We didn't know each other very well when we first decided to go into business together. He was younger than me and still fairly immature. I needed him though. He possessed several contacts, and had experience in the market that I was trying to enter. Our relationship was very rocky throughout. There were good times when we made considerable money together, but we also went through plenty of troubled times. Even though I didn't always show it to him I did appreciate him and in some ways loved him like he was my own son. He also looked up to me.

There was one particular bad period where past addiction issues resurfaced with him. I was going through some pretty crazy personal stuff at the time too. Between the business and family I didn't have much extra time or attention, and I wasn't there for my partner in a way that I should have been. His habits were having an increasingly negative effect on our business to the point where it was questionable if we could keep going. 

Despite all of the issues I was able to work out a deal with a new client that, if it went smoothly, would take our little business to the next level and open up many new doors.
I desperately needed his help to close this deal. It materialized really quickly and we had to pull everything together for the client on a very tight deadline. I tried to get in touch with him for hours with no response. He had just dropped off the face of the planet at the most inopportune time and would not respond to any calls or text. I was scrambling.
Finally, I decided that I would go to his house and see if he was there. If I had to I would confront him. 

Even in his current mindset, if I could just talk to him, he would understand the importance of this deal and work with me. I just needed to find him. I drove to his house, and thankfully his car was in the driveway. I knocked and rang the bell several times with no answer. I pounded on the door and yelled his name. Nothing. I walked around the house to see if there was an open window that I could look in. I went to the back and onto his patio. I could hear music playing in the adjacent room. His bedroom. I thought he might just be passed out in there. The door on the patio went directly into his bedroom. I started knocking. I knock repeatedly. Very hard, very loud knocks. I yelled for him, but I heard nothing except the music playing. 

At this point I was desperate. I would do anything to close this deal. I needed the money for my family. We had some stacked up medical bills and this deal would help me get out of that debt and hopefully move forward.

In a moment of panic, as I felt the deal slipping through my fingers, I decided to break into his house. I broke through the back door and gained entry. There he was. Passed out in a drug induced haze with his junkie girlfriend that was responsible for his recent relapse and decent back into his addiction. Drugs and paraphernalia were scattered everywhere. Empty booze bottles lined the nightstands and dresser. I tried to wake him with no success; shaking him and yelling his name repeatedly. He was passed out cold, and there was no way he was going to be able to help close this deal.

There I stood. Completely screwed. I saw everything that I had worked for evaporating in front of me. His girlfriend started to stir. She was passed out wasted too, and began to make a gagging sound. I realized that she was vomiting and because of her position it was running back into her esophagus and she was asphyxiating. I reached down to help her, but I paused. This girl had come into my parter's life, screwed him up, and as a result, the business that I risked so much to start was collapsing in front of my eyes. I'm not sure what took over me standing in that bedroom that afternoon, but I just watched. I watched her choke and gag. At the time I felt no guilt. She was to blame for what was happening, so I was eliminating a major threat to my livelihood. She put herself into the situation and knew the risks of her actions and decisions. I stood and watched until she stopped breathing.

I ended up closing that deal, but just barely. That deal is what made our business take off, but it was ultimately not to be. We made it big and then we imploded. Through it all I lost my family, many friends, and came very close to dying. But that is another story..."

&gt;Mid morning snack: Apple x2

&gt;Lunch: Whole grain sandwich, usually slice cheese x1 and tofurkey slice x1

&gt;Mid afternoon snack Carrots x2

**All of these are high in carbs and sugar though better than other options.**


&gt;Dinner: Whatever my dad makes. Usually 800-1000 calories

&gt;I only eat when I'm hungry and with the exception of dinner, I stop eating when I'm full. Dinner is a bit harder for me to stop eating because my dad doesn't make really healthy food and he gives me too much (though we've bought a couple of vegetarian cookbooks and he's trying).

**Imo, count calories, get a food scale, and eat more protein or rather a bigger breakfast including protein if possible (egg, beans, legumes, milk, soymilk, lentils, tofu, seeds, nuts, nut butter, meat substitutes, sun dried tomatoes, soybeans,  seaweed, mushrooms, spinach, or look up other food high in protein. Perhaps have whole grain toast with peanut butter with your banana or nuts with your breakfast).**

I rather be challenged intellectually than hear another rant about how X movie failed the Bechtel test.  

2. If the stuff people your age talk about sounds pretentious then you might be hanging out with the wrong crowd, people in all age groups say pretentious horseshit.

malliebee,weddingplanning,1390329381.0,"We cannot afford an open bar either and frankly it just didnt seem worth it to me, for our wedding because it is going to be on the smaller scale we are thinking of just getting a few pony kegs for the beer drinkers, then having an alcoholic punch/sangria for those who do not want beer (like me for example because I have a beer allergy would prefer to have a boozy punch) and we will also be having non-alcoholic options like water, ice tea, and lemonade since our wedding will be outside in May I thought it would be refreshing. We are just going to have the stuff on hand to keep making more to refill the glass containers we are serving/keeping it cold in. I found that this option is MUCH more budget savvy. A lot of this will depend on your venue but I wouldnt worry so much about keeping things so 21 vs not 21 as far as drinking goes...its a wedding people want to celebrate and have fun, Im sure someone under 21 is going to drink at some point and if its that big of a deal just make it clear that you do not want those underage to be drinking at your wedding their parents and stuff should be the ones responsible for that not you.

rising_son,Guitar,1390329415.0,"&gt; What are the best pickups for a strat these days? I'm not necessarily looking for a SRV like tone, but I am looking for hot pickups with great mids, lots of quack, and noiseless if at all possible.

I use a set of DiMarzio Area 61's in my strat, they have reasonably good output, great tone they sound like singlecoils but are punchier which suits how I play, and they are noiseless too.

&gt; Is there a tonal difference between rosewood and maple fretboards?

Personally I believe there is, I find guitars with Maple boards to be brighter sounding while Rosewood produces a rounder sound (source I have 3 strats with different fingerboards).

&gt; Roller nuts - good or bad when it comes to tone? I've yet to play a guitar with one, well, at least I haven't in about 5 years. I don't remember honestly.

I honestly have no experience with these at all, I like the principle of them though, and that they eliminate friction at the nut. Doesn't bother me though as I am not a trem. user, and block all my strats up at the back with 5 springs.

&gt; What is the difference tonally between ash and alder? I've not had the chance to find an ash body on an instrument in ages, so I've forgotten what they were like.

Alder is supposedly warmer sounding in the Mid range, and Ash is a brighter sound.

&gt; What after market mods should I consider for a Fender strat? Should I built my own, with a Fender supplied neck? 

You can do pretty much anything you can possibly think of, many many custom made parts are available for Strats, they are the most common modding guitar. You could consider a Hipshot Xtender (drop D switch) Tremsetter (helps balance the trem and regulates the point it returns to after it is used, thus helping tuning stability). There are various wiring mods you can do... phase switching... ""Magnificent Seven"" wiring (gives you the Neck and Bridge ""Tele"" style setting. This can be added with a push/pull pot or a separate switch of your choice."

Fernis_,AskMen,1390329450.0,"1. Most important thing to realize is that most people who are “qualified” to give relationship advices are adults who have some experience with relationships, that have been in few short ones and few long term ones, that had some bad experience, some good ones and are probably in a serious relationship right now. On the other hand most people who look for advice are either young (teenagers, in college) or are somehow emotionally underdeveloped. Mature people appreciate honesty and being straight forward. They don’t have time for games, It’s either one way or another. I cannot see a thirty year old guy waiting for a six months to ask out a single colleague form work, because he’s afraid “she will say no and people will laugh at me”. For high school kids, it’s a valid concern. If I expect something form my SO, I cannot imagine not telling her that straight… it would be just childish. On the other hand I fully understand how this might not be a good idea for a couple of 17 year olds.

2. Advices on Reddit are given to strangers by strangers, based on very short description of the problem. While giving advice here, you don’t know person in question, you do not now people involved, you don’t know their relationship, any details (which are often the most important things), you don’t know what was not told or what was overlooked by the person asking the question. So the only real way to say something helpful is to show most logical, easy solution. Which is too general in most situation.
In real life you give an advice not only to a person that you already know, but usually you see the situation by yourself and your perspective is usually completely different then the persons youre helping. That’s why your judgment is a lot better and the advice is “personalized” not a vague tip for some theoretical problem.

duckface08,travel,1390329525.0,"I agree with this. I'm 25 myself and have to strike a balance between having fun and being financially responsible. I live on my own with no family nearby. I'm sure my parents would send me money, but they're retired themselves and are living on the little that they managed to save over the years, so they don't have much. If I get sick or injured, how am I going to work? How am I going to pay rent and the bills? So I maintain a certain amount of money in my savings just in case because that fear is always at the back of my mind.

Plus, now that I see my parents retired, I know that managing one's money is tricky business. My dad once told me how he might outlive his savings, which may very well happen. His parents were active into their 90's, after all, and so far, my dad's health is good. Even my mom's side of the family, despite diabetes running in the family, seem to be overall healthy, and her parents also lived into their 90's. When I grow old, all the Baby Boomers will have probably sucked the system dry, so what financial security will the future government be able to afford me?

However, I've worked with many people who have gotten very sick or badly injured in their 20's and 30's, so I know that not everyone gets to grow old. Hell, my wake-up call was when I had to wrap the body of a 30-year-old man who died of cancer. As a result, I know I have to spend my time wisely, too.

So there's definitely a balance that needs to be struck. I take a trip somewhere once or twice a year and work in-between. My money I earn first goes to rent/bills and other necessities (i.e. food) while trying to keep costs down as much as possible, and then to savings (I have a TFSA and an RRSP). Anything else leftover can be used for fun things, like traveling! Usually, after about a year of this, I can afford a trip somewhere."

First, a lot of people don't keep up on their skills. This drastically lowers their employability once they leave a job. 

Second, a lot of developers become managers. A lot of developers move into sales. A lot of developers start their own companies. None of these count as ""developer"" anymore, but they didn't disappear or give up on their skills. 

Third, and this is a *big* one, if you work as a consultant, according to government stats, you're not a ""developer"". So even though I wrote software for a major gaming company that every person who bought the console will use, because I did it as a consultant, I didn't count as a developer. 

If you keep up with your skills and treat your job like a doctor or lawyer would (go to conferences, speak at conferences, contribute to open source, always be learning), you won't have a problem being employed after 40. 

The big but here is an easy one -- money. The young kids will work for 50k/yr and be happy, but at 40, you might be used to 100k/yr+. That's not a deal breaker, but you must be able to demonstrate that you're worth twice as much as the other guy. Then imagine you want to keep making 200k/yr. How do you continually prove that value?

So after a day of exploring Dijon, France we change into some more relaxed evening wear and hit the city. It was getting close to laundry day so my options were limited. I ended up wearing blue jeans, a USA t-shirt and a red &amp; blue bandana. I'm also 6'4 250lbs man, so I always stood out there anyway, but that night you could see from a mile away I was American.

Well, as it should happen, we come to find out that particular evening was Bastille Day. For those of you not familiar with French holidays, it's basically like our 4th of July. Not exactly the evening you want to be the world largest American beacon. After a few bars we found one place where the bartended laughed when he saw me instead of a snarl. Along with the red wine I was drinking, he starts making me this drink called absinthe.

I don't remember much of the evening after that, but my cousin swears to me that I was walking around the bar singing the French national anthem (which I'm not familiar with) and filling up everyone's glass with wine while yelling ""Viva la France!"" at random intervals. It seems the staff and patrons enjoyed this so much they let me drink for free the rest of the evening."

**Waking Mars** is an amazing game. If you like calm, interesting, relaxing science fiction, don't hesitate and buy this shit. I am playing it on my phone for now but the Steam version is much better. The ending is pretty cool as well.

""Waking Mars follows a single astronaut, a pioneer for the Chinese space program, as he explores the subterranean caverns of the red planet. There are two other characters –– a computer hacker type and a bumbling AI companion –– who fill in gaps in the game’s story through radio chatter. But largely, the game is about isolation. Even after players encounter and begin to cultivate the strange, plant-like life forms that cling to the cavern walls, it’s always clear that the astronaut is a long way from safety."" (wired)"

viceywicey,explainlikeimfive,1390329661.0,"There are a lot of variables that determine how fast or slow your metabolism is:

**1.  Sleep Schedule** - how many hours do you sleep per day on average?

**2.  Genetics** - do you parents have fast metabolisms?  At what rate did their metabolisms decline as they got older?

**3.  Diet** - are you eating the necessary amount of calories and macronutrients (the chemical elements your body requires for you to function).

**4.  Weight** - 130 lbs

**5.  Height** - Unknown?

**6.  Age** - 19.  You are at or nearing your peak metabolic rate.

**6.  Muscle Density/BMI/Body fat %** - what is the composition of your body?  Do you have high muscle density (this would increase your dietary demands) or low muscle density?  Body mass index is not the greatest indicator?  Body fat% - how much fat do you have compared to your overall mass?

A simple answer would be pure speculation.  I have not yet come across any significant research that suggests a gamer has a higher metabolism as opposed to someone who has all the same dietary and exercise habits (assuming genetics are relatively similar).  The only speculation would be to ""suggest"" that gaming uses a lot of your higher cognitive abilities for longer periods of time: pattern recognition, the ability to hold several sequences in your memory, constant visual stimulation/searching, knowledge representation in space, etc.).  This ""might"" put a higher demand on the brain (which uses up more energy than rest of your body) which in turn increases your metabolic demands."

I certainly wouldn't say that he's been given much of a chance in the role he was bought for by the current management. Leverkusen and the second half of Swansea both were extremely promising but there was no consistent building from there (or we'll see after this sunderland game). He did have a game with Giggs in the midfield where he kept dropping too deep to do much and yeah in that game he was totally meh.

2) It's not your job to a) clean the house, b) make the meals, c) raise any young siblings, d) drive a drunk parent home from the bars (again, looking at you alcoholic ndad).  Sure you should help and pick up after yourself but it's not your job to be the parent.

3) You are not a Spawn of Satan if you're not perfect.  Everyone gets a C or D on a test at times, gets in trouble at school, argues with an adult, gets moody.  It's not the end of the world.

4) You deserve respect, respect goes both ways in any relationship be it friends, SOs, or parent-child.

5) YOU MATTER!  You deserve love without any strings attached. 

6) Don't be ashamed, or feel guilty, for going NC or LC with the N's in your life.  It's no different than getting any other toxic substance out of your environment, it's just that society tells us we should 'honor our mother and father'.

Mobility, recovery, nutrition, ""state of the sport(s)"" discussions, specific assistance work for main/big lifts.

**2:** I'm in ""offseason"" mode, so I'm just trying to get hooge. Training is based around hitting rep PRs on front squat, incline bench, and weighted chins. Staying away from competition lifts. Lots of high-volume assistance work. I have an ""arms day."" Also, intense prehab/rehab for my shoulders. I haven't squatted with straight bar on my back for months.

South Ossetiya, the area which was attacked by Georgia, was ""given"" to Georgia by Stalin, populated mostly by the Ossetians, who felt that they were historically oppressed by Georgians, therefore not willing to be a part of the modern independent Georgia.  They seceded in 1990, and majority of the population took the citizenship of the Russian Federation, since their republic is not recognized by majority of the world community.  So Russia was effectively protecting its citizens after Georgians attacked the peace keepers and bombed the civilian population.

Just because you have money and property, doesn't mean you can govern it. If he can't learn to govern it, he will lose it to people who are better at governing it, so he has to earn his right to govern it too. And since most of the richest in world are not inheritors, it proves this.

Money isn't everything and doesn't bring happiness. Money can be curse as much as it can be a gift. As long as you keep giving money the power it has, you are playing the same game they are, except you are nowhere near their level, you are not as good at it as they are, and this is where your ""injustice"" and ""inequality"" stems from."

Well, I told my doctor I am on a ketogenic diet, but the doctor seemed to just nod and glide right past it.  It's possible that the sentence didn't really penetrate fully into the doctors thinking.  In addition, I didn't take the test for a week after I met with the doctor so by the time they wrote the note they could have easily forgotten that I was already dieting in a low-carb fashion.

&gt; Read up on it and have some conviction before you start changing stuff. Know why you are changing whatever it is you are changing.

No fears, I'm not really going to change much for now.  I'm losing weight and doing great.  After a few months I will go in and test again, this time I'll ask for the NMR test.

Thanks for all the advice!"

Vroonkle,explainlikeimfive,1390330120.0,"I have been trying to find a very interesting article I read that explains this very well, and I'm sorry to say: An hour of search has brought me nothing. 

Here is a summary, from my best recollection, of the finer points of the article: 
Internet companies hold an oligopoly on a nearly *necessary* service in the United States. This means that the market share is limited to a low number of the strongest companies. An example of similar market holding would be auto manufacturing. The high cost of entering the market is set by these companies to discourage startups from ""messing up"" the profitability of the market.

Short digression for the sake of explanation: Now, we all know the most desireable position to be in is to make the most money for the least amount of work. In terms of an individual, this means a high wage with low hours; for a large corporation would be to provide a service for a high fee with the lowest possible cost to run.

To return to the point, these companies are all very happy to meet a ""standard"" that is mutually agreed upon, and to conform to a general price bracket. Let us just say for simplicity's sake, that you can get 10mpbs connection speeds (sustained) for 75-90 dollars a month. As long as all of the major service providers adhere to these requirements: They are never required to improve their service, or lower their fees. There are several localized acceptions to the rule; a small company could develop a network in one (or a few) towns, without garnering the attention of the giants. The largest issue that causes consumer unrest, is the way these companies advertise (to acquire new subcribers, sometimes laterally) high peak speeds, and introductory rates. Ultimately, they need only make good on the initial requirements of our hypothetical 10mpbs for 75-90 dollars a month. This will keep customers in a state of comfortable complacency. 

The greatest palpable example of this, to me, is the tiered speeds offered by all major providers.  Almost every provider offers the same ranges of connection speed for roughly the same cost. 

That is the conclusion of my summary. My only notable observation from this would be the birth of Google Fiber. Google Fiber seems to be interested in ""changing the game"", but only time will tell what their true intentions are. As we all know, Google sees a different value in having access to our homes, browsing habits, and internet usage. The loss of profits from subscribers may be offset by the valuable intel that they are able to gather about us as individual targets for advertising. It also may be that they just wish to become the biggest. If they could set the tone for internet service provisions: They could control the cost of entry for new companies, the rates which subscribers can expect, and the network performance we must all accept.

Ingenium21,AskMen,1390330265.0,"Honestly the best advice is to stop giving a shit.  

You are asking out every girl in the classroom?  So what if it makes you look like a creeper.  We are all looking for a companion, how else are you going to find her?  Dating isn't some complex mystery puzzle, you just have to be earnest with yourself and the person you are interacting with.  

I agree, if you're not good at this you're probably going to come off as odd, but that's what practice is for.  And no I'm not saying become a PUA dork, just keep practicing talking to people, be flirty, and see what people like and don't like.  Eventually you're going to find someone who likes you and finds the things you say funny or engaging.  

Example 1, is pretty dead on though, I don't usually sit down with my gf's, draft up a contract, and have it notarized.  We usually try stuff and see what we like and don't like.  Also usually fetishes come up after a few drinks, unless you have a really weird one like, ""I want to vomit on my partner"".  You are gonna have a tough time finding that special someone. 

But honestly, just don't give a shit, It took all the guts in the world yesterday for me to ask a girl out, and she said yes.  I went through all that social stigma shit in my head, and was like, ""when is the right time"" and blah blah blah, in the end I was like fuck it, and asked her.  You miss all the shots you don't take.

(disclaimer: as a general rule, don't shit where you eat, but if you do happen to find someone you work with whom you connect with, tread VERY SLOWLY.  So DO give a shit when it comes to that situation)"

We're talking about conscious actions people have to take. I think that yes, by and large, everybody deals with jealousy, and we all have issues with communication and honesty. I think that some people are naturally better at these things than others, but ultimately, they're just learned skills where all can have some type of competency.

I just can't buy that polyamory would be the problem if there's just as much a likelihood that the same person not communicating clearly or being honest with their needs and emotions would also wreck a monogamous relationship. Unless you want to say that the person in question is just not fit for a relationship, period. "

steve496,49ers,1390330351.0,"I agree - Frank Gore probably has at most one year left in him.  But we also have Kendall Hunter for another year, who has shown signs of being able to be a starter in this league.  And Lattimore definitely has a chance to grow into that, and while James is not a workhorse back he has the potential to contribute significantly as a change of pace back.  Point being: we have 4 backs that I'd be comfortable lining up behind Kap and giving 5+ touches a game.

Meanwhile, on the receiving side, we have... Crabtree and Patton.  We have other receivers under contract - Baldwin, Jacobs and the just-signed Wylie - but none of them have shown the ability to start in this league.  We're a little better at TE - Davis is outstanding, and McDonald is developing - but the point remains, we are not particularly deep with receivers right now.  And while I imagine that fixing that will be an offseason priority, I still think our RB depth - Gore or no Gore - is likely to be better than our receiving depth next season."
IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,minnesotavikings,1390330353.0,"Our last FA experience was a bit of an outlier in the Spielman era. I would expect a return to normalcy, that is, low-risk, low-profile guys who Spielman thinks have some upside.

If I was in control, I'd look to shore up DT, LB, or CB before the draft. There are some intriguing guys out there. Linval Joseph at DT? Verner, DRC, Grimes, Aqib Talib, or Vontae Davis at CB, perhaps?

Linebacker is thin in this year's FA. CB is deep though. A lot of great talent should be available for relatively cheap considering how many guys are available. But that probably won't happen because NFL logic and we'll end up paying $10M+ for a corner."

hezec,LearnFinnish,1390330374.0,"Not bad at all. Actually sounds like a poem!

Translating poetry is obviously not an absolute task with only one correct result, but to get a better idea and to practice my own (nonexistent) Chinese skills I'll look up the characters here.

鹿柴  
deer | firewood  
空山不見人  
empty, void, sky | mountain, hill | not | see, seem, contact | human  
但聞人語響  
but, only | smell, hear, news | human | language, speech | sound, echo  
返景入深林  
return | scene, situation | enter, in | deep, dark, difficult | wood, forest  
復照靑苔上  
again, reply | light up, reflect, contrast | (no apparent meaning alone) | moss | above

The first thing I'll note is that *tunturi* is a very specific type of mountain – eroded, treeless, usually very gently sloping. The original character, 山 *shān*, is quite generic and can refer to almost any kind of elevated terrain, but the reference to the forest would make some other word more appropriate. *Vuori* or *kukkula* might work, *mäki* feels too bland.

*Kuullaan* sounds a bit too 'active' to my ear, like there has to be a human acting even though the previous line just established that there are no humans in the scene. *Kuuluu* would be a better form here, although *kaikuu* could also work.

*Laskun*? ""Of the descent""? *Laskee* would be the verb form. All the translations of 返 *făn* I could find refer to returning or repeating rather than descending, so *palaa* might also work. The existing translations seem to agree it's ""slanting"" or ""at an angle"", though, so maybe the word's meaning has just recently shifted in Chinese.

I'll agree with you that *loistaa* sounds better than *loistavat*. It's a more natural form of the word, though not quite grammatically correct here."

RJ815,runescape,1390330400.0,"Bandos seemed like the pretty clear ""bad guy"" or at least ""badder guy"" in this event, whereas both Saradomin and Zamorak were questionable in the first world event (though of course people could still argue Zamorak was the badder guy there). I was pleasantly surprised to see that the dialogue for Bandos NPCs focused around power as authority and philosophizing about how Armadyl going to war is hypocritical, but ultimately Armadyl still seemed like the morally better choice whether you think he is hypocritical or fighting a ""just war"". I wonder about my allegiance now after the end though, as the finale cutscene makes it seem like Armadyl may be a bit of a ""fallen angel"" now. Him taking up Bandos' mace and unnecessarily brutalizing him with it seems heavily symbolic of how he is becoming more like him now. It seems Bandos may have won either way.

I'm curious to see how Brassica versus Marimbo will play out, because ""good"" versus ""evil"" is less clear-cut there than all the previous world events.

On a more superficial note, I preferred the aesthetics of the Armadyl armor and NPCs and encampment and all that stuff. All the Bandos stuff basically screams ""evil and brutish"", whereas a lot of Armadyl stuff was more ""beautiful""."

ask your friends about it. especially since you are meeting most of your dates through them, they may be able to get feedback from some of the guys so you know what you are doing or are not doing that's turning them off.

lol and being 20 and saying that someone 30 is ""a lot older"" makes me laugh. yeah, i know, it seems that way, but 10 years age difference is not that much, even at 20 -- unless you are trying to date a 10 yo LOL! if the 30 yo is acting like they are 20, then that might be part of the problem too. a 30 yo should be more mature and settled into work-life, so maybe you are dating men who are only attracted to you because you are younger and so are not really looking to have a serious relationship.

So anyway, I wake up in my bed, and everything seemed normal. Outside the noise of cab drivers arguing with drunken passengers and traffic at a standstill even at three AM. A little further away I heard a siren, until it faded out of hearing. Standard for New York City at Three AM on a Monday morning. But I still couldn't shake the feeling that something was seriously wrong.

I rolled over, and froze. Along my wall was a shadow that *most definitely did not belong there*. This was my apartment, and it had been for the last six months. I planned to live here for another five years, which was roughly when I expected another raise at work. But as anyone who has lived in an apartment will tell you, you learn what belongs where really, really fast. And this did not belong there.

My hand instinctively crept toward the baseball bat I kept near my bedside. My psycho ex-girlfriend still had the key to my apartment, I was sure of it. She'd nearly stabbed me in the subway this morning, with a real knife, which of course had resulted in her being hauled off by some NYPD kicking and screaming, until they filled her with 50,000 volts. Now that was fun to watch.

Er right, back to the creepy shadow on the wall of my room. I reached to the left of my bed's headboard and clicked the lamp on. And guess who I fucking saw? GUESS WHO I FUCKING SAW IN MY FUCKING ROOM?! THE MOTHERFUCKING GRIM REAPER THAT'S WHO! I did what any rational human being would do, and sat there gibbering like a psychopath. 

He sorta... looked at me. Not that I could *see* his eyes you understand. That hood covered his head. But it moved just so slightly, so I could tell he was looking at me. And I swear to you I have never been more scared before that moment. He was Death, literally. Not in the way that some man will call a movie character Death Incarnate, I was standing, or sitting rather, in front of the actual Grim Reaper. Death himself.

I squeaked out a ""Hello"", but it came out a lot higher pitched than that. Death looked at me, and now I could tell he was amused. Death was laughing at me. When he spoke, his voice was rich. Far richer than any man I have ever heard. My first thought, absurdly, was that Morgan Freeman had dressed as the Grim Reaper and was in my room.

""Well Hello John.""

Then he pulled back his hood. His face was gorgeous. I'm not talking about Brad Pitt gorgeous, it was ethereal. Beyond the beauty of a mortal, and the strangest thing was that I was attracted to it. I consider myself to be a pretty normal guy. I had a girlfriend (the crazy one on the Subway, remember?) a job, and while I had experimented a little in College and really had no objection to two guys getting married, I also was straight. And I really really was attracted to Death.

When I say that it sounds weird doesn't it? Or at least, I was attracted to him until his face... flickered. It changed, briefly, for a bare instant his face was a grinning skull. The true face of death.

""Wh-what do you want?"" *Well that was brilliant. Stammer a question at Death himself. What could he* possibly *want?*

""Well, you are supposed to be dead John."" His lips were just a heartbeat off of his words, but the disconnect was there. I suppose I just stared at him for a bit because he continued.

""Your Girlfriend, on the Subway. Those cops aren't charging her with Assault with a Deadly Weapon, they're charging her with Murder in the First Degree."" 

I think the cliched thing to do would be to say I don't know which surprised me more, that I was dead or that Death was a lawyer. But lets be honest, the dead thing kinda overpowered the lawyer thing. 

""But, no, but, I, but, I'm here! Not dead! I'm *here!*"" Death nodded pleasantly, which in of itself was really creepy.

""No John, you're not here. Your spirit is here. Your body is in the morgue. Now John, I need you to come with me.""

""Where are you taking me?""

""To court.""

""What?!""

""Your moral sins will be weighed against your heart, and you will either go to an eternal paradise of your own making or a hell of your own making."" 

""What?""

Death sighed.

""You got the judged part, right?""

""Yes.""

""Well, who knows what you love more than you do? Thus your subconscious creates your heaven. Or, it creates your punishment. It won't be eternal, probably. Did you sneak a genocide in while I wasn't looking?"" Death laughed.

I blinked, and all of a sudden I was in a court room. As you may have guessed, I didn't sneak in a genocide while Death was busy. So I got heaven. Which is being a writer, which is why I'm writing this. My first story. Heaven has a cadre of printers and writers who work together to distribute works to the voracious readers up here. I have a contract with Gutenburg himself if you'll believe it.

So... yeah. That's how I died."

That's not saying that you can't judge him? 

Klopp and Fergie are insane man managers. Klopp keeps on building teams with players who perform under him, and you could literally (in the figurative sense!) see Fergie's will embodied on the pitch with 10-15 minutes of bombardment if we were behind. 

Nov-Dec we looked defeated if we were down entering into the last quarter (it's a bit better now but we don't maraud like we did). That was *the* marked difference between this team and last years one. The other thing I noted is how we didnt seem to get much of a half-time boost in the first half of the season. We'd look pretty limp after whatever talk was given. Now we look a side shot of confidence.

At some point, he's responsible for fixing that and getting a side of title winners to look half-way capable of beating the likes of NewCastle, Tottenham and Everton let alone top 4.

I don't know if I buy the public comments in interviews as having anything to do with respect. It would only be notable if they slagged him. It's just unprofessional for them to slag their manager one and two they'll obviously become the new blame pinata for why the team is underperforming."

I charge $300 for a shoot, whereas these guys charge a grand for you to sit in their studio for a few frames.  And surprise!  Most of them are terrible directors.

Study photographs of models.  Keep a tear sheet blog or Pinterest of your favorite looks.  Even watching the photo and video shoots on America's Next Top Model can teach you a lot about modeling.

Rhode,polyamory,1390330890.0,"I can't really help you on reading material, most of what I've read were things I've found here in this subreddit.  I will say though that just knowing about the idea of [compersion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compersion) has helped me a lot.  Sometimes just knowing the name of an idea can be thought-provoking.  

When I was first getting into polyamory, I saw everyone say things like, ""communication is the most important part!""  and all that.  I've come to disagree.  Of course communication is huge and I don't want to downplay that, but to me the most important part is empathy.  

You've got to be able to see things from your partner's perspective, and understand that they're having (or at the very least, trying to have) a positive experience.  Knowing that they're experiencing something good and keeping that knowledge at the forefront of your thoughts sets you up for success.  By empathizing with them, you open the door to good communication.  Internally, emotionally, you're in a good place, so when you go to communicate with your partner, the subject and tone of your communication mirrors that emotional state, even if what you're saying is difficult or awkward.  Your partner is then more likely to receive that communication in a positive manner and respond as such.  

Take empathy out of that process and the whole thing looks different.  If you're feeling jealous and you try to express that to your partner, it's going to come off as negativity, maybe even whiny.  They're going to respond to your negativity with more of the same, and now you're on a downward spiral going tit for tat.  Even if they don't express negativity to you directly, they'll probably resent you a little, or grow tired of communicating with you.  Either way, you're closing the door to future communication.  

That's just my two cents.  I've been messing around with this stuff for about two years now, I still consider myself a novice.  My girlfriend has been dating another guy for about three months now and it's been a really great thing for her and me.  They've had a lot of problems and she's come to me for advice a lot during that time.  I just stay focused on her happiness and give her the best advice I can.  Our communication ends up being really positive, and then not only am I left feeling good about everything when she goes out with him, but she feels more and more comfortable initiating communication with me in the future.  

Sorry, didn't mean to ramble on.... TL;DR: Exercise empathy, restrain your ego, focus on your partner's happiness.    "

Strange to see how American stereotypes have changed. In the 19th century the stereotype was ""Brother Jonathan"", the New England Yankee, pragmatic, somewhat vulgar and acquisitive, lacking the manners and fine sensibilities of Europe. 

In the old Billy Bunter stories from the early 20th century there was an American character, Fisher T. Fish, described by Orwell as ""the money-grubbing American boy"". ""Fisher T. Fish is the old-style stage Yankee (“Waal, I guess”, etc.) dating from a peroid of Anglo-American jealousy"" he says. 

That was how Americans often used to be portrayed in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, in British and European literature. Pragmatic, somewhat gauche, rather given to vulgar commercialisation and the dollar as the be-all and end-all, with exaggerated Yankee mannerisms. 

Americans still seem to me to be rather pragmatic and literalist. They like how-to guides and self help books, and pithy little Franklinesque sayings and proverbs. Their culture war rages between Bible literalists and the crudest of crude materialists. 
On the other hand, they sometimes seem besotted with quite fictional narratives, in which good triumphs over evil, or the wise fool confounds the foolish intellectual, with a generous helping of schmaltz.

Serae,AskWomen,1390330977.0,"People differ in terms of how sex effects their lives.

No doubt there are people who get very clingy after having sex with someone.  There are people who see sex and just fun and don't feel like it makes them closer to someone.  Some people have sex as a bonus to a bond that has already formed.  There are many reasons people have sex and how it emotionally effects them.

Part of growing up is learning about ourselves and our needs.  I was worried I would get really, really attached to someone when I had sex with them.  There are other factors but as a result I only have sex with someone I am already bonded to and have been in a relationship with for quite some time. Sex is a bonus to an already bonded relationship for me.

I assume you haveb't had sex yet, so you don't know how you will react.  I think the most important things is to make sure you want to have sex and that you are ready.  When you do have sex you should have reasonable expectations about that relationship.  Sleeping with someone you have a crush on could complicate matters if they don't feel the same, and vice versa.

Gin. Kind depends on what I have and what I feel like having. These times, I stock and use No. 3 London, Ungava and Bombay Sapphire. I rarely use orange bitters, but when I do, I use Fee Brothers. For vermouth I use Les Folies du Vigneron or Noilly-Prat. 4:1. Extra, extra cold, stirred. Either a lemon peel or a rinced olive (I don't want no brine in my martini)."

Any neighbors around that you could knock on their doors and ask for some work? ANY work? Just tell them things are really tough right now and you need the money for some food and something to do as it is driving you crazy! Also maybe go through the ads and see if there is anyone locally who needs some health care that you and your dad could move in and help and also be handymen kind of guys.

Other than that there are suicide hotlines you might call that could probably actually get you some counseling that you can't afford on your own...that might be of help. I can only imagine how much pressure this is on you.

My only thought other than these is to find someplace that you can volunteer which will keep you busier and occupy your mind and give you some ease.

Usually related to the detonation velocity of the explosive being used. C-4 being a very bristant explosive.) They used to use smokeless powder in grenades in WWI so I think this could be a example of this? Smokeless powder is a low order explosive that deflagrates instead of detonates when unconfined. However, when confined the rate of deflagration is much faster making for a relatively effective explosive device. This means that it does not produce a shock wave that goes faster than the speed of sound so it does not shatter the outer casing of the grenade, but stretches it to the point of failure instead.

This seems like an odd conclusion to jump to.  Shaved heads are pretty common.  

I don't mean to downplay your insecurity, but the problem really is the insecurity around the balding more than the balding itself.  Figure out what you can control, and control it.  Shave it or get a wig if that's going to help your psyche, but there are women out there who love fat guys, skinny guys, bald guys, amputees.  Even Newt Gingrich can get laid.  It's not always about what you look like.  It's about how you make someone feel.  Accept that looks are subjective, and that someone can be attracted to you.

p3ndulum,poker,1390331332.0,"I agree your sentiment with knowing where you're at in a hand, but there also profit to be made by making room for opponents to bet when checked to with hands that they would fold to a bet.

In terms of information in OP's hand in particular, calling a lead bet on the turn could give you the same amount of information having your c-bet flatted on the flop would give you. You also keep the pot small while holding an extremely volnuerabke hand that might still be the best hand.

If villain checks on the turn again, our delayed c-bet takes down the exact same sized lot a flop bet would have won us, while also minimizing the damage we take after c-betting the flop only to be out drawn on the turn.

Also, when you c-bet the flop here, you should be folding to most turn leads considering how many times you'll get out drawn, if you're not behind already, which takes away from the profit that you would be making with th delayed c-bet.

And finally, it is my own personal philosophy to never c-bet the flop on a board full wet/heavy middle cards unless I flop two pair or better. This way, I keep my c-betting frequency balanced just where I like it, and because of how regularly these types of flops help the range if cards just just flatted a single raise before the flop.

You can also out draw a lot of hands that flop better than you a lot by checking back here, adding reinforcement to your hand when more chips finally do start going in."

That is just one example, but I think that alone could be a deal breaker for Canada, especially since they're doing well on their own. They have a large enough economy, and energy resources, that gives them clout in the global arena without being part of a union. "

luculentlady,AskReddit,1390331583.0,"It's not okay to beat your child because you can't reason with stupid. Find better parenting techniques and find better ways to discipline that don't require resorting to violence.

Raising your voice or raising your hand only says you have very little confidence in yourself and the type of parent you are and need to physically beat your child to assert your dominance. That's the only way it will be looked at, that you're  weak.  However, if you grab your child by the shoulders, direct them to face you and speak in a level tone and -direct- them toward the thinking you want then you'll get your point across. You are the parent and they are your child, making them feel the pain of a slap on the behind or the swat of a stick won't get your point across and in fact will develop anger issues in your child.  Now you're teaching them that a good outlet is violence. 

Your kids don't learn from what you say most of the time, they learn from what you do and they love you for who you act like you are not for who you say you are.

After a successful gank bottom lane ADC/jungler will shove the lane into tower as fast as possible to go for dragon. You'll probably get one proc off while shoving, the coin would have given you gold for every minion that died.

5 man grouping to take towers. Your team will just kill the enemy minions as soon as they appear. Coin gives you money for every single one, you most likely won't get a targon proceed off while sieging, especially if you're melee and the enemy is defending. Relic shield has it's place and gives a bit more money, during laning phase. Once laning phase is over the coin will most likely give you more. Your team can't wait for you to last hit that cannon minion and if you're a melee support you probably won't be able to get into range to get it off because the enemy would just kill you.

The question is, what is it that you want to do? I'm assuming CompLing since you're interested in computer science? If that's the case, between computer science and linguistics, you can major in one and minor in the other and it doesn't matter which is which. Though I will say that the more focus on linguistics, the more it'll fall into the realm of computational linguistics, and the more focus on computer science, the more it'll fall into the realm of natural language processing. Either way, you'll probably want an MA or a PhD before you enter the field or your job prospects won't be great. 

If you want to study a foreign language, go for it, but don't overload yourself with work! If I were you, I'd do Japanese and/or Italian as part of your linguistics studies, general undergrad coursework, or just general electives, depending on how your school's curriculum is set up. For me, my linguistics major includes two courses on a less commonly taught language (I'm studying Russian) and two courses in the linguistics of a primary foreign language, which is French for me. It satisfies the foreign language nerd in me, and I'm studying things I love which are all related to the career. 

If I've got you wrong and you want to study something else, though, let me know. I've studied the educational requirements from major schools in various fields related to linguistics, so I'll at least be able to point you in the right place."

Duckylicious,vegetarian,1390331937.0,"I still use them, but with a bad conscience, if that helps :/

I would, for example, never buy a pair of leather pants - people like my parents (who call me an ""extremist"" for being a vegetarian rather than being like them and just eating meat sparingly) would argue that since other people are eating meat, the byproducts are there anyway and we might as well use them. I don't buy this - I try to go by the Golden Rule, so I'm not eating meat because I wish everyone else wasn't eating meat either, and if that were the case, there wouldn't be any leather (unless we start explicitly killing animals for it, which of course I don't want).

At the same time, I do need shoes and I've never seen a store specifically carrying vegan footwear in the places I've lived. I risked ordering boots online once (I generally wouldn't because they're so likely to not fit), but when I originally ordered them from a vegan website, they strung me along for 4 weeks before finally admitting that they were actually out of stock and didn't know when they were going to get them in again. So I settled for Timberlands that do have leather, but at least have a lining of recycled bottles for the eco aspect of it. And some of my jeans came with leather belts in them, which I didn't see the point of throwing away.

Tl;dr I would not buy things I can avoid like leather clothing or wallets, but I sometimes turn a blind eye to things like shoes, in much the same way that I try to stick to vegetarian cheese, wine etc. but will compromise if I can't find anything clearly labelled (which tends to happen a lot in France)."

WinterCharm,apple,1390332028.0,"**Keeping your Battery Healthy**

1. Use the battery every few days. But use it NATURALLY. Discharge to about 40-70% and then plug it back in when you can. Don't overthink it, but just avoid leaving it plugged in all the time, and draining it to zero ALL the time. 

2. Once a month, Drain it from 100% to zero, and then let it go back to 100%. 

3. AVOID leaving it in hot environments (the truck or boot of your car in the middle of a hot summer) Heat damage to batteries is permanent, while cold damage is temporary. Heat damage permanently will reduce your battery capacity. Cold slows down the chemical reactions in batteries, but won't permanently damage them - when the battery warms back up, you'll regain lost capacity. 

For more information, read about this directly from apple: 

* [About Li Ion batteries that Apple uses](http://www.apple.com/batteries/)
* [Information specific to notebook battery care from Apple](http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html)

**Okay, so actual power saving tips in OS X:**

1. run at half brightness, or lower. 
2. turn off bluetooth and Wifi when they aren't being used. 
3. Aggressively close applications - remember that (most) apps don't quit when you click the red x. Be sure to use [Cmd] + [Q] or right click on the dock icon and click ""Quit"" When you're running on battery, you want to use as few apps as possible over any given time. 
4. ~~GET RID OF DROPBOX and Switch to Copy - Dropbox is the most criminally power hungry application I have *EVER* seen, aside from pro apps. For such a tiny utility, it cut my macbook battery in HALF. [Read more here](http://blog.nicoschuele.com/posts/dropbox-will-kill-your-insane-macbook-air-2013-battery)~~ Now a moot point. See Edit.
5. ~~Copy gives you 15 (or 20 GB if you use a referral link - PM me for one, if you want it) and does the same thing Dropbox does, except it also has some great extra features. :) And it only barely sips battery power. I got + 3 hours from uninstalling Dropbox. It really is that bad.~~ Now a moot point. See Edit.  
6. Use the native apple apps - they have support for app nap, and  are generally less power hungry. Even if chrome is your preferred browser, use safari on the go, as it uses much less power. 

**EDIT:** 
The first line in the Dropbox article that you linked to in #4 now reads:
UPDATE: Since this article was written, the Dropbox client was updated and it doesn't drain the battery anymore.

Armagetiton,news,1390332075.0,"Everyone within 1 mile of the blast was instantly killed at Nagasaki, where Fat Boy was dropped. A 1 mile radius of Fat Boy's detonation was defined as ""total destruction"", everything was vaporized. The very center of a nuclear blast is over 10 times the temperature of the surface of the sun, over 100 million degrees celsius. That is so fucking hot that no type of matter can even exist in a typical state as it is stripped of all it's electrons and becomes ionized plasma. The shockwave is nearly the speed of sound, and the outer limits of the shockwave exceed 1000 degrees celsius, which will go well beyond the 1 mile radius. The shockwave itself is produced by the rapid expansion of heat that was created instantly. *It will strip the flesh off your bones instantly inside the 1 mile radius*. Outside of that, if you stood there watching it come in at 0.2 miles per second (assuming you somehow weren't blinded by the flash instantly), everything would feel normal until the shockwave hit you, at which point you will be knocked unconscious instantly and never wake up.

If we are talking about people dying slowly, we are talking about people over 3 miles outside the impact, but that's not what I said. I said *ground zero*, defined as the closest point of detonation, and I said people outside of ground zero would have wished they were there."

Street legal is a weird thing.  It's not hard to have a vehicle that is street legal in most states.  Seat belts, head lights, tail lights, that's about it.  But a vehicle that is sold new must meet certain standards, like airbags and crumple zones, etc.  
You can buy a HUMMER, that was made by GM.  This is not the military version, even though it does look the same.  My issue here is the cost, they run $30K for a beat up one, up to $50K+ for one in good shape.  
The real hurdle is that unlike old Jeeps and Deuce and halfs, which can be purchased as surplus, HMMWV's cannot be sold surplus.  They run them into the ground and when they decide they don't want to fix it anymore they either sell them to an ally nation or they crush them.  
They changed the laws about getting rid of some items a few years back, HMMWV's are one of the items.

Most casters can't prevent the riders from getting shot to shit, and they don't have hunter so they can't charge from behind forests. I could spend 8 points on vanilla thralls with out Tartarus or even their UA and get a lot of bang for my buck in the right situation, and putting 11 points of riders in the same situation would probably be a pretty big blunder. Conversely I could spring for BLT and their UA and use them as frontline troops but I'd get screwed by terrain if I didn't pony up another 2 points for Saxon, whereas 11 points of Riders can accomplish flanking or smacking key frontline targets (or ripping through a screen with impacts) at a relative discount.

(It just appears) So it had at most 60 miles to travel like you said, there was enough time for Onoki to act, as well as the alliance to try and escape (probably 20-25 seconds from appearance, till the 1st meteor is stopped) Also of note there was no tail from entry. Ergo that meteor was probably going 120 Miles per minute, actual meteorites go much faster especially if they enter from the day side as Madara's did (since the earth is still moving forward to smack it)  

&gt;Meteors enter the atmosphere at speeds ranging from **11 km/sec (25,000 mph), to 72 km/sec (160,000 mph!)**. When the meteoroid collides with air molecules, its high level of kinetic energy rapidly ionizes and excites a long, thin column of atmospheric atoms along the meteoroid’s path, creating a flash of light visible from the ground below. This column, or meteor trail, is usually less than 1 meter in diameter, but will be tens of kilometers long.

&gt;The wide range in meteoroid speeds is caused partly by the fact that the Earth itself is traveling at about **30 km/sec (67,000 mph)** as it revolves around the sun. On the evening side, or trailing edge of the Earth, meteoroids must catch up to the earth’s atmosphere to cause a meteor, and tend to be slow. On the morning side, or leading edge of the earth, meteoroids can collide head-on with the atmosphere and tend to be fast.

So even at the slowest meteor that would be real, there would have only been 5 seconds before impact, ergo madara's is going very slow comparatively. (it is probably just in freefall) The damage would probably be mostly what was seen, local impact and a much smaller earthquake than shown. "

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390332288.0,"After I grad school, I tried to find a job on the East Coast and couldn't. So I moved home. Then I decided to work on my conversion and reached out to all the Conservative and Reconstructionist rabbis in the area. Didn't like the Reconstructionist theology, and didn't like all the Conservative rabbis, but when I found my rabbi... omg, I knew he was ""the one"".

So I asked him to convert me. And he did. And then I stuck around. And a few years later, I asked him to marry us. And he did.  And now he's leaving, and that finally feels ""freeing"" in a way, to move onto my new Jewish life.

I am not happy Jewishly in the Bay Area. Way too much assimilated, intermarried, non-serious, non-educated Jews who don't separate their politics from their religion. It's not where I want to raise my future kids.

I think we're seriously considering moving to two other areas in the next few years. One looks strongly more appealing to me Jewishly/weather-wise/culture-wise, the other looks strongly more appealing to me financially.  We will see where we end up."

He has had previous relationships that failed and he has learned from them. He won't make the same mistakes again, but you might. You need to be patient with each other.

Hopefully he has a good job and can manage his money. That will allow you to go on vacations and do fun things that you won't be able to do with a 24 year old guy. Just roll with it and don't get let money get in the way of your relationship.

You might be a bit of a trophy, so embrace it. Stay in shape, be intelligent and mature. No matter what age you are, its always good to impress your SOs friends with how awesome you are. 

I could easily see myself with a 24 year old. I would want someone that is intelligent, attractive and a little mature for her age. I am a little immature for my age, so we would probably meet in the middle. Good luck"

captain_craptain,worldnews,1390332861.0,"Your point is terribly made and you only sit at positive 9 karma on that comment because the majority of the people here are too stupid to realize that your point is moot and that you actually contradicted yourself.  So yes, you are comparing apples and oranges.  That is all the response you deserve but I will break it down for you since you seem to feel all triumphant about some shitty analogy.  

Person with cancer mocks a person with MS and says their problems are trivial.  - *So we have two people with life changing diseases and one is gloating to the other over who has it worse.  Cancer threatens one's life directly and lowers the quality of life by quite a bit as well.  MS does not typically threaten one's life but only reduces the quality of life.  Also there are varying degrees of MS from the severe to the relatively mild.  So even though the cancer patient is an asshole for trying to diminish the MS patients suffering, he isn't necessarily wrong as MS patients quite often go on to live long fulfilling lives and cancer patients often do not.*  **Also the big kicker here is the people don't have to do or not do anything in order to get sick, this shit just happens, even to non-smokers etc.  In other words their actions hold little bearing on their situation.**  

&gt;People who make 10,000 dollars a year are not guys making 180,000 dollars a year and comparing the two is quite frankly a joke.  

*Well you're English sucks quite frankly, but let's move on.*  ""People who make 10K a year are not people who make 180K a year.""  **WOW!  Did you arrive at that conclusion all on your own?!?**  *No shit dude, and comparing them is not a joke.  It's quite a realistic thing to compare actually.  Take for example the level of education and what type of home life each individual had.  Chances are that the 10K a year guy was a bad student, a fuck-up in school and has minimum requirements in order to be useful for a job therefore he makes minimum wage.  He made his fucking bed, he can sleep in it.  While the  180K a year guy most likely had good schooling where he paid attention and learned how to be a valuable employee.  He has the skills that pay the bills unlike whiny McBitcherson pulling in only 10K/year.*  **I don't give two shits about the guy who didn't pay attention in school and now can't get ahead.  BUT I also don't give two shits about the guy who makes 180K/year and still can't balance his budget and afford groceries because he is not living within his means.  Both need to learn to live within their means and no we can't just pass a law to raise minimum wage to some ridiculous amount because that will throw off everyone.  Maybe dumb assholes like 10K/year guy should have stayed in school, learned a trade or not spend so much on cell phones cable tv and other unnecessary items.**  

So why are they apples and oranges?  Because you cannot control whether or not you get sick.  You can control your future in terms of being employable and worth a decent salary.  If you choose to not take those things seriously then get used to flipping burgers or punching a time-clock.  I have no sympathy for you, your children maybe, but not you."
bugzrrad,pics,1390332862.0,Reddit: the land of pretentious nonsense 
avantvernacular,FeMRADebates,1390332863.0,"Your entire argument is dependent on a litany of false conclusions, beginning with your reinterpretation of the word kyriarchy to suit your conclusion, (rather than the other way around, as it should be). You decide that kyriarchy is dependent on class because it supports your argument, and that we should accept this decision as truth. Never at any point do you question why the given definition doesn't include a dependence on class, but rather add that condition because it makes your argument better, facts be damned. 

Then you double down on your false assumption with another: that kyriarchy is somehow dependent on these bio-thruths, which you conclude based on apparently the same nothing you interpreted definitions from. 

But here's where it gets really good: 

&gt; When you say that gender inequalities existed prior to kyriarchy, that actually supports my argument 
 
Except I never actually said that. I was very deliberate in being sure I did not say that because it was both incorrect and irrelevant. Yet somehow, here you say it.  The entire point depends on the fact that you either didn't read or simply didn't understand anything I said. 

You changed you evidence to fit your conclusion, deliberately misquoted other comments,  and your entire argument boils down to: ""I'm right  because I want to be; accept my conclusions as fact.""

Selling all of this would result in a net loss to humanity as everything is transferred from public accessibility to private collections.

Also, the Catholic Church is not a monolithic corporation, both in terms of finances and command chain. The pope can't sell Notre Dame de Paris and cash the check, for example - only the Archbishop of Paris has that authority. Each diocese essentially acts as a separate business unit.

And like /u/Chazhoosier pointed out, clerics aren't sipping out of fancy chalices and wearing liturgical vestments for a night on the town. Most priests live pretty modest lives, and deacons rarely draw enough to live on from the Church. Even most bishops live simpler than you'd think."

namer98,Judaism,1390332906.0,"I live in Baltimore. 

How I ended up here: In college, my wife's parents moved to Baltimore. When she graduated grad school, she didn't have a job then, and followed. When I graduated college, I followed a few months later. 

We both really like the Baltimore community. It is in a large suburb, but near a large city. This means it has the resources and population requirements for a fully functional community. But it also has grass. This is also why Pittsburgh was a top choice for job hunting. The main problem we have with Baltimore is that the local politics are skewed to the right, for what look like complex reasons. But this isn't a problem. The problem is the lack of school choices, hashkafically. There is LWMO, and Bais Yaakov and rightwards. 

My in laws are here. It is also a cheap place to live. Being near a city and a commute to DC being possible, there is a good job market. The Jewish community itself is actually rather diverse. I have so many choices for shuls, it was a bit intimidating at first.

Sometimes too, prices aren't easy to figure out.  Stuff you wouldn't think was very expensive can be surprisingly so because it's rare.

Sabu113,reddevils,1390333071.0,"Which spurs game? I thought he got shifted into the 10 in the last 15 of the spurs game this month about 3/4 minutes before the red card?  The match that always seems to sum it up in my mind is the Everton game where he got switch out wide 15/18 minutes in just as Everton got that goal in favor of Welbeck top/Rooney behind.

I would disagree that getting muscled off is a big problem. It is a problem contending on the left but overall I think 9/10 he uses his technique and the momentum of the ball to do work for him. He's pretty handy in tight spaces- especially if he's not being expected to skip past players ala Januzaj but rather pass it around them in a more Arsenal-esque fashion. The biggest problem on the left is that he's just not involved enough in play consistently. He'll never be a left wing player that we couldn't find an improvement on. Definitely one of his failings is that he's not a versatile player. 

As for getting the debating going, let's see at Sunderland. He was damn good against Swansea in the second half. He needs minutes to make the challenge for the slot. (Also can't wait til Nani decides to be fit again. Nani Januzaj are smart enough to make runs for through balls and it should be gorgeous.)"

I don't know, I've never been blocked to my knowledge. However, she made it pretty clear to me that she doesn't wish further contact. I'll respect her choice. She already did me a favor by replying in the first place, even if the content wasn't something I particularly enjoyed. 

&gt; By the way, you started this very response with me criticizing my word choice! I immediately wanted to tell you to fuck off.You went through her profile in a meticulous fashion compared to how others do. Which is read the content of the profile and then send a message. I honestly believe you don't know how you are coming across. Curiosity is great, but you're not trying to recruit her for a job.

Guh. I wasn't trying to critique your word choice, I was saying that I do what I normally do and that I didn't think it was that meticulous. Don't others look at available questions? I mean, how do you know if they are worth a message if you don't? 

&gt; In all seriousness, are you somewhere on the spectrum? Because if you are, you can learn to do OKC in a more appropriate, even formulaic, way that will not unintentionally offend people.

No, I'm just an ass. It comes across more charming in meatspace than it does in cyberspace. Also, I think I'm rather jaded.

TokisCodpieceBZZZ,fatpeoplestories,1390333190.0,"Part of it is a respect thing.  If I see you gasping for breath and sweating buckets after climbing a single flight of stairs, complaining about a sore back and painful knees and clothes that don't fit, ignoring the doctor's suggestion to lose weight, well, you know there's a problem and you refuse to do anything about it.  I'm not going to waste my time on someone who would rather complain about their problems than try to solve them, whether they're a size 3 or a size 30.  Those people rarely have anything positive to add to any social interaction.  On the other hand, a person who's really heavy and either a.) doesn't complain or preferably b.) tries to fix the problem, is much easier to be friends with.  Even if that person has insulin resistance and a bad thyroid, and they have a hard time losing weight, the honest effort makes a huge difference.

Another important aspect is *health.*  When I date, it's with the hope that I'll find something long-term.  I don't want to be tied down to someone who won't support my newfound efforts to be healthy, because some days my self-control hangs by a thread.  I don't want to have to take care of someone with a heart condition, or someone who's lost a foot to diabetes, just because they never learned to take care of themselves.  I don't want to become an early widow for the same reason.  If something unpreventable happens - cancer, an infection, an accident - then that's life, and I can probably deal with that.  Hell, I tend to go for older guys, so I know the whole ""having to take care of him"" bit is probably in my future.  But I am not going to pick up after someone else's poor life decisions."

One thing, if you don't mind, I would like to address as best I can. The exaggerated mannerisms. It is truly a phenomenon that is hard to nail down but, I have noticed myself that it exists in two specific places: One would be the ""older"" generation of gay men. I am going to say 50+. For those guys, I think it was a matter of growing up in an entirely different climate. One where there was tons more discrimination,danger and isolation. I feel it was adopted, in a way to be ""seen"", to be known, to be out, to be visible, to give a fuck you to people. But again, it was a very different time. Those guys were watching their friends and loved ones literally dying around them, which I think kicked up the ""proud"" thing several notches. When you feel ignored or unworthy, you may go to extremes to get attention for yourself.

The other group I notice is very young, newly out gay men. Again, I think it is similar, they NEED to be identified, they need validation. They struggled to come out, often to dire consequences and they need it to be known. This usually subsides over time. Same thing with lesbians who feel they need to cut their hair or dressed more masculine. We all want to be seen and not ignored and I think for younger/newly out folks, these traits they feel they have to show, subside with time. Hell, I am 40 and I rocked rainbow stickers on my car, had all kinds of rainbow crap, when I first came out. Today, I no longer feel the need to identify myself in those ways. 

Again, it is hard to accept things that you don't understand but, understanding can make all the difference.

Google, Microsoft, Dell, Oracle, and Pfizer are all in the top 10 employers in Ireland. This was not an innocent mistake on Ireland's part being exploited by large evil American multinationals. Ireland's tax and corporate structure laws are deliberately structured to benefit Ireland. 

I have to give the Guardian a lot of credit for publishing Snowden's documents, but their overwhelming bias in other areas, specifically involving the US, makes it difficult to read.

Also, I'm pretty positive that I spelled Neutrogena incorrectly but I'm too lazy to walk into my bathroom to check the label. 

If I have particularly dry areas on my face, I put a very thin layer of Aquaphor lotion over them. My daughter's pediatrician recommend Aquaphor for her dry face and I figured it was worth a shot on my dry areas as well. 

This routine has been working out pretty well for me over the past few weeks. 

A primer would probably also help. I wouldn't recommend an oil-free formula. Also, not Porefessional. But a decent primer would lay down a good foundation for your makeup to go over.

by_a_pyre_light,gaming,1390333449.0,"&gt; it wasnt more powerfull

Well, at least you've come to your senses and agreed on that. The GC used a 485 MHz IBM PowerPC chip, whereas the Xbox used a 733MHz Pentium 3 chip. I don't think I need to tell you the Pentium 3 smoked PowerPC chips. 
The GPU was also far more powerful, being based on the single most powerful gaming PC GPU available at the time, the GeForce 3, and being the *only* console with DirectX8 compatibility and features.

&gt; it was just easier to make games look better, the way it handle Shaders/Textures

Also incorrect. As mentioned, the Xbox used the revolutionary GeForce 3 GPU, with additional shader features that came from DX8, that weren't available to the other two consoles. So, the GPU had raw power and additional features the GameCube just couldn't touch. 

&gt; but the GCN had a diffrent way of handling shaders that required less power, but it didnt loose it on how the game looked.

I'm sorry, but I'm calling bullshit. I'll need a credible source to even consider that argument.

&gt; The entire ""What machine was stronger/looked better"" was a complete mess thanks to the arcitecture, Dev kits and the way they used their powers...

Also pretty much wrong. Remember how the Xbox 360 was the easiest to develop for this past generation because it used off-the-shelf parts and a Windows XP kernel? Well, the original Xbox used even less-custom parts, and it was based on Windows 98/ME, with DirectX 8. It was essentially a gaming PC in a compact form. In fact, one might even consider it the first SteamBox, before Steam existed. 

The name alone, ""Xbox"", came from its internal development as a ""DirectX box"". It would be easy to develop for the Xbox using standard computer programming languages, and then port it over. Much more efficient than developing for the GameCube, especially given what we know of Japan's support of third party developers and their messy dev kits.

Here are the point guards that averages around 5 rebounds: Westbrook, Wade, Lowry.

Here are the point guards with more than 13.7 PPG that Rondo posted: Westbrook, Curry, Irving, Wade, Parker, Ellis, Lillard, Deron Williams, John Wall, Walker, Holiday, Jennings, CP3, Lawson, Crawford, Dragic, Nelson, Cnley, Teague, Sessions, Hill, Lou Williams, Felton, Vasquez, IT2.

I'm not even going to bother naming point guards with higher 3PT/G than Rondo: There were 55 of them.

Here are the point guards that has more than Rondo's 1.8 steals/g: CP3, Rubio, Conley, Ellis, Walker, Wade

Blocks..: 20 PG's posted better blk/g than Rondo.

FT%..: His 64.5% FT% is the lowest amongst all of the Point Guards you can imagine.

TO/G: Rondo is highest at 3.9. Other PG's averaged at 2.5-3.3.

Just because he posts double doubles, it doesn't mean that he is an outstanding guard.

Again this is why I think Rondo is overrated. Everyone goes like OMG HE POSTS DOUBLE DOUBLES WITH 5 REBOUNDS PER GAME!!! Cool, you got 3 out of 9Cats. Let's say 4 out of 9 with his steals.  What are you gonna do about the rest of the categories?"

ANewMachine615,badhistory,1390333561.0,"&gt;I think (not a historian but will defer to you all) that the 2nd amendment wasn't written for this reason. It is my understanding that the 2nd amendment was written to protect the newly formed States because it explicitly states ""a well regulated militia""

Not a historian, but a lawyer. What you have to understand about the Constitution is that many of its sections were drafted intentionally broadly, ultimately allowing for many different interpretations. This lead to some later arguments, and continues today (see the debate over how strong the [unitary executive power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_executive_theory) of Article II is). The Constitution was, in a lot of ways, more what would pass than what would be ideal. This extends to the Bill of Rights, as well. The Second Amendment is one of those that admits of two clearly competing interpretations, and different framers of the Amendment will defend it on different grounds. The best we can point to is recent Supreme Court decisions, which support an individual right to bear and keep arms, as opposed to any tie to the militia.

Further, let's presume you're right, and that the Second Amendment wasn't written for that reason. Saying that the Second Amendment doesn't recognize something doesn't mean it's not a right -- it doesn't even really comment on it. There are plenty of things many consider fundamental human rights (say, reproductive choice) that may have been secondary or unconsidered by the Founders. The fact that they failed to include it means little for any modern debate on the topic."

And this does not mean you are still in love with them or that you are somehow untruthful to you current partner. This just means, what you felt towards your ex back then, was real.

No one is saying that you are still in love with those girls. If you would be, you would know it and would not need a Reddit to tell you this. But the feelings you described clearly show that you still care about them on some level. While the love part of your feelings is gone, the part that says that you’re responsible for them, you should protect, help and aid in need is still present. That’s fine, it means you are a good person. But for your sake you should break this, otherwise you will be never able to close that part of your past and focus on your current and future feelings.

satan-says-meow,Stretched,1390333752.0,"Apparently every lobe is too thin here. Even when a lobe is perfectly healthy, the advice is to downsize and stretch back up. Downsizing is a good idea but not every lobe is too thin. Also, there is such a thing as a lobe being too thick and having to pay extra for plugs/tunnels with larger wearing surface. Also, everyone should take their time but a lot of people take that to an extreme. I have figured out that I can stretch roughly 2mm every 2 months by listening to my body but that to a few people on this subreddit, it's a sin to stretch any faster than once every 3 months. Yes, it took me 1 year to stretch to 1/2 and to all who think I am wrong, I have fairly healthy lobes, not too thin, no blowout, no tears. The only stretching guide I have ever read that I think is really good is Pauly Unstoppable's guide which says you need to wait at least a month between stretches which is a pretty good estimate. Some people take 4 years to reach 2g, some take 6 months. If their lobes are healthy, they are doing what is right for their body.

* Yes, it's extremely hard to get the good items. Yes, some players cheat to get them. But that's what all ARPGs are all about. You play, slowly building your character, ever hoping that one cool drop, that one lucky orb, etc. Personally I hate trading too but just the slot machine farming aspect is lots of fun.

-Scavenger hunts. Takes planning but even a really simple one can be really fun for kids. 

-Bake cookies. Use cookie cutters and let the kids decorate them with icing and sprinkles. For true pros, bake bread and let the kids make the dough into fun shapes. 

-Crafts, clay, paper dolls, beads. You can find lots of cheap ideas online.

-Make a board game (for older kids)

-Take them roller skating/ice skating

-For older kids, look up simple science experiments you can do at home. 

-One of my favorite things ever was when my parents would give me tests, like spelling or math tests. I know I was probably an abnormal kid, but it might appeal to other kids if they like school.

Illivah,AskReddit,1390334198.0,"I figure if you were to divide american clothes into 3 categories: manual work, casual, and fancy. Manual work clothes are designed to handle being dirty, crappy, and ugly. It's OK, no one care about those clothes. Casual clothes are cleaner, more comfortable, and happy. But when they get torn, stained, stretched, and otherwise ruined, well I guess they become work clothes. 

So you only have the fancy clothes left, and there just isn't enough reason to wear those. Family parties? no way -they'll get ruined and you'll be out of place. Clubs? just not practical or worth the money. Work? only if your boss forces you to wear them for appearance sake. A decent suit costs money, might not fit you for 10 years, is hot, and often just a little too tight. You gotta have a good reason to wear those. "

by_a_pyre_light,gaming,1390334216.0,"Oh really? I guess one lone dev obviously speaks from much more experience than the myriad of other devs that have publicly stated what we've all known for a long time: the Wii U is underpowered compared to the Xbox 360 and PS4, and even has some deficiencies vs. the last gen products. 

&gt; ""“It’s largely a hardware thing,” Bethesda VP of PR Pete Hines told Joystiq at QuakeCon

&gt; ""...while the Wii U is supposed to be next-gen. But as we know, the graphical and processing capabilities of the Wii U are closer to the 360 and PS3 than they are the One and PS4.

&gt; ""it’s an obvious problem when people are just not making games for your system because you physically cannot play their titles without an incredible amount of downscaling work on their end.""

in regards to the early dev kits being poor, which is what I stated, that was pulled from the tell-all by the big Third Party developer, on Digital Foundry: http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-secret-developers-wii-u-the-inside-story

&gt; ""So a basic comparison/calculation makes the Wii U look, on paper at least, significantly slower than an Xbox 360 in terms of raw CPU. This point was raised in the meeting, but the Nintendo representatives dismissed it saying that the ""low power consumption was more important to the overall design goals""

&gt; ""The almost universal answer was, ""I like the new controller, but the CPU looks a bit underpowered"".'

&gt; ""Former Vigil dev sounds off on Wii U, says it’s “a $400 Xbox 360 seven years late”

einTier,IAmA,1390334217.0,"Well, tires are always an issue.  I'm going to eat up tires and money no matter what I drive.  I try not to think about it. 

But where most people lose their money is in depreciation.  I like to buy cars that have already depreciated a significant amount.  For example, my Cayman S was an $80,000 car off the lot.  It was nicely optioned, but when it was sold to me, those options don't tend to be listed in any NADA book and dealers generally don't know what they're looking at.  I did my research and ended up getting a car that was a year old and had 3,000 miles on it for $50k -- a savings of $30k for just a few miles.  Of course, this means being able to do things like spot Porsche's full leather interior from photos.  It's a $5,000 option, but since every Porsche has leather, very few know it's worth more.  For the record, on that option, you're looking for stitching along the top of the inner door panel.  Only the full leather interiors have it.   All high end cars are *filled* with stupid options like this. 

In the case of the Tesla, I picked up a demo model.  It had 10k miles on it, but it's titled like a new car and has a warranty that's extended to negate those additional miles.  They offered me enough off the current purchase price that coupled with the $7500 back from the federal government, I'm reasonably sure I can drive the car for a year, sell it, and not lose any money.   I had originally intended to buy the car in April, but it was such a good deal on exactly the configuration I wanted that I couldn't say no.  I plan to drive it for a year and re-evaluate my purchase. 

One of the cars that's been on my short list for a few years is the Mercedes Benz SL65 AMG.  It was a $200,000 car that can routinely be [found in the mid-40's](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mercedes-Benz-SL-Class-SL65-AMG-2005-mercedes-benz-sl-65-amg-designo-62-k-miles-pr-/141156607793?forcerrptr=true&amp;hash=item20dd96e731&amp;item=141156607793&amp;pt=US_Cars_Trucks) if you don't mind driving an 8 year old car.  It's a pretty serious business car with more horsepower and torque than a Dodge Viper.  The prices are holding steady too, so you can probably drive one for a year and suffer very little depreciation.  You'll have to be careful and buy the right one and it'll help if you know cars and can spot potential problems before they're expensive problems.  I wouldn't own one long term, but I could have a nice year long fling. 

That's kind of what I mean.  I do a lot of research on the car and I'm willing to wait a long time for the right car to come along at the right price.  There's been dozens of cars I've entertained buying over the years but never did because the right one never happened and something different caught my eye.  You've also got to be ready to move when the right one does show up and you have to know it when you see it.   Rarely does the car you're wanting to buy come along at exactly the right time. "

TioTaba,summonerschool,1390334309.0,"Any support with hard CC will do against Leona.

Every time I go against a Leona I pick Lulu, and I can shut down 100% of her engages by playing reactively. I pick Lulu because I'm more confident with her, but you can have the same effect playing Thresh, Nami, Morgana and even Lux.

The thing is, in all those cases, you know exactly where Leona will land, so it's hard to miss your skillshots. And if you stop her on her tracks, her power is cut by 90%

As for Karma, I think it works, but it's a skill match up. It will take some time before her stun lands on Leona, and you may not have that time. If I were the Leona, I'd focus you as Karma instead of the ADC. Same goes for Annie.

The issue with Leona in the current meta is that shutting her down on laning phase doesn't hurt her so much anymore. She can get back on her feet with the gold items and be the teamfight beast that she is. You can always play reactively and focus her on teamfights, but most of the times you will be focusing someone else.

**EDIT**

In any case, no matter what you pick, the key to beat her in the laning phase is to always watch your position. Always stay behind your minions and take vision control on the side brushes. If you manage to get regular ganks from your jungler, it will be great. She doesn't have much cc for a 3v2 and even after 6 that CC is not completely reliable.

Happiness is not the absence of negative feelings.

Getting rid of all negative feelings does not produce happiness.

I am not someone who naturally thinks about being happy, or happiness being important. It simply does not occur to me that anything besides contentment should be sought out, unless pleasure or happiness is inherently necessary to complete that task.

I had no idea, for years, that happiness should, or even could, be a priority in life.  I spent all my time managing my life to provide basic necessities, reduce/eliminate anxiety, keep my human needs met.

I was not unhappy. But neither was I happy. I was content.

I stayed content much as you described in this post.

Then I met my rather hedonist husband.  And although he had all sorts of problems, and struggled with basic things I had totally covered, he was by far the happiest person I had ever met.

He went out of his way, constantly, to seek out and experience things that made him happy. And so he was.

I learned from him. I have also become a happy person, despite things like setbacks and struggles. And I do it, not be seeking to minimize all negative things, but by purposefully creating happy moments as often as possible.

pakap,technology,1390334432.0,"&gt; I don't pay them any Bitcoin tax.

As soon as you start making any kind of big purchases with your off-the-book gains, you'll get caught. Even if bitcoin was totally untraceable, like cash, it will only get you so far before you start to need to either launder it or pay income tax on it to be able to use it.

It's just like cash money. The fact that individual exchanges of money are basically untraceable is an old problem for tax enforcement. It's how the drug trade (the first killer app for Bitcoin) can function.

It could mean that a lot of transactions will become untaxable, like buying something relatively cheap over the Internet. That might hurt the US tax base a little. But really, you already can live completely off the books if you want to, and I think it's already enough of a PITA that most people will continue to avoid it, by and large, even if Bitcoin sees  mass adoption."

soitcause,AskMen,1390334561.0,"Yeah, this is bullshit. I'm not self-loathing. I don't wish I weren't black. I don't dislike black people. 

What I *do* dislike is when people of ""my"" culture try to claim unilateral solidarity of the entire race without acknowledging the vast range of experiences we have in 2014. Being black isn't ""who I am,"" it's one of thousands of variables that have made me into the person I am today and the way I view the world. AFAIK there is no other ethnic group in this country that so staunchly holds onto tired tropes in order to retain group unity. I respect my grandparents and their generation more than words can express for living through segregation and helping build the world I live in today. Truly. But it's not 1967 anymore. If ""black culture"" (which at this point is almost as stupid as trying to claim ""white culture""; the lives of upper middle class black people in Atlanta is nothing like that of poor black people in Arkansas) wants me to inherit its legacy, it needs to learn how to change with the times. 

I recently saw [this](http://www.americanpromise.org/) documentary on the experience of two black kids in NYC attending elite prep schools and afterward had a chance to go to an open discussion with the directors. Like most kids, the two boys featured had to deal with loneliness, growing up and balancing the expectations of their parents with their personal desires. And yet, every response to a question (from a mostly black audience) had to do with needing to ""teach"" our generation about our past so that we can have strong ties with other black people. That kind of baseless solidarity doesn't forge strong communities, nor does it help us transition into a society that's becoming more and more diverse at its upper echelons. Why must the dialogue focus on preserving the past rather than acknowledging that, in many places, young black people don't have to deal with [nearly as much] racism and their experiences with white people are *vastly* different than those of their parents?

Seriously, though. There are black people who hate other black people. But do recognize that there is a huge difference between those people and those of us who are annoyed with the insistence on perpetuating a culture that is disillusioned with the times. Who I am and where I'm from is important, but don't assume that I hold those things more important than other aspects of my life."

hezec,LearnFinnish,1390334644.0,"&gt; My goal was actually to say ""auringon laskun"", but I couldn't fit in ""auringon"". Is there another way to say ""sunset""?

Not that I can think of. *Iltarusko* or just *rusko* means ""dusk"", if that's fitting enough. *Iltaruskon valo* sounds pretty poetic to me, if you can forget the rays which aren't mentioned in the Chinese anyway. Or maybe you could just talk about ""the last rays"" – *viime säteet*.

I also got thinking about the case that you use to describe the forest. Maybe *syvällä metsässä* would be better, to sort of 'set up' the scene before you describe the shining on the moss, which is clearly inside the woods already rather than looking at them from above.

&gt; Also, is there a synonym for tyhjä that might start with a ""k""? I'd like to get some alliteration going between that and kukkula.

I don't think so. *Kumiseva* (""booming"" or ""echoing"") comes to mind but it's only used for describing an empty container, not an area. I suppose *tunturi* could work after all if you imagine the forest to be at its foot. There are enough such locations in Lapland, if not in China.

&gt;If the commentator is a westerner then they may need to study Japanese social customs more, especially in the 1950s and 1960s when Miyazaki was younger and is the timeframe when he sets many of his stories. Still today, but much more so then, *the Japanese had a very different attitude to nudity and mixed bathing than we do in the west.* 

No, they only had a different attitude to the US! Look at Finland and Germany, for example. They would fit the 1st world culture you mentioned, but both are as relaxed about nudity and mixed bathing as the Japanese.

It's easy to find more examples. To have a different topic, you can use yaeba or '[anime fangs](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteLittleFangs)'. Americans discuss this as something which is completely opposite to 'Western culture', but it's again a US-only thing. Other countries are not as obsessed with straight teeth, British anime fans won't see a problem here."
EndiaBanana,linguistics,1390334657.0,"As a French speaker, this is what I can tell you:

French is not only used in France, and it is actually a very useful language to learn. It is also spoken in Belgium, Switzerland, many African countries that were colonized by France or Belgium (including Algeria, Morocco, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Rwanda, Madagascar, and the list goes on), Louisiana, Quebec, parts of New Brunswick, and is a very commonly-learned second language. 

I live in a city in the midwest where you'd think there are really no French speakers, but you'd be surprised once you start studying French how quickly you'll run into it. Of course if you travel it is more useful than if you live and stay in the United States, particularly in an area that is less multicultural, but you'll run into it in various forms of media and literature as well. To use a personal anecdote, I became really interested in sociology for a while and I wanted to read some of Emile Durkheim's original work which is in French. I also listen to a Canadian French solo artist called Coeur de Pirate, and I read LeMonde newspaper.

Truthfully, if you're looking for a more useful language as a resident of the US, Spanish should be your go-to. But learning a language is also one of those things that, if you're not invested in it, can be really boring and won't sink in well. So, I mean, I recommend learning French instead of Spanish just based on personal preference. Sorry I can't provide you with more specific research other than telling you what countries speak French, but that's what I know. Hope that helped a little."

Another issue was that while my car had no problems passing DMV inspection in my home state it chronically failed DC DMV inspections. The maintenance I had to put into it just to get it to pass inspection was $400+ and at this point, it was just a formality since I rarely drove it due to the aformentioned details.

etotheipith,circlebroke,1390334921.0,"&gt; How is an (admittedly simplistic) expression of leftist economic leanings a circlejerk?

Reddit has very leftist leanings, but rarely discusses these in detail (unless it's a wall of populist buzzwords), let alone looks at what the other side has to say. This statement is symptomatic of a circlejerk, so featuring it here is justified.
&gt;This post in particular is just a list of shit that OP doesn't agree with. 

Not really. In fact, I agree with some of the comments. It's just that they're all samey re-printings of the same shit reddit upvotes every week in the exact same type of threads, and most of them involve some kind of explicit or implicit sense of arrogance, which is often unjustified (see: the celebrities comment). If that's not a circlejerk, what is? 
&gt;There isn't even a common thread between them other than the fact that they're opinions held by others.

There is a common thread between them because this kind of posts is just asking ""Reddit, in what ways are you superior and more rational than the rest of society?"".

&gt;This could be such a good sub if more posts were like this[2] or this[3] . You know, actually recognising and critically dissecting shitty stuff that reddit does.

This could be such a good sub if the people who wrote walls of text about what they'd like to see on /r/circlebroke actually posted that kind of content on /r/circlebroke.

lwhatley,AskReddit,1390335038.0,"Not a parent yet, but I will be within the next 5-10 years. 

Yes I was hit as a child, as were my siblings (older brother, and younger brother). This punishment style was strictly circumstantial, and honestly, as a middle, female, generally well-behaved child, I wasn't hit as often as my brothers. 

 Our ""hits"" were anything from spanking, ""thwapping"" on the backs of hands (like swift, three finger swats), to the most severe level of punishment, a slap to the face, which was reserved for a time where one of us would defiantly curse AT a parent. Super no-no. 

I whole-heartedly support the practice, and I know that people disagree. I believe this form of punishment, when used with discretion and reserved for the most important of lessons, works to identify the strictest of boundaries, or priority rules not to be broken. Even the threat of the punishment (which if you threaten a punishment for a rule break, you must follow through! If you don't, you have misconveyed the importance of the rule, and therefore allowed the child to successfully break the boundary, and question your ability to lead effectively). 

When used as punishment for minor misbehaviors, I do believe it doesn't send a great message and it's purpose is lost, it more so invokes a general fear of the parent instead of letting the child identify the rules that you have placed the highest priority upon abiding to (example: coming home late vs. Punching a teacher in the face. Coming home late, while a serious offense, probably isn't as serious of a misconduct as punching an authority figure in the face, and therefore should be dealt with differently to establish levels of misconduct) 

Bonus: I also went to catholic school from K-5th grade. Corporal punishment was enforced and rulers and hand slaps were just a couple of commonly used techniques. I never got hit at school because I didn't misbehave in a way that would warrant that punishment, but my brother did (he had many many behavioral issues as a kid, lots of anger issues stemming from a nasty divorce of my parents) as did a handful of my friends. We all turned out just fine. "

bermyWHAT,BabyBumps,1390335142.0,"Thank you for your response. I didn't mean to up and disappear but I ended up not having to induce. The baby came all on his own.

I kept trying to get my husband to have sex but ever since my doctor told us I was 2cm and she could feel the baby's head was right down he was super grossed out - so it wasn't really an option :(

I definitely didn't want to *defy* my doctor and even my doula got a little squirrely when I mentioned possibly skipping the induction. I mean, I had gone to all the NSTs and an ultrasound and the kid was perfect so...yeah...I guess I was just too in love with my birth plan and I didn't want to be disappointed or get PTSD when things didn't go right. I just imagined that an induction would inevitably lead to an epidural and a C-Section...

Anyway it turned out that I went into labour at 3am on Monday (was scheduled for the induction on the Tuesday), got to the hospital at 6am and was 9cm. They broke my waters at 7:30ish? and the kid was out at 8:18. I was sure I'd need to use Gas and Air but the whole thing was so quick and I had been working on meditation and visualisation with my Doula that I ended up using nothing other than the Tens machine for the early contractions. I must remember to thank my Grandmother for these enormous hips.

I almost forgot to add, the baby was perfectly healthy. He was 9.98lbs and 21cm, no glucose issues, no meconium in the waters. So far so good :)"

Something as horrible as that will affect you for the rest of your life, but it doesn't have to affect your relationships.When you know in your soul that is definitely the one, seriously consider including him in the counseling, and as painful as it might be, telling him the full story.  If he really loves you, and he's anything like me, he will be there for you any time you need him, and maybe that fear of intimacy that you have during those moments will bring you closer together.There's nothing wrong with sometimes being emotionally dependant on someone you love, who loves you, and I'm sure that he would rather you cry on his shoulder than push him away (and I think that so would you)."

captain_craptain,AdviceAnimals,1390335166.0,"&gt; There's a huge difference between physical pain [rape], social stigmatization [slander via false accusation], and having your feelings hurt [emotional reaction to false accusation]. None of those three are truly comparable, so I don't agree with your analogy.

You make a pretty clear case here that the only pain that can be physical is rape.  

&gt;Uh... yeah. Everyone should. All the time. If you're not perceptive of your own actions constantly, then how would you even know if you're doing anything wrong? Everyone should be vigilant to look analytically at their own behavior on a regular basis.  

If you are a conscious human being you should be perceptive of your actions, unless you are in a coma, drunk/high or a sociopath.  Sure people can take stock of their lives, but to think it is acceptable that people be forced to do this by accusing them of horrendous crimes is ludicrous.  Anyone who thinks that accusing someone of rape so that they will take stock of their life is acceptable should be committed.  

&gt;I don't think that's ok. I've been pretty clear that I think false allegations are a pretty fucked up thing.  

Yet you continue to support the idea of a falsely accused male taking stock of his life and that the situation, although completely avoidable from the start, is a good thing for him and he apparently needed it anyways before being accused of rape....right.  

&gt;No, I'm trying to keep an open mind and considering the possibility that I might be wrong... which is exactly what I am proposing everyone should do all the time. I'm just trying to practice what I preach here.  

Well, in this case I think you are quite obviously wrong.  But this all comes down to judgement, some people have good judgement and some people have poor judgement.  I would say that keeping your mind open to the idea of treating the falsely accused as if they are a real perpetrator and exacting some form of rehabilitation on someone who doesn't clearly need it is very poor judgement.   I came to this conclusion through a basic thought process of; ""Did he do wrong? If no, he shouldn't be treated poorly for an accusation that isn't true.  Expecting him to deal with the fallout of something he didn't do is bullshit.""

&gt;It's easy to read 2 sentences and assume the worst of people. But never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.   

Believe me, I love this quote and that is kind of what I have been doing this entire conversation.  

I don't think you are evil, I just think you are open minded to a fault.  There have to be some concrete things you believe in.  You cannot possibly go through life thinking you may be wrong on **everything.**  There has to be some principles that you know to be true and you will stand by.  For example, rape and murder is wrong.  This whole open mindedness thing has gone too far for you apparently, to the point that you are considering whether an innocent man still deserves some form of punishment, even it that punishment is simply self reflection about a crime he didn't commit.  

P.S.  Comins is a fucking moron as is evidenced by her statements.

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1390335230.0,"&gt;There has been an increase in the rate of 50-point games among perimeter players and a corresponding decline in 50-point games among post players.

I feel like this is misleading, in that Kobe really only had the opportunity to shoot as much as he wanted after the handchecking rules came into play. IIRC Kobe has ~25 50 point games, and only a handful were in the Shaq days. I'm not sure what the sample size but I imagine this is a significant factor, especially if you take into account how few 50 point games there have been by perimeter players now. And as for the decline in 50-point games among post players, well how many post players would you expect to go to 50? There isn't anyone dominant like Shaq.

That said, you have to wonder if someone like Brandon Jennings could score 50 as a rookie without handchecking rules."

How confident you are, what your personality is like, and of course, looks.  I'm a very confident person and as contradicting as this may seem, i'm kinda shy.  I rarely approach women.  I'm a pretty good looking guy.  Realistically I give myself and 8/10.  I'm fit, I have a good job, witty...yada yada.  The only thing that holds me back from approaching many women is the fact that i'm shy.  It's hard for me to make the right approach.  When i do I tend to get shot down.  But on the other hand, there's been many of times that I've caught women staring at me.  So I don't know if it's a thing where they see me ugly, or if I am just intimidatingly good looking to them.  I know it sounds shallow, but I'm just trying to be realistic.  Also geography comes into play here as well I think.  I can't find a date around here because I live in a very small backwoods redneck town.  The women around here want a country boy.  That's not me though....at all.

Well, this right here is a big N indicator.  Some of the driving issues also sounds N-ish.  Why would you start yelling at a young teenager on a learners permit while they need to concentrate on driving.....not smart.

Continue to track her 'weirdness' and then talk to your therapist on your next visit.  They should be able to give you a good answer.

Good luck"

The induction was scheduled for 8am Tuesday so my little nugget made his entrance at 8:18am Monday. The birth went completely to plan, no drugs, no problems, nothing. My doctor was there and even the Maternity nurse that was on duty was the nurse from my doctor's office that saw me for every check-up. It was truly a wonderful experience. "

Arkanta,iphone,1390335390.0,"&gt;I think it only refreshes for apps that you have in the background, apps in the multitasking screen. If they're not there, then they won't refresh.  

Wrong. The apps get awoken on certain conditions (time, charger plugged or not, etc ...). The exact recipe is only known by apple.  

By the way WhatsApp is not only going to receive messages if it's actually running. Apple (less on iOS 7 with background fetch) forces you to rely on their Apple Push Notification Server to push anything to your phone. The notifications you see when the apps have been stopped for a couple of minutes ? Most of them come from Apple servers.  
This is why when you tap the notification you have to wait a couple of seconds for the app to catch up, and it has worked that way since push was introduced.  

(in iOS 7, push notifications can wake up an app,  but it's certainly not mandatory for an app to receive messages)"

When struggling in a relationship, sex is usually one f the first things to suffer. So it's not like you're (usually) having copious amounts of really fantastic sex one day and breaking up the next. 

As to the bit about being bonded to someone forever, you will be in some way. I look back on guys I've dated or men I've banged usually with some fondness. They played a part in my life and in making me who I am now. But it's not like I sit here somehow less-than because I've had sex with multiple people, and I don't pine for them now that they're playing a smaller (or no) role in my life. "

Dependiendo del patron, el tipo de puntos (el mas básico es Knit), y que tan larga quieres la bufanda. Una bufanda de puro K, medio delgada y de unos 120-130cm tardarías 1-2 días si es tu primera bufanda, y cuando sepas bien la terminarías en unas 4-5 horas. Por ejemplo, para hacer [esta](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/oh-brioche) bufanda tarde 3 días por que el tipo de punto es mas complejo, y eso que no esta tan larga.

A budget was never brought into question and does not factor into this at all.  It's very clear that spitfire DID have staff below her, so the budget was not an issue.

Also it bothered me that the 42 week thing was the 1st day of the 42nd week instead of allowing at least most of the 42nd week to pass before they take action. Obviously as long as they're checking that the baby is fine with all the NSTs and Sonograms.

I applied a heavy swatch and a blended swatch with my fingers. There are two blended swatches of the Peaked color because I had too much product for the first blended swatch. The color is very pretty, I'm predicting I'll have to wear a BB cream with more coverage with Peaked because I don't want it to enhance the redness in my skin.

He made a very convincing case as to his credentials stating he was from Brazil, however when the head ref (an ACTUAL, Brazilian, IBJJF approved referee, 3rd Degree Black Belt) attempted to speak Portuguese to him  Lan could barely hold a two-sentence conversation and insisted that they speak English in spite of his mild-but-clear Brazilian accent.

About six weeks after this incident one of my training partners had to temporarily relocate to New York for work but wanted to continue training for a fight. At the time Paulo Izaias (a highly accredited competitor and practitioner) was living and training at Lan's academy. 

My training partner quickly pointed out the difference in skill citing Izaias ability and expertise and Lan's lack of ability to apply his know-how, inability to perform even the most basic of hip movements, and complete absence of coordination that would be present in a 2nd Degree Black Belt."

I managed to masticate the center and the Japanese girls found this hilarious.

stln00b,relationship_advice,1390336107.0,"Well, the first problem I see is ""made to penetrate"" is labeled ""other sexual violence, when in reality, it's fucking rape.

Second, I would venture to guess that because of the way we socialize both men and women, if men and boys were taught about sex the same way women are, those numbers would be much different. 

For example, I recently broke up with a woman for attempting to force me to get an erection in my sleep, and in a not so gentle manner either, so I would wake up and have sex with her. After terminating the relationship, I was discussing this issue with a female friend and she was *flabbergasted* at the idea that an erection is not consent.

Additionally, there are an estimated 300,000 men in prison that are raped annually. Recent research, and I'm not going to google rape at work, has shown that  at least 65% of those rapes are staff on inmate. And out of those rapes, 90% of them are female on male rape.

The issue of rape is a very sensitive one, and rightly so, but the issue I see is that  society and feminists tell us that it's something that happens to women, not something that happens to people, and that if a man is raped he either ""wanted it"", ""should have wanted it"", was ""lucky"", or he deserved it (especially in the cases of prison rape)."

Thinking that selfish thigns justify themself based on you wanting to do them. Yes, you CAN do them. But other people have no reason to support bad decisions.

It looks like etsy is a per transaction fee based system.. so it depends on what your budget is for your store.  With a basic store at $29 with shopify you have no time limit on how long stuff is available to sell, but there is a limit on SKUs.  there are 100 SKUs for the basic store, and if you are going to have lots of variants of each shirt (i.e. sizes) you could run up against that limit fast if you have lots of designs.  You can probably work around that if you don't have a price differential for different sizes, but multiple prices means multiple SKUs, so it would require a higher paid level plan to get more SKUs.

So, if you are starting small it might be more cost effective at first to get up and rolling with Etsy to get your product rolling and income coming in before you switch to a dedicated shopping cart system as your income increases and stabilizes.  If you are going to be going full tilt and have the budget Shopify is a great platform to work with, with lots of customization options and addon apps.

Edit:  with the change to their SKU limits, my recommendation is that if you have the 29 a month to budget for it, go with Shopify.  ;)

SueTheName,raisedbynarcissists,1390336210.0,"(Throwaway for this one. My SO is on reddit.)

I avoided dating for decades because I never found anyone to trust. Some time in my early 20s, I met someone that I actually considered dating, but I still had MASSIVE trust issues. Initially, my concern was that I met them online, that they were essentially a stranger, that they were incredibly generous and immediately opened up to me, etc. I thought it was all a ruse to get close enough to me to hurt me, use me, etc.

I had to rationalize away my paranoia. ""The first gift they gave you ties in to your first conversation with them, they held importance and value on that conversation.""  
""They just spent $50 on you for your enjoyment.""  
""They drove 20 miles to pick you up, just to hang out for a few hours.""  
""They've invested so much money and time and energy into this, there's no way they're in it just to hurt you.""

It wasn't until I had a medical emergency and they dropped all their plans to help me that I finally trusted them. It was when we were in the waiting room that I had an epiphany. I apologized to them for making them do all this for me. They responded:  
**""But I *want* to do this. This isn't the place I wanted it to be, but I wanted to spend all day with you.""**

And I suddenly realized they did all this out of love.

I thought back to the last time I had a medical emergency and my Nparent took me to the hospital. They'd drop plans to drive me there, of course. Except the waiting room, it's not reassuring words and comforting hugs.  
""Do you realize how much this will cost?""  
""I could be doing _____ instead of sitting around, waiting with you.""  
**""You owe me for driving you here.""**

And I suddenly realized my Nparent didn't help me out of love. It was out of duty. It was out of looking good to others. It was out of getting tokens to redeem for later favors.

----
After that incident and epiphany, I learned to love. I learned to love and trust my partner. I learned (and they taught me) that relationships based on love and friendship are ***NOT*** based on repaying favors, evening out the score, and as a wise user said on this very subreddit a bit back:

Relationships are NOT credit cards.

You can't even out a $1000 deficit with many $10 payments. In fact, you don't need to be balancing a relationship budget at all. If someone wants to do something, they SHOULDN'T do it expecting something back. A gift is not an IOU. A favor is not attached to a ""you owe me later"". Helping someone is supposed to be done because you want to help them, not because you want a metaphorical cookie.

---
You may be surrounded by the wrong kind of people. Like attracts like, so if you're looking at your Nmother's social circle, that's probably shaded a certain way. For me, it took a risky connection, meeting someone 3 cities away, and bonding with them and their friends to find that love is indeed real and that having friends with bonds strong enough to form a family-style relationship is not only real, it's possible.

I wish you the best in finding love, whether it be romantic, familiar, platonic, unconditional, etc."

mhblm,explainlikeimfive,1390336218.0,"Great question! A good lawyer can help by arguing that the search was unreasonable, as per the fourth amendment, or that the search or arrest didn't follow proper protocol. If the search was unreasonable, then the evidence found during it cannot be used in court.

Different standards exist for determining whether a search is reasonable. In order to search the trunk of a car, for example, a police officer does not need a warrant, but needs ""probable cause"" to believe that a person has committed a crime, roughly meaning enough evidence that a reasonable and cautious person would believe that the suspect has *probably* committed a crime. 

Drug dogs are commonly used to establish probable cause, but they must generally be used during the time of a reasonable stop; cops are generally not allowed to detain a person against their will to wait for a K9 unit. Example: a cop makes someone wait for two hours under the guise of a traffic stop, and a dog comes around, giving them probable cause to search the car. The search produces two pounds of marijuana. A good lawyer could easily convince a judge that the person was being detained beyond the length of a traffic stop, so the search was unreasonable, and the marijuana could not be used as evidence.

**Note: This doesn't apply if you consent to a search!** If you consent, the search is reasonable in the eyes of the law!  **The proper response, If a police officer asks if he can search you, is ""I do not consent to any search.""** Don't stop them, but *do not consent.*

Probably the most notable example of someone [getting off on a technicality](http://www.theonion.com/articles/jurisprudence-fetishist-gets-off-on-technicality,9063/) (*hehehe*) is the case of Ernesto Miranda, after whom the Miranda Warning is named. (""You have the right to remain silent..."") Ernesto signed a confession after two hours of interrogation, but his lawyers argued that he wasn't aware of his right to remain silent, and were able to get his confession thrown out. Since then, the police read the Miranda warning, ensuring that anything the suspect says is admissible in court.

TL,DR: The bill of rights is awesome, and lawyers can help save your ass."

bermyWHAT,BabyBumps,1390336272.0,"I was worried that the induction would lead to worse labour pains which would lead to an epidural which would lead to a c-section

I definitely didn't want to put the baby at risk in any way but I was definitely torn between the perfect plan I had created in my head (as I tend to be a bit of a planner and control freak) and this new element that threw a kink in this thing I had already built. I'm the type of person who finds it incredibly stressful when I have a plan and it goes to pot. 

I ended up not having to get induced so I got myself worked up for a whole lot of nothing. I think that when I finally relaxed and gave up and accepted that my baby was going to be born that I let myself go.

The induction was scheduled for Tuesday at 8am and my baby was born on Monday at 8:18am. I started labour pains at 3am, 6am was at the hospital and 9cm dilated, 7:30ish they broke my waters and 8:18 I was holding the baby. The whole labour went to plan perfectly, drug free, no ripping, and not stressful at all. My doctor *barely* made it to the hospital and the maternity nurse was also the nurse that saw me for my appointments at my doctors office so it was a really wonderful experience.

I ended up staying in the hospital until the Wednesday morning but I would've rather gone home on the Tuesday. They would have let me leave on the Monday but because it's my first baby and the paediatrician doesn't know me so well he asked that I stay longer so they could monitor the baby. My doula's back up stayed in the hospital for 2 hours after her last kid - our hospital is really good about working with people and letting them do what they want within reason."

I will definitely be looking for 10man guilds in the 5/14H+ range though, thanks for the info!

I'm going to have to disagree with you there. There are plenty of ways to explain chart patterns based off of traders' mentalities. 

TA is almost a self fulfilling prophecy because the more people that use it the better it becomes. That is why the most popular technical indicators (50/100/200 day moving averages) are always so consistently right. Ask any trader and he'll say a breakout below the 200 day shows weakness in a stock. If everyone thinks that then who's left to buy?

I'm a big believer in TA and it's how I trade so I might be a little biased but there's always a reason behind patterns on stocks. It's not just random "

It may be that my time and energy are better spent elsewhere, in which case I take a risk and use a faster but less reliable method of determining quality.

There is good reason to equate price with quality - a simple understanding of supply and demand. If people actually buy it at full price, it is worth that price to at least some consumers. Of course there are problems with that like in this case where the $80 jeans are actually mostly bought at $30, but you can be willing to take the risk of that happening without being irrational. I think it's completely rational to buy stuff on sale based on it's original price without evaluating every item you buy, because evaluating each item is cheaper effort-wise than following a general rule that usually works."

Esoteric_Indulgence,TwoXChromosomes,1390336534.0,"I changed from HBC pills to Nexplanon and thus far has been a great decision. 

Since I was already on pills, the implant process was scheduled to align with my current hormone schedule (basically inserted during my placebo pill phase). Insertion took only about a minute. I personally didn't even find the numbing agent to be painful; it's the same prickly feeling you get if you rest on your arm wrong and it goes numb. I had a very experienced gynecologist insert it, so I didn't have much bruising. 

I had side effects for 1 week after insertion. I only experienced some small headaches, abdominal pain (like cramping), and moodiness. After that, my body adjusted and haven't had any side effects since then. No spotting or anything, but that was to be expected since I was already on HBC prior to Nexplanon.

If you read the instructions and fine print that come with Nexplanon, you'll see it's about the same effectiveness as IUDs. The only thing more effective is sterilization procedures, so you're truly in the top tier whether you choose an implant or an IUD. I feel more protected with Nexplanon than I did with HBC pills.

Originally my insurance said they would not cover Nexplanon, so I paid $935 up front out of pocket. Then 2 weeks later, the insurance company reimbursed me $835. So I guess if you have insurance, call and find out for sure if they can cover any of the cost. If not, I did my own math and found that the full cost of Nexplanon cost the same as 3 years of my HBC pills. So do some math of your own and you'll probably find it's either less expensive or as expensive as what you're using now (over the course of 3 years)."

Another thing: I'm inferring from your references to ""in your class"" that you're young enough to still be in school. The two pieces of advice you mentioned work better and better the older you get. Your FWB who thinks that guys should be able to read her mind and ""just know"" what she wants and doesn't want is absolutely, flat-out wrong. Nobody can read minds. She'll get hurt by her ignorance or a while, and eventually, she'll change her mind. Trust me, women in their mid/late 20s are much, much more open to that kind of communication. And if they aren't?

If they gave her lower mana costs on her Q/W (or better mana regen), she'd become really good support. If they improved the shred from her passive, she would destroy top, having the equivalent of a black cleaver for free. If they made her attacks always ranged, with her E simply providing splash, she could potentially fill the role of ADC. There's a ton of places for them to shift her power, if they think her burst is too good.

* There is a hierarchy in seats you take at a table, in a room, in a car, anywhere. As a guest or client you will be offered the best seat (usually farthest from the door, if the room has a window, the seat that has a nice view, and closest to the sacred *tokonoma* if you are in a Japanese-style room). Same goes with when you have drinks or a big party with all of your coworkers. Older people/your superiors go to the back of the room, while younger people get to interact with the waiters/waitresses in the small-room type establishments (*izakaya*)

* Do not stick your chopsticks in your rice. That is for dead people only.

* Do not use your chopsticks to take something that another person is holding with chopsticks. That's reserved for holding dead peoples' bones (after they get cremated)

* There are about three different kind of bows - the one when you're deeply apologetic, the one where you're greeting someone formally, and the one where you're just nodding your head to someone in the hallway. Use them appropriately.

* Take gifts EVERYWHERE. The gift shops in Japan are not just for tourists to get cheesy souvenirs - they are there so that businesspeople can get something to take to their clients on the way. People usually get edibles, as permanent things get in the way. Space is always valuable.

* It's perfectly acceptable to yell across the restaurant (*sumimasen*, or ""excuse me"") to get a server's attention (unless you're at a more-than-$100-a-meal type of quiet place). It is, however not acceptable to talk on your cellphone on public transportation because that would be disruptive.

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390336895.0,"Even after reading it again, I still don't see anything that speaks specifically to ""creating happiness."" Only meeting needs and then not having expectations that are likely to make you unhappy.

I do agree that the right mindset of seeing positive and not focusing on negative, and lower expectations help with not being sad, and probably with being happy.

But I still don't think that is the same thing as creating a happy moment.

If someone is in such a dark place that they can imagine nothing that could even possibly make them happy, or, if you suggest, can only imagine things so out of reach, with such high expectations as to be unattainable, then yes, they are going to have a hard time ever being happy.

When I say ""happy moment"" I mean a mere moment in time that happiness/pleasure is felt.

Again, I agree that a negative mindset, or extremely high expectations will prevent someone from being able to feel even small moments of happiness. 

But solely having low expectations and a positive mindset does not give someone the idea to do something that has the possibility of making them happy or feel pleasure.

To use your movie example, (without my husband's influence, of if I slip back into my olds ways), it simply does not occur to me to go see a movie. I have never been someone who would go in with high expectations, or would be critical of the movie. I would not be disappointed in it if I went to see it. In fact, it would entertain me and make me feel happy. But it never would occur to me that such a thing is something I should do.

And it is that way with everything. As such, I was never really happy.

In addition to what you say about mindset and expectations, someone has to also have the idea that happiness itself is valuable and to be sought after and prioritized.

I've been working since I turned 18. I took a big fancy IT class in highschool, which basically turned my college education towards an IT/Computer degree. I now have my Associates degree and now I'm just trying to find a full time permanent job.

There is nothing forcing you to go back to college. Personally I don't want to go back to earn a bachelors degree, I just don't want it. (experience is better for IT jobs anyways)

Provided you qualify for some type of financial aid, go back to school for some classes you have an interest in. You don't have to fully dedicate yourself to being a student. You'll have to work out the details for your own school though.

As far as work, it couldn't hurt to find a part time job at least that way you still have some spending money.

TL:DR - You are 20 years old. You are an adult and free to do what you want. Provided you can afford to do it, take advantage of your freedom. Don't be pressured into anything. If you want to take a class, go take a class. If you want a job, go find a job. Do what **YOU** want to do."

That particular lens turns out to be very sharp at close range, but a bit soft at the longer ranges you might want to use the lens for. I do understand that it's more difficult to test at longer ranges, and the Imatest suite isn't really suited for that, but I hope someone is going to do a back to back comparison at longer range to complement the LensRental work."

thisisjustmyusername,nfl,1390336976.0,"Obviously, I've only seen my team win two conference championships and both felt very different.

In 2006 when the Seahawks beat Carolina to go to the Super Bowl, it was a huge deal considering that level of success was uncharted territory for the Seahawks and the other sports teams in our city hadn't experienced that level of success since the Sonics went to the NBA finals in the mid 90's. Prior to that season, the Seahawks had some success and a few playoff appearances under Holmgren but no one had anticipated that we were sitting on Super Bowl level talent. Personally, it felt that the stars were aligning over the course of the year; the rest of the NFC West was weak and home field advantage through the playoffs in a pair of games against two teams that I would not consider elite. When we beat the Panthers, it wasn't a close game, so the majority of the emotio  I felt was based off of the victory being an unprecedented acheivement.

This season was completely different. The Seahawks were preseason favorites to go to the Super Bowl and the hype and anticipation in this town was off the charts and unlike anything we had ever seem before. The fans, players, coaches, and pundits realized that we had the talent to make it there and it was a matter of putting it all together on the field against a tough schedule and a competitive division. Even when we won games, there was worry and scrutiny over every phase of the game that we came up short in. A lot of people were calling for linebacker Bobby Wagner to be benched after we had been gashed by a few teams in the run game (he has since played very well). I can't remember a time when our fan base has been so reactionary and quick to judge players and I attribute it to the stakes being so high in most people's perceptions. 

Winning the conference championship this year was nothing short of amazing. I still haven't come down from the high. The Sherman tip for the interception might be the greatest moment in Seattle sports history, and it's a shame that the commotion surrounding his comments has eclipsed that. Overcoming an early defecit against a worthy opponent and winning on such a great play after over a year of anticipation was wonderful.

DeathrayGourmet,DetroitRedWings,1390337098.0,"I think the wild card is still a possibility. But they have to get healthy and play consistently in order for that to happen. I'm gonna say there's probably a 30-40% chance that they're gonna make it, but they'll have to fight for it.

I'm just concerned of what will happen if they don't make it. I hope it isn't some huge spectacle that people won't shut up about and use to ridicule the team, and us fans in /r/hockey. But that's very likely. I'm sure some people will be really sour about it, and a few people in /r/DetroitRedWings will give up on the team and have some nasty things to say.

If they don't make it, yes, I will be very disappointed and wouldn't be able to help but feel slightly betrayed. This is a streak that's gone on every year of my life, and I didn't think I'd be seeing it end any time soon. Every season that doesn't get at least to the 2nd round of the playoffs feels like a failure around here. I can't imagine how frustrating it would be to miss the playoffs altogether.

But in all, I think there's still a chance. Everyone's been saying ""The season is a marathon, not a race!"" -- But that only matters if they can pick it up at some point. So far, we haven't seen that. They've actually been getting even more injuries and playing worse. They need to be much better and more consistent to have a chance."

I'm also not going to spend $100,000 on this car, even though the purchase price was originally above that.  I don't intend to own it for decades.  I don't plan on riding the depreciation all the way down to zero.  I really can't afford that any more than I can afford to give $100k to charity.

He then ignored me the entire night, even normal social conversation was out of the question. So I just thought he was totally rude and wouldn't talk to people he didn't know and that he had an unattractive girlfriend because his personality sucked.

I saw him again almost a year later after he and the girlfriend had broken up and turns out he is a really sweet, funny guy. The reason he wouldn't talk to me was because his ex was the super jealous type and couldn't deal with him paying attention to anyone but her.

It all went smashingly to plan. I couldn't have asked for a better birth experience. I was surprised that even with all the birth classes and readings and meditation and talking I had done how freaked out I still was about actually going into labour and giving birth. 

Like, I knew all the things but it was still something I could never know until I experienced it and that really bothered me. I get very worked up in my head a lot and sometimes suffer from panic attacks so I like to really be in control and plan - which made my doula nervous; I wouldn't be able to let go and let the instinct and the labour just take over - that I would end up dragging out the whole process.

I ended up starting labour at 3am and the baby was in my arms at 8:18am. It was a very wonderful experience.

MikeyDeez,relationships,1390337307.0,"Coming from someone in protective services, I just want to point out that the advice given from someone who does not know your family  basically said:

""Alerting the authorities to criminal activity won't help much.  The only way to help the victim is to leave the abuser alone and make the victim leave.""

Obviously there are family dynamics at play but if a stranger threw an object at you and gave you a black eye, and a bystander/witness said ""Well yeah, that guy is beyond help. But I guess, *if* you wanted to punish him you could tell someone what he did.  I really think the only way to help you here is if you leave.""

Your mom is abusive and dysfunctional. Why should your sister have to leave the only home she's ever known because your mom is a jackass? 

 You aren't the one ""punishing your mother"" by reporting the abuse your teenaged sister is facing.  **Addicts/abusers/criminals won't stop until they have a reason to.  Sometimes a victim calling 911 is the shot-in-the-ass that makes people stop doing the wrong thing If anything, I think your mom needs you to call authorities just as much as your sister does.** Domestic violence won't ""get better"" on its own over time.

I think putting up any sort of defense for an action involving a false rape accusation is indefensible, no matter how abstractly you want me to look at it.

H335,CCW,1390337419.0,"Ability, Opportunity, Jeopardy.

Ability includes disparity of force issues. Does the offender/assailant possess the ability to cause you grave bodily harm or is there rough parity between you and the attacker. This can change through the course of an encounter by the way. Assume two males, both roughly equal composition of body, but the defender has some basic self defense training. There is a slightly positive disparity of force. If it starts with fisticuffs, and the aggressor picks up a two by four or piece of re-bar when they realize they are getting a can of whoop-ass opened up on them and now back the defender into a (literal) corner, that disparity of force has been significantly altered to a negative towards the defender.

Opportunity: Given the scenario you have described, there is obvious opportunity.

Jeopardy: Were you in fear, for yourself or another, of grave bodily harm or death? At the beginning of the encounter (given the parameters I established) probably unlikely. However once backed into a corner, facing an opponent wielding a piece of re-bar, the appropriate answer is ""Yes!"".

&gt; U.S. Steel deliberately placed the massive steel columns on the exterior of the building to showcase a new product called Cor-ten steel. Cor-ten resists the corrosive effects of rain, snow, ice, fog, and other meteorological conditions by forming a coating of dark brown oxidation over the metal, which inhibits deeper penetration and doesn't need painting and costly rust-prevention maintenance over the years. The initial weathering of the material resulted in a discoloration of the surrounding city sidewalks, as well as other nearby buildings. A cleanup effort was orchestrated by the corporation once weathering was complete to undo this damage, but the sidewalks still have a decidedly rusty tinge."""

sharshenka,changemyview,1390337592.0,"Do you have a source to show that boys learn best from men and girls from women?  I ask because I have a son, and it is really hard to find anything that has actual numbers behind it, not just annectdotal evidence. Even the article you linked about the Eagle Academies in NY didn't specifically mention the sex of the teachers. Frankly, I think in that example things like giving the students the space to vent about home problems and fostering healthy camaraderie probably had more to do with the school's success than gender segregation does.

Now, to get down to trying to change your view, here are some reasons why I don't think segregating schools by sex would improve education in America.

1.  We've done desperate but equal in the past, and it didn't work. In this case, I'm guessing some areas would have bad boys schools and good girls schools, and in others it would be reversed. For example, lower income areas might focus on preparing boys for trades, or wearing them out with physical activity instead of actually teaching them. Higher income areas might assume girls are just going to ""marry up"", and focus on etiquette and the humanities. Not to say this would happen everywhere, but making segregation mandatory instead of by choice increases the chance of crappy administration. 

2. Mandating who you can hire isn't generally a good idea.  Teaching is a skill, and it's bad to assume any skill divides strictly along gender lines. Even if boys need more kinesthetic learning, what's to say the best kinesthetic teachers are men? The boys school could lose out on the talent they need because they can't hire women. Because of lack of supply currently, this problem could lead to the boys' schools, especially in smaller cities, getting stuck with poor quality, expensive teachers, especially in the short term.

3. Limited resources. I imagine your ideal end solution would be two separate buildings, maybe even two administrative structures. This doubles the overhead involved with education. We seem to have a hard time funding schools currently, and if we are willing to spend twice as much, it seems like we would get more bang for ourbuck keeping schools integrated. 

4. It doesn't model the real world. It seems to me that it is a bad idea to have the only opposite sex authority figure in a child's life be a parent. In this day and age every young adult is going to have managers of the opposite sex. Getting used to seeing people in those roles and learning how they communicate before your paycheck is on the line seems like a good idea.

Overall, I agree that having more male teachers is a good thing, but segregating schools by gender seems like it has too many pitfalls."

chrisonline1991,self,1390337683.0,"I'll bite:

&gt;In the Bible (humor me for a moment!) we are given three very distinct types of rules. They are generally referred to as: Civil, Ceremonial, and Moral Laws.

Are these terms defined in the Bible?  How do you know this/where can i find info on it.

&gt;You find these type of laws all over the Old Testament--and though we are no longer supposed to follow them in our society

Why?

&gt; Don't kill without righteous reason

What does ""righteous reason"" mean?

&gt;It boils down to the concept of Convictions. Convictions are, simply put, personal rules that the Christian learns as they grow in Christ. These are typically very personal rules between you and God, that are NOT explicitly stated in the Bible.

So convictions are just opinions?

&gt; 1.   Am I still putting God above all things in my life?
&gt; 2.   Am I loving people as much as God loves me?

How do you determine these? What is love, how do you measure love, how do you know how much God loves you, and therefore how much you should love people?

These two questions are so vague that i can imagine people never doing anything, or doing everything they want.  e.g. Husband has an alcohol problem, Wife wants him to get help.  Husband says ""God made me like this, if i listen to my wife i am putting her above God"". Mother doesn't want to give child surgery/drugs/etc. because doing so would put God benenith something(surgery, drugs, etc). I could go on and on.

BooksofMagic,TheBluePill,1390337770.0,"&gt; TRP is a sub where threads like this one, where the terpers launch a personal attack on a guy whose wife was sexually harrased by a coworker, 

Boy she kissed him back a LOT for it being harrassment.  Ever consider that his wife lied to him to protect herself?

&gt; or this one, which claims that women are incapable of love and that the only relationships that work are the ones in which the are submissive.

There are quite a few women out there that desire a submissive relationship.  My own wife is one of those.  She's always defered to me, so taking control of my household as the ""captain"" didn't change the dynamic much at all.  In fact, I've seen many stories of such on the Married Man Sex Life blogs.  Maybe you should take a look there?  Lots of guys having success by taking control of their marriages through red-pill knowledge.

As for the last link - I get what they are saying.  The whole point of it is that Women are not special snowflakes, despite their need to feel that way.  I think this is true for all of us really, so I suppose it's one area where my beliefs differ from theirs.

&gt; If, as you claim, viewpoints like that were the equivalent of radical views in the feminst movement, they would be a tiny minority of TRP posts and condemned by most of the community's members. As I think is clear, that is not the case at all.

I disagree.  I keep encountering this viewpoint all over the internet.  There are many many more people fighting for feminism right now than for mens rights.  Men have a right to their ideals as well."

As far as the gym, two pieces of advice: I'm not sure what education requires you to not injure your arms, but if you slowly increase your weight level and lift with good technique, weight lifting is not dangerous. In fact, being stronger will increase the safety of your arms, because you will be less likely to injure yourself just navigating your life.

More importantly, though, if you want to gain weight/muscle, its MOSTLY ABOUT HOW YOU EAT. You need to eat a caloric surplus and make sure you're eating clean, and you WILL put on good weight. It's a simple equation. Hit up /r/fitness or /r/leangains and start getting advice from them.

You should also not be a dick and refuse to leave the left lane because you're ""going the speed limit"".

I only pointed out what was in the drivers manual because finest_jellybean pointed out asserted that this wasn't true in California. I suspect the issue is that the term ""Passing lane"" implies that you should only be in the lane if passing, which as far as I know isn't that common in the US.

Basically, you can't push down on one side of the water balloon without it bulging out somewhere else. People are going to be relatively constant in the level of commitment they're comfortable with.

&gt;Prenatal care is comprehensive and covered entirely by insurance.

Some tests are optional and it depends on the insurance company if they pay it (partially) or not. But all important stuff is completely paid for.

&gt;Or for delivery, though they usually don't go straight there after the waters break.

Also depends, for example if there are problems detected beforehand like the baby's position is not right. But if everything is fine you wait a little bit - to know when to go is also part of the preparation done by midwives, they offer courses called ""Geburtsvorbereitungskurs"" (Birthing preparation course).

Edit:
If you plan to have the baby in a hospital you will go there beforehand (scheduled by your gyn) to get examined and more importantly informed about what is or might be happening and what your options are (like c-section, pain treatment)."

einTier,IAmA,1390338163.0,"Wow.  That's a pretty open question.  

Let me start with the end goal.  Starting and owning a race team is a really good way to go bankrupt.  I sincerely hope you have deep pockets, a charismatic personality, and a whole lot of luck.  Not to dissuade you, but just know what you're up against. 

Autocross is easy, cheap, and a good place to start.  [Autocross.com](http://autocross.com/) should be able to point you to a local club.  From there, find the people that are really serious about the craft.  They'll be running race tires and probably have the car on a trailer.  Ask them for local track schools, which are often called HPDEs.  Try a few track days to get your feet wet and understand how to properly and safely get around a race track and deal with traffic.  

After that, you can go racing.  If you've been asking lots of questions of everyone along the way like you should, you'll have a pretty good idea of the type of racing you want to pursue.  It might be prepping your Fox-body for a spec series, or it might be buying a Miata to do Spec Miata.  Or maybe you want an open wheel Formula Ford.  Maybe, in preparation for your race team, you want to go do some Grand-Am races ($$$$$).  Maybe you just want to get on a team for 25 hours of Thunderhill.  

It's all about having a clear vision of what you want to achieve, be willing to listen to others and modify that vision to meet reality, and taking everything one step at a time.  Like most things, it looks extremely difficult when you look at the whole, but it's really just one step at a time, and luckily the people you meet on each step are more than happy to point you the way to the next step.  

Go attend that autocross.  Meet people.  Ask questions.  Tell them where you want to go and ask them where to go next.  Listen.  Do. Repeat.

GTnicholas,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390338223.0,"Mass scale economics never actually reduces in the way you state. I would challenge you to prove that boom and bust cycles are cause by the market side of our mixed economy when they tend to be associated with currency, debt and the stock market. The currency is owned and controled by the state and intentionally devalued in order to pay for things and pass it off to the next generation without upsetting the current tax payers. The debt of the individual is affected greatly by poor economic education in public schools and abject poverty, which is aggravated by inflation, the minimum-wage, unfunded-liabilities, practically half of what you own being taxed and incentives to opt out of and leech off the market through various government social programs. The stock market is one of the most highly regulated areas of the economy and well over 90% of its participants are forced to participate in it on pain of state seizure of their funds. Remember that the stock market is nothing more than an organized system of investment in various companies, and is essentially a bunch of people giving loans to companies either for a share of their profits or to call back those loans later. Such an area of the market is so highly speculative that it takes a skilled professional to profit. Furthermore, these factors do not exist in isolation, but influence each other, devaluation of the currency incentivizes people to place their value in something other than money which typically means that excess wealth gets placed into a stock portfolio. The boom-bust cycles are macro-economic events and as such take place in a complex and highly volatile system which just cannot be accurately described as being cause by capitalism."

I ended up not having to get induced. I started with labour pains at 3am on the 13th (induction was scheduled for the 14th), laboured at home with my doula, husband, and a tens machine until 6am and we went to the hospital where I was 9cm dilated. I think they broke my waters at 7:30ish and the baby was out and in my arms by 8:18am. No drugs, no tearing - it was an absolutely wonderful experience. I had done a lot of visualisation/meditation with my Doula over the past few months and the maternity nurse on duty turned out to be the one that also worked at my doctor's office and who saw us for all of our appointments. It was really wonderful. It couldn't have gone better and I can't speak higher about the maternity staff at my hospital.

For one of the NSTs I had, my husband was speaking on the phone with our moving company about when our furniture will arrive in the country (already 3 months late) and with our neighbour about when our dog will arrive in the country (we had to leave her behind because my country has outdated rules on rabies vaccines and citizenship laws) so I was crying and stressed and they called me the next day to make sure that I was ok. 

If you ever find yourself pregnant and want to give birth in a relatively exotic location I definitely recommend King Edward Memorial Hospital in Bermuda ;)"

1. Maybe ask for advice in /r/nonmonogamy for some pointers. You should also check out some Dan Savage articles on ""monogamish"" couples. I have no links, but the google does.
1. All things considered, bangin' once a week after being married for five years is a far cry from some of the mismatched libidos I've seen discussed here and elsewhere. It might not be worth the hassle. Of course it also depends on how satisfying your sex is, but that's another post.
1. This is a horrible post title. It sounds like you're looking for a loophole, not that your wife has given you the OK. If you post anywhere else asking for advice, phrase it differently
1. I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and say your wife is trying to trap you, but you should really really really make sure she is on the same page as you are. Set strict rules and FOLLOW THEM.
1. Would you be accepting if she wanted to get laid with no emotional attachment? Maybe she's not interested now, but if you start sleeping around now and she wants to step out on you in 10 years for some extramarital fun, how are you going to react?"

Frisky2Times,weddingplanning,1390338324.0,"While I admire your dedication and commitment you think you are displaying to your marriage, it is very naive of you to say you will just 'soldier on' in the example we are talking about here re; a partner that develops mental illness. A person who does all the can for as long as they can is no less committed. I think you are confusing the commitment to do all you can for your spouse in such circumstances for as long as you can (or as long as they will let you), with bailing on them at the first sign of trouble.

If my fiancee developed mental illness down the track, I would do all I could to support and help her for as long as I could. The length of time I would be able to help her would be inversely proportional to how hostile she became and directly proportional to how willing she'd be to receiving/seeking help. I'm not going to bail on her at the first sign of trouble or when she needs/wants my help and support. Having said that, I am cognisant enough to realise that it would largly depend on how willing she'd be in receiving such help and that there may be a limit to how long I could keep it up for.

I would do this for her regardless of whether we are married or not, the 'marriage' in this circumstance is irrevelant.

We are not getting a prenup bc we don't have any major assets, however, if we did, we would. It wouldn't undermine or de-value our marriage at all, it would be just saying that we are going into this marriage with every intention and expectation that it is for life but we realise that there are aspects of life that are beyond our control and that this is a plan of what we would do in the unlikely event it might happen. 

Like a will, I think prenups would need to be re-evaluated after a few years and perhaps even disposed of. "

drzoidburger,news,1390338335.0,"We can't say for sure whether the kids were acting out of malice. I'd like to think they weren't because if they were, that's even more awful. Personally, even if the kids were just having a laugh (at others' expense), I think it's important for them to learn that certain behaviors and attitudes won't be tolerated by society in the real world or are dangerous to hold because they can unfairly disadvantage others. What if someday one of these kids holds a position of power and they must decide whether to hire a black candidate for a job? If their attitude of black culture is purely ""basketball and gang signs"", then they might write off the candidate without looking into what they have to contribute as a person. It seems to me that these kids have a lot of maturing to do, and perhaps this slap on the wrist will be the first step to that maturation. 
      
Yes, there are black people who do walk around in jerseys and throw gang signs, but it is unfair to judge an entire race of people based on the lifestyle of a comparative few. You say that respect is earned, not given. But why are you expecting blacks who don't walk around in jerseys to have to apologize or compensate for the blacks that do? They have no relation to each other. I am assuming you are white (correct me if I'm wrong), so if someone said all white people were hick hillbillies who marry their cousins, judged you for it, and then expected you to fix those people if you didn't want to be judged as white trash, how would you react? I think it's easy to say to blacks, ""Look, your problem exists within your own group. We're only judging you for what we see."" But that implies that you're seeing all blacks as one entity when they are actually a group of individuals with their own (often very different) lives. "

ClimbingWolfBear,AskElectronics,1390338612.0,"There are two formulas that will help greatly in understanding this. The first describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance:

V = IR

The second describes power usage (wattage):

P = IV

When you have an outlet (in the US), it has 120V AC between the ""Hot"" and the ""Neutral"" lines. When you plug in a lamp, say with a 40 Watt bulb, you know that bulb uses 40W. Using the second equation, you get:

P = IV

40 = I*120

I = 1/3 A

So, nothing is being fried by 30A. That light bulb is simply drawing only 1/3A. Now, how is that not acting like a direct short? If you look at V = IR, you see that the light bulb has a resistance of 360 ohms. 

Let's think about LEDs. LEDs work in a very special way. They simply turn on at around .6V. However, they will break at somewhere close to 1.2V. So, how to do we get around this? We put a resistor in the circuit. It takes up the extra voltage and saves the LED.

What is the 30A, then? Your breakers will have 30A fuses on them. This means that in each circuit (the outlets a single breaker switch uses), you can only use a total of 30A. This is a safety measure to protect the wiring in your home.

So if we have 120W bulbs (to make the math easy), we can have up to 30 of them in a room (circuit) without blowing the fuse."

lendrick,BasicIncome,1390338658.0,"If this is true, why is unemployment still so high even though the rich (who ostensibly create jobs) have more money than ever?  You would think that the availability of cheap labor and the availability of capital would be a recipe for an economic boom, but in all honesty, we're reaching a point now where the necessities are becoming so easy to produce that people just don't need to buy a whole lot more than they're already buying.

We're reaching a point where we're the middle class and above are getting diminishing returns per dollar on their standard of living.  We have large houses, TVs, high speed internet, king sized beds, air conditioning, etc.  I have more stuff than I'm able to realistically use, and I can *still* afford to put extra money into my savings.

And yes, people have said the same thing in the past, but assuming that demand will automatically grow to meet supply forever is like assuming that Moore's Law will last forever.  Sooner or later, we're going to come up against the physical limits of our abilitiy to consume, and there just won't be enough unskilled jobs available to make sure that everyone has a job.  And as I said, I think we're seeing this already.  It's not going to happen instantaneously, but at this point it's not too hard to imagine a world where things are so automated that basic necessities are completely taken care of by automation.

I don't think we need to be particularly alarmist about all this stuff (it's not like one day all the robots will come out and take all of our jobs), but on the other hand, I think it's folly to assume that in a future economy where all unskilled jobs can be automated away, things are going to be the same as they are now.  As robots approach the capabilities of humans (for the purposes of doing general labor tasks) unskilled jobs are going to go away and not come back, because even for new industries, it'll be cheaper to get a robot."

TheRedGerund,AskReddit,1390338672.0,"Gross by your standards. But then, that's probably society's standards of grossness. but does that make it objectively gross? Does such a thing as objective grossness exist? Gross is extremely relative to the group you're speaking from. Then again, we're all part of a common group, so it's really about whether this is gross by reddit's standards, which is the embedded group assumption. The best way to test this would be to poll the group to see if it's gross, but upvotes will satisfy that test, at least to a better degree than what you initially said. 

So, I guess in the end it comes out that it's gross by reddit's standards, not gross by the participant's standards (possibly, some people get off on gross), and there's no such thing as objective grossness."

tyhopkin,detroitlions,1390338715.0,"&gt; Not sure you can say this guy was performing well beyond expectations.

Who said he was performing well beyond expectations?  I didn't.  I just said aside from his injury he had his best year as a Bear in year 1 of having competent offensive coaches and fully expect him to only get better.  Much like I expect Stafford to get better with quality coaching next year.

When was McCown ever under consideration for replacing Cutler?  Trestman said from day 1 and never waivered that Cutler was the starter when he got healthy.  You are making things up now.

&gt; He was performing at a level that made them seriously contemplate keeping the backup(McCown) in

Again I don't think you know what you are talking about.  The Bears were 2nd in scoring when Cutler was playing.  I'll take that any day of the week and twice on Sundays.  When McCown came in their scoring dipped, sure he put up stats, but less points against some of the worst defenses in the league.  With Cutler the Bears were scoring 30 ppg, with McCown, 22 ppg.

TheFarnell,Quebec,1390338748.0,"&gt; Avec la nature de plus en plus hétéroclite de notre immigration à mon sens c'est bien plus simple d'adopter des lois universelles qui tiendront en tout temps et en toute situation.

Je crois sincèrement pas que c'est le cas.  La réponse appropriée à une plus grande variabilité des besoins, c'est une plus grande flexibilité de l'offre.  On le voit partout dans le monde des affaires (les ""personalised user experiences"" sont maintenant la norme), des technologies (téléphones hautement personnalisables par apps et autre), et des mouvements sociaux (Occupy Wall Street et le Printemps Érable) - avec la population de plus en plus hétéroclite, le ""one-size-fits-all"" est simplement dépassé et tue dans l’œuf les échanges et la compétition d'idées qui font la force des sociétés en épanouissement.  C'est sur que c'est attirant, parce que c'est plus simple et ça permet de voir en noir-et-blanc une réalité qui est pas juste bourrée de gris, mais aussi de pleins d'autres couleurs qui ne se comparent simplement pas, mais fondamentalement, c'est tenter de repousser l'inévitable que d’enfoncer un code social unique."

turmacar,askscience,1390338757.0,"The thing is, Quantum mechanics is weird, nothing acts in a way that 'makes sense' on the macro scale without a lot of thought. The holographic universe hypothesis is a branch that is trying to bring string theory together with reletivity and get closer to a Grand Unified theory by trying to explain gravity on the Quantum scale. Its interesing, and they've had some exciting progress recently. But you have to keep in mind that much of it, especially the 'cutting edge' bits, have yet to be tested. For many of them its actually questionable how you could even attempt to test them. As such, they're very nice and ""the math all checks out"" but as it stands they're (mostly) just nice internal reference models that may or may not model (or be closer than our current models of) how the universe actually works.

As to:

&gt; A lot of what is being discovered now controdicts much of what is taught in our preliminary academia. 

This has always been the case. Students are taught easy(ier) to expand abstractions. Then you move on, draw the curtain back a bit, and teach them a harder abstraction, building on the earlier one. 

This is now you get from ""You can't subtract a big number from a smaller one, that would get you below zero, which is impossible."" to ""Now we're going to talk about imaginary numbers.""

Its how education works. It also mirrors how science advances. My favorite example being the [Luminiferous_aether](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether), which was a framework in place before we understood the dual partical/wave nature of light (/electromagnetic radiation). Our old models get phased out and become learning tools as the new models gain precidence."

If I can't affect it, I don't think you should be able to affect it either. At least not without taking it out of it's little safe haven.

SiriusHertz,Parenting,1390338859.0,"A large part of the problem is that kids don't naturally ""speak"" dog - the body language that dogs understand has to be learned/taught, and if you don't take the time to do that, then kids act like kids around the animal. When that happens, my dogs respond by treating the kid like a puppy - and if you've seen puppies play, you know they're rough by human standards. Lots of nipping and biting - and Mom doesn't hesitate to snap at pups who misbehave.

We have two large, cuddly-looking Old English sheepdogs, one of whom is friendly, the other is skittish with people and loud noises - she's a rescue, we're not sure if she was abused or if the abandonment left her so insecure. Kids love to run up and hug them, like they're great big teddy bears. A kid pulled this in public the other day - only he was eating something, and one of the dogs decided whatever it was, was now her lunch. She snapped at it, he pulled it away, and it looked to the kid's mom like our dog was snapping at his face.

After we got the food away and showed the kid how to behave around a large dog, where to pet her, how to stand, etc, everything was fine.

TL;DR: Parents, please teach your kids how to act around dogs before letting them interact with unknown dogs in public!"

bermyWHAT,BabyBumps,1390338865.0,"Did they induce because you had problems? It seems a bit weird to start the induction process before your due date if everything is fine. Although I have seen comments on here before about being getting induced at 40 weeks - maybe it's just common practice in some places.

I actually forgot to ask my doctor about the cervical sweep although it was on my mind. I had though to ask her or a midwife to do it when I went in for my induction appointment to see if that would work. It was unnecessary though because he decided he was ready to make his grand entrance the day before.

They did end up having to break my waters though. I stated with labour pains around 3am and went to hospital at 6am and was 9cm dilated. They broke my waters at 7:30ish and baby was out by 8:18am. 

I remember not wanting to get my waters broken but I don't remember why now other than I wanted as little intervention as possible but I can't remember what the arguments against it were any more.

Either way, the birth was a truly wonderful experience. Everything went extremely well with no complications. My doula and my husband were awesome. The nursing staff were awesome. My doctor was awesome. My little munchkin has been awesome."

""Due to the size of the shaft, I wouldn't recommend this for small jobs. I have noticed on bigger jobs, the extra length really helps speed it along. The first time I used this, my wife was skeptical about the finish, but after how quickly the job was done, she's an avid believer and had me use it on a patio and a few other areas, all with quick results. As with all power tools of this sort, I recommend safety glasses and a mouthgaurd to prevent splashback and chipped teeth.""

She had a big smile on her face when I was done, and even though I had the tools to get it done, I was happy to have shaved a few hours off the task. It is a little hard on the shoulders, and my hands are numb, but the extra-long shaft meant I could stay a safe distance from the mess. The only other con is she was so pleased with the Concrete Vibrat0r Extra Long Shaft by Chicago Electric Power Tools, I have had to order a backup unit and my hands are numb from all the added projects I've been given. Now I'm working at the neighbor's house, her book group, and my mother-in-law has called for my help. It is exhausting, but at least I make tips.

&gt;Here's a good way to fix gayness. Get the shit kicked out of you a few times, get laid by a beautiful woman a few times. Go to the gym and get some muscles. Take up kick boxing and kick another guys ass and get your ass kicked. Go hunt some dangerous animal. Climb a mountain.

&gt;Gayness = fixed.

It's about the social and economical disadvantages people face in our society because of their gender, and trying to restore equality. Yes, there are probably larger problems, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't address this one until the others are fixed, because that assumes they can come to a definitive solution, and other larger ones won't pop up.

As for why you should care, it starts with respect. Most people believe in the golden rule and equal opportunities for all people. If you believe in these things as well, the next step is saying, ""I want to do what I can to stop people from being treated unfairly."" Then, you will discover that women are being treated unfairly all the time, and you will set out to stop that oppression. Poof, you're a feminist.

Aside from that, I promise losing weight and keeping it off isn't as hard as you think it is.  Make little, sustainable changes.  Even if you count calories, pay attention to when you're hungry and when you're not.  Try to get used to stopping when you're full and not just eating because you think you should it or it's habit.

Don't think of ""bad"" and ""good"" food.  ""Healthy"" nights and ""cheat"" nights.  I know it works for a small number of people, but it's hard, because if you eat something ""bad"" then it's easy to keep eating ""bad"" things.  Try to eat more fruits and vegetables and whole grains but NEVER beat yourself up for not eating entirely healthy.  Tbh, calories in &gt; calories out no matter what you eat.  Eating to lose weight and eating healthy are not exactly synonymous.  Try to eat healthy MOST of the time, but you don't have to ALL of the time.  If you go over your calories, so what.  Just do better tomorrow.  Don't restrict even further.  It backfires almost every time.

Make it a lifestyle change.  That means make it bearable.  Eat how you can see yourself eating the rest of your life.  You can do it.  The most important thing is that you believe in yourself."

mdkss12,golf,1390339233.0,"i'll try to address some of your points in order:

1) her past was discovered, she committed suicide on october 18th, the article was published january 15th. her mental health may well have deteriorated due to being found out (either as a liar, as trans, or both), but she wasn't outed until well after her death.

she was outed in the course of investigative journalism that was uncovering one lie after another. if you gain public fame you lose a small amount of your privacy. if you gain this fame on the backs of lies, your entire life becomes subject to investigation. transitioning is a pretty major damn event in a persons life that is bound to turn up.

The question does arise as to whether or not to just not print this portion of the story. it was likely included because it fit the narrative of the dr being even more unusual than the story she presented (unusual meaning 'uncommon' *not* 'strange'). i didn't read it as equating gender to credentials, there i feel we will have to agree to disagree as to me that's a matter of interpretation (unless you have access to what the author intended, in which case i would defer to that info) but i do feel that when you lie to the extent that she did to gain notoriety she sacrificed her right to dictate what facts are printed about her (as long as they were facts)

2) In other posts of mine i'v stated that the writers biggest fault was ignorance of proper pronoun use (which shouldn't be tolerated, his job as a journalist is to do the research) so i don't have much to argue about on that front, as i agree with you. like you said:

&gt; even the editor, Simmons, has admitted they didn't do enough to learn about their topic.

3) this is sad no matter who it was regardless of gender, we are inundated with news of death and sometimes i think people forget that and become apathetic as this writer seemed to in this situation. i don't see this as a trans sensitivity issue however, but rather one for humanity in general.

4) true, it isn't a tabloid. it is a sports and pop culture blog. it fits the sports criteria as a human interest piece about the inventor of a golf club. this isn't the nightly news, i don't quite know what people expect to be 'newsworthy' from grantland. if dr v being a trans woman was never mentioned it would still make for a fascinating story that would deserve to be published. but that fact added depth to the complicated character that she clearly was

5) i agree that eulogy was a poor choice of words, but this relates to #3, as again, it is not a trans specific issue

6) to refer to this as a slap in the face seems to imply a malicious intent that appears simply lacking. there were certainly issues (such as #2) but notice i didn't say it was a vast overreaction. there has been outrage over the entirety of the article including the outing (which has been contentious, but i've made my argument there, refute it however you feel is best) if the complaints had been more focused on the improper pronouns then i wouldn't have found it to be, as i initially said, 'an overcorrection'

i should point out that i never thought it was only lgbt people, i said regarding lgbt, as in, in reference to

ps i hope you appreciate that i'm taking this whole discussion seriously and am not trying to offend, i merely see the situation differently. iv been having an unusually high number of discussions involving trans lately and have been doing my damnedest to articulate myself properly. if anything i'v said is improperly worded, please let me know so i can amend it. if my intent isn't clear let me know and allow me to clarify."

For venues, there are some things specific to weddings:  people may be wearing nicer things, carrying nicer gifts, getting more drunk, and thus insurance rates need to be higher.  The quality of materials may need to be nicer as well, versus a family reunion (to use your example).

T0ast1nsanity,SkincareAddiction,1390339313.0,"So, my face looked a lot like yours (if not worse) two months ago and I thought the same thing as you! I had tried a whole bunch of natural things to help it out. I was so distressed. Then I went to a derm. I found out I (not saying you do) have acne rosacea and that I am also allergic to most things people use on their face- any fragrance, parabens, dyes, etc. CerVe is awesome on my body but AWFUL on my face.

Some things I noticed from your routine/food for thought:

- Stop picking

- Replace paper towel with micro-fiber towel. If wearing makeup, use oil or gentle soap, otherwise I doubt you are getting it all off. I can't even wear makeup. it broke me out. 

- Exfoliating that often is probably damaging your skin. 

- Stridex works for some people but it can also be too harsh and cause flakes making you think that you need to exfoliate. 

- Aloe Vera is great but it is sticky and can be sealing and excess Vitamin E can cause some people to break out. I have to wash off rather promptly if I use this.

- CeraVe can make a lot of people break out. It's a miracle for others I have seen. 

Is there NO way you can go to a derm, even once? It may be all you need. Your GP or family doctor can also subscribe a lot of things for you if they deem it necessary- retinoids, azelaic acid. 

I started using a few Rx items but it honestly helped the most when i started washing with Olive oil soap and stopped putting anything else on my face. "

When I met this skinny white dude, his eyes were sunken in, he told me that he had been working until 10-11 the previous night, didn't get home to get something to eat until after midnight, and then napped until about 3am so he could get ready and be at his first job at 5 in the morning.  I was his 10am appointment, and the 3rd or 4th setup he had that day.  From what I gathered, he rarely ate, rarely slept, and was the only one of the crew that was willing to go into some of the more crime-ridden areas of town.

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1390339423.0,"Here is the beginning of the Wikipedia page on psychological manipulation:

&gt;Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the perception or behavior of others through underhanded, deceptive, or even abusive tactics.[^\[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation#cite_note-braiker-1) By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive. Social influence is not necessarily negative. For example, doctors can try to persuade patients to change unhealthy habits. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject and is not unduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation.

So it depends on the circumstances. If a doctor is trying to persuade a stubborn or ill-informed patient to accept treatment that will save their life, that could be considered positive manipulation. 

However we're talking about casual sex. The keywords in the linked quote above are **underhanded**, **deceptive** and **abusive**. Both underhanded and deceptive are synonymous with dishonorable, dishonest, unfair, ect. 

So in this scenario, a man meets a woman at a bar, they hit it off, have some drinks, share some laughs, are flirting, ect. After a little while, the guy asks the girl if she wants to come back to his place with him. The girls says, in an arguably flirty way ""Why, are you trying to get in my pants? I don't sleep around after just meeting someone."" Then the guy says ""No, I've just got this cool thing to show you. We don't have to do anything."" 

This is the important moment right here. The guy has now put himself in the situation where he is assuming the girl is being coy, and is actually interested. Both people involved right now have taken a risk. The guy is risking not getting laid, by having told the girl he doesn't want to fuck her (even though he does) in the hopes that she'll decide to have sex anyways after saying she wouldn't. The girl is risking her safety, putting her trust in the guy by going to his place, trusting that he'll respect her boundaries, whatever they may be. And women do have interests and hobbies, and whatever excuse he's made to get her back to his place might **actually** be something she's interested in. A movie she likes or pictures of Hawaii or whatever. And even if she's not planning to sleep with him that night, such a mutual interest is something she's probably filing away mentally and could influence her desire to get to know him better and sleep with him later.

Anyways, back to why manipulation is bad. Trust is important in any relationship, sexual or otherwise. Serious, or otherwise. Even with a one-night-stand, trust is in play. Manipulation is a breach of trust. Manipulation is when you lie to get laid. So when the girl goes back to the guy's apartment, they have another drink and he starts to get handsy with her and she resists and he says ""Why did you come back to my place if you didn't want to mess around?""

Because he invited her back to look at Hawaii pictures. And she trusted that he meant that. And now that she knows he lied about wanting to share something with her, that he only wanted to get in her pants and didn't actually care about her conversation or company, she wonders what else he lied about that night. Probably everything. It was probably all about getting laid. And that feels pretty bad, that realization that the person you've been spending time with was being disingenuous. She feels hurt and leaves. Or worse, she gets guilted or pressured into sex she didn't want. And that's an awful feeling. You feel dirty, used.

Of course, maybe she *was* playing coy and she is receptive to the advances and everyone's happy. But you don't know for sure what's going through her mind and it is incredibly dangerous to assume that a woman is just being coy when she says she's not interested. 

And I also want to address the notion that a woman will turn down going home with a guy because she wants to have sex but is afraid of being labeled a slut. I get so annoyed any time I see that line of reasoning mentioned. It's such a ridiculous oversimplification. There are almost an infinite number of reasons why a woman might turn down sex with a guy she's attracted to. Maybe her stomach isn't feeling well. Maybe she's on her period. Maybe she's casually seeing someone else and she doesn't want to mess that up. Maybe she knows she's had too much to drink and wants to clear her head before she decides to fuck him. Maybe he reminds her of someone she wouldn't have sex with, like a relative, and that would be weird. Maybe there's some good chemistry there but he's said something that was a deal breaker, not enough to walk away but she wouldn't sleep with him because of it, like political opinions. Maybe she's due for her bi-yearly pap smear and would rather wait until she gets her results back before sleeping with someone. Maybe it's been a while since she's gone out and she hasn't shaved in months and would rather do that before sleeping with someone new. Maybe she has to be up early for work. Or a test. Or an appointment. Or she promised to help someone move. Maybe she has a friend who she promised to be there for, who is mourning, who is going through a breakup. Maybe she's Catholic and she gave up sex for Lent. My point is that it could be anything.

But being seen as a slut? By who? By the guy trying to get in her pants? By the other random people at the bar? Why should she care what random strangers think? And why should she worry about the guy trying to fuck her thinking she's slutty? Isn't he, you know, trying to fuck her? That concept just doesn't make sense to me."

It is less stressed now, but it's still common to go to places like Lourdes or Santiago de Compostela.

dunnoyabassa,relationship_advice,1390339533.0,"here's the thing:

this girl is currently at the beginning of TWO relationships.  one with you and one with her child.  the latter is, for all intents and purposes permanent, which means YOU are at the start of two relationships as well, assuming you aren't planning on breaking up with this girl.  full disclosure: ending this relationship immediately seems like your best bet to me, but i know nothing about you at all so i'll lead you through a look at your options.

option 1:  break up with girl now.  start afresh and eventually seek someone else that doesn't come with the baggage of an anonymous ""asshole's"" children (typically a fairly doable thing when you're under 30).

option 2:  stay with this girl, but break up before the child is born.  pretty much the same fallout as option one except you both endure a lot more pain and suffering from the breakup after the longer duration of your relationship.

option 3:  stay with this girl long term, but not permanently.  congratulations you just became the asshole who walked out on a mother and child who came to rely on you as a source of support (whether that be emotional, financial, or otherwise).

option 4:  stay with this girl permanently.  you become the surrogate father to the child of another man whom the mother dubs an ""asshole.""  hope you're up for the task."

You could save a tiny bit of money on the CPU by switching yourself down to a 4-core, but really, the 6300 is good enough value that it's not really worth it unless you're extremely price-pressed. The PSU is more than good enough. You probably won't need a CPU cooler unless you really, want it to be quiet, and even then there are better options. I'd look at maybe spending that money over on the video card instead. 

It looks like you've done your research!

The only potential thing to look at would be if you wanted to make sure you could crossfire the card in the future, as a cheap upgrade path.

manunderboard,RBI,1390339801.0,"I found the mother's Facebook (Rebecca Vance, it's on the page OP linked), it looks like this is legit, and the money they are raising is to create a $5000 reward for finding her. 

This is what someone said on one of her posts (I'm not sure what her relation is to the family): ""Law enforcement are not helping. They will only arrive to an address when Rebecca receives a tip which includes a physical address, all they do is ask if she is there, and leave. Of course an adult is going to lie instead of admit they are harboring a minor, and providing her with alcohol and possible drugs. The best route is reward money. Rebecca has been dealing with this since the 15th. She knows what she is doing. Fresno Police Department will not even see to it that Autumn is placed on the news, nor will they actively search for her. It is up to the public to spread these posts and prospectively help with even minimal amounts of donations.""

Her mother also said ""the police checked out a lead... these 2 kids knew where she was. She was seen with them moments before we got there. the police asked them a few times, kids refused info, laughed about it, treated it like a joke. cops wished me luck and left.""

Redsnork,AskReddit,1390339830.0,"I was at a concert, and it started getting cold out. I wanted to go back to my car and get a jacket. I saw a cop car (which I thought was unoccupied) and decided to slide across the hood like they do in the movies. After I slid, I saw the cop about two rows away in the parking lot. I made eye contact with him as he yelled at me. I ran away into the woods near the side of the parking lot. I hid behind a tree while I listened to him search for me. After about 10 minutes, I snuck back to my car. The night before, I had returned from a road trip, and still had a packed suitcase with me. I completely changed clothes, put rolled up socks in my shoes to appear taller, and used an electric trimmer to completely shave off my beard. I calmly walked back to the venue, and walked past the police car I had slid on, with the policeman beside it. Right where I had slid, there was a huge dent from my ass. When I came back to the concert, none of my friends recognized me.

Tl;dr: I am a master of disguise."

ProffieThrowaway,Purdue,1390339852.0,"I'm really not sure why you are being downvoted so much. I'm a prof and this terrifies me. I don't go a single term without a student who cheated, never attended class, or whatever begging, bullying, or just plain threatening me to try to get a higher grade. Lots of people give in because they are scared, don't want to be ""reported"" to the dean or chair by an unhappy student (I'm glad to be in a position where those folks back up my grading), or because they are physically frightened by the student or think they will be fired. 

My current institution has good policies in place for reporting of students who we fear violence from, but when I was earning my PhD I didn't have that kind of luck. Instead, the director of the program I was in actually told a TA that she was lucky she wasn't fired for having a violent student removed from her class (he physically threatened her in front of 20 witnesses, all of whom backed up the TA's story). 

So yes, this is a real concern of teachers and yes it may lead to more grade inflation. It's awful. :( "
