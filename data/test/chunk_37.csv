By the time that church figures actually started talking in person about their condemnation of porn and masturbation and such, their words held no weight with me.

But make sure your wrists are nice and loose before you do things like handstand pushups. And when you're at the computer don't do [this](http://www.purdue.edu/rem/safety/graphics/wristdont.jpg). When you're sleeping, keep your wrists at a neutral state, don't sleep on them or hyper extend them for any reason, and try not to sleep on the wrists.

One thing that I actually do a lot is that when I get into bed or when I'm grabbing something off of my bed, I'll put my wrist palm down and then the bed will depress a little and hyper extend my wrist, my wrists gets really messed up from doing stuff like that, so when you have to put your hand on your bed, use your finger tips.

[Here is a video on wrist injury prevention and stretches.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pcPb4zprYM).

For your knees, don't lift stuff with your knees, again, you probably know this, but when you are squatting drive through your heels. When you are getting up from the ground, and you happen to have weights on, use whatever support you can, don't try to strength your way back up onto your feet, it wreaks havoc on your knees. When you land from heights, land on the balls of your feet and keep your descent as smooth as possible, don't straight leg land on your feet, you will snap up your legs so easily that way.

llama_in_galoshes,exchristian,1389741522.0,"I became an atheist just over a year ago.  It was only last week that I sat down and tried to deal with the resentment I'd held for the church.  And myself-I was so embarrassed to have ""evangelized"" to so many people.  I sat down to journal about this, ready to beat myself up about it for the millionth time.  Then I realized how unproductive it is.  And since you can't do the same thing over and over expecting different results, I went for self-forgiveness instead.  

Next I worked on forgiving the people who hurt me in the name of the church.  I figured that none of them were intentionally hurting me.  None of them were secretly atheists, maliciously handing me down a faulty belief system just to watch me squirm.  They were simply acting in the way they believed was best.  Just like when I evangelized to people, I just wanted to help.  Maybe they just wanted to help me, too. 

Your situation sounds a bit sticker than mine, but again, I have to believe that they weren't trying to be assholes about it, even though they were assholes.  I assume they're just acting how they were raised to believe, and were never taught or allowed to think for themselves.  You know?  Compassion for the people who hurt me feels better long term than perpetual anger.  

We WANT to be angry at people who have hurt us! But they aren't sitting there thinking about us, we are the ones who are hurting ourselves, over and over, by continuing to be angry and resentful.

Strangely, as a Christian I could never forgive myself.  True forgiveness only came after I gave it all up.  I hope you'll use this time to decide what values are important to YOU, not the values you SHOULD have according to a book or rules or some people supposedly ""wiser"" than you.  

The best way I can find to deal with religious folks (since I'm still working in religious circles) is to be be RIDICULOUSLY, RADICALLY  loving.  Not in the sense that I tolerate everything, but in the sense that if someone makes a sexist comment, I speak up about it.  Gently and kindly. If someone's spreading a rumor, I refuse to take part in it, and try to get the person to quit spreading it. If anything, I want to show that it's not religion that makes a decent person a decent person.  "

I try very hard to be respectful of people in my life and I think that asking others to respect me in turn is a reasonable request.  

Try your best to keep your comments as an ""I"" statement.  Pause before you say something.  This requires you to take ownership of your feelings.  If he responds with ""well you"" or ""but you""  You can respond with we are each entitled to our own opinions, and in this case I respectfully disagree.   
My reason for talking about this is that it's really important to me.  

As an aside, either he is totally unaware he's doing it or he actually doesn't respect you.  Don't bother asking him to change or trying to change him, other than to positively reinforce when he does something you are happy about.  Be clear about what is important to you and let him make his own choices."

I hate DRM as much as anyone here (probably more), but the effect of this clause is that you can't make use of CC-BY work on, say, iOS, because of the app store's built-in DRM.  I can certainly understand a term like this being in CC-BY-SA, but it seems pretty silly to say that you can't use technical measures to restrict reuse of a work when you can easily use *legal* measures to do it.  **There is no CC license that requires attribution but has no restrictions on technical use.

LawBobLoblaw,IAmA,1389742098.0,"The most important focus on this topic is removing the opportunity for exploiters to exploit, rescuing the exploited currently in that situation, and healthily reintegrating them back into society. If a sex worker wants to become a sex worker on her own, and enters into a law-abiding deal with a brothel that takes care of their own, then outside of my own moral disagreements, I'm not going to stand in her way.

Majority of sex worker cases are not under the umbrella of protection in a non-exploitative way. And, from everything I've read, legalized opportunities only create more illegal opportunities, and the utopia of legalized prostitution works well on paper, but never in actuality. Humans always want more, always want worse, and are never satisfied. Just look at porn addictions causing tastes to shift. This isn't the drug trade, this is people selling people. If legalizing prostitution actually showed legitimate drops in human trafficking, then I would still not like the idea, but I would prefer it to keeping it illegal. But, that doesn't seem to be the case.

http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/human-trafficking-persists-despite-legality-of-prostitution-in-germany-a-902533.html

The article doesn't match what catbarf states as a nice brothel run by caring women, but it does show how inept governments can make things worse, which is  what I'm afraid of.

&gt; Five years after it was introduced, the Family Ministry evaluated what the new legislation had achieved. The report states that the objectives were ""only partially achieved,"" and that deregulation had ""not brought about any measurable actual improvement in the social coverage of prostitutes."" Neither working conditions nor the ability to exit the profession had improved. Finally, there was ""no solid proof to date"" that the law had reduced crime.

&gt; In a poll conducted by Ver.di, a brothel operator said that she valued the prostitution law because it reduced the likelihood of raids. In fact, she said, the law was more advantageous for brothel operators than prostitutes.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AskReddit,1389742205.0,"well i suppose that is actually valid if you accept that those who are involved in ""war"" are somehow less ""innocent"" or more deserving of losing their life (and therefore less of a victim).

Personally i find that particular notion equally ridiculous, and believe the way the phrase is presented implies that their victim status is that they have to ""Pick up the pieces"" of the loss, yet it ignores the fact  those that lose their lives to war have actually lost everything. as when you die you not only lose your daughter wife sister mother father etc, but everything and everyone and all sensations and existence itself

on the sliding scale of victim hood surely being killed has to be pretty much the end scale, ""(other than perhaps unimaginable extreme prolonged torture)

If you subscribe to your devils advocate point (which is a valid interpretation) you are fundamentally declaring there is no such thing as a ""Just war"" and that to partake in any armed conflict is to diminish your ""innocence"" which would be an extremely radical stance for  Hilary Clinton to take, which leads me to believe that is not what she means.

azayii,books,1389742377.0,"Seems sadly like I've given away most of my Wicca books when I got my Kindle, probably because I don't practice anymore. Wish I hadn't, now - there were some interesting ones I couldn't get to.

Of the ones I have, or remember:
Fire Child - Maxine Sanders, an autobiography of the wife of the founder of Alexandrian Wicca - like I said, one of the two main branches. I was very interested in women in relation to Wicca at the time.

Witchcraft Today - Gerald Gardner, which is by the founder of the *other* branch. I never read it, so I don't know if it was any good, but I know it has stuff on the history of Paganism, including it being seen as a ""cult"" and stuff like that - so might have some of what you're looking for.

Drawing Down the Moon - Margot Adler, from what I remember, a beautiful, interesting book about Pagan traditions, and how it is practiced etc. Upon Googling, found an about.com page that said it was both entertaining, and ""read like well-done thesis"". Academic and factual, unlike what it says about Gardner's book... However, not much on the history, mostly about American Pagans. It was highly recommended by a lady who worked at a Pagan bookshop in Covent Garden (which, if you're in the UK, you *have* to visit if you have an interest in the Occult - it's where my coven was, too).

The problem is, most of my books are for someone on the path of Paganism, and not much interested in the history. The history doesn't come around a lot when your Wiccan - it's a long forgotten persecution of something that can loosely called a religion - loosely, because I don't like the idea of Paganism being boxed into ""religion"", it feels a lot more than that. Not to get all spiritual on you, haha.

Here's the thing; practicing witches (which, usually - except maybe for Druids, I'm not sure about them - you call the males and females) don't engage with the past because it seems so silly looking back. The first principle a witch is told is that everything you do - every spell you cast - it all comes back threefold, good or bad. It's about being one with nature, and is very similar to Buddhism, except Pagans have deities. Although I witnessed prejudgement first hand (one of my Jehovah friends stopped talking to me because she thought I had turned devil-worshipper), religion doesn't come up enough anymore. Magic isn't taken seriously by anyone outside of Wicca. Anyway, you might be better off looking for books by non-Pagans, or by historian Pagans, which I sadly don't have, if you want persecution.

Sadly, now your OP has gone, I can't remember your exact specifications, but if you PM me, I'd be happy to dig around in my old haunts, Wicca forums and the like, to see if anyone has got anything, if you tell me what you want again. Sorry for the ridiculous text wall. I forget how much I miss that way of life, get all nostalgic like."

MusingMagus,TrueAskReddit,1389742563.0,"Ah.  So the right to marry a consenting adult you love and who loves you is a special right... if you're gay or a lesbian.  Interesting.

There are many things I could say to you about your point of view.  I could compare it to that of bigots during the civil rights movements who felt that African Americans who wanted equal treatment were demanding ""special rights"".  I could point out that the LGBT community does not, in fact, have equal rights, and give you examples like benefits that are based on marital status that are unavailable to gay couples who have been together in a monogamous relationship for decades (but *are* available to straight couples who haven't been together a fraction of that time), or like the fact that, without the current fight for EQUAL rights, not SPECIAL rights, people who choose to be open about their non-straight sexuality would still be banned from serving in the United States military (remember that?  That lasted 18 years).  I could also mention other things.  I could fill this thread with them, honestly.  I could point out how there's nothing inherently WRONG with overthrowing laws, as laws aren't necessarily meant to be forever.  I could point out how many religious people seem to think their values are somehow all important...when it comes to homosexuality (which predates Christianity and Judaism, by the way, in case you thought primacy was somehow an argument against it), even though the VERY SAME BOOK that gets quoted over and over again ""forbidding"" homosexuality (Leviticus) also forbids eating shellfish, uncovering your heads, wearing garments that are a mixture of linen and wool, cutting your beard, getting tattoos or piercings, drinking wine in the tabernacle (awk-ward), and working on the Sabbath.

I could walk out in public with piercings, tattoos, a well-trimmed beard, no hat, and a shirt of mixed fabrics, head to a pub, and buy an order of clams.  No one would give two shits.  No one.  Seriously.  But if my friend (who happens to be in a loving relationship that's lasted longer than any of mine have) kisses his boyfriend in public, suddenly he has to deal with condemnations and hellfire speeches. 

If I wanted to, right now, I could drive down to Vegas and marry my girlfriend... provided I could actually convince her to do so.  My friend can't, and you want to say gay and lesbian couples have as many rights as straight ones do?  Get out of here.  Seriously.

Marriage between two people not only legitimizes the relationship in the eyes of many people, it CONFERS TANGIBLE BENEFITS.  And you're calling the desire for equal treatment in marriage petty?  Yeah, okay.

TLDR: No, they don't have equal rights.  Wanting what straight couples have isn't ""wanting special rights"", it's wanting equality.  Religion is not an effective argument against gay rights.  Existing laws are not an effective argument against gay rights, insofar as the argument you're using is ""but they're trying to change laws!""  So what?  People change laws all the time.  That's how the law works.  

EDIT: Honestly, though, this is all just wasted fucking time, as you yourself said, in another post, after someone provided FAR better points than I:

&gt;You can argue with me until the cows come home, but homosexuality (the act) is wrong *and nothing you say will change my mind*

How is that better or worse than eg. Yorkshire wanting to allow prisoners to vote but being forbidden by London courts?

&gt;There was never a vote on the direction to take the EU.

Has there ever been a vote on the direction to take the UK, or Spain, ...?

&gt;At least with an elected president people would have an idea of the direction of the EU.

The current European top level officials are appointed for their reconciliation skills. Electing a president would just bork the healthy parliamentary dynamics and turn it into a US-style polarized mudslinging fest without real alternatives. No thanks.

That is your opinion. There is no fundamental reason it should not. In any case: ""However, such extension requires a unanimous vote in the Council (Article 153(2) TFEU)."" National vetoes still apply.

lendrick,computergraphics,1389742617.0,"This is more believable than most.  There's nothing about this render that gives me an ""uncanny valley"" feeling, although there's one tip-off to me that makes it not look completely real, namely the hair.  If you look closely at the places where the hair curves, it's obvious that it's made up of little straight lines.  If your hairs had more subdivisions, this render would be nearly indistinguishable from a photo.  Also, most people, even women, have a tiny amount of ""peach fuzz"" on some parts of their face.  It doesn't bother me that it's not there, but it would probably look slightly more real if it were.  Again, this is something you definitely don't want to overdo.

Also, you might want to add a *very very small* amount of blur and then a very small amount of noise in post, to simulate having taking the picture on a real lens.  It's seems to me like it's a teeny bit too sharp.

(Note that people will always find tiny nitpicks, but a better way to figure out how well you're doing is to have the image pass a ""turing test"" -- that is, include it in a bunch of similar photographs and see how many people correctly guess which one is the render.)

A couple things stand out as being very good about this image:

* You didn't overdo the SSS.  A lot of renders look like foam rubber.
* You didn't overdo the reflection in the eyes.  A lot of renders look like the eyes are made of water.

IMO, overcorrecting for common problems often takes people right back into the uncanny valley, and you avoided that.  Excellent work. :)

professor__doom,AskHistorians,1389742733.0,"&gt; That written language for instance was a new invention and had not always existed?

Plato was certainly aware that written language was a new invention, and offered a pretty scathing criticism of the written-word-as-authoritative-source in [his dialog ""Phaedrus.""](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/phaedrus.html)

He attests to the Greek view that the Egyptian civilization was older than theirs, and states that it was the Egyptians who developed writing:

&gt;At the Egyptian city of Naucratis, there was a famous old god, whose name was Theuth; the bird which is called the Ibis is sacred to him, and he was the inventor of many arts, such as arithmetic and calculation and geometry and astronomy and draughts and dice, but his great discovery was the use of letters. Now in those days the god Thamus was the king of the whole country of Egypt; and he dwelt in that great city of Upper Egypt which the Hellenes call Egyptian Thebes, and the god himself is called by them Ammon. To him came Theuth and showed his inventions, desiring that the other Egyptians might be allowed to have the benefit of them; he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired about their several uses, and praised some of them and censured others, as he approved or disapproved of them. It would take a long time to repeat all that Thamus said to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts. But when they came to letters, This, said Theuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit. Thamus replied: O most ingenious Theuth, the parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them. And in this instance, you who are the father of letters, from a paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to them a quality which they cannot have; for this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners' souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves. The specific which you have discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality. 

Seems like Plato wasn't a huge fan of the written word!

And it's no surprise that Plato should have these words come from Socrates, who championed inquiry and dialog as the means by which the truth may be fleshed out:

&gt;I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence. And the same may be said of speeches. You would imagine that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and put a question to one of them, the speaker always gives one unvarying answer. And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or defend themselves.

cloudynights,buildapc,1389742774.0,"I play MMO's, so I know about latency. =/ At least in mmo's, 50~60ms for ping isn't that bad at all, anything over 100ms is slightly noticable - with over 200 def being noticable. I use [Leatrix Latency Fix](http://www.leatrix.com/latencyfaq)(which is just a executable that does the same registry change you could do for the same effect.) and I honestly haven't run into latency issues at all with it and how my wireless is set up for my house. Server location of the game you're playing will also affect latency.

What type of wireless are you using(a/b/g/n)? And here's a [guide](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21132/change-your-wi-fi-router-channel-to-optimize-your-wireless-signal/)(though apparently the program they use there isn't free anymore for the pc, but has a free andriod app? that's silly.[this would also work](http://download.cnet.com/Xirrus-Wi-Fi-Inspector/3000-18508_4-75758254.html), or you can hunter for an older version of inSSIDer) that may simplify any process you'd think you'd need in order to fix any channel interference. What model wireless router do you have, along with what type of intel pci-e adapter? Most wireless adapters advertise being capable of running..lets say 100mbps, however that was a *perfect*, disturbance free room. When you're shopping for a wireless adapter, you should pretty much expect to only get near half of that. Depending on your intel pci-e adapter, even if you're getting/paying for 75mbps down, if you only have a pci-e wireless card that's old as balls(54mbps advertised)..even if you're playing 40 feet from the wireless router..you shouldn't expect to hit half of the 75mbps(only in part due to not checking to see if there's interference, for one). If the wireless you mentioned is Wireless-N or no one runs anything lower than wireless g, and your wireless router is capable of up to 300/150 mbps(like an adapter, this is in a perfect setting, however my wireless n router is capable of running both modes, so you might wanna check into switching)..you should look into updating your wireless card(laptop or not. You would only have to uninstall the drivers for the old intel one that would be built into the laptop, and disable it via device manager, and it'd have to be a USB adapter). 

If you have another person on the wireless network, that's going to lower it. I think if you're on a 802.11g wireless network and using a wireless G adapter..if another pc joins the fray with a wireless B card, then your speed may be lowered - since 802.11g is backwards compatible[[link](http://its.uiowa.edu/support/article/2168)]. Interference isn't something that's super hard to figure out - I'm back @ my pc now so here:[link](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21132/change-your-wi-fi-router-channel-to-optimize-your-wireless-signal/). But the biggest potential for wireless speeds is going to be your card and wireless router. 

I have more than one PC that relies on wireless in my house, and 2 of them use a USB High-Gain [TP Link USB](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833704045) wireless N adapter. They get around 50mbps, which is 1/3 of the advertised speeds but since my connection is only 100mbps down anyway, that's great.  Our wireless router is on the first floor, near the west side of the house, and my room is in the NW side of the second floor. I use a intel centrino wireless-n 2230(currently using a m-ITX board that has one plugged in) and I get around 45~50mbps down - which is half of what I'd get wired, mind you, but getting half that is great for a wireless adapter. I raid in my MMO perfectly fine and my raid mates are surprised to learn that I'm on wireless.

If your wireless card is at least 100mbps, and you go through that guide and still have issues, then you should look into powerline adapters. Sadly, I rent(in a duplex house) and it wouldn't be worth it to me to buy since I have issues already with my circuit breaker making enough noise during the summer and just to only use it during the winter..wouldn't justify the purchase to me."

I can hunt up some verse references if you really want them.

Et là ou une femme se fait *imposer* un certain vêtement par un autre (ou là ou quelqu'un discrimine contre les homosexuels), l'état devrait agir.  Mais imposer qu'une femme ne puisse *pas* porter un certain vêtement de son propre gré *au cas où* on lui impose, c'est pas la traiter en égal."

Omega037,changemyview,1389743020.0,"&gt; The US has been a democratic republic continuously since 1789 - compare that to everyone else and the resultant bloodshed and families destroyed in Europe, Russia, and China.

Well, much of those issues were due to external conflicts, which aren't really relevant.  Not to mention, this seems to ignore the Civil War and Indian Wars, but I digress.

If you actually look at a list of countries who have banned guns versus those that haven't there really isn't a correlation between removing guns and ""bloodshed and families destroyed.""  Nor between having guns and preventing it.  

Russian citizens had guns during the pogroms and purges, German citizens had guns during the Nazi regime, and Chinese citizens had guns during the Communist revolution.

Alternatively, most countries that have banned guns in the past 50 years have been relatively peaceful and stable.

Beyond this, the whole line of reasoning is flawed.  Governments generally don't just turn on all the people.  The ugly truth is that it is usually the government working with a large amount of the populace who do these things.  Hitler, Stalin, and Mao would have had little power without the support of many people under them, especially those with guns.

Regardless, for this to be an effective argument, you would also need to show that the populace having guns would be a deterrent to the military.

Thus, your view requires two assumptions:

1. If the whole US military suddenly decided to take over the country, that attempt would be successfully deterred by civilians with assault rifles.

2. The removing guns from the populace would have no impact on the number of homicides in the US.

Do you believe these facts are true?"
aprildh08,AskWomen,1389743022.0,"I entered my first relationship at 23. I had almost no experience with guys prior to that (had been on 3-4 dates but nothing developed and then had some ld shit with a friend that turned out to be awful and left me really fucked up). 

Unfortunately (?) most of my concerns were kind of selfish. In the very, very beginning, like pre-exclusivity, I was concerned about losing my ""me time"" because I'm very much an introvert. The thought of spending SO MUCH time with another human being made me tired, let alone actually doing it. I was also concerned that my fucked-upness would result in my hurting him, that I would suck at the whole sex thing, that he'd get bored of me, that I would have to *hide* so much of my crazy because otherwise he'd definitely dump me, etc.

The more time we spent together, though, it just got easier and easier to *be* around him, y'know? I wasn't acting or hiding or anything, I was just being me and doing what came naturally to me. I realized, since he was sticking around, that he wasn't bored with me. I realized that I could tell him things that I was feeling or thinking that I knew were silly, and he wouldn't get mad or upset or weirded out, because he cared about me. I realized that I *wanted* to spend time with him, as much as possible, and I wanted to be someone on whom he could depend.

Regardless of what others do or how others enter/maintain relationships, ultimately you just have to do you. Go at your own pace. Do what feels right to you.

And good luck!"

That being said, being a college student has taught me that acts of sexual assault and harassment do exist on a spectrum to some degree-- frat guys do make girls really, really uncomfortable. I've also had people who I am very close to get raped. Obviously nobody's going to come out and say that they would rape another person under certain circumstances, but it remains a pretty big problem in our society. Women are constantly treated as sexual objects, and their status as people with a right to do what they wish with their own bodies is not as widely respected as it is often made out to be. I don't believe that our culture is fucked up to the extent that SJWs do, and I think their vitriolic outlook is extremely counterproductive, but at the same time I won't deny that we have some serious problems to address. Boys *should* be taught to respect girls. Gender roles *should* receive less of a focus."
tattedspyder,tattoo,1389743077.0,"People have already covered most of the problems with this style but after the artist's skill the next big thing that determines how long a tattoo stays looking good is how well you take care of your skin and your body.  

If you follow the aftercare carefully and make sure it heals right you're off to a good start.  After that you need to avoid exposing it to the sun as much as possible, regularly use moisturizers, use sunblock when you can't avoid the sun, stay hydrated, don't gain or lose a lot of weight, avoid injuries to the area, etc.

My opinion, as someone with 16 tattoos (some of them had to be redone), is that the watercolor style only looks good when it is executed perfectly, if it's not done just right it just looks like a poorly colored tattoo and with so many fine details and deliberately light areas it just won't age well.  If it's done well you'll have a nice tattoo for 5 years, a good one for 5 more, and then all bets are off."

ElderKingpin,NoStupidQuestions,1389743210.0,"*Disclaimer: I suggest you ask a closer family member or a close friend for advice instead of random strangers on the internet

&gt; I disregard gender roles. They are anti-egalitarian.

You can disregard gender roles if you want, but you can't disregard responsibility, if the woman will not step up to to the plate, then you need to.

&gt; Humanity? Forgiveness? Divinity? Err? What?

It was simply saying that everyone makes mistakes, but if you want to be above and beyond, you have to forgive those mistakes. Err is a another way to say ""mess up""

&gt; What is 'moving on' considered as here? How do I do this? What?

You're posting on reddit about how you're having troubles with the lady and that you're confused, kinda angry, kinda upset, and generally, you are not at peace of mind. How do you do this? Well I can't teach you how to move on, because even if I told you exactly how to move on, it's up to you to not only figure out what that means, but to also do it by yourself. I can't move on for you.

&gt; How is that an answer at all? What exactly are you answering? This only seems like just a reply/remark.

I'm answering your problem in the most blunt and simple way that it could be answered. As big as a mountain as your current situation is, time will pass, things will change, you will change, situations will change, and suddenly the thing that troubles you the most will suddenly fade. Leave your emotions for a moment and look at the big picture, you're still ""young"" and you have more ahead of you. Simply put, life goes on.

&gt; The distance of past events is relative beyond objective measurement. It is also arbitrary.

Previous answer. 

&gt; What faults should I be accepting? And again, gender roles.

Ok when I say faults I dont actually mean that either of you were in the wrong, but most definitely neither of you both acted OPTIMALLY in the current situation or in the past situation. What could you have done better to prevent this problem from arising.

Coming out a better man isn't a gender role, its simply becoming a better person. If you were a woman I would say come out a better woman.

I use a lot of analogies because they, IMO, best represent what I'm trying to convey."

* Toasted cheese pita panini with olives and tea
* Cheese on toast, 2-3 slices with milk/tea ( One of my favs!)

This is a very strange convention around here I find. People are distinguishing between being nice and being kind, and somehow determining that being nice means you are a pussy. It's crazy. You can be a nice guy who is also strong, won't back down from confrontation, and is socially adept."

No, it doesn't, because it, at least for a time, had one instructor who admittedly was changing grades for money. Whether the school sanctioned it or not, that reflects on the integrity of the school and the grades and degrees handed out there, even if only a little.

But, in reality, those boosters were doing that because they knew it would work...because they have done it before.

Other behaviors like feeling overly responsible are not normal. If a friend is grumpy because they had a bad day, normal people do not spend the day wondering ""What did I do wrong?"" They recognize that they are not responsible for the feelings of others. Another example is the expression of needs. Is it selfish to have needs?

So at about 4 am or so, the group of us decide to go to a local pizza joint that caters to the drunk. It is open till like, 6 am on weekends because of that. I was saying the whole time that i wasn't hungry at all, until the pizza got there, which i devoured (and dipped in ranch. that was a new one, and quite delicious), but that is besides the point.

So i run into the guy that i used to HATE back in high school. He was super obnoxious, loud, and just all around annoying. So my friends were over there talking to him (we all went to high school together), when i hear my name being shouted by him. So i walk over to his table and he lays this line on me, ""Iris! Hey! You got hot!!"", to which drunk iris pulled a Han Solo and said ""i know"" and walked away. In my defense, i really did dislike him, but normally i am not that rude.

After that incident, two of the girls went into the bathroom. And encountered a girl peeing in the sink. And then the sink broke. And then the drunk girl got all sorts of pissed off.

THEN, outside there was supposedly some sort of incident involving a gun being pulled? something? i really have no clue. i was inside eating what tasted like the best pizza of my life.

THEEEENNNNNN, we all go home. I am crashing on the birthday girls couch, and i am passed out. /u/xaffinityx is on the couch next to me. She CALLS me to wake me up that way i can hear the birthday girl having sex with her boyfriend. Yeah, thanks for that.

Oh, and bonus, that night our DD /u/chizzle91 who had to drive all our drunk asses around (poor poor chizzle. that was a rough job) got knocked up that night by her dude.


So yeah, that was a interesting night.


Edit: In addition, /u/xaffinityx almost left with the guy previously mentioned that i hated. She also hated him too. But he made a convincing argument of free food and hookah.

Baldish,PlayStationPlus,1389743761.0,"I used to be Physical Only until recently when I had a realization. I love having physical ownership, the responsibility to take care of my stuff, the artwork, the ability to have a collection.

 About 6 months ago, I realized that I was running out of space on my entertainment console to store games. I also realized that going back to the XMB and starting up a game was way easier and faster than getting up, finding the game, making sure that the actual game was in the case(bad habit), then back to my couch. Call me lazy, I'll call my self efficient. 

Since I'll probably head to university this year and might take it with me during the second year, it's much easier to grab the console rather than 10 game cases in addition. If I want to, I could get a new TV stand without many shelves. 

It's nice to have digital games if you have the hard drive space. "

_TIXCY_,incest,1389743885.0,"&gt; If you makes it too difficult, you will drive people away. Some of us are old and not so computer savvy , but we enjoy this group.

Tags aren't to make it too difficult. Some people already include tags in their titles. At most, authors would have to type six extra letters into their title. That's not difficult at all. 

We're not asking you to design a webpage, we're asking for [brackets] to be placed into your title.

&gt; I'm concerned that too many rules are going to stifle input from new users.

If someone wants to share their story, adding a few extra letters into the title wont stop them. If anything, this might stop some of the posts that are obviously spam or trolls from making it to the front page because these people rarely view the rules.

&gt; Will this be retroactive, or just from posts starting on the 22nd?

/u/GayGiles: New posts only. We're using AutoModerator to manage this and it only checks posts after the rules were added

&gt; What's the purpose of being so strict about those? As long as they're tagged why's it matter?

Because people like to get creative with their tags. I've seen people use things like ""I'[m] interested in my mom,"" to indicate mom/son and while it works, it makes it harder to sort through things.

I'm going to say that the majority of users here have a ""preferred"" scenario as far as incest goes. If they prefer [M/s] it's easier to just go through the posts and see if there's a tag or **search for it** rather than skimming 30 unrelated posts.

&gt; Mod power trip time.

A mod power trip would be us implementing this with zero feedback from users. If you take a look at the poll spreadsheet, you'd see that 93% of users who voted wanted this. We asked for feedback, we put a poll up, and we took responses. 


ALSO, I like that NO ONE commented on my little fun fact! :("
oldneckbeard,programming,1389743888.0,"we're building an eventually-consistent graph representation of our rdbms. with 1.8.x and 1.9.x, even with a unique constraint on the index, we would end up with more than one node referenced at an index. This was because the ""constraint"" wasn't caught until later, the code (using the Traversal API) completed just fine. 

We even narrowed it down so that all writes (we were trying to do about 1000/sec) went to 1 box (the master, routed through a hardware LB). We would still sporadically end up with ""More than one element matches..."" exceptions. 

I ended up writing a locking mechanism using JGroups so that threads have to request exclusive access to a synthetic key (entity-id basically), have the whole cluster agree on it, and only then could they modify or create it. It's really hackish, but it works. 

The basic access pattern that caused the issue was something like this: 

1. Request A comes in, wants to create record R1
2. Request B comes in, wants to update record R1
3. Request A looks to see if R1 exists. It does not. 
4. Request B looks to see if R1 exists. It does not. 
5. Request A commits R1. No errors
6. Request B commits R1. No errors
7. User requests record R1 (using a REST interface we put in there as a plugin), and gets an exception. 

Basically, as long as both transactions were opened without R1 existing, they would both let R1 be committed, and only later would it complain to us. "
pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389743889.0,"I've encountered a handful of guys who think tickling or poking me is an acceptable flirting technique. Once I was with a guy (someone I knew, so I couldn't downright be rude to him) and he kept poking my stomach ""playfully"". I slapped his hand away and it brushed my boob, at which point he said defensively that if I had just not overreacted he wouldn't have touched me inappropriately. NO, DINGDONG. If you think any form of touching is okay except groping my boobs and privates, you are wrong. Him touching me over and over on my stomach bothered me a lot more than the accidental boob sweep. I had a coworker who liked to tickle me in the middle of the restaurant I was working at. When I would go in the kitchen he would pick me up and spin me around. I would resist it and struggle but he saw it as a game. Guys too often think we are just being coy when we resist them or tell them to stop. It's a shame because he was kind of cute--I would have given him a chance but his behavior toward me convinced me he was an asshole. 

TL;DR Guys should not ""playfully"" touch girls and ignore all the signs that they are uncomfortable. It is basically sexual harassment regardless of where you touch them."

They hate women because the set of world views is condusive to hating women. Nothing in TRP tells men to hate women.

&gt;They are pro-murder though, I never claimed they were. Nor did I say they were has hateful as genocide.

You just made a huge fallacy....you claim TRP is evil/fascist, then say feminism doesn't do X, Y, and Z and therefore it's not fascist, but TRP doesn't do X, Y, and Z either, but you still deem it fascist...

&gt;Well, that's bullshit. What makes your opinion on gender dynamics, or anything else, more valuable than mine?

Greater access to unbiased life experiences. 

Greater freedome from the Halo effect.

Higher maintainence of life.

Higher ceiling of entry for doing, or acheiving anything.

etc...Anything you did, do, are, or have in life, I had to do, be, or get twice, or three times as hard as you did, therefore my opinion is worth more than yours, and your opinion is so poisoned by congnitive dissonance and halo effect, it's worth practically nothing. 

&gt;So even if I agreed with everything you said, you would still not take me seriously? Well at least you are consistent.

I pride myself on consistency. By virtue of what you *are*, your opinion is worthless. It doesn't matter what opinion that is,...unless we're discussing like....fashion...or sex, or other mundane every day things that an attractive woman would have an edge over other none-attractive women, but certainly in the field of feminism, gender, attraction, and dating psychology, no, you're opinion is worth nothing. 

&gt;Several people on the Red Pill subreddit hate me, and that's probably because I point out the flaws in their ideas.

No, they most likely hate you because of your logical inconsistency. I've debated you about 6 or 7 times, and you've never forced me to reconsider any of my opinions. In fact, I usually walk away desperately wanting to meet you because I don't understand how someone like you functions on a daily basis because your world view is so twisted and out of perpective. 

&gt;If you have an ideology that certain people aren't allowed to discuss, it's probably not a very strong ideology.

Lol, you've clearly never been to /r/PurplePillDebate ...

&gt;Not really. I'm actually in a creative field, so it's nearly impossible to succeed if all you do is regurgitate data.

The arts has almost nothing to do with acemidia. I also have trained in the arts, and I've seen a lot of highly skilled air-headed women. 

&gt;That's obviously not the dictionary definition, or the encyclopedia definition. So either you found it on an anti-feminist website, or you made it up.

I analyzed it. Feminism in action and Feminism is theory are two different things, no different than communism is theory and communism in action. Communism in action is nothing more than socialist dictatorship. 

&gt;I never understood why Red Pillers, MRAs, and other anti-feminists think that full gender equality is somehow anti-male.

1) Because women are already superior/over-privileged to men in every way in our modern society. 

2) Because Feminism is anti-meritocracy, which is inherently anti-anything that the ideology competes against [ in this case, men ]

3) Because Feminism in practice is starkly, blatanly, and unapologetically anti-male. 

&gt;A movement in favor of equality cannot be fascist, because fascism is anti-equality by nature

Feminism has no desire, or need for equality. Feminism is a social privilege advocacy group for women at the detriment of men.

&gt;And I'm not seeing any relevance to the Nazi Party.

**A social movement creating an overtone characterized by the perpetuation of victim mentality amongst otherwise perfectly equal or otherwise advantaged individuals (women) for the purposes of accruing social, political, and judicial privileges for women at the detriment of men**

~Nazi plan for accruing power at the hands of the Jewish. It's literally the exact same strategy.

&gt;No, this is based mostly on people I know.

This is a cognitive dissonance based belief, sprung from your life **and the lives of your friends, also being attractive** being given constant validation and sexual advances. You can't imagine people not having partners because you **and your friends** can't imagine yourselves not having constant access to partners.

&gt;And you have a delusional view of my life. I don't have ""constant access to partners"". I'm not sure why you think attractive women have extremely easy lives, it's just not true.

Crystal Harris disagrees.

&gt;Are charismatic, dominant women less likely to attract alpha males than other women?

Charisma and dominance are not qualities men want in women. They are more likely to be unattractive if the woman cannot make her man feel wanted, appreciated or masculine, however they are not inherently unattractive.

&gt;No, you said everyone falls into one of two categories. I disagree.

I specifically stated, and explained that within a spectrum someone either has predominantly alpha, or prdominantly beta behaviors. Almost no one is 50%...people are either well into alpha, or well into beta, though not entirely one or the other.

It's a somewhat functional element, but it's mainly decorative. We have iron bars, which would be great for using as an iron fence for decorative purposes, but what's really missing is a gate. I think iron bars would become a lot more useful with this added.

Banks merely needed a deed poll and a filled-out form, was really rather easy.

My university merely needed a deed poll. Also rather easy. 

Passport was more difficult. A deed poll sufficed to change the name, but changing the sex was more tricky. You need either a Gender Recognition Certificate (two years of RLE required minimum), or a letter of consent from a certified gender specialist. For this, I sent a letter to my clinic with my deed poll after a year of being under their care and on hormones with them, and the head gender specialist sent me back a letter addressed to the passport service for me to attach along with my passport renewal form. This took a lot of running around red-tape, but after a month or so I ended up with my passport with Sex: F on it! :D

The same goes for a woman afraid that her boyfriend is only with her for sex.

- Stan's ""truth or dare"" moment after the phone call was really great

- Loved the gag with Klaus' bowl

- I actually disliked how we kept cutting back to the babysitter in the hospital.  While I'm usually all for dark humor, and have even written some sketches that go darker than that, something about it just rubbed me the wrong way.

- Roger's ""Honk if you're jealous"" bumper sticker on the carriage was brilliant

- The bit where Jeff calls out for Steve and another Steve calls back from his house's window got a big laugh from me.

- Steve's nerdy drawing along with his sketch for Jenny was another highlight.  Actually remember posting a link to that when the episode first aired that I had totally forgotten about.

- Speaking of Jenny, who did her voice?  It feels like a guest star, but I can't quite place it.

- The scenes where Haley was drunk were all really funny.  American Dad handles their characters really well when drunk, from Haley here to Francine in A Jones For A Smith to Stan in Jenny Fromdablock and whenver else he gets drunk

- Finally, I love the idea of having an anally retentive methead who keeps track of all of his expenses.

The extractor itself condenses the solvent over top of the sample and drips it in drop by drop until it fills up to a pre-determined level. A curved tube that looks like an inverted U is connected to the sample chamber and as it fills it nears the top of the U. When it reaches the top it siphons out the remaining solvent and the process begins anew! It kind of looks like [this!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Soxhlet_mechanism.gif) 

This concentrates the compound to be extracted inside of the round bottom flask that the solvent is boiling in. So after something like 12 cycles you'll have almost no THC left inside of the plant sample and then it's simply a matter of adding decolorized charcoal to the collected solvent to remove impurities, Filter, and then re-crystallize the THC into a pure or almost pure form.

People seem so reluctant to burden their conscience with the truth, that they distort and perform mental gymnastics to create a more digestible and comforting reality, we all do it to some degree (we bias our own self and opinions over others), but if you are aware of it, you can at least take steps to minimise it and make best efforts to try and get as close to ""reality""  as one can, even if through a still somewhat distorted lens.

IndignantChubbs,IAmA,1389744560.0,"I appreciate your informative post but I think were is a bit of a miscommunication here. I'm not really an advocate for either side on this issue. My comment was taking issue with your dismissive attitude and your argument that no one should question a cop on matters of crime. It wasn't really about the substance of the issue, it was about open-mindedness.

As for the issue itself, I'm generally pro-legalization on libertarian grounds, but I have seen the reports that legalization aided trafficking and so I'm on the fence on the issue. I don't know whether legalization inherently has that side effect; if it doesn't, I think it's worth pursuing because I don't believe criminalization of women, most of whom are poor and without many options, is a good thing. If it does, then I'd rather have prostitution just be a low enforcement priority and concentrate resources on trafficking, abusive pimps, that kind of stuff. But I'm not an expert on this issue, and this is an issue where empirical evidence is critical to form an opinion, so, like I said, I'm on the fence."
letsgocrazy,AskReddit,1389744568.0,"I was close friends with a guy, one of those charismatic narcissistic people - he was a very minor celebrity, but he was influential amongst the show industry he worked in.

I found that he definitely needed someone normal to just be a normal friend, which I was - except it went sour because he (like many performer type people) had issues with manic depression, and swapping between being treated normally and wanting to be adored and kow-towed to.

I found eventually we were squabbling often when he spoke and wanted to assume some kind of authority or tell me how to run my life, or psycho analyse me with pop psycho-analyst bullshit.

I found him to be possessive, and like ""took me under his wing"" but then started to behave in a weird controlling manner, as well as being a pathalogical liar. He would simply tell anyone anything he thought they wanted to hear.

We don't talk any more!

&gt; A friend from Europe once asked me if it was true that Toronto had really only two subway lines. I felt some shame and looked away. She is from Vienna and they have serious public transit and fewer people.

Vienna's actually a good counterpart to Toronto - similar population density and city area. But as with most European cities, they had a head start: a sizable chunk of the [Vienna U-Bahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_U-Bahn) uses [infrastructure that predates the TTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Stadtbahn).

&gt; We also have new boards that actually tell us when the next bus is due! There is nextbus.com too.

He isn't even in my top 5 of current Kings players. I know with him he finishes all his checks and he irritates the hell out of the opposing team. He plays against the top lines so he is hitting top line guys. Plus he draws penalties. Because of his style of play he gets teams to focus him. Does he embellish? Yes. Honestly if I was him I would embellish too. Maybe not to that degree but he knows guys are coming after him so why not get a PP or two for it? A couple of his hits were borderline. But I don't think he is intentionally trying to hurt people. Does he get wreck less at  times? Yes. But not to the degree of hate he gets here.

Noise is a problem in either case. You might be better off in the east side dorms (Dorman and Deviney) if you plan on having an even remotely regular sleep schedule since the construction workers don't work into the night. If anything, it's good insurance that you'll wake up early and not waste a perfectly good day or miss class. For Kellum and Smith, the problem is that they're right next to US-90, which can get a lot of assholes with loud cars blasting down the street all hours of the day.

Community-style wasn't too bad. Having to go down the hall to use the bathroom could be a bit of a pain but I got used to it after a while. Your mileage may vary, but the guys' bathroom on my floor never got too out of hand. I would recommend that you bring your own toilet paper though, as they only keep cheap single-ply in the community bathrooms.

&gt; Many of us saw religion as harmless nonsense. Beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but, we thought, if people needed a crutch for consolation, where's the harm? September 11th changed all that. Revealed faith is not harmless nonsense, it can be lethally dangerous nonsense. Dangerous because it gives people unshakeable confidence in their own righteousness. Dangerous because it gives them false courage to kill themselves, which automatically removes normal barriers to killing others. Dangerous because it teaches enmity to others labelled only by a difference of inherited tradition. And dangerous because we have all bought into a weird respect, which uniquely protects religion from normal criticism. Let's now stop being so damned respectful!

You happen to have been brought up, I would presume, in a Christian faith. You know what it's like to not believe in a particular faith because you're not a Muslim. You're not a Hindu. Why aren't you a Hindu? Because you happen to have been brought up in America, not in India. If you had been brought up in India, you'd be a Hindu. If you had been brought up in Denmark in the time of the Vikings, you'd be believing in Wotan and Thor. If you were brought up in classical Greece, you'd be believing in Zeus. If you were brought up in central Africa, you'd be believing in the great Juju up the mountain. There's no particular reason to pick on the Judeo-Christian god, in which by the sheerest accident you happen to have been brought up and ask me the question, ""What if I'm wrong?""

TheArtofXan,vancouver,1389744693.0,"I think an important question is whether Vancouver wants to start moving towards treating Surrey as its own city, or let it continue to grow as a suburb supporting Vancouver.  We often here the complaints about the suburban commuter class, but would building more infrastructure in Surrey be a benefit to Vancouver, or would it draw away too much of the surrounding suburban population it depends on. 

For big events like concerts, we've already seen hints of it: Mumford and Sons playing in Surrey last year is a good example. Would Vancouverites be willing to travel to the burbs to see mid-size concerts if they started shifting that way, or is that too far to travel?

Would building an arena help spur the development of an entertainment district in Surrey, and if so would that pull too much of suburban dollars from establishments in the city? Im sure many Vancouverites would love to see the end of Douchebags on Granville street, but they'd also potentially be losing the spending dollars of over 1 million people south of the Fraser. Would that have a significant impact on restaurants and shops in the city?

At the rate Surrey is growing, I think these are issues we'll face eventually. In the next decade  or so Surrey will likely become the biggest city in the GVRD, and I don't think anyone would think it best to  keep treating it as a housing stable for the city; a growing mass of people travelling to Vancouver constantly for work and entertainment."

LawBobLoblaw,IAmA,1389745057.0,"I agree that my dismissive attitude did nothing to help my argument, and really probably pushed a lot of people away, which is stupid of me.

I agree that any option that reduces trafficking is worth exploring, but so far, there just doesn't seem to be one. 

Also, I do not agree that no one should question authority. As someone who has worked for the military I firmly believe we should ALWAYS question authority (government, religious establishments, business), especially on two specific topics:

Efficiency, and ethics. 

Just earlier someone posted the sheer negligence of the Pensacola Police Department about the handling of an abused girl. It sickens me. Physically ill, and angry. But, short of dedicating my life to it, what can I do but give money and time to organizations, and educate myself?

I didn't consider Greg to be a cop: he's an old man long-retired, and giving the rest of his days to something that bothered him the most. Terrorism, business corruption, chasing down bad-guys. What did he choose to give his time towards? Human trafficking. It's a big damn deal. And what he's doing is way better than any of us are doing right now, regardless of how we feel about cops, or the prostitution. Seeing him as just another cop and getting on the hate-cop/hate-war-on-drugs train isn't helping the cause.

I just want people to stop being taken advantage of. However we get there is fine by me."

La famille du gars n'a jamais été *propriétaire* du terrain.  Depuis la formation de la base de Trenton, les terres ont toujours appartenu à l'armée.  Comme l'armée n'utilisait pas activement cette partie des terres, elles ont laissé des fermiers les cultiver, *tout en restant propriétaires* des terres, qui devaient éventuellement servir à l'expansion de la base.  Cela fait maintenant plusieurs années que l'armée a aviser le fermier qu'ils allaient reprendre les terres pour l'utilisation militaire.

Still, I do want to try a 1-tab trip. I have a couple of friends who feel the same way, and for good reason! Everything will probably ""seem"" and look a little different with just 1, but things wouldn't be quite so overpowering. I'm almost positive it would allow for a very thoughtful calm trip.

I do care about historical context if you're talking about music that addresses historical events directly.  Example, Bob Dylan and just about every political issue of the 1960's.  He wrote songs about the cold war, civil rights, Vietnam, etc.  Listening to those songs reveals the history behind them, and knowing the history provides great insight to his music and lyrics.  Another good example, Pink Floyd's The Wall.

You're really special to her, Dude. You might very well be the first guy she's ever *loved*. Think of it like this, she mustered up the courage to tell you how she feels, and for you not to say that you loved her back crushed her. As THEM4CHIN3 said, it's most likely a self-esteem problem, but it might just be that her feelings were hurt and she overreacted. I've got the tendency to become overly-attached to people and I have very high self-esteem. 

Long story short, it's not a red flag (unless she really starts acting crazy), her ego is just wounded. Best course of action is just to sit her down and talk to her, as with all relationships. You seem level headed, and like you care for her. Don't look at love like it's a ball and chain. Love doesn't equal commitment; it just means that you *love* them and *could* commit to them.

* Strawberry-Banana smoothies help a ton with cramps. Banana's are full of potassium, which help with muscle cramping and strawberries help with any other ""tummy-troubles"" you may be experiencing on your period.

* Doing muscle stretches can help! God knows all I want to ever do while on my period is be a human ball, but I've found doing some light yoga can reduce the intensity of the cramps I'm having.

She doesn't magically get a no-fault divorce if I decide I want an at-fault divorce and have the ability to prove fault on her part.

In a no-fault case, the burden of proof falls upon the petitioner. If the responding spouse comes into court and says that he also wants a divorce and can prove fault, then it is his right to petition for an at-fault divorce and compel the court to resolve the competing petitions."

riseandrise,AskMen,1389745501.0,"This used to happen with my previous boyfriend. He would often flake on plans, or just refuse to make any, but he always wanted to hang out last minute. No matter how many times I brought up the subject with him, nothing changed. I found myself keeping my nights and weekends free until the last possible second in case he wanted to hang out. 

Finally, I had an epiphany: as long as I was willing to always hang out at his convenience, he had no motivation to respect mine. So I started doing things differently. I'd still try to make plans with him, and I'd still be upset if they fell through, but I stopped *not* making plans with my friends. If he wanted to hang out last minute and I was free, cool. But if he wanted to hang out last minute and I wasn't free... Too bad.

I'm not going to lie. It wasn't easy. For several weeks we barely saw each other because he'd always flake on our plans, and I was always busy when he wanted to get together last minute. I really missed him. But then a miracle happened... Slowly he started keeping the plans we made, and even making some with me. 

Basically, by showing him that I respected my time, he had to start respecting it too. If you try this, it will play out one of two ways: either he'll come to that same realization, or he won't, and you'll see that he's an immature jerk who doesn't care about you more than his own convenience, which is good to know as soon as possible.

*Orville looks ahead, seeing Seuss almost reach the arena. Whatever he's up to, he has to be stopped now. Orville raises his fists and yells. He slams them into the ground, creating a shockwave that carries all five of them and carries them forward at extreme speeds. Argo lets himself be carried by it. Souji uses his guns to ride it and stabilize himself. Minok and Silver barely hang on to Orville, who is now soaring on it, body straightened, as if he were a dolphin swimming on the surface of the ocean.*  
  
*As the five close in on Seuss, Orville bucks Minok and Silver off of him. Souji throws a smokebomb at Seuss, but is quickly grabbed by Silver, using metal strands from his coat to swing from a building as an anchor point. Silver tells Souji he has a plan, and the two go flying towards the armory. Argo sticks out his legs, aimed at Seuss's back, trying to hit with with a drop kick. Minok uses the extra momentum from Orville to catch up to Seuss's, aiming a fin drill at his side. Orville sticks out his arms, grabbing Joan's hand, ready to crash into the ground.*  
  
Techniques:  
  
Orville: Roar of the Earth: Orville swings his fist on the ground, creating a shockwave that propels himself forward and throws enemies off balance.  
  
Minok: Findoriru(Fin Drill)- Minok manipulates the water vapor or watever around his hand until it begins to swirl around it like a drill. straightens out his palm so it is flat and runs toward the enemy. He uses his immense strength to ""drill"" the enemy with the torrent of water swirling around his hand. This does external as well as internal damage if hit. Slightly easier to dodge than a normal attack however. The faster he is, the stronger he can make his attack. Due to the nature of the attack, it can be used to break though structures such as wooden houses and weak hulls. As he perfects it, he will be able to break through stronger materials. Can be used as a ranged attack in water.   
  
Argo: ""DAS BOOT:Argo Kicks an enemy stunning him for a turn and changing his target to another enemy, If another enemy is found, Argo gains a stack of spirit, if not,Argo gets +2 Precision   
  
Souji: Smoke Bomb(Rank 1): Souji carries a few special items on his person, which come from animals that he’s hunted or eaten before. This item in particular is a smoke bomb that when enough force is applied, will emit and a thick smog that inhibits eyesight due to it’s thickness and inhibits breathing when inhaled, due to how the smoke will linger in one’s lungs.

Eat shrooms and go to the science museum then the Van Gogh museum.    The Jewish museum is really cool if you're interested in that sort of thing.  Mannequin Piss fries are the greatest munchies on the planet.  Get a little drunk and bang a hooker (or have a 3 way!) - seriously, it's kinda weird at first, but so much fun.  Try chatting up locals online and finding the best local pubs.  I met a couple of locals and they took me to some crazy spots that didn't even have signs out front.  I didn't go to the Anne Frank house either of my times there and I'm Jewish.  The lines are just ridiculous...all to go see an attic.  I can't tell you much more about what to do.  Both times I went it was basically just a drink beer and smoke weed all day thing.  I should probably go back and actually have a trip I can remember.  "

Now my dog was an American Eskimo, like [this,](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/American-Eskimo-dog.jpg) and he was absolutely the most submissive, gentle, and cowardly dog you've ever met. He never displayed the faintest degree of dominance toward other dogs, and he was even scared of bugs.

But one time when I took him on a walk, we were approached by two strays that were nearly twice his size. (At this time, my neighborhood had a problem with a pack of aggressive strays; sometimes after the incident I'm relating here, they tried to attack my mother while she was carrying my baby sister, but fortunately a man driving by witnessed the altercation and beat the dogs back with an umbrella.)

The two strays had their hackles raised and they were growling at both of us. Without any hesitation, my sweet, timid little dog suddenly jumped at them with such force that I lost my grip on his leash. He went after those dogs with a fury I've never seen in any dog *ever*, and he chased them off. Then he came back to me, smiling and tail-wagging, as if nothing happened.

He never acted strange toward any other dogs or on any other walks after this incident. It was truly as if it never happened. But rather than make me nervous, the event actually made me feel *safer* when I was with my dog, which probably helped him feel relaxed, too."

Previously I had been wearing a silver dial Citizen Signature Grand Classic (still for sale for any interested individuals), but I wanted something a little more unique. I searched for some time for the exact watch I was looking for, briefly landed on the Stowa Marine, but ultimately found the FC was exactly the watch I was looking for.

The case measures 40x10mm with 20mm lugs which is my ideal dress watch size (I had ~7.25"" wrists). I love the thin profile and the nicely curved lugs, it wears extremely flat on the wrist. The leather strap it comes with is pretty meh, especially for a dress watch, but I swapped it for a black Crown &amp; Buckle strap with the FC buckle and I think it looks fantastic. The dial has applied markers, 3 o'clock date window, and is branded. This might sound silly, but I've always wanted a watch labeled with ""Geneve"". I would have liked to have a display back case, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

The packaging is fantastic (it even smells good) and the finish on the watch is topnotch. Overall I am in love with it! It is everything I wanted it to be. Let me know if you want any more pics or info (sorry the pictures are put of order)."

Ron then realized that though he spent every night pining over Becca, she thought nothing of him- in fact, she was screaming in ecstasy as literally thousands of cocks were rammed into her.

Becca, on the other hand, got knocked up by douchebro Gary, and is now saddled with 2 kids.  Gary left, and is now off working other jobs and coming to grips with his beer belly and the creep of male pattern baldness.

The crazy part?  Becca messaged him on Facebook a few days ago, asking him to hang out.  Ron checked out her profile and realized that she hit the wall HARD. Lol NOPE.

CrayonOfDoom,PS4,1389746042.0,"Well, I'd either remove the credit card from your PSN account, or remove the PS4 from your PSN account.

As for ""tracking""...

File a police report (I'm sure this is done), then request from the detective ""investigating"" your case to submit a subpoena to Sony requesting the information for when/if they connect to the internet and registered the serial number (You have that written down, right?  Somewhere?) in Sony's database. 

Sony won't release serial number -&gt; IP information without a warrant/subpoena, that's for sure.  If all this magically aligns and happens (including the thief actually logging on), the detective then has to send a subpoena to the ISP of the person on that IP.  When that goes through, the police then can recover your stolen goods.  However, they'd have to have really solid evidence that the PS4 was stolen by the person who connected, which they won't have unless the dude has a ton of stolen shit in his house or something.

Lostfiniel,GITCP,1389746060.0,"Welcome to the server! It's always good to see enthusiasm in new members.

&gt;Is this subreddit the best place for communication; i.e. post build ideas, coordinate collaborations, discuss * stuff? Is there some other forum? * Is there an official directory for server members? Who they are, best way to contact them, etc. * It's not listed in the rules. Are mob grinders/spawner farms okay (so long as they don't cause lag)?

This subreddit tends to be the best way to get in touch with people. We've had forums and irc chatrooms in the past but the subreddit has been a great resource. Most members are Redditors. 

There is no official directory of server members. Many people would likely be uncomfortable having any of their contact information out there. But there was a thread on this subreddit from months ago where many of our regulars introduce themselves (Which Elmaata posted just before I posted this.) My suggestion, though, is to join mumble and get to know people there. 

Mob grinders and farms are welcome and encouraged as long as it doesn't change the server's performance. We do have a number built and running already so it's worth asking about. Other members will likely know more about those than I do.

I don't have a silk touch anything, unfortunately. Good luck with your bargaining though!"

I've also learned that the sexual bias that people complain about is usually masking some other deficiency.  When a man loses his custody fight, it's easy to blame it on his sex and a lot harder to look at the best interests of the child and why the man might not be up to the challenges of parenting.

&gt; I would assume that most bisexual women specifically would be less likely to be attracted to ""alphas"" because they are also attracted to women and there are no prescribed gender roles in gay relationships.

I have a dyke friend (I mean that in as nice of a way as possible) who games girls as hard as any dude I've seen and has never been with a guy. I mean, of all the human beings alive that I know, I respect her game a mile more than what anyone else is bringing. 

Funny thing happened as the friendship moved along . . . she started dropping unsubtle hints that she'd love to take a shot a me. For example, the last time I saw her pick up a girl she told me, ""You should join us.""

It's an anecdote, sure, but I do find it interesting that when she met a guy whose game she could respect, suddenly there was at least one guy who might be worth her interest.

I also knew a hetero girl a while back who was so twisted in knots by her relationship with me that she went bi for a while until her girlfriend basically told her to cut the shit and just accept that she was still pining for me and that she wasn't really bi.

FTR, I'm not a strong believer that there are a lot of true homosexual women in the world. I actually frequent an area bar with my friend that's basically the dyke bar in my area, and I love watching them run game. But it's hard not to pick up that a lot of lesbians seem to simply be responding to hypermasculine cues being transmitted by other women.

Honestly? When I look at the swathe of women who claim to be bi, I see a lot of women who are engaged in substitution for what they really want. In the absence of any men that are up to the task of getting the gina tingles going, they will settle for a woman who'll do the job right."

Omega037,changemyview,1389746373.0,"&gt;  1) The US military soldiers would not follow orders to attack US civilians. 

This is conceding my point.  If it is the case that the military would choose to protect us rather than attack us, then certainly we *don't* have a need for average civilians to have weapons, just the military.

&gt; 2) We don't know, but we do know that removing cars, alcohol, and swimming pools would save 1,000's every day so why not take them?

First, we do know.  We have several cases in recent history of similar societies getting rid of guns.  It doesn't really decrease crime itself, but it *does* greatly decrease the lethality of the crimes.

&gt; We also know that a disarmed populace has made easy pickings through out history 

There is no evidence of this.  Many armed populaces have been easy pickings, and many unarmed populaces are standing strong now for decades.

&gt; and it isn't likely a coincidence that we have the world's record for holding on to a democratic republic free of aristocracy and despots.

No, it really isn't.  Of course we hold the world record, since we were the first to begin with.  In other words, even if all the others lasted perfectly, we would *still* be the longest running.  That has nothing to do with guns, just the fact that we formed our country earlier.

That said, you seem to ignore a whole lot of history here.  You forget a massive civil war with huge causalities, including civil casualties in the 1860s.  

The very fact that the well-armed South was unsuccessful during the war basically disproves your entire point here.  Did civilian guns prevent Sheman's men from waging total war and cutting a swath of destruction during his ""March to the Sea""?

Your argument also ignores the fact that most of these republics failed for reasons completely unrelated to guns.  The fact that a country didn't last as a republic due to internal corruption, economic collapse, or an external conflict is not evidence of anything.  Especially since countries that did have a well-armed populace often failed for the same reasons."

attax,askgaybros,1389746415.0,"Hey! I'm not a Baylor UG, but a UT-Austin UG with a lot of good friends at Baylor, and I may be up there for law school in the fall.  

The student culture is quite accepting, and from what I've gathered from friends the faculty find it more of a nuisance than anything (similar to some of the cohabitating rules). In fact, the gay group separated themselves from the atheist group because the atheist group was making it difficult for them (the gay community) to be accepted as an official organization (as per my friend who is president of the baylor atheist/agnostic society). 

That being said, there is no in state tuition at a private university. Baylor is super expensive, and somewhat underperforming in the sciences compared to the other schools in Texas. I study Chemistry at UT, and I can say with full confidence from my experience that if you want to be a professional UT or TAMU would be better choices than Baylor for chemistry. While Baylor isn't bad, you'll probably get more options and opportunities elsewhere. Feel free to PM me for more info. However, I don't think, from what I've gathered, that you would be too bad at Baylor.

lendrick,SocialEngineering,1389746438.0,"This is of course a matter of opinion, but IMO using manipulation techniques to get better prices is kind of a moral gray area.  I like expensive shoes myself, and this sort of technique isn't something I'd use at a mom and pop shoe store or a respectable corporate chain.  The place I buy from treats me well and stands behind what they sell.

You mentioned that SE techniques could be considered to be ""sociopathic"".  This is certainly true, but as an individual person, it's important to keep in mind that a lot of the entities you have transactions with on a day to day basis are sociopathic as well.  Large corporations are sociopaths almost by definition due to the dilution of individual responsibility for the corporation's actions.  The only way to get a fair deal with a sociopath is to be a sociopath yourself.  *This doesn't mean it's okay to commit fraud*, just that when you're dealing with someone who is going to use every legal means at their disposal to get as much of your money as possible while giving you as little as possible, acting the same way is just good business sense.

You ARE in an abusive relationship, and it doesn't matter if you're going to seem like you failed by going back to your home town.  You NEED to get out.  NOW.

I've been in a similar situation myself, and I thought I was so worthless, that nobody else would ever love me, being called names on a constant basis, negative energy all the time, and yeah neighbors calling the cops multiple times, leading to a domestic violence charge that I dropped.  Reading through this list might help you: http://www.ywcaregina.com/Programs/AbusePrevention/ViolenceAgainstWomen/WhatToDo/Why.html  Many of those applied to me.

You know what?  That's ALL behind me now.  I'm in an amazing relationship with my husband.  We never fight.  We never yell at each other.  We have nothing but uplifting, positive and kind energy.  I can relate to you saying you get his favorite candy, because I like to be a giver myself.  But my husband is also a giver. He appreciates my gestures and gives me so much affection.  Looking back, I now see that it was not ME.  It was the toxic relationship between the ex and me.  I didn't want to sound like a victim either, and I thought I was so strong and smart, that I was just fine.  I was not fine.  

I was happy within weeks of getting out, though the ex continued to harass me and make threats of killing me, and trash-talking me to everyone he could.  Incidentally, that just made him look crazy to everyone else, because who says stuff like ""my ex should be killed""?  I did continue to have nightmares on and off for a while, even though I moved several states away and cut off all contact.  Anyway, I digress.  

You deserve better than this.  You are not safe.  You've had a gun pulled on your head! As a parent myself, it would be incredibly heartbreaking to learn that my child is being emotionally and physically abused by a significant other.  And if my child ever came calling to me for help, I would drop everything and spend everything I could to get him/her out of that situation.  You have people who love you.  Love yourself.  What you have with this man, it is not love.  It is pain, it is fear, it is manipulation, it is negative, it is darkness, and love is the opposite of all of those things.

I loved scouts and I think it's a valuable organization for children but since they have issues with women, gays, and atheists it's really hard for me to recommend it. Fortunately, the other branches of scouting are more tolerant and have some of the same designations like the [Quartermaster Award for Sea Scouts](http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/Venturing/Awards/quarter.aspx). Really, I just want everyone to have the same opportunities that I had through scouting without having to hide who they are.

Other factors strike me as more important. For example, cry-for-help vs. impulsive suicide attempt vs. planned suicide attempt. Maybe more women fall into the first two categories than men, which leads to the discrepancy? "

HalfysReddit,AskReddit,1389746974.0,"&gt; I guess that was the only scenario I can see where a woman would not fight back and be a complete non-factor against this hypothetical small group of people you mention.

I never said they'd be a non-factor, however very few women would stand a fighting chance against a hardened criminal. I'm a trained fighter, I've fought plenty of women, and honestly the strength difference that comes with being a guy is an absurd advantage.

&gt; I guess I read your hypothetical murder scenario as someone within the group doing said murder. Hence trusting a thug.

Wouldn't really be necessary, although it would be more convenient for the thugs in question. It's worth noting though that while I was using thugs as an example, I was more thinking along the lines of just generally people who would not maintain their morality barring the existence of a society that would shun them for abandoning it. I mean it's what, 1 in 48 people or so that's a sociopath?

&gt; The way you made it out to seem as though ex-cons are inherently stronger and better fighters than a ""normal"" man. If you grabbed ten guys off the street odds are that you would have a couple dudes who know how to throw down.

I think you have more faith in the common man than I do. Most guys have no fighting experience. Most guys do not strength train. Most guys wouldn't stand a chance against someone with any recognizable amount of skill. Most guys also have loved ones to worry about the safety of, something that isn't quite as common among the criminal population."

Omega037,relationships,1389747063.0,"It takes like 15 seconds to introduce yourself.  

Turn to the girl whose locker is next to yours, who is waiting next to you in lunch line, or sitting next to you before class begins.  Then just introduce yourself.  

""Hey, I'm [name].  What's your name?""

Don't make a big deal of it, and if they ask why you are asking, just say ""you just like meeting new people"".

Actually follow that thought process though.  Go and try to meet as many people as you can.  You can practice with boys and girls, and each time you do it, you will get better at it.

If you already know their name, just say something like ""It's [name], right?""  If you already know them, just strike up a conversation with a neutral phrase like:

""This weather sucks, doesn't it?"" or ""I hate Mondays, don't you.""

Once you have conversation, ask questions.  Most people like talking about themselves, so just listen to their answers and create new questions based on them.  Anything from asking who they had for English last year to if they had seen some new movie is fine.

The key to understand is two things:

1. Being social is a learned ability.  You don't just magically become social, you gain it through practice.  Even if you fall on your face and get embarrassed, the very act of trying gets you ahead of those who don't.  So try new things and see what works.

2. Many people, especially your age and in High School, are just as hopelessly lost as you are.  You may think that girls are intimidating and have it all together socially, but my guess is that half of those around you are just as inept as you.  Many of them are probably lonely, don't know how to meet boys, and wish that one would come talk to them.

Video games are more open to all demographics now, but it used to be more of a hallowed ground for nerds and so for nerds to bully other nerds is just wicked disheartening.

Normally I only peer-police my environment when people get really offensive in their ribbing (use of homophobic slurs or calling people ""retards"" for example), but it's really weird how frequently people are inappropriate when its learned a female is existing in their match.

* Or do a buy to let with a relative.  Yes yes buy to let is evil on Reddit apparently, but it's a second income.  Buying that one with a relative means you need half of the deposit.  So that's a big plus.  Sure the income you get (over the cost of the mortgage and the fees and some cover for repairs/maintenance) will also be halved but it's still something good.  That you can use for saving up for your next deposit for your own place.  It'll be that much easier.

* Or live very frugally right now.  Lower your lifestyle in the short run.  Flat share and live somewhere cheap.  Ditch the car and travel by tube.  Forgo that holiday.  Do that for a few short years and really mean it, and with your salary and projected salary I think it's very doable to get a decent mortgage.

KH10304,AskReddit,1389747149.0,"One time I picked up this distressed looking old guy who turned out to be a con artist I think. 

I was on the way to Hillsborough from Durham nc and he was on the on ramp to hwy 85. He claimed his 14 year old daughter had run off with a 27 year old carny and that he was an army surgeon who could jump on a flight for 100$ at any time, he needed to get that 100 because his daughter stole his money and ditched him at the motel he'd gotten them after he rescued her from the carny. He was all teary and religious and said he'd lose his pension etc because he'd left without leave and had a surgery the next morning in anapolis, he said he'd spent like 30000 dollars trying to find his daughter and finally she had told him she would come home so he dropped everything to come and get her. 

Anyway he told me various details about the surgery he had coming up and his daughters situation etc... And I bought it, took him to the airport and gave him 100$ that I didn't really have to spend. He said he'd pay me back 1000 which is what makes me think he was a con artist trying to appeal to my greed as well as my generosity. I never heard from him. A part of me worries he lost his job and committed suicide and the whole story was real, but I think it's more likely he played me for a fool.

All the same, I'd rather be the guy who'll take someone at their word in a situation like that than the guy who doubts and doesn't do what he can, and I know I'd feel a lot worse if I had refused to help him since I never found out if his story was true or not.

If people are interested I wrote his whole story down later that day and I can look it up when I get home, sorry for any spelling and grammar errors I typed this with my thumbs."

It kind of looks like you're standing outside of your front door, like you went to check on something.

You look up and stare into the camera. Yep, it's you. And you've seen that look on your face before in the mirror. It was when you thought you'd heard something in the bathroom, something like a whisper. It sounded like your cousin, the one you used to play that ouija board game with. But your cousin died of cancer, his body parts donated for the cause. If there was any piece of him left in tact, it wouldn't be talking anymore. Definitely not to you.

There it is again. On the video, though. And the whisper's very clear now, because it's coming from the guy holding the camera--or phone, or whatever it is. Maybe it's even an eye. ""Wait til you see,"" it goes. ""I've got a secret.""

A subreddit which simply spins short men in a positive light is not going to make anyone think better of short men.

The only way to challenge prejudice is to hoist a mirror in front of those who practice the prejudice and strip the prejudice naked for all to easily see.  It's a painful and difficult process, but it's the only way.

This is why it is so much better than ways of thinking which came before it. The scientist assumes that he is very likely wrong, but perhaps he's right, and he performs experiments and analyses to try and prove himself wrong. 

This method of thinking allows us to know with better and better certainty over time what is wrong, and move us closer to what is true, but our certainty can only ever eliminate. We can have extremely high degrees of confidence about what is true, but not absolute certainty, as we can with what is false.

mkvgtired,europe,1389747417.0,"Most of the European companies are very diversified. Many people *hate* the Corrections Corporation of America because all they do is private prisons. But European companies that manage them tend to specialize in ""security"". So most people will associate a company like G4S with armored cars or security guards, so they will catch much less flack. 

The problem for these companies is, US states and the Department of Justice are taking over some of these prisons as their contracts expire. Same with the UK. So these companies are looking elsewhere, mostly to emerging markets that cant afford to build state of the art facilities. So they will happily build a new facility, but will require it to have X amount of prisoners. 

In the West these requirements are there as well, but if there is not enough prisoners the state just has to pay as if the minimum were housed there. So say there was only 850 but the minimum was 1000, they would have to pay the rate for 1000. In emerging markets, I think policies like this will be much more open to abuse. These large companies will have a lot of clout in emerging markets and will likely be able to put pressure on the governments get more favorable contracts. 

Granted, its better for the company if there are less prisoners and they're being paid as if there are more, but I can see a judge sentencing someone to prison that might not otherwise receive a sentence because his incarceration ""has already been paid for"" (meaning there is a paid spot not being used). Although I guess that could also be an issue with public prisons given the high fixed costs. 

&gt;I don't hate much, but I do hate slave labour, even if the labourers are criminals.

Forcing prisoners to work is illegal in the US. A Federal Appeals Court said even forcing someone to work intermittently falls under the definition of ""slavery"" so it is not allowed. They can offer them incentives to work, but it has to be voluntary. 

This was one appeals court so it technically applies to one circuit, but circuits tend to be pretty uniform. If federal dicisions differ, the Supreme Court then takes the case to clear up the disparity. This case is several years old, so either prisons nationwide started complying, or other federal courts have made similar rulings (I have not followed it). 

Either way, forcing someone to work, even for pay, as part of their sentence has been held to fall under the definition of ""slavery"" and is therefore unconstitutional. "

oldneckbeard,AskCulinary,1389747422.0,"I make my own olive oil mayonnaise now, and a few things I've learned: 

1. My recipe is 1.25c light-flavored olive oil, 1tsp mustard powder, 1tsp salt, 2tbsp lemon juice, 1 egg. 
2. The key is to get everything to room temperature first. If you take an egg right out of the fridge, you won't get a stable emulsion. Same with your lemons. Get everything out and let it sit out for 2 hours or so. 
3. I do mine in a blender. Mix egg, lemon, mustard, and salt for about 30 seconds on a med-slow speed. Then add 1/4c olive oil all at once, another 10-15 seconds. Then keeping the blender on, drizzle the remaining 1c into the blender as slow as you can. If this takes you 4-5 minutes, that's a good thing. 
4. Even if you do all of this perfectly, sometimes it just won't get there. There's 2 ways to rescue it. First, you can get the same base (1/4c olive oil, 1 egg, lemon juice, mustard, salt). Get that base mixed up, then drizzle your watery mess into it until it's the consistency you want. Make sure the new base is also room temp. Second, and this is my go-to now, is get some xantham gum. For the quantities I describe above, about 1/8 tsp is enough to get the Best Foods (hellmans? what? who?) consistency from what would have otherwise been a salad dressing. Lots of mixing/whipping to make sure it really combines and creates a demi-emulsion :) 
5. I don't know any of the logic behind this, but apparently once it's stable, you should leave it out for 2-3 hours. Something about this makes it last longer once you actually put it in the refrigerator. "

* They are already distant to some extent, Martin &amp; Maggie

  * Martin sleeping in armchair

   * A lots of quietness

     * Morning

     * Dinner and not just because Cohle was tipsy

* This case is more than likely to put a lot strain on marriage

   * Stress piling on Martin [hes boss, bosses boss, church etc.]

   * Dark shit of the case [occultism] giving its own strain

   * Long hours

* Cohle

 * More than likely talks to Martin about alleged affair putting some strain on theirs partnership

   * Very *ungodly* views of the world

     * Martin already shown dislike of them, but they may rub on to him or to Maggie

   * Maggie being sympathetic towards Cohle

     * She knows Cohle's daughter has *passed on* where Martin doesn't

    * Maggie can relate to loosing of child, may want support Cohle

 * Maggie may talk to Cohle about why Martin seem so distant

 * Maggie may start to bond with Cohle which would put a lot stress on Cohle's and Martin's partnership and on Maggies marriage more than likely

     * Children

     * Distant husband [need of companionship, wanting answers about husband etc.]

     * Want to understand hers husbands partner and Cohle's *ungodly* views can be pull for her

When you feed live to a snake, the mouse (or rat, or guinea pig, or whatever) can see what's waiting for it. That will spark the mouse's fight-or-flight instinct, and in the case of the OP fight eventually won. In this case, it was the *snake* who couldn't get away from the (way too big for it) rat. 

In the wild, the prey doesn't see what's coming, and usually once the prey is constricted it can't get free to attack in return. If the snake misses, the prey can run off safely, or if they would-be victim turns to attack the snake in return, the snake can try to escape. That option doesn't exist in captivity. 

The snake knows not to go after anything far too big for it, and will ignore prey that's too small to bother with  - keep in mind that snakes are poikilothermic, so moving quickly and expending energy 'costs' more than it will for a warm-blooded animal. "

(1) To both parents jointly pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 3080) or to either parent. In making an order granting custody to either parent, the court shall consider, among other factors, which parent is more likely to allow the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent, consistent with Sections 3011 and 3020, and shall not prefer a parent as custodian because of that parent's sex.

I'm saying that the muscle group that goes through a concentric contraction is more likely to be the glutes (hip extensors) than the erector spinae. The erector spinae undergo an isometric contraction to keep the spine in a stable position. However, they don't move the vertebrae in relation to one another. So yes, the spine does undergo displacement with respect to the global coordinate system, but the vertebrae do not move with respect to one another. It's a fairly well accepted fact that if you do try to accomplish intervertebral movement while they are under load, bad things will happen.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,MuayThai,1389747869.0,"personally i see no point in doing kickboxing unless you enjoy it more.

Muay thai has less restrictions a greater emphasis on dealing heavy damage, and greater freedom and conditioning potential.

Certainly for self defence of increased fight ability Muay Thai is better than kickboxing, you might have marginal gains in kickboxing with speed or flexibility perhaps on certain strikes, but you certainly wont wield the power of devastation you get from Muay Thai.

even something as simple as spear elbows or spinning back elbows can be genuine game changers and if you find yourself for whatever reason needing to kick arse, its better to have more/deadlier tools in the arsenal.

I've never properly trained kickboxing but some of my muay thai students have or start with a background in kickboxing, and they all struggle or find it very much ineffective in a muay thai environment.

I would say unless you enjoy kickboxing more (which is perfectly valid) muay thai is more practical, 

But having said that its better to train both, 4 times a week than one just twice a week. fitness and exercise will be transferable, and they are not a million miles apart, the more you get used to switching between the two the less of an issue it will be.

i would do both if i had the opportunity, but I would rather do muay thai 4 times a week "

ctesibius,Christianity,1389747902.0,"I'm an organist and lay preacher. I think that a large part of the problem is that ministers are never taught how to use hymns as music at college. We have a problem with one of our ministers, who tends to find a new hymn on YouTube and uses it once. Typically the hymn has only two verses, so that the congregation doesn't have time to learn it, or it has multiple verses but with different inserts rather than a plain verse-chorus-verse-chorus pattern, so that even with the music it takes time to find your way around.

Then there's the dreaded projector. Adequate for showing the words, but it means that the people who can read music and support the rest of the congregation as they learn the tune, can no longer do so. Showing the words isn't enough!

There's a few simple rules that I think would help.

* At least four verses so that the congregation have a chance to learn the tune.

* The same tune each time. Fiddly bits are fine for a choir who have time to practice and can see the music, but they kill any chance for the congregation to pick it up. Your organist or other musicians can show you how to read a repeat pattern in the music (unless it's Complete Mission Praise, in which case abandon all hope because there's a good number in there that make no sense whatsoever).

* No instrumental interludes. They make it very difficult for the congregation to know when to come in.

* The melody should fit within an octave, and preferably less. This makes it possible for most people to sing it. Your musicians can show you how to read this from the music very easily.

* Use the piano! It's the best instrument for accompanying a new song. An organ is less clear, and a guitar can be really bad because it usually doesn't play the melody at all. The instruments should serve the congregation, not be there for their own sake.

* Have some printed sheets if you're using a projector. Some people won't be able to see the screen.

* Try to get the score (the sheet music) to key individuals - a choir or music group if you have one (our churches are usually small), but if not, to anyone who can read music in the congregation."

If anything, you will find that extending the bipod makes unsupported handling better as it moves more of the weight closer to the rifle's CoG. The only reason bipods fold is to make transport less unwieldy. With a barrel mounted bipod like the Mosin, you will see a POI shift from unsupported to supported groups, but that is not the same as reducing the accuracy of the rifle.

Drop_,sanfrancisco,1389747973.0,"You are wrong on both points, in addition to also being wrong about ""behavioral economics.""  

It isn't begging the question.  I'm asking a question with two outcomes that you don't like which naturally stem from your proposed framework.  That is different than assuming the outcome.  You can either show me why it's a false premise (explain an outcome in your framework that isn't either of those) or you can answer, but just hand waving about some fallacies you read about in another argument like you are doing is a silly exercise.  

On the other hand, you are begging the question with your assertion on the ""incentives"" for developing new drugs and biologics - that nationalizing healthcare will mean no new drugs or biologics. 

Finally, behavioral economics is the study of the impact of cognitive, social, and emotional factors on economic decision.  Responding to incentives (take away the reward) is not ""behavioral economics.""

2) Our first pick (in the second round) should probably be a defensive tackle. I'm not sure who's going to be around by then, though. I wish we could time travel and get Kawaan Short. 

3) We need corners for depth, at some point. They don't have to be immediate contributors, but we were legit running out of cover guys towards the end there. I would like for Cassius Vaughn to be the worse CB on the team. 

4) I'm not even sure who our other starting inside backer is. Angerer? Do we just swap guys? Make a wish kids? I dunno, we need a guy to stand back there and make plays with Freeman. 

5) I've seen Bethea make mistakes as often as Landry. The difference is that Landry is usually a force in the run game, while Bethea isn't as much (he's made some plays, but those are pretty rare). I think our safety situation should be evaluated. Maybe bring in a guy late in the draft, maybe generate some competition or strike gold on something. 

6) I don't want us to target a wide receiver in the draft or in free agency, especially if  Reggie is back to his old self. I think if he does, we have a pretty incredible 1 and 2 with him and TY. If he's not back, I think we have a good enough number 1 in TY and a solid Frankenstein crew in Whalen/Rogers/Brazill. Plus, Fleener/Allen can catch, so that'll help.

crogi,footballmanagergames,1389748503.0,"I find the only way I can describe this (to myself as much as anyone else) is that its a variable. Values update slowly, but asking prices and squad roles can fluctuate at a rapid speed.

Example A, Fierro left in one of my games on a free. We were a few years in and he ran down his contract, with no competition he moved to the bridge. Under me he scored an incredible goal a game. All season he was worth 5 to 10 million, summer comes and he shoots up to 45 million upon winning golden boot and footballer of the year.
City inquire and I asked for 60 million. They rejected.
So two more seasons he scores at this rate of more than a goal a game and city come back in with 60 million up front. I rejected it.

Other time I was a smaller team trying to sign a player on loan, I offered full wages and monthly fee, but no deal. Then a signing here and a signing there for the big team and they had more cover, he was listed for loan and I got him for only a fifth of his wages.

These are two examples of how much of a role timing plays in the value of players, also never forget the relation between the clubs and the current competitions.

if you ask any of them, no matter how ""girly"" or ""manly"" the thing they're doing is, if you ask them if they're a boy or a girl, they'll know.

now even then, there is a subset of us who identify as genderqueer, as being neither male NOR female. and if you think trans people get shit for transitioning? whoo boy, they genderqueer people who go for an andro look REALLY rub some people wrong. it's something about not being able to gender someone that makes a lot of people uncomfortable.

bananapajama,birthcontrol,1389748550.0,"No one has mentioned the IUD (Mirena or Paragard are the leading US brands), which surprises me since it's a popular option for reddit women. 

I have the paragard, which is a copper-coated piece of plastic that is inserted into the uterus for up to ten years and has an efficacy close to that of sterilization. There are similar devices that contain hormones instead of copper. The side effects vary depending on the type of IUD. Hormonal ones can reduce or eliminate monthly bleeding, while copper ones can make your periods heavier and more painful.

They do tend to have a high upfront cost but this may be covered by our insurance. Mine was.

There is an outdated opinion that IUDs cannot be given to women who have not given birth. This has been denounced by several important medical associations, and in fact the IUD is now the number one method recommended for teens by some of these institutions.

sheenathepunkrocker,TumblrInAction,1389748634.0,"&gt;There are others who say that it’s normal for kids’ weights to fluctuate, especially before growth spurts, and that you can’t assume a chubby kid will turn into a chubby adult, etc

There's a big different in being a chubby kid that grows up and fills out nicely and a 100 pound 4 year-old.  Being slightly chubby doesn't negatively affect a kid's health like being obese does.  A 100 lb 4 year-old is huge. I'm 5' and I've never weighed more than 100 pounds (I usually hover around 90-95 lbs).  

&gt;We don’t know a lot about how manipulating children’s diets will affect them in the long run. Some people say that you can effectively stunt growth in weight, but to actually make that happen seems to require a famine state that also stunts growth in height.

Ok, I don't think you need to be in a ""famine state"" to lose weight. Just male sure the kid is eat healthy foods in controlled portion sizes and let them run around outside to make sure they don't gain too much weight, or if they need to lose a little weight.

To my knowledge (and experiences), a lot can change. My speech therapist was rather badass though. It's still really weird for me - like, wow, my voice changed from *that* to *this* with what seemed like such little work? Trippy...

A fair point... Yah I'd evade the gym lol. As for hips, hmmm... I'm not sure. Well, for starters, I don't think it matters that shoulders are wider than hips. A quick glance at other women around me as I write this indicates that the majority have wider shoulders than hips :P

As for fat redistribution, yeah, it happens. I wouldn't overestimate its effects though... Apparently I have a nice arse, and the hip area is slightly more fleshy, but the hip bone isn't especially wide or anything... Now, as for the face, it does a fair damn good job there. I would show you me pre-transition but I kinda burned them all lol :P

Hehe, aww, thanks. In fairness it's the best picture of me that there is. And I'm very experienced with makeup :P. Without makeup, and in different lighting conditions, I still think ""owwww"", though I appear to still pass apparently... And from behind, my hair is weird (I suffer from trichotillomania). But yeah, sorry for the envy; I do consider myself among the luckier, and at present you have my sympathy (feels so much better now than pre-transition). Though if I'm to confess, I myself get envy for the successfully postoperative (I'm preop for another few months), and for the early transitioners (always pass insanely well). 

And the doc stuff. Ahhh that feeling. Yeap, had that too lol! Despite having suffered from so much inside, I had rationalized it away, as I would have periods where I felt it didn't affect me as much and questioned stuff. Sound familiar? 

It took my girlfriend at the time, and a close friend who's also a transwoman, to tell me to go get a consultation. After doing so, in the mental health clinic appointment, the clinical psychologist referred to me in the feminine for the first time properly in my life. It felt so right and gave me such a drive :D

But yeah, your mileage may vary. I'm in the group of ""Treatment shouldn't define gender; if one feels female but doesn't want to transition they should be recognised as such"", but if you're holding back not because of that but because of fear and such... :(

I wasn't going to die from it any time soon, but because I was in so much pain I'd be skipped forwards to the front, given a bed and placed on a morphine drip. I'd then be comfortable enough to go to the back of queue while people who needed to be treated immediately were sorted out. Pain is a hard thing to judge, but for me it was so bad I couldn't respond to anything, no idea where I was or what was happening. I was just curled up in a ball, so far beyond being able to cry that I just shook. A couple of times I collapsed from the pain, and another it drove me so crazy I started bashing my head against the wall trying to knock myself out.

Once I got to the top of the queue they would run checks to make sure I didn't have another infection and that my liver wasn't about to fail (I was pretty close to it for a while).

deananana,loseit,1389748932.0,"Okay, so: most of the top comments so far are by people who have superficial impressions of weight watchers, rather than people who have actually tried the program. 

First misconception to be cleared up: WW does not actually push any of its food products. They really are a legacy from back in the day when processed foods were thought to be healthy. There is no part of the system that encourages or even mentions those foods. They exist in the back ground. 

Second misconception: the WW program is structured to teach people about how to choose healthier whole foods that keep them full longer. Yes, it's true that there isn't a lot of focus on 'macros', but there is on what they call 'power foods', which are worth fewer points for larger servings. Power foods are things like oatmeal, chicken, and other healthy low fat whole foods. Vegetables and fruit are zero points, so you can eat as much of them as you want. It's structured this way to encourage people to eat more of those foods, and to help them learn that you can fill up on healthy stuff. 

Third misconception: The meetings aren't just support groups, although that is part of it. They keep you accountable by weighing you every week and writing it down, and by doing so preventing you from thinking that ""this week doesn't count"", or ""i'll be extra strict next week"". It forces you to be consistent in your healthy eating, which is important.

I'm not usually this evangelistic about WW, but for me (and lots of other people) it's been a really useful tool for learning about proper portion sizes, and for making it easier to make good food choices, and for keeping me accountable to myself. It's unfortunate that so many people think they know what the program is just because they saw a commercial in 1992, or because they know someone who tried it and failed - those inaccurate impressions can prevent people find choosing a program that might be right for them.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,MuayThai,1389748948.0,"&gt;so you're saying that i wont benefit at all from any kickboxing classes in regards to just basic kicking flexibility or so.

well there is a possibility that if your opponent is only used to fighting fellow muay thai fighters your style and switch of style mid round might confuse him or he might find you more difficult to read, but i personally don't think its worth the effort/time

&gt;Also since my gym only has MT class twice a week is there any way i can train MT at home without having to buy a bag or pads.

Yes but how effective it will be is questionable, in Thailand they shadow box for months and months even years perfecting every move etc, but that is unlikely to yield good results for you.

Personally if it was me, I would get a friend and invest in 1 set of thai pads and using those you can train virtually all you need (assuming you have gloves), failing that i would probably use the non muay thai days to increase my fitness cardio and flexibility, like with a specific non combat but extreme stretch routine followed by intense exercise etc.

but don't kid yourself training twice a week will still take at least a year till you are competent enough to be able to perform the moves to a decent enough standard.

even training 5 times a week it takes at least 2-3 years to become decent enough that you can fully ""flow"" effortlessly.

you will only realise this when you get to that level, its strange progression in MT, it sort of slowly creeps up on you, there is no eureka break through you just sort of harden and become more and more lose and fast and powerful.

grafxbill,Wordpress,1389749202.0,"I don't think you really understand the nature of what you're asking.

The short answer is, it's not possible to run a WP theme without running WP.  It's like asking if it's possible to run a boat without it being in water.  The water is like the WP system files on the back-end and the boat is like your theme.  It needs the water to properly function.  The blades cannot spin on cement, and air is too thin for it to be propelled.

Wordpress renders pages on the fly.  The page doesn't actually exist until the user renders it in their browser.  It's built on a system of conditional PHP that says, ""get this file, get that file next, get that file next, get that file last.""  It essentially pieces together files to make the page at the user's request.

A static ""regular"" HTML webpage exists in it's entirely and is simply accessed by the user.

That said, you could certainly create a static page that looks exactly like your Wordpress page.  I don't know why you'd want to do that, but you could."

I've never been the small cute one who gets the pick up and swing hugs, I hardly ever feel short, I don't wear heels because my best friends are 4'11 and 5'2, I have HUGE hands and feet.

I want to be able to look up at someone who makes me feel little and cute, who has bigger hands than mine because as a girl, holding hands with someone whose hands are smaller than my own makes me feel absolutely huge, no matter what their height. I want to wear heels and not be taller than the one I'm wearing them for. I want to be able to play footsie where for once my feet aren't the biggest. I want to be the little spoon and actually feel like the little one. I want to be able to stand on my tip toes to kiss someone, to lean into their chest when I'm sad, to feel little and cute and small, because that's not something I can do with a shorter/my height guy. 

Don't get my wrong, I've liked and dated guys my height and shorter before but I always feel  so insecure, like I'm going to crush them with my giant feet or like I have to be the big spoon because I'm the bigger one. Then theres sitting on your boyfriends lap when you're bigger than him... That does absolutely nothing for your self esteem.

Another note : Education is uniform all over the world due to globalization . 2+2 = 4 is taught all over the world , although the means might be different . 

I cannot argue on the fact that IB doesn't help for college . But all I can say is that , weigh your factors , which is more important for you ? Getting into a college or doing well at college ? Some people arent made for the IB and dont just IB . I am one of them and what is done to me is that it has affected my chances at my preferred institution . "

DaltonB,hiphopheads,1389749473.0,"Because the internet.   
I think a lot of people disagree or dislike the album because they box it into either an album or a screenplay. It's neither.   
When was the last time that you read a novel? Do you remember how it feels to read an entire story? Through words alone, authors are able to place readers into an entirely fabricated world via imagination.    
This is similar to what music does.   
By combining them it creates an even more powerful experience. Neither parts are as good on their own because they are two parts of a whole. Just like how films are audio and video together.

I think it's really creative because it hasn't been done (to my knowledge) at a large scale, **especially** with hip hop. The genre is very focused around lyricism. Narrative storytelling is a critical part. That's what makes this so cool. There's even more layers of narrative to this. You've got the entendres, metaphors and symbolism that you see in rap lyricism as well as screenplay/novel writing. BUT IT ALL GOES TOGETHER!    

We're hearing words in a song that are creating an experience for us. We're reading different words that are telling a story and creating an experience.   
Two separate senses are transmitting information to our brains. We are hearing lyrics, reading stories, and fusing them together. That is wicked. Try reading a story while listening to an album, it's nearly impossible. Childish made it work though. Even if you don't like the story, sound, or commentary you have to appreciate that.

Even further, I think the album made good and interesting points/thoughts about internet culture and how it is effecting all of us. The most impressive part is that it doesn't rely on the writing/music duality. It's got CG's own style, commentary and direction that flows throughout both. Maybe you have to be a CG fan to fuck with this, because if you don't like him you won't like this because it's so him. 

Either way, I think you gotta respect the creativity in it.

So the doctor takes him into the nursery.

Doctor: See, he can fly...

He picks up and drops the baby. The baby hits the floor and bounces a little bit. 
The Man gets all pissed off..

Man: Hey, what the fuck is your problem???  That's my kid!

Doctor: NO, I ASSURE YOU!! Your baby is a super hero watch, maybe he just needs a head start. 

So the doctor picks the baby back up and runs through the nursery and throws the baby. The baby slams right in to the wall head first and falls to the floor.

The man is even more mad now.

Doctor: I don't know why it isn't working maybe he needs to fall further to make his flying abilities work right.

The doctor then grabs the baby off of the floor, takes it to the window, and drops it. The baby falls and lands in the middle of street, where it is then run over by a large truck.

The Man is beside himself

anyway, it was caused by someone linking to this roo that had been removed from the chain and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/switcharoo/comments/1td4pt/living_dog_vs_reddit_comment/) is how i fixed it.

here is the chain at that point:

**before**

Living Dog vs. Reddit Comment  *links to wife cheating*  
Hearthstone Hunter vs Card Bug  
~~Wife cheating vs lost music~~  
~~Amy Virginia vs Anus Vagina~~  
Hitler vs. Furby

Hearthstone Hunter vs Card Bug  *links to hitler vs furby*  
~~Wife cheating vs lost music~~  
~~Amy Virginia vs Anus Vagina~~  
Hitler vs. Furby  
Toe vs Graphic Card prizes  

the original fault seems to have been my own for removing [this very roo](http://www.reddit.com/r/switcharoo/comments/1td13f/wife_cheating_vs_lost_music/) from the chain which itself was wrongly linking after poor roos got removed despite a couple of fixes and i can't work out what happened any more but we seem to have ended up with two roos linking to Hitler vs Furby and had to delete one of them.

Jrodicon,CampingandHiking,1389749805.0,"Personally I'm a high alpine mountain junkie so I prefer Glacier because that is what the park is focused on, but Glacier doesn't have really unique geothermal features like Yellowstone. Yellowstone has a lot of high alpine terrain as well, but it is not as bountiful as Glacier. A good way to compare what the geography and views would be like would be to use google earth, that is one of my favorite ways to explore wilderness areas from the safety of my home. Here are a few pictures which I think sum up what each park is all about:

My favorite personal line that use frequently is "" People without hope do not fight social injustice, they stay in there place and never try"". Those people are around in large numbers and can be found on this sub for all the world to see. 

The mirror is out there right now in the form of numerous articles as a sad situation.

The reality is that even though being short puts us at a disadvantage in area of life, guys like I and Hemmingway (we are facebook friends) have had an amazing love life history. At 5'4"" and 5'5"" this is considered an impossibility to a number of men on this sub, and mine and his is seen as a fairy tale of made up stories to many.

They're pretty good.  The finish on them is rough and the seasoning they come with isn't very good, it's better to just re-do it.  I think they're less dense than the one my sister gave me because they're thicker but they're also about the same weight.  

The difference is the variety.  I can see myself using a 10"" skillet much more than that little 6"" pan.  The little one I used a couple times, but it was never very useful for anything, if I have a small amount I just use one of the bigger ones instead.  Because of this it's never built up any kind of decent seasoning, which means I can't use it for anything else.  The medium pan I use for small things like brauts, but usually only when my large pan is in use.  

You should just evaluate what you have, what you need, and how you'll use it.  Small pans I use almost exclusively for eggs, so I have teflon for those.  I'd like a dutch oven, but I can't think of anything I'd actually make it one.  Buying a huge set is fun, but if you don't need all of it then it'll be a waste.  "

madhjsp,nfl,1389750005.0,"In his defense, though, the post-Warner QB situation he dealt with in Arizona was pretty damn awful. I mean seriously - John Skelton, Kevin Kolb, Matt Leinart, and Derek Anderson? When you make a statement like ""he absolutely needs a franchise QB"" and base it on past results, you're essentially saying ""he needs a QB that isn't absolute garbage,"" which is true of virtually every coach who has ever worked in this league.  

Now, whether or not he could have upgraded his QBs and either neglected or failed to do so, or had to play with the hand he was dealt by the personnel people, I don't know. For all we know, that crappy selection may have been his own undoing. Or it could have been a major motivation for why he chose the Titans job, where he will supposedly play a larger role in personnel decisions than what the Lions were offering him.  

Obviously the Lions do have the better QB situation, currently, but it remains to be seen what Whisenhunt will do with Locker, or how Locker will pan out if he is tabbed as the starter next season. He certainly showed signs of improvement this year before getting hurt. Maybe he finally plays all 16 games next year and starts to live up to his potential. Maybe he gets hurt again, and the Titans are forced to move on once and for all, but Whiz's job is not in immediate jeopardy anyway because we aren't the Browns and will at least give him the chance to build around a QB he didn't inherit. Or maybe he decides to go another direction as early as this offseason, and we will truly start to get some indications of how good he is at building an offense without an established veteran QB in place.  

Point is, there are a number of different ways this could play out, and it's pretty hard to make definitive statements on how good or bad this coaching hire is immediately after it happens. "

FountainsOfFluids,AskReddit,1389750140.0,"Ok, there is a lot of bad information going on here. It's understandable, but really not helpful and very distorted because people aren't taking the time to actually understand.

The purpouse of /r/theredpill is twofold: 

First, it's a place where people, mainly men but also some women, are trying to understand human sexual relationships. (Hetero relationships, to be specific.) They have a strong theory for understanding male and female gender roles in a world that is actively trying to destroy the very notion of gender roles. The focus of this theory is that feminism has run amok and is actively destroying our ability to have happy marriages.

Secondly, it is a safe place for frustrated men to vent their anger. These men are frustrated because everything they have been taught by popular culture about love and relationships has created horrible and painful situations in their lives, and they are lashing out.  This comes out as misogyny and all manner of vile statements about people, the government, and society in general.

Personally, I agree with the first part (kinda) and am very unhappy about the second part. The second part is why everybody hates this subreddit and will eventually get it banned from reddit completely. It also makes it hard to have civil conversations there, and impossible to have civil conversations on the topic anywhere else. People simply dismiss you as a redpiller and then ignore anything you have to say.

silly87,TrueAskReddit,1389750164.0,"Because we have decided that immorality is very often based on whether a type of behavior harms another person.  Rape and murder obviously hurt the victim (and the victim's family), and drug use hurts the drug-user (and often the family).  Stealing, adultery, battery, arson, etc all hurt people, or at least the property of people.  Littering harms the environment, which in turn harms animals and people.

Two consenting adults choosing to engage in a homosexual lifestyle either because they were born homosexual (most likely), which occurs in other species as well, or because they choose to (less likely), does not harm anyone.  Therefore, you're calling people immoral for something they're doing that has no effect on you or anyone else and harms no one.  If I say that I'm not a bigot because I think it's immoral to be black, you'd call me wrong.  Well, if you say you're not a bigot because it's immoral to be gay, I'd call you just as wrong.  

You may be religious all you want.  But using your religion to justify homophobia (and often sexism and racism as well) is not something I have to respect.  Tell me you're a Christian and I won't call you a bigot.  Tell me you're a Christian and you believe women should be subservient, black people shouldn't be allowed to marry whites, or homosexuals shouldn't be allowed to share the same rights as heterosexuals, and regardless of your religion, I *will* call you a bigot.

Enlisted in the Army when I was a college student. Ended up becoming an officer. No college debt, good first job as a young Lieutenant out of school.

Did two deployments to Afghanistan. It sucked. The only good thing was that it forced me to save money. A lot of money. Now I have a civilian job earning $85,000/yr before taxes, plus reserve pay = about 95k-100k a year before taxes. No kids, no spouse. I am 28 years old. 

Long story short: 

- $83,000 in a Vanguard money market account.
- $42,000 in Morgan Stanley mutual funds
- $16,000 in a Roth IRA
- $11,000 in an Army investment account, that will end in about 60 days and the money will have to find a new home. 
- $11,500 in an E*TRADE account, because I am just messing around. 

TOTAL: 163,000

Only debt I have is $30,000 left on my car (I kinda splurged on a 2014 Audi S4 when I got back from my second time in Afghanistan) interest rate is 1.74% so I am not in a hurry to pay it off.

Credit score is good. No other debts. I do not currently own a house or have a mortgage, I am thinking of buying one.  

So here are plans:

- Vanguard funds need to be moved into something different. Right now it is sorta in a holding pattern until I figure out what to do with it. 
- Morgan Stanley is charging me something like 2% fees, it has earned something like 7% in the last few years. I am likely going to move those finds into a no-load mutual fund account, probably with Vanguard. 
- Roth IRA is going to stay where it is. I have already maxed it out for 2014, I plan to continue to max it out as long as I can afford it.
- The money in the Army investment account is a temporary thing that was only available for the time I was deployed overseas. That money is going to become liquid cash in the next 60 days, I need to find a new home. Likely going to be no-load funds with my Vanguard account. 
- Some of this, maybe 12-15k, will be staying in Vanguard moneymarket funds as my rainy day fund.     

MY BIG QUESTION:

IS NOT BUYING A HOUSE AND CONTINUING TO RENT REALLY GOING TO HURT ME? I AM EXPECTING I AM GOING TO PAY OUT THE NOSE IN 2014 IN TAXES BECAUSE I AM SINGLE WITH NO DEPENDENTS AND DON'T HAVE MUCH IN TERMS OF TAX WRITE-OFFS. WILL BUYING A HOUSE ALLEVIATE THIS? 

I DO NOT PLAN TO STAY IN MY CURRENT LOCATION FOR MORE THAN 5 YEARS. I PLAN TO MOVE BACK EAST.

If you look toward the lower right corner, you'll see a little white streak.  An object in the field of view moved by that amount over the course of my two hours of imaging time.  I didn't know what it was - it wasn't in my charts - so I checked with my local club.  Someone in the club checked with the [Minor Planet Center](http://www.minorplanetcenter.net), and discovered it was a known asteroid: [71 Niobe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/71_Niobe)!  Using the information I got from my fellow club member, I was able to repeat what he'd done and confirm this identification to my satisfaction.

Aside from this, there's a whole mess of galaxies in the picture.  If you look at the annotated version, I sat down with Wikisky for an hour or
 so and labelled every PGC galaxy I could find.  The unlabelled galaxies are in the USNOA2 catalog.

MusingMagus,AskMen,1389750686.0,"&gt;""I have plans with a friend. -offers another time.-"" 

Most likely she has plans with a friend, but does not have plans during the time she offered you.  If the new time works for you, take it.  If she turns *that* down, ask her why.

&gt;""I'd love to, after I eat lunch with my buddy.""

Chances are she'd love to, after she eats with her friend.  Try not to take her to a restaurant after this, unless she's one for post-meal drinks or coffee. 

&gt;is this essentially some soft(sly?) way of saying they are seeing a male interest already?

Not that I can see.  In both cases, the person is willing to spend time with you, but not at that time, because they're busy.  People do things.  Not all of those things involve you.  There is nothing wrong with this.

&gt;Generally speaking, I would know all her friends and she would just say the person's name instead of being purposefully vague. (it would be unusual to say 'a friend' and be very nondescript about it in normal circumstances) 

Are there friends they know you don't like?  If so, that may be the case here. 

&gt;When talking to ex's

If by exes you meant people you have been in a past relationship with but are no longer in a relationship with now, *and* you're asking about meeting up, maybe it is another romantic interest, or they just don't want to see you.  Relationships often end for a good reason.

Yahspetsnaz,totalwar,1389751134.0,"-Yari Ashigaru are the cheapest unit in the game, but their wall formation is nearly unbeatable by melee unit attacks. Of course they can't move while in this mode, but it is extremely effective in situations where the enemy has to move. Especially against the AI because they always charge you.


-The archers in this game seem to be very powerful compared to some of the other Total War games. Use them a lot. Even the bow ashigaru, which are the cheapest one, are decent if you have no other choice. Matchlock units are also extremely powerful, but obviously they suck at melee combat. Keep a light unit behind them such as yari ashigaru just to engage any enemies that charge your foot soldiers. If an enemy is charging them, move the ashigaru up to hold them off long enough for the guns to waste them. You will suffer some friendly fire, but it is for the greater good.


-The best way to create allies is to first make a trade agreement with someone. Slowly build on that until the clan likes you, and get a military alliance. Giving payments and arranging marriages are a very effective way to increase your diplomatic rating. Also, note that your Daimyo's honor includes a bonus (or a negative effect if you are dishonorable) to diplomacy. Don't make empty threats or attack friendly clans. Vassal clans make great buffer zones and quickly become allies, but once your clan become extremely powerful, everyone in the world will turn on you including your closest allies.


-In multiplayer, prepare to get ass-raped by players who own Fall of the Samurai. Spread your units out and focus on samurai units as opposed to ashigaru because they have higher morale. Morale is everything when attacking gunpowder units.


That's all I got on the top of my head.

YNAB (you need a budget) is another air program, and it's on steam. It's implementation is almost perfect, but you can feel a very slight disconnect, which is a bit weird.

&gt;When you say you're looking for a ""feminine"" girl, what are the qualities that you consider feminine in an appealing way?

You don't need to know the answer to this.  Be yourself, and find someone who likes you for who you are.  Don't try to be something you aren't, as, if someone becomes involved with you because of that, it's a case of false pretenses.  You then either have to fake it for the rest of the relationship, or give up the masquerade and risk dealing with ""you've changed"", ""you're not the person I started dating"", etc.

To me, closure is an explanation for when someone ends things out of nowhere.  For example, everything is going great, then he breaks things off.  You'd want closure because you figured everything was going well, and it doesn't make sense.  Did you do something wrong?  You need answers.  Maybe he fell out of love, realized you had different goals, he wanted to be single, whatever.  It's at least something, because the not knowing is the worst part.

But in this case?  I'm not sure not knowing is really that bad of a thing.  What can he really say?  Will it change things?  If he didn't cheat, then maybe you think he's a liar when he says he didn't.  Still no closure.  If he did cheat, then your breakup is justified, and nothing changes.

&gt; 

Actually, that's more a function of how the stories are told. Given that we don't have contact with Valinor during this period, and the main contact we have after the War of Wrath comes from scolding emissaries sent by the Valar to get the Numenoreans back on the straight and narrow, I can see why that might be. Even if the Numenoreans had tales of the happenings in Valinor, it may be that it was lost in the Fall.

To me, the question of what Glorfindel was doing is best answered by how he came to Middle-earth: he was sent back by a special dispensation of the Valar along with the Istari. To me, this suggests that his role was similar to that of the Istari -- to advise, give hope, and intervene directly only when absolutely needed."

I met my boyfriend through accidental online dating. Me and my best friend had got drunk and decided we'd both make dating profiles on the same site and see who got more messages. It wasn't supposed to result in anything. So I set up my profile, put up a photo from my holiday in the US and left it to go crazy. 

I'd forgotten about it until I got an email saying [boyfriend's username] had favourited me. I was curious, so I logged on and looked at his profile. I saw this amazingly gorgeous guy and a profile that made me both laugh and be interested all at the same time. I sent him a message asking what it meant that he favourited me, and the next morning he replied saying he wasn't sure but he thought I was cute.

We messaged back and forth that whole night and the next day, then I gave him my number as he was going out and told him to text me. The first ever text message I got off him said ''I shampoo my beard.'' and that was it. We texted and messaged for another few days before he suggested meeting for a drink.

We met up and talked solidly for about 6 hours. It just felt right. We saw each other once a week (as he lived 2 hours away and I worked 6 days a week) for a month or so and then we went to Germany for 3 days. It was there he first told me he loved me and where we first had sex.

It's been highlight after highlight since then. He's pretty much living with me now and I seem to love him more every day. I think he's the most amazing man ever, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him. We're talking about the future a lot, like getting a place and getting married, but that's a bit off yet. We're just enjoying being together at the moment! He's amazing."

d3gu,TheRedPill,1389751569.0,"Ah fair enough. What do you mean 'current environment'? As in, current economic climate, current political/personal viewpoints, or since a certain tv show/popular opinion? I often get confused on here, as a lot of posters are American/Canadian and assume that everyone else is. In Britain we just kinda 'let people be'.

Your answer makes sense, thanks for answering. I'm going to find it hard to coherently/concisely explain what I feel about TRP, but I'll try. Like any social theory, it's not an exact science. But it can't be totally bollocks or no one would even read it. I personally believe that the best way to form a good attitude is to read, appreciate and formulate your own opinions based on many philosophies. 

For example, I think that there are more differences *within* groups than between them. I'm a girl and appreciate everything my forefathers(mothers?) have done for my rights to vote, work and so on. However I get really angry at how badly men are treated when it comes to custody and child benefits. I've seen it happen to my friends, in 2013 and I can't fucking believe it! I think yes, you could use TRP/PUA stuff on women and have it work, but I don't think I'd like the women in question as friends, or the men who used the techniques religiously. As in, I hate people who always have an ulterior motive or agenda. 

I guess what I'm (tiredly) trying to say is - sure, use TRP and any other theory to help you out. Use it in moderation, or to help you gain confidence. But please never, ever let it get in the way of common sense &amp; never let it persuade you that one sex is any better/worse than the other for any one thing. Individuals - hell yes, but not entire groups of humans. If someone's not right for you, fuck em (or not) and move on.

Casual relationships vs longterm... As long as both of you are enjoying yourselves, then who's to say which is right or wrong? There is no 'slut' or 'stud'. If someone has a string of sexual partners, then judges a guy/girl down for the same behaviour, then shame on them imo."

zataks,amateur_boxing,1389751795.0,"I'm saying the ability to run 4 miles and do 30 push ups is not indicative of you're overall conditioning and does not necessarily mean anything in terms of fighting shape.  Obviously strength and conditioning are important but a 4 mile jog is worthless for your training as a fighter.  And one set of 30 pushups is worthless too.  

Sure you hear about some pros running 6, 7, 8 miles a day for training but that distance isn't really the point.  The speed they're doing it and their heart rate is what matters.  You see guys like Pacquiao doing 3 miles for his running but he does that in around 15 minutes.  As an amateur, probably the best running you can do is 1/2 mile sprints.  If you can do each 1/2 mile in 3 minutes with 1 minute rest or less in between, you're pretty well simulating what you'll experience as a fighter and will be increasing your VO2 max far better than a 4 mile jog.

As for the pushups.  30 is a good starting point.  Now start breaking that into sets.  At the end of your workout.  If you can do 3-5 sets of 30, that sounds pretty good.  

&gt;You say that running and push-ups are irrelevant to boxing. I'm begging to *troll*

MC1000,atheism,1389751799.0,"/r/atheism is all about bashing both religion and the adherents of religion. Incessantly and unnecessarily scathingly. In far harsher a way than most religious people bash the beliefs (or, more accurately, lack thereof) of atheists.

This post is not 'just an example'. If it was a representative example, it would also represent unintelligent atheists arguing with extremely intelligent theists - there is no question that the most intelligent theists rival the most intelligent atheists, while the least intelligent atheists are similar to the least intelligent theists.  In fact, I would go as far as to argue that Rowan Williams is more broadly intelligent than Richard Dawkins. Their Oxford University debate from 2012 revealed that Williams - like Dawkins - has a firm grasp of science (admittedly less than Dawkins, but a firm understanding nonetheless); yet, unlike Dawkins, his grasp on both theology and the broader philiosophy behind all of this is immense - far, far greater than anything Dawkins could ever hope to achieve. 

Furthermore, the original post implies that the unintelligent theist goes on about his religion while the intelligent atheist remains smugly quiet. /r/atheism has determined that this is not necessarily the case at all; a certain demographic of atheists are equally, dogmatically vocal about their stance on religion.

However, if you step back and look at the entire species, it is adaptability that wins out.  There is no such thing as a perfect organism adapted to all environments, and a genetically homogeneous species is just asking for something to come along and discover its achilles heel, wiping it out in one fell swoop.  We might genetically engineer ourselves into a species of Arnold bodies and Einstein brains, but what happens when the flu comes along and wipes out 99% of the population because we accidentally eliminated everyone who had a resistance that would have spared them from that particular strain?  That doesn't sound like a recipe for successful reproduction to me.

madhjsp,nfl,1389751967.0,"Also went to UVA, class of 2012.  

This is pretty accurate. Lazor ran a very traditional pro-style offense, somewhat conservative for the most part, but nonetheless fairly effective. We won 8 games in 2011, our best season with him on board. That year, he got surprisingly good production out of a pretty unheralded QB in Michael Rocco, a decent-at-best set of RBs, and a receiving corps lacking any real stars or physical types.  

I always felt that he had a good head for coaching, a decent feel for playcalling, and a knack for coming up with solid game plans that our team could execute well, despite relatively limited offensive talent. As I see it, he was mostly held back by two major factors:  

1) Aforementioned limited talent. He never got the chance to work with a reliable QB at Virginia, or anything better than passable RBs and possession receivers. Now he'll have Stafford, Bush &amp; Bell, and Megatron et al.  

2) Our head coach, Mike London, has to be one of the worst in college football. Long story short, he insisted on QB rotations with mediocre backups, when it was clear that Lazor's offense functioned better with a single starter. Lazor left after 2012, and we won 2 games in 2013 behind an offense that was almost completely unwatchable. And somehow London didn't get canned, but that's a subject for another post on another sub...  

Bottom line: I liked what I saw in Lazor's ability to design an offense with limited talent in college, so I think this is a good move for the Lions, given their wealth of riches on that side of the ball. "

IndependentBoof,Redskins,1389751993.0,"I think the ""self promotion"" criticism is misguided too. He can't be blamed for attention that 24/7 sports media gives him. He's far from the first to have endorsements. Hell, RG3 even *earned* endorsements more than guys like Tebow. The recent Facebook post was hardly self promotion either, he was simply defending himself.

A lot of pro athletes get this kinda of unfair scrutiny. In hockey, Sidney Crosby caught a lot of flack in his first few years because he didn't know how to handle himself well in front of reporters. LeBron James still gets a lot of crap because ESPN decided to hold an hour-long special leading up to his announcement that he was moving to Miami. None of them caused those problems -- all of those instances are the result of sports media overexposing a young star.

Perhaps he did rush himself back too soon. However, although he wasn't 100%, he was obviously healthy enough to play. Adrian Peterson returned after the same amount of time. Also, ultimately, it wasn't RG3's choice whether or not he played. I dare you to find a real gamer who gets the ""okay"" from the doctors and an ""okay"" from the coach but decides *not* to play. If any fault lies on RG3 regarding his injury, it was that he took a few too many risks during his first season and he really should have taken himself out during the Seattle game."

Harry Potter--I don't have much of an explanation. I've seen the movies, but they aren't anything memorable or spectacular to me. My opinion on it is generally really neutral. The Harry Potter World in Universal Studios was awesome though; I enjoyed that.

AliceA,offmychest,1389752363.0,"It may be the law. Ask them before you go in or tell them anything to be sure...maybe even get it in writing so you can sue them if they breach that trust!

Speaking of trust you are likely going to have some real trust issues as you go (and so many people really ARE untrustworthy!)so the best I can tell you is go with your heart and remind yourself there are really good people out in the world who will be fair with you...and you deserve some happiness too!  No one escapes being hurt in relationships so expect that too.

 I mean it when I tell you how brave you are to make this first step at beginning to talk about it with others. That will take some of the onus/stigma away from you I think...as always not everyone will believe you or know how to process it so this is where all that strength you've shown so far will come in. Carry in your heart that you are a good person and just be the best you you can be."

mkvgtired,europe,1389752372.0,"I agree it is somewhat harder to physically express outrage on the national level in the US. I am glad to see a good amount of outrage over the NSA scandal, and things seem to be on their way to changing for the better. Much of that is online, but they seem to be taking note. In a country the size of the NL it would definitely be easier to make a ""show of force"" through physically protesting in the capital.

For me to drive to Washington DC its about 11 hours. For many on the West Coast its about 40 hours. And keep in mind that is driving time, it does not account for any stops or sleeping. 

Depending on how federalized and large the EU gets, some people out East may face a similar scenario in the future but not sure the trip to Brussels would be worth it for most issues right now."

terabyte06,NoStupidQuestions,1389752379.0,"The wattage is what's really important.  Watts = volts * amps.  

Take a 60 watt light bulb for example.  They look the same in both countries because the wattage is the same.  But the amperage the 240v bulb pulls is only half of what the 120v bulb pulls.  

60 watts = 120v * 0.5 amps.

60 watts = 240v * 0.25 amps.

So your fan spins at the same rate because it's getting the same wattage, regardless of the voltage.  It just has to pull twice as much current (amps) as it normally would.  This isn't especially good if the fan isn't rated to handle both voltages, as the higher current will quickly wear out the motor and the wiring in the fan (and worst case, could start a fire)."

anassakata,Portland,1389752797.0,"Hi! Current student here. I transferred back home from your typical secular liberal arts college (not because of that, I'm also not religious and enjoyed a lot of the life there) and have had a great time at UP. It's Catholic in the sense that if you go to large school-sponsored events, there'll likely be a prayer at the start. The profs (minus the Theology department) by no means propagate or conform to an agenda, and in fact I find that oftentimes they wouldn't really be in accordance with what you might think of as a Catholic or religious agenda.

You have to take a few Theology classes, and unfortunately they just axed the world religions aspect of the intro, which a lot of students are still peeved about. It's not so bad. Try not to be That Person who refuses to participate in those classes as a militant atheistic sort of thing. Treat them as a sort of scholarly philosophical history-based study, which they are. Nobody tries to convert or overdefend Catholicism/religion, and except for an occasional slip of the tongue there's never an assumption that 'we' are all Catholics.

I don't think this is entirely because there's a population of Catholics/Christians, but the student body for the most part is fairly white bread and buttoned up, at least during school hours. I kind of appreciate that, because I don't like lots of snippiness or a sense of exclusion. But they still have parties with booze, and frosh friends of mine have gone, so I don't think they enforce that a ton. If you live in the dorms or in one of the houses they own, they can search your stuff for weed or booze. I never lived in the dorms, but it kind of weirded me out. There's also a no-sex policy, but I'm not really clear on how (if?) they enforce it.

Lastly, compared to some of the stuff I've heard of at other schools (especially the type of liberal arts school I came from), despite the no-sex stuff they have a really appropriate definition and policy regarding sexual assault. Not sure if that applies to you.

If you have any other questions, about majors or food or things that don't involve actually living on campus, please let me know!"

maowsers93,TumblrInAction,1389752853.0,"Well, there is quite the thread I just had with another poster about that if you'd like to get into that whole thing. The groups I've worked with never put out public statements regarding SJW's because they'd scream oppression if they did. They have public organizers who make sure their groups aren't seen with or associated with them. They do this through various means like mass emails telling people to wear a certain color, meet in a certain place, don't go to a certain place, etc. 

No group that I know of has ever put out a public bulletin about specific people because 

A. They know that they are generally volatile type people who will scream oppression if they do

B. They don't want to acknowledge them in any manner because doing so will only draw more attention to them. and

C. They don't want to alienate anyone. 

People from particular groups have addressed them individually and asked them to stop making a mockery of the situation but they never do. With the thing that happened last summer for example they kept running over to where the pro-life people were and yelling at them. I knew someone who went over to them and asked them to stop and she was basically attacked as their ""oppressor"" and they started posting stuff on social media about how Naral Pro-Choice was trying to keep them down like the man. It was just ridiculous, but I mean that is the response you get from them. Doing anything other than avoiding them totally just makes the situation worse, especially when it looks like you are the same group of people. "

Just come in from fog, like any normal ganker would.  You don't need to follow people with your E, root them and stand next to them while you hit them, you do enough damage that they will be dead by or shortly after your 3 seconds of root end. And yes, you can use your W to dodge spells, and if I see the need to dodge a specific spell, I will take a point in it. Usually you don't though, Alch stun (with the absurd physical nuke and stun length on it) is one of the few cases where I find it really necessary to take an early point in W, because you root people for 3 seconds and DoT, your E is up, doing more DoT and blocking the damage from said stun; the only thing you lose out on is autoattack damage while stunned.

Godlykha may find that great for his playstyle, I'm not spouting universal advice for Ember, I'm explaining a style of playing him that happens to net me a 60% winrate even at my natural MMR. I believe I even stated that BoT were a solid choice, I just personally did not find them necessary, yes? And phase boots have more uses than just that; they increase the speed of the remnants you throw, allowing you to land them more reliably, give you autoattack damage for both fights and laning, and in *addition* allow you to follow people down with your E when necessary."

It's that Kishimoto couldn't find anything useful for her to do. Sure, she heals people. So does Karin, and Juugo to an extent. She's supposed to surpass Tsunade (who is also super worthless when compared against her own reputation), but knows only the exact same styles and techniques, except less of them.

Then there's her inner monologue. Every major event which happens with her there to experience it is peppered with an infinite loop of ""I'm going to contribute something this time! I'm sick of being left in the dust by those two"". Six hundred chapters later aannnnd... nothing changed. It's almost as if Kishimoto is expressing his passive aggressive misogyny from being jilted by some old crush by consciously deciding that Sakura will by the ONLY character in the series that won't fucking develop at all after that *crucial* turning point where she cut her hair."

1. No, but his words carry weight similarly to Kodlak White-Mane.

2. No, several cities were built by the First Aldmeri Dominion and, therefor, are ""regular"" cities.

3. As far as we've seen, it takes a lot of bosmer performing some secret ritual to initiate the Wild Hunt. It would take a lot, but because the Hunt turns on itself when it's done I would assume it can be stopped by force.

4. I would call it a temperate rainforest.

5. Maybe?

6. Common, but they're probably treated as second class citizens due to their simple nature and bestial appearance.

7. Walking, gondolas, moving trees, running through treetops, maybe some kind of mount?

8. Maybe?

9. Ayleid might be in the north with Aldmeri to the south.

10. I doubt that bosmer are cannibalistic at large, mostly due to a lack of evidence in-game. Occasional tribal cannibalistic rituals or tendencies are a possibility, however.

11. I would think the boats they use to travel are similar to gondolas, as I previously stated.

12. Again, I doubt the validity of the Meat Mandate, but I know that a free-willed people like the bosmer would look down upon slavery.

13. I like to think that they technically have, but the bosmer only treat the traditional boundaries of Valenwood with the respect required in the Green Pact.

14. No idea, but I like the idea that leibro had about bosmeri navy, what with the boat trees.

15. That's an odd question, but I doubt they would care about not harming a non-native plant if they needed to.

16. I don't think that Falinesti rooting is a sign of death, but we'll see.

17. No, definitely not.

With a really quick glance on Wikipedia, I saw that while there is treatment, there seems to be no consensus on efficacy, although there was a study that showed 90% success, so who knows.

But in the end, maybe the guy doesn't want to put all his time into a girl only to find out that they maybe won't be compatible when it comes to sex.  Another user /u/Benn1 commented that (and I'm taking this out of context, I'm only posting this particular part because it's relevant to my post):

&gt;However if it's a choice between you and the countless women out there who have no issue having sex, I'll choose them.

I'd say this is reasonable.  Her ability to have sex is up in the air.  For all we know, maybe she really can't have sex.  If someone can't deal with that, then they shouldn't waste her time with a relationship they're going to end anyway.  There's nothing wrong with that."

I think one of the ""advantages"" of having such experiences as you have had is that it does make you strive more for a happy/good life than you otherwise might. That spirit will keep you sane and stable...well more stable maybe! No one is perfect so even though you are striving so very hard do not forget that your ideals aren't the only way to look at the world, so do allow people and different goals to enter your life...and when you make mistakes forgive yourself, dust yourself off and learn from them!

And those pesky trust issues are likely going to plague you all your life in different degrees and forms...just do the best you can...and I do think professional help would be better for that than just trying on your own. 

That sense of not being worthy is a real bitch to deal with too! Let me tell you straight up you ARE worthy! It's a horrible thing to do to a child and while you were the victim just do what ever you can to not live your entire life as a victim. You have inner strength others wish they had.

-If you have a bitch of an item that spits out every 5th manastone or whatever, look for the pattern, does it seem to do three successfully and fail on the fourth go? Does every other stone go in? If you spot a pattern, get some cheap manastones of the same level and a piece of crappy gear, and put the turn you think is likely to fail on the other piece. I've had mixed success with this but I have know people who swear by it.

-For L65 eternal items it can really be worth it to go for high stones if you are trying to get above +10. You can waste a lot of money failing on slightly lower stones, sometimes just getting really high ones and crossing your fingers (while on full DP, in the middle of the night, naked, with your feet in a bowl of yoghurt and pants on your head) can pay off.

He was more like the other guys I knew and liked, and he never did scare me.

I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. 

Written Torah came from G-d. It tells us what G-d wants from us, our relationship, our creation, our purpose.

Oral Torah came from G-d or was inspired by G-d, whichever you believe. If the first, then your questions doesn't make sense because there would be no distinction between written and oral. If you believe the latter, isn't that... well part of the definition inherent in it being ""inspired by G-d""?

kakersdozen,OSU,1389753749.0,"I didn't go Greek. Also, being female, I couldn't tell you what frats are really like. I can tell you, though, that Greek life isn't necessary. At a lot of schools, you have to go Greek if you want a social life. OSU is not like that at all. The vast majority of students are not Greek and there is still plenty to do outside of frat parties and other Greek events. 

The Greek community mostly keeps to itself, probably due to the way that it is set up. I've known people in frats/sororities, and they had to dedicate a lot of time towards Greek events throughout the week. As a result, their friends were almost exclusively Greek just due to the fact that they spent so much time with their brothers/sisters and not as much with people outside that group. It's not for everyone, but a few thousand people seem to like it.

A GDI perspective: Greek life is douchey. But if you like it, then our opinion of you won't matter. Try it out, and if you like it, do it. If you don't, there are plenty of us on the outside that you don't have to pay thousands of dollars to hang out with. (Cue the GDI hating on this post because I implied they paid for friends!)

OSU has a welcome concert and a spring concert every year, sometimes they have multiple concerts in a week. They are all free and the opener is some big name. Off the top of my head, I remember seeing Drake, Skrillex, OAR (who are from OSU), Childish Gambino, Lupe Fiasco, and a few more that I can't remember right now. They also bring in a bunch of speakers from all areas: Jane Goodall, the US Women's Soccer Team, Bill Nye, James Cameron, etc. Check out OUAB.

doth_revenge,WritingPrompts,1389753806.0,"Going into my senior year, I've become a bit numb to the number floating over my head. 3.479.  Nothing to write home about, but nothing to be embarrassed about either.  I still got an internship last summer even if I had to work harder than some of my more blessed peers.  I still get some special attention.  I am still of value to society.

It's like this.  Freshmen are always easy to spot. Just a series of dashes.  A nice clean slate after high school.  For some, this is frustrating.  Why do they have to go through a semester without the privileges of being a 4.000?  They get treated the same as everyone else, don't get the best spots in the classroom, the special attention from the teachers, nothing.  They want to be their number, and for some, being stripped of it is traumatic.  On the other hand, the 2.0ers who barely got into college love it.  For once they are given a clean slate, can be friends with anyone, and are given the same opportunities as everyone.

When the next semester rolls around though, trends start to appear.  Classes become segregated by GPA.  4.0's are always in the front, sucking up to the professor, taking careful notes.  They all know each other and are courteous, even if they're not really friends.  It's hard to be friends with your competition when there's no way to go up- only down.  Sure, they might do study groups, but none of them actually trust each other.

Then you have the 3.8's to 3.9's, the dean's list students.  They are generally nicer to each other and actually have some genuine friendships.  They're more common to see involved in clubs and activities, working jobs and studying.  They still get special attention and privileges, they still get awards and scholarships, and recruiters know that, generally, these are the students they want.  Like 4.0ers, they don't have to look for jobs, the jobs come to them.

Generally the 3.0 and higher groups look the same, with the 3.5-3.7's together, the 3.2-3.4's together, and the 3.0-3.1's together.  We don't get as much privilege.  We're stuck in the middle of the room, we have to seek out recruiters.  We have to work.  We know that we have to maintain where we are.  Going higher feels impossible, but going lower is a fate none of us want.  It could be worse though.

If you're under a 3.0, professors don't look twice at you.  The ones higher than 2.5 but lower than 3.0 at first work hard, but the farther they get in their college careers, the less they care.  They become resigned to their fate of being menial workers.  The secretaries, the assistants- they'll never have a title of their own.  The 3.0 becomes a glass ceiling to them that won't break.

2.0's to 2.5's group together.  They're generally laid back, happy to be passing and still being given a chance to get a degree.  That's all they need.  They're not serious, but they're not slackers either.  Their friendships are genuine, and they don't overwork themselves.  They know they'll end up in the same place as the 2.5 to 3.0's when all is said and done.

Finally there are those beneath 2.0.  They never last long in university.  College wasn't mean for them.  Some just go into the workforce, others go to technical school and apprenticeships.  You see them elsewhere- as cashiers, baristas, mechanics, construction workers.

Eventually, we all leave college.  The number never leaves though.  Society is ranked by this number.  We all exist in little glass boxes.  We all associate with our own kind.  It's sad really, but it's the way it's always been.  Gender, race, sexuality- none of it matters in the face of a number.  One mistake, one bad semester, and you lose your place in society.  Suicide and a rapid fall in GPA have a direct correlation, and yet no one has tried to change it.  No one wants to.  The system works, society is kept in line, and everyone is where they should be.  So is life."

It's not a matter of genetics and being short conveys no meaningful disadvantages.  But heightism is a big deal and it does convey a substantial disadvantage.  I'm going to spare you the statistics right now, but heightism does have a huge impact on a person's social outcomes.  Essentially, tall men and short men may as well live on two separate worlds when it comes to pretty much every dimension of social opportunity.  

And, to make things worse, this social discrimination is encouraged and maintained by the concept that ""it's not a big deal"" and that short people (men, especially) are innately inferior.  Just look at many of the comments on this very thread.  Many people hold an essentialist mindset when it comes to the topic  of short men.  That is, they believe that a certain behavior and set of social characteristics are innate to being short and male.  When in fact, to the extent that they exist at all, they represent the result of an ongoing struggle against the systemic exercise of social power in a burdensome, cruel, arbitrary, and unjust manner."

A lot of people detest the smell of cannabis. If one person is causing an entire floor to smell like something that a lot of people don't like, chances are, someone will complain. The owners won't WANT to call the police, but after a certain amount of complaints, they almost have to. So then the police show up to the property they were ASKED to come to by the owners. The owners take them to a room in where someone might be doing something illegal. Then the owner, not the cops, looks in the room to make sure it's the correct room. Then they knock. Honestly, they probably don't even need to knock. There is no abuse of power here. People give cops way too much shit sometimes. If someone calls them because illegal activity is harming their business, it's their job to show up. Blame the person who couldn't be bothered to buy a $20 Smoke buddy and a $7 can of Ozium. "
ImOldGregggggg,AskWomen,1389754292.0,"Push your shoulders back and your chin forward. 

Even if this seems obvious, stand up straight. 

When you're in a full body picture, shift your weight to your back leg and don't stand with your weight equally distributed. To have your weight on your back leg (farther from the camera) makes your front leg look thinner. 

If you're self conscious about your arms, don't have them laying flat against your body if you're being photographed from the side. It'll create the dreaded arm blobs. Instead, put one arm on your hips or in your pocket. Anything to keep it slightly out from your chest. 

Smile at the last minute or don't smile until right as the camera goes off. Think of something that makes you genuinely happy when you do smile. It'll help your smile be more 'real'. 

If you seem to look angry in all the photos, slightly raise your eyebrows. *Slightly*. Otherwise it will make you look surprised.

If you are in a group picture, lean forward slightly from the hips. This will help prevent double chin or you looking awkward with extremely good posture. "

I am wondering if these other females that are saying this are asian also, and was your date asian?

I see a lot of 5'2"" asian men at my work that are married. I work in a place where I see hundreds of people everyday.

How did I cope. Well I know that this is not going to be liked by everyone on this sub but, start a body building routine and grow some muscle to give them the feeling of a little more protection when they see you. That will add a little more size acceptance that your height takes away. With todays supplement it is easier than ever before. Go to a gym and let them give you a routine to build on. Don't be shy, let them know what you are going for. Not just definition over time but bulk. You will actually begin to really enjoy it over time. But don't over do it at first. A little pain and a little gain while going forward.

I suspect that the rest you are doing well because of your success at this point. Clothing, style, hair.

The truth is women are all different and will respond differently, so their is no magical solution to finding one that you will be with for the rest of your life.

Don't worry about the coping idea, just keep improving who you are in general. Women love some ambition in a man, even if it is just simple things."

ellathelion,truegaming,1389754359.0,"Yeah, sure, but the other side of the 'body image campaigns' and anti-barbie talk is that women who actually are naturally a 'model' body type (tall, very slim) and can't gain weight, or women who have an extreme hourglass (say, 41""/26""/40"") actually are excluded from being 'real women'. And I say that from personal experience, in both cases.

Maybe I like that when I turn on a video game I actually can get a visually similar character. Maybe I like that they're allowed to be sexually open, and through them I can experience, even minutely, that freedom without the backlash from society.

I think we need variety, not to condemn certain portrayals (especially visual portrayals) of women. Because in some ways, getting into a video game is the only way I can have any discourse about my body - even if I do something like complain about not being able to find a single pair of jeans in my city that will accommodate both my hip/waist ratio and my height, it's always apparently a 'humblebrag'."

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1389754569.0,"If anyone wants to hear a good TRP/MRA podcast from a pretty intelligent philosopher, check out Freedomain ep 2578 ""Are women held morally responsible?"" There is a lot of good stuff in that podcast. Especially the part about women initiating divorce. 

There is a good chunk in it with a lot of supporting data showing that single fathers are much more effective than single mothers. Ideally, both parents add value, but if you had to choose one over the other, it's best for society and the child's future to go with the single father. Mainly because fathers surprisingly are the main influence of teaching empathy, male bonding, and hardwork. Children of single fathers get in FAR less trouble in school, and do much better in life.

What's funny, is society sort of recognizes this. You often hear about the struggles a child had to overcome being raised by a single mother. But when it's a single father, society just sort of shrugs like it's not that big of a deal. 

Also, something I've personally noticed is that many people in the male self-help sphere tend to have father issues. In the seduction relm, it's crazy how high that number is. Just about EVERY single serious seduction member can tell you a story about their shitty relationship with their fathers. So many guys have to go out and reestablish their masculinity, because they never had positive male figures teaching them how to be a man. Seriously, I would have never have guessed if you would have asked me 2 years ago. "

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1389754654.0,"Without getting too far into gender issues, our society tends to teach women that men spending money on them is a major way for them to measure their value.  It is also not uncommon for men to use money as a way to control women.  When you combine those two norms, you create an environment in which it is challenging for women to appreciate and be comfortable with frugality, as society says that it is either an indicator of poor social value, a warning sign of a controlling partner, or both.

This is not to say all women are raised this way (most foreign nationals and second-generation immigrants I have met are not), but they are messages that are commonly repeated in our media, and so most people will be affected by them.

Understanding this is very important.  When we started getting serious about budgeting, it was very stressful for my wife, who was raised in a very financially unhealthy environment.  We worked through it slowly, and I explained exactly what I was trying to do, and we discussed the goals to make sure that we were in agreement as far as what we ultimately want for ourselves, our family, and our lifestyle.  We then discussed exactly what it would take to get there.  I have spreadsheets and graphs for everything, so I explained exactly what we could expect based upon my proposed plan, what factors might change that (inflation, inability to continue to advance my career, economic issues, unexpected expenses, etc.), and what we would do in case any of those happened.  Once we set our goals together (we had talked about them before of course, but had never truly formalized them), and she had an understanding of the systems that would get us there, the apprehension disappeared, as she understood the reasons for the numbers I was proposing, and that they were not arbitrary or excessively constraining (i.e. not an attempt to control her), and that we have the flexibility to adapt to changes without compromising the minimum lifestyle we have decided on.

I hope this is helpful.

Edit: nice to see some conflicting perspectives. I just want to be absolutely clear that I was not trying to make a sweeping generalizing, just to provide some insight into factors that might be creating a conflict of financial values. Men have their own pressures when it comes to poor financial decisions, and many times people are just financially ignorant, or just may not share the same values.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389754863.0,"&gt;Everyone would constantly tell me that I'd ""catch up"", and that people ""develop at different paces""…plus my parents are relatively tall (dad - 5'11"", mum 5'6"") so while I hated being short as a kid, I used to just look forward to growing up…I was certain it'd happen eventually. 

I think a lot of us could share similar stories of adults telling us things like that because they thought it would be helpful.  Of course, those sort of things are usually more damaging than anything else.  But, I can even remember being young and hating when adults said that I would probably have a growth spurt even though my growth had been slow and steady.  I remember that one of my favorite adults (a baseball coach) saw me and my friends for the first time after coming back to school after the summer where a lot of guys get their biggest growth spurt.  He basically looked at each of my friends and commented about ""how much they've grown"".  And then, he got to me and said ""well, Geoff....it's good to see you again"".  Lulz.  I loved that dude because he was about the only adult who didn't give me a speech about how I ""shouldn't worry"" because that growth spurt would be coming any day now.  

Who's worried?  I wasn't worried until I got all these comments indicating that height was such a big deal.  :-)"

I don't know how to say this so that it can't be interpreted as condescending, so I'll just say that it's not my intention at all. I don't know how many people who read Naruto read stuff that isn't manga. My guess is most of the people who are happy with the current story only read manga, comics and/or young adult lit. Shonen writing is, as a rule, somewhat predictable and heavy-handed. I accept that about it without reservation, but Kishimoto has gotten careless on par with Kubo (of Bleach fame). All I'm saying is Naruto seemed a lot better before I started enjoying literature. Part of that is the comparative quality of the storytelling, but I'm pretty sure the writing has also gotten worse objectively."

kempff,Catholicism,1389754967.0,"Looks like Pozzo was a priest and then was consecrated bishop November 3, 2012, and immediately upon consecration became the bishop of Bagnoregio.

Bagnoregio was an episcopal see from 600 until its suppression in 1986 when it and several other episcopal sees were combined into the diocese of Viterbo, but in 1991 the title of Archbishop of Bagnoregio was revived, albeit without any corresponding real territory or persons subject to it, and Pozzo succeeded to the title, probably immediately upon his consecration, since he was likely consecrated for the sake of becoming Almoner, a position typically held by a bishop rather than a priest.

The difference between a bishop and an archbishop, incidentally, is in the kind of see he is bishop of. The bishop of an archdiocese is by that fact an archbishop.

The pope did not make Pozzo a bishop; the three bishops who consecrated him made him bishop. Francis, however, granted Pozzo the title of the archepiscopal see of Bagnoregio, automatically turning Bishop Pozzo into an archbishop.

So yes and no.

silly87,TrueAskReddit,1389755078.0,"&gt;You can disagree with anyone, but physically preventing them from doing something they feel is right, like threatening them is wrong, and that is not what I am doing. 

First of all, you don't have to physically prevent someone from doing something to be a bigot.  If I say that all women are stupid bitches, I'm a bigot whether I ever actually touch a woman or not.  Second of all, you ARE trying to prevent them from doing something they feel is right: you are trying to prevent them from exchanging marriage vows.

&gt;I am not protesting at the Capitol demanding they not be given rights. In fact, no one I know has done that. I don't have straight parades. 

Again, you don't have to do *any* of this to be a bigot.  If I say all black people are stupid and lazy, I'm a bigot, whether I ever try to stop them from having rights or not.

&gt; I don't threaten organizations or people who disagree with me either as they do.

Wat?

&gt;If it was just rights, then why all the ""in your face"" rhetoric

There are a few reasons for this.  One of the biggest is that for so long it has been considered wrong to be homosexual.  Homosexual men and women were not allowed to be out in the open, living their lives as they wanted to.  Their response was to say, ""Wait.  No.  Fuck that.  Not only are we gay and it's okay to be gay, we're *proud* of who we are.""  This is very similar to the Black Power movement and to second wave feminism (bra burning, nudity, being ""proud"" to be women, etc).  It's reactionary.  You're going to tell me I'm inferior for being a woman?  Well fuck you, I'm not going to be ashamed.  I'm proud I'm a woman!  And in their case, you're going to tell them they should be ashamed?  Well fuck you, they're proud!  Get over it.  YOU don't have to be gay.  YOU don't have to have sex with another man.  

&gt; tell me the gay agenda is not bigoted or wanting power:

Who are they bigoted against?  And YES, they do want power because the more power they get, the closer they are to wanting rights!  Can you really not see this?  Black people want power too because a black person in power is more likely to give black people equal rights than a white person.  Women want power because a woman in power is more likely to give women equal rights than a man.  

From your link:

Paragraph 1: I see nothing at all wrong with this.  In fact, it's quite eloquent and I agree completely.

Paragraph 2: this is tongue in cheek as fuck.  Again, it's reactionary.  You believe masculinity means heterosexuality?  Well fuck you, I'll seduce your son.  By son they don't mean underage little boy, in fact they use the word ""men.""  It's a stupid misconception that homosexual = pedophilia.  They are not one in the same.  There are many straight people who are pedophiles.

Paragraph 3:  I see no problem.  I would be fine with someone saying that my co-workers must be tolerant of women and black people, or they can get out.  You can have whatever personal beliefs you want, but when working with people of other races, sexes, sexualities, etc., keep it to yourself.

Paragraph 4:  Again, no problem there.  What they're saying is: since Americans have been trained to be disgusted by homosexuality, we're going to get them to think about it as an ideology.  Do we want to discriminate based on the sex of two consenting adults?  And most people finally realized that no, we don't want that.  Well, okay, by the way, some gay men choose to have anal sex and gay women tend to give each other oral sex.  So what?  Straight people do these things too.

The ""statistics:"" Looks like a bunch of stuff consenting adults do.  Straight people do this stuff as well.  Again: **consenting adults.** Why do you care what they do?  They're not asking you to join.

Dreadnougat,technology,1389755113.0,"What?  I did not say that genetically engineering ourselves is a bad idea.  Read my post again - I just said that we have to be smart about it and preserve our genetic diversity while improving ourselves.

&gt;by that logic we shouldn't be using modern medicine, because it's just going against natural selection.

No, by my logic the opposite is true.  Modern medicine allows us to preserve some traits that may otherwise have died out.  This increases our diversity rather than decreasing it, which is good in the long run.

&gt;also, genetic diversity does not guarantee nature will find a cure for a disease.

Of course it doesn't.  But a lack of diversity hugely increases our chances of disaster.  We've foolishly walked into this trap multiple times before in our food supply - it was a lack of diversity which led to the [Great Famine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_%28Ireland%29) of Ireland.  The fact that a single strain of potato made up a disproportionately large percentage of the food supply allowed a disease to come in and ravage the entire crop at once - other strains were more resistant to the blight.  You have to understand that the problem was not that the strain grown was particularly susceptible to disease in general - this could have happened to any strain.  It was fact that there was no diversity which allowed the total devastation of the potato crop.  There has been a lot of talk lately about Cavendish bananas which you may have heard, in that they are at risk of going extinct for the same reason.

All I'm saying is that if we start genetically engineering ourselves, then we better approach it correctly, otherwise we put ourselves at the same risk."

Skate down the middle towards the goalie. Do a quick move to your backhand and then back to your forehand, then fake a shot to your forehand side of the net. Include a head fake and a leg kick to really get the goalie tricked. However, instead of shooting, just move the puck over on your forehand more, so that it is about level with the post. This is almost certainly get the goalie moving to your forehand side, so it is now a simple task to quickly pull the puck over to your backhand and lift it over his pad.

Plan B only prevents [ovulation](http://m.livescience.com/29215-how-plan-b-works.html) and increases the mucous lining of the reproductive organs to keep sperm from reaching an egg. It does not prevent implantation from fertilized eggs. 

In fact, any information you see from Plan B clearly states that the pill doesn't work after 72 hours after intercourse. Implantation of a fertilized egg happens a week to two weeks after intercourse. If Plan B prevented implantation it would be effective for up to 2 weeks, but it isn't because it doesn't. 

But this is what this whole topic is about right? The constant need for people to attack women's health under the guise of abortion and morality.

Texas also has the highest mortality rates for preventable and treatable diseases like cervical cancer. We also have some of the highest STD rates, and the highest rate of repeat teen pregnancy.

&gt; The next big question is undoubtedly ""okay, then what about hell?"" ... The Bible says it is possible for people to ""go"" there. How this is possible given Jesus' work is inexplicable. It seems completely absurd for someone to end up in hell. Yet it also seems to be the case that it can happen. **Personally, I don't think it's something I ought to concern myself with** given God's work on the cross.

(Emphasis mine.)

I *do* think it's something we ought to concern ourselves with. It seems to me that who gets sent to hell and why speaks quite a bit to character of the one doing the sending. If I'm going to love and serve him, I want to know that he's worthy.

&gt; Further, I mentioned before Colossians 1:19-20 saying God reconciled all things to himself, whether things on earth or in heaven.

You can substitute hill repeats for any of the interval workouts, or even in place of a Tempo Run or two if you want.""

Her0_0f_time,stocks,1389755340.0,"Ok, this is the process that I have been using, though I only just started so I may not be very good. 

I look at a screener to see what happened the previous day with stocks that are not on my watch list. See if there are any to add or whatnot. Normally I look for something that had a decent sized drop within the past month.


[Here is the settings I use](http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=211&amp;f=cap_microover,sh_avgvol_o500,sh_price_u10,ta_beta_o0.5&amp;ft=4
)

[Here is an example of what I look for with these settings.](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRIS&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d&amp;b=1)

Notice the drop in both November and December. While that usually isn't a good sign (And as you will see in this case might be true and why I wont be buying into the stock) it really depends on what the reason for the drop was.  In this case a mix of a bad drug trial and a small Q3 earnings report makes me think this is a stock to pass over.  Too risky and not much chance for profit. So I pass over it. Now lets look at something that I would buy into with these settings.

[Chart](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DRWI&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d&amp;b=1)

Normally if you just look at the chart, its not enough to make a good decision on it, and some may pass it by. But Looking at the [recent news for the company](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/dragonwave-inc-reports-third-quarter-221500712.html), You can see that there was a subpar Q3 report. However, (And this is important) they are expecting Q4 to bring in more money. As well as the fact that just this past friday the company signed a deal with a major US carrier. This leads me to believe that the stock will start to turn upwards within the next few months.  Something to keep an eye on. And since the stock is at a low price, if I have the spare money, I would buy into it.  

Sure, my process isn't for large growth over a short amount of time, but I am not a day trader.  This is just to supplement my day job. Also, remember I am still new to this. And this is the process that I learned from this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkZb4yH2NzY)"

That piece of paper could be the only way for many trans men and women to even just get a license with the correct marker on it. Without having ID to match their presentation, that could and likely will out them without their knowledge or control of how and when that information is shared. This can and often does result in violence. Trans violence stats are a very real and scary fact. Only .223% of the US is trans and 3.8% is openly gay, despite this huge difference, trans violence is over six times greater than violence relating to homosexuality. That means that for every violent event relating to being gay there are around one hundred for being trans. 

Measures like this aren't just for feelings. It saves lives. Is your shitty attitude towards trans people worth the life of even one human being, no matter if you agree with how they live their life or not?

He's not as good as his wife (Lois Lane), but he's still fantastic. Sure, she gets more Superman interviews and Lex Luthor exclusives, but Kent writes from the everyman perspective. Lane makes the world know that Superman is just as much of a hero as we imagine him to be, but Kent is the one telling everyone how the people of Metropolis react to alien attacks. He's also been a war correspondent. I don't know if you've ever been shot at, but Mr. Kent sure has.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1389755609.0,"First of all, most of the early sexual encounters between people are less than ideal. It takes practice and communication to really get comfortable with someone sexually, and to learn what they like (and for them to learn what you like). Yes, comfort is a big part of that, but the only way for the sex to ""start being good"" is to start having sex. Waiting will not magically make you more or less skilled in bed, nor will it make her any more or less skilled in bed. It's totally valid that you're waiting until you're comfortable, but good or bad sex depends on a lot more than that.

Second, what is your understanding of ""a long time"" and ""very quickly""? From my own opinion, sex is a really important part of a relationship for me. I don't feel the need to rush into sex immediately, but I do want to start exploring that aspect of our relationship fairly early. Sexual incompatibility is one of the biggest problems that comes up on reddit in relationships, and if there is such an incompatability between me and a new partner, I want to know that before I have a deep emotional investment. So, personally, I wouldn't wait months to have sex with someone. If I started seeing someone who wanted to wait that long, I probably would not be willing to wait. 

Which leads me to the final point: how to communicate that. The number one thing you should do is be frank and honest. Just tell her: ""Hey, BillieJoe, I really like you and I wanted to take a minute to talk about us. We've been seeing each other for a few weeks now, and I just want to put it out there that I usually wait to have sex until I know someone very well - probably around [insert time estimate here - a month, six months, whatever].

Same thing with bacon, Redditors just kept talking about how awesome bacon is, in the way Reddit does. And bacon then became Reddit's official food (hence the konami code on Reddit).

GetOffMyLawn_,Fibromyalgia,1389755818.0,"While there is no cure there is treatment. There are a few drugs approved specifically for fibro. There are lots of other things to try in terms of lifestyle, diet and supplements. 

Regarding your migraines: Two of the medications approved for fibro can be useful in preventing migraines. Lyrica would be one, and could possibly help with migraine pain. Cymbalta would be the other. It's an SNRI (works on norepinephrine and serotonin pathways) and related to SSRIs (serotonin only) which are good at preventing migraines. So you could potentially kill 2 birds with 1 stone. Google for ""Lyrica migraine prophylaxis"" and ""Cymbalta migraine prophylaxis"". One of the downsides of these drugs is that they may cause insomnia as a side effect, in which case you would also need some sleep medication. Nothing works on fatigue like a good long night's sleep. I would say that based on my own experience sometimes just a sleep medication is a huge help for the pain, the fatigue and migraine prevention.

Based on personal experience both SSRIs and Lyrica are good for pain. I couldn't tolerate the side effects from Cymbalta and eventually I stopped taking an SSRI since I found that made me more fatigued. Right now I don't take anything for pain other than headache pills for headaches. Even tricyclics work extremely well on chronic pain and migraine prevention, and they have the added bonus of being sedating so you can take them at bedtime and sleep thru the night. They do come with stronger side effects, like dry mouth. I took those for years before SSRIs became the thing. 

Any rheum worth his or her salt realizes what a miserable disease fibro is. Find a different doc, get a complete work up to make sure you don't have  something curable, and then start testing out the meds available. Everyone has a different response to meds, what works for some doesn't work for others and vice versa, and it can take months to get the full effect."

maowsers93,TumblrInAction,1389755851.0,"Yup, people can argue that it is an abortifacient even if they want to ignore the studies that have shown that it isn't, but they can't lie about numbers. Trying to tie any delusion to a pill causing abortion that clearly doesn't work after 72 hours of conception is total fallacy considering it takes 4 more days at minimum for the zygote to implant. 

The argument of illegals really doesn't apply because women make 50% of the population in Texas whether illegal or not. That still means that half the illegals would be men and half would be women but the discrepancy between the two with health insurance remains. Therefore the need for low cost health clinics for women's remains if for no other reason than for fiscal necessity. 

Either way this isn't an argument against pro-life ideals. This has absolutely nothing to do with abortion or pro-life arguments. This is 100% a topic of women's reproductive health and the fact that in the state of Texas it is woefully lacking, and men's reproductive health for that matter isn't that much more impressive here.

More people arrived than anticipated so there wasn't enough seats for everyone.  Since I was one of the first on the bus, I had a seat. The prettiest girl in my school by far was on the bus with us but was the last on, so she was without a seat.  Now she was one of those girls that matured very early as she was at least a DD cup, and she loved to show them off.  To top it off, she is Brazilian.  And you could say she had a stereotypical Brazilian booty.    That night, she was wearing a dress that barely covered them at all and fit her like a glove.  She was all curves.  Needless to say, I was very attracted to her that night and so was my friend down under.  So, this girl comes over my way and I offer her my seat. She bends down, tits in my face and whispers, ""That's okay, I'll just sit on your lap."" BAM! Insta-boner.  And in slow motion she went to sit down.  Let's just say my lap was not the first thing she had contact with.

The same goes for her family. If she's not interested in that, then end your marriage and find someone who is. 

Her family sound like awful people. Her grandfather was lucky he had someone like you to befriend him, and there's absolutely nothing unmanly about being a friend to an old man who needs one. Can you maybe find out what home they put him in and go see him occasionally? I'm sure he would love to see you. 

And for what it's worth, I'm a woman and a feminist; but I've known so many guys in my life who have been Nice Guys and tried to hard to please and let people walk all over them. I've recommended that book to several of them and it's really helped them out. Everyone deserves a loving, equal, respectful relationship. 

Good luck. "

sorabird,AskWomen,1389756251.0,"I enjoyed the Avengers, but I agree on the last two. I grew up with Harry Potter, but I grew increasingly less interested as I got older. After book 4 or so (I was maybe 10ish?) I was really just reading it to finish the series. I've felt no need to go back and reread or rewatch it, either.

The Hunger Games I read due to a recommendation from a friend. I enjoyed the action in the first book, but I wouldn't have called it good writing, not really. I got increasingly irritated with the second and third books, at the end of which I decided I actively disliked it. I did end up watching the first movie, but I didn't think it was anything special.

I had a particularly incredible English professor my senior year of high school, and thanks to her I ended up separating what I would call good writing and simply writing I enjoy - not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, I really enjoyed reading Brave New World, and I considered it very good writing. Most of the books I read, though, while entertaining and fun to read, don't display the same level of skill with writing, instead relying on gimmicks and overuse of metaphors and the like (not to say that you can't use them frequently, but you should really have a purpose to it if you're going to use them as much as I see in certain books). 

My very favorite books are somewhere in the middle of what I consider good writing. The classics, while often better written than other books I've read, are a little too much work for me to want to read them in my free time. Books that lean to the other end can be fun for one reading, but I tend to get irritated with them once I've finished and they have little reread value for me.

Basically, I'm very picky about the books I read, which probably helped contribute to the fact that I don't read a whole lot any more. I usually confine it to the 3-4 series of books (which, together, is probably reaching 40 individual books) and the occasional recommendation. 

This isn't to say I judge people with different tastes than mine. I have a friend who reads nothing but classics and adores talking about them, and I have a friend who still enjoys YA fiction even though she's a little older than the target audience. Both of them are valid preferences, and I always think you should read whatever makes you happy.

Sorry for writing a novel."

I normally release off my index finger only.  I don't think this is a big deal either way.  Whatever is more comfortable.

&gt; 2 - Shooter should dip before shot to set rhythm.

I think this really depends on the circumstance of the shot.  I have heard it's better not to dip on free throws because it adds another variable.  I agree with that but yet I dip on free throws.  It just feels better.  

&gt; 3 - Legs should swing &amp; sway

amishbreakfast,rpg,1389756257.0,"It's totally awesome.  I could really go on and on about it, but I'll try to keep it brief.

**For me, it made being the GM fun again.**

After years and years of 3.5, I was so burned out from D&amp;D.  SW was love at first sight.  In our first game, I actually stood up and yelled, ""Fuck D&amp;D!  I'm never going back!""

In SW, it's very easy to make GM calls on the fly without worrying about breaking the game.  Combat is fast and fun but still tactical and you won't have to crack open the rulebook every 15 minutes.  The open-ended die rolls are way more exciting than nat 20's.

SW has a lot of really oddball settings, familiar enough to be easily approached, strange enough to be memorable.  My guys especially loved *Rippers*, *Pirates of the Spanish Main*, and *Slipstream*.  If your guys like dungeon-diving, the *Fantasy Toolkit* is totally kickass.

The one complaint I hear over and over is from new players weirded out by the concept of ""wild die"".  If they can bypass that mental obstacle, they will probably love it too."

Epicman93,AskReddit,1389756326.0,"Not OP, but I can give you guys a similar story, several storys actually.

So a little over 2 years ago I was taking my senior year of high school, wich was a different school closer to home than the boarding school I had been attending for 2 years. Since the school was close, I could take the bus.

This was going to be a good year. I had recently broken up with a girl after 1.5 rough years together, I could reconnect with some old friends, and the best thing was that I reconnected with someone else. A girl. A cute girl. She had been my neighbour for 13 years, but we had rarely talked, we used to play a bit when we were kids but that was it. So now I met her again, and holy fuck was she beautiful. I fell for her instantly.

So me and this cute girl took the same bus, wich led us to hanging out more and more. This continued and escalated in a good way for several months, until we started making out at a friends party. The next couple of days we both tried to hide the fact of what happened, but after a week or two she asked me what I felt about her. I was honest with my feelings, and she felt mutual. This led to agood few days, up until a few days before christmas.

She sent me a text, stating that she wanted to talk to me. I met her outside her house. She then told me that she couldn't keep seeing me, since I still talked with my ex from time to time, and never really fully dissmiss her. Me and the cute girl stopped talking.

Weeks went by and I started talking more to my ex, and we decided to hang out, which led to kissing (stupid, I know). A few more weeks went by and I talked less with my ex, and reconnected more with the cute girl. Long story short, we got in a relationship, and I stopped talking to my ex and told her of the situation with cute girl (soon to be crazy bitch).

The next 4 months were awesome! I never knew how good it was to actually love a girl to that extent! But this was soon to decline. 

I was on a roadtrip with her, when she started talking about my ex. She had recently starting doing this for some reason, even though I hadn't talked to her for 4 months. She asked if my ex had ever sat in my car with me after I got my license at 18. I responded yes, and told her what had happened after she broke things off with us a couple of months earlier. She flipped shit. She got out of my car, started screaming, calling her friends, telling them what had happened, and she told med that we were through. I was crushed. I didn't want to lose her, the person who showed me what kind of attachement one can have to a girl. So i caved in, told her I would do anything to get her back. Man was i dumb.

Over the next weeks she gradually calmed down about what happened during our roadtrip, but she became more... weird. She became extremely emotional very fast, something shehad been for some time, but it became more clearer now. She also demanded to know where I were at all times, something she had done to a more vague extent earlier. She also blamed me for everything, and made me cancel plans, dinners, family-time, hell even work, just to hang out with her when she had nothing to do! She started trash-talking my friends, and tried to get me to drop them in favor of her friends. She also made me break contact with all my female friends. She would go as far as deleting numbers of my cell. This was just the beginning though.

Things became hazy for me over the next months but a few situations stood out. Like my best friends birthday party.

My best friend had recently turned 19. He wasn't the most social and popular person, he had gone through a bit of bullying and such, from me included, which made me feel sorry and actually try and establish a friendship with him, something that turned out awesome, since he was actually a really good guy. Anyway. I had gathered a few guys to come over to his house and have som pizza, beer and play some board games and watch TV with him. The night was going well, we had a good time, up until my ex called me.

She had for the last weeks started telling me that she could see ghosts and shit. Telling methat she was being tormented by an old man and a little girl. Something I didn't really believe in. As I said she called me during the B-day party, and started ranting about how these ghosts were nearby. I told her to calm down and go see her family in the floor below her, but she cut me off stating that she would kill herself. I freaked and told her to calm down. She hung up. This ended in a series of phone-calls, resulting in her telling me I could have stopped her from killing herself had I not gone to my friends party. I drove away from the party to her home, and she yelled at me for doing it, and just throwing bad words at me.

Over the next months she did all kinds of crazy shit; threatening to kill herself, more casper the not-so-friendly ghost shit, calling me at the worst possible times, making me cancel more plans, school and work. And if I didn't answer my phone, loads of messages would appear on my phone almost up to 100 at the worst. When I called her up, she would a couple of times yet again threaten to take her life with a heartfelt goodbye, and suddenly hang up, not answer her phone and make me climb up to her second story bedroom just to keep her crazy ass company.

During august of 2012, I finished school and joined the air force for basic training. This led to a great time for me, since I couldn't constantly be at my phone. The past with my ex had almost been forgiven, she rarely mentioned her anymore, something she had continualy done just to trigger my guilt.

During the air force-period I felt at peace at first, but the worst was yet to come. Among them; More and worse threats, dragging my friends family and fellow soldiers into the ordeal. Threats and hints at cheating, her threatening me to tell her family about me beating her (something I didn't do but she had done to me), even a full on exorsism-ish possesing on her side. Stalking, choking, blood and false pregnancies. Even making up people and alternate identities. I eventually left her though, I stoped liking her.

I would definitely retake the LSAT if I were you. Instead of the work experience, I would just put that time into more LSAT studying. Even 1-2 more points would be so much better than an additional job.

I needed to learn the state of the art in popup advertisements, and realized that porn sites pretty much had that market cornered. LiveJasmine for instance, and their annoying full-screen click hijacking popup, was particularly useful to me.

Looking at porn for a job for a day or two was kinda interesting. I mean, it wasn't an ""AWWW YEAH"" moment since, you know, I'm not exactly about to masturbate in the office and that kind of porn is pretty horrible if you aren't...

BOOMBOXNOTATOY,videos,1389756572.0,"You're being downvoted even though you're technically correct.  

You have to remember to throw in resistance.  If you grab an electric fence vs. touching it with the tip of your finger you're going to receive a totally different level of amperage.

The finger tip having higher resistance than your whole hand will prevent the fence from delivering the same level of amperage as if your whole hand was touching.

    Let's use Ohm's Law to solve dis bitch.
    
        / \
       / E \
      /-----\
     / I | R \
    /____|____\

    E=Voltage  I=Current  R=Resistance

    E=I*R      I=E/R      R=E/I

    
    (electric fence touched by dry human finger)
    4000V / 40,000Ω = 0.1A
    
    (electric fence grabbed by dry hand)
    4000V / 15,000Ω = 0.266A

Now let's raise the voltage while keeping the resistance the same.

    8000V / 40,000Ω = 0.2A

    8000V / 15,000Ω = 0.533A"

Apart from your ""friends"" being dicks,  if by ""stand your ground"" in the OP you mean you only say shit like ""No I'm not"" to them ribbing at you being fat or stupid then I assume the reason they still pick at you is because they don't have anything to go off of with you other than shit that happens when you're in their presence. Obviously, some groups of dudes don't explicitly ask each other how their day was, so they just crack jokes and don't think. Do you mostly just hang out with them for company? What do you actually bring to the table friendship wise?

If they actually invite you out, it may well all be fine and that they don't have any actual problems with you. You could just be so content with other areas of your life that you kind of got too content with just having friends and stopped being a friend in some regards. You don't have to insult them back, but hey- that's not a bad start if that works.

Totally taking a guess about the possibility of you being relatively private outside of trying to share common interests with your friends. Could negate the whole post. /shrug."

Epicman93,AskReddit,1389756589.0,"Posted it far below in the comments, but figured that it could go here too.

So a little over 2 years ago I was taking my senior year of high school, wich was a different school closer to home than the boarding school I had been attending for 2 years. Since the school was close, I could take the bus.

This was going to be a good year. I had recently broken up with a girl after 1.5 rough years together, I could reconnect with some old friends, and the best thing was that I reconnected with someone else. A girl. A cute girl. She had been my neighbour for 13 years, but we had rarely talked, we used to play a bit when we were kids but that was it. So now I met her again, and holy fuck was she beautiful. I fell for her instantly.

So me and this cute girl took the same bus, wich led us to hanging out more and more. This continued and escalated in a good way for several months, until we started making out at a friends party. The next couple of days we both tried to hide the fact of what happened, but after a week or two she asked me what I felt about her. I was honest with my feelings, and she felt mutual. This led to agood few days, up until a few days before christmas.

She sent me a text, stating that she wanted to talk to me. I met her outside her house. She then told me that she couldn't keep seeing me, since I still talked with my ex from time to time, and never really fully dissmiss her. Me and the cute girl stopped talking.

Weeks went by and I started talking more to my ex, and we decided to hang out, which led to kissing (stupid, I know). A few more weeks went by and I talked less with my ex, and reconnected more with the cute girl. Long story short, we got in a relationship, and I stopped talking to my ex and told her of the situation with cute girl (soon to be crazy bitch).

The next 4 months were awesome! I never knew how good it was to actually love a girl to that extent! But this was soon to decline.

I was on a roadtrip with her, when she started talking about my ex. She had recently starting doing this for some reason, even though I hadn't talked to her for 4 months. She asked if my ex had ever sat in my car with me after I got my license at 18. I responded yes, and told her what had happened after she broke things off with us a couple of months earlier. She flipped shit. She got out of my car, started screaming, calling her friends, telling them what had happened, and she told med that we were through. I was crushed. I didn't want to lose her, the person who showed me what kind of attachement one can have to a girl. So i caved in, told her I would do anything to get her back. Man was i dumb.

Over the next weeks she gradually calmed down about what happened during our roadtrip, but she became more... weird. She became extremely emotional very fast, something shehad been for some time, but it became more clearer now. She also demanded to know where I were at all times, something she had done to a more vague extent earlier. She also blamed me for everything, and made me cancel plans, dinners, family-time, hell even work, just to hang out with her when she had nothing to do! She started trash-talking my friends, and tried to get me to drop them in favor of her friends. She also made me break contact with all my female friends. She would go as far as deleting numbers of my cell. This was just the beginning though.

Things became hazy for me over the next months but a few situations stood out. Like my best friends birthday party.

My best friend had recently turned 19. He wasn't the most social and popular person, he had gone through a bit of bullying and such, from me included, which made me feel sorry and actually try and establish a friendship with him, something that turned out awesome, since he was actually a really good guy. Anyway. I had gathered a few guys to come over to his house and have som pizza, beer and play some board games and watch TV with him. The night was going well, we had a good time, up until my ex called me.

She had for the last weeks started telling me that she could see ghosts and shit. Telling methat she was being tormented by an old man and a little girl. Something I didn't really believe in. As I said she called me during the B-day party, and started ranting about how these ghosts were nearby. I told her to calm down and go see her family in the floor below her, but she cut me off stating that she would kill herself. I freaked and told her to calm down. She hung up. This ended in a series of phone-calls, resulting in her telling me I could have stopped her from killing herself had I not gone to my friends party. I drove away from the party to her home, and she yelled at me for doing it, and just throwing bad words at me.

Over the next months she did all kinds of crazy shit; threatening to kill herself, more casper the not-so-friendly ghost shit, calling me at the worst possible times, making me cancel more plans, school and work. And if I didn't answer my phone, loads of messages would appear on my phone almost up to 100 at the worst. When I called her up, she would a couple of times yet again threaten to take her life with a heartfelt goodbye, and suddenly hang up, not answer her phone and make me climb up to her second story bedroom just to keep her crazy ass company.

During august of 2012, I finished school and joined the air force for basic training. This led to a great time for me, since I couldn't constantly be at my phone. The past with my ex had almost been forgiven, she rarely mentioned her anymore, something she had continualy done just to trigger my guilt.

During the air force-period I felt at peace at first, but the worst was yet to come. Among them; More and worse threats, dragging my friends family and fellow soldiers into the ordeal. Threats and hints at cheating, her threatening me to tell her family about me beating her (something I didn't do but she had done to me), even a full on exorsism-ish possesing on her side. Stalking, choking, blood and false pregnancies. Even making up people and alternate identities. I eventually left her though, I stoped liking her."

maowsers93,TumblrInAction,1389757035.0,"Well, sort of. Planned Parenthood was certainly at the center of the situation but it isn't because of Planned Parenthood that the money was lost. The reason why the money was lost was because the TX legislature wanted to cut PP from the women's health funding roles. The state wasn't at liberty to do that legally because the WHP was 90% funded by title X funding from the federal government which was implemented under national medicaid laws. 

Under medicaid laws no one is legally able to tell the recipients of the funding who they can or cannot receive their health care from. The state of Texas attempting to tell women who they could or could not see for their health care was in direct violation of the law and over stepped their bounds by trying to allocate funds that they had no control over. 

So, the Feds basically told Texas that they were in violation of medicaid laws and if they didn't stop that they'd lose the money. The state said no and the Feds removed the funding. That is how we lost the money. 

After that the state said ""we don't need you anyway"" and tried to implement their own WHP which had a funding slice of about 66%. They've done a painfully embarrassing job. They said they would fill a website with a list of providers who would give women the care they needed like pap smears, cancer screenings, etc. They filled the website with out dated doctors, doctors who don't offer women's services, and even a few numbers that were just insurance dealers. I'd have to find the articles but there were also a few (like one or two) numbers that lead to companies that didn't even deal in health care. 

The whole situation started with PP but then spiraled out into illegal activity, a woefully funded supplemental plan, and a website that had a list of providers that wouldn't even offer health care.

Our jeweler is also great because if we ever want to upgrade the diamond all we'd have to pay is the difference between what my diamond costs and what the upgrade costs (idk how standard that is in the jewelry world).

Putting on MOPP-4 wasn't enough, no, we had to *test* it - make sure we knew what we were doing and get confidence that it works, right?

So they sent us into a tent full of 100% concentration tear gas.

Now, that part was pretty interesting.

Then, they made us take our gear off. Inside the tent.

Nope, doesn't stop there. So I strip off my mask, stand there for a second, and start choking on the tear gas, as is normal. I run outside, flap my arms to get the gas off, and do laps until I can see again. Everything's fine now, right?

Well, I *really* had to take a piss. so I ran to the bathroom. Now, tear gas crystals stick on your skin, and rubbing your skin while contaminated is like grinding salt into a wound. I'd gotten some crystals on my hands in the process of removing my MOPP gear, but didn't really register it since my face was still in quite a bit of pain.

Run to the latrine, pants down, get ready to go... and then I realize that I'm holding my donger in my hands. My tear gas crystal contaminated hands. **This is going to suck #2.**

It sucked. A lot."

Because when you put them all together it shows that she refuses to see that she is hurting me. 

So even if you think your issues with your parent are more tame than what you've read, that doesn't mean you don't belong here and it DEFINITELY doesn't mean you're in the wrong.

* **But but, 120GB SSD isn't enough storage!?**

It is, and with a few changes can go a long way. So think it through before you spend the extra money on a 250GB model.

1. Once your OS is installed, go to C:/Users/'YOU'. 

2. For each, My Documents, Music, Downloads, Videos etc. right click and go to Properties.

3. Click the 'Location' Tab, then click 'Move'.

4. You may now move this folder where you wish onto your mass storage HDD. (Assuming your HDD is Drive E) Exp: E:/Users/YOU/Documents.

5. Repeat until you are finished.

Next, once you have Steam installed, you must configure the libraries where your games are installed, so most of them may be installed onto your mass storage.

1. Open Steam, go to Settings.

2. Navigate to 'DOWNLOADS.'

3. Configure libraries for both storage devices. **[DEMONSTRATION](http://i.imgur.com/CPEgT3g.jpg)**

You may also go so far as to configure your browsers Cache/Temp folders to be on your mass storage drive.

* **What maintenance software should I load?**

Most of you already have your favorite software figured out, so this is uselss to you; but if you feel that you are completely clueless, I'll keep it simple and showcase two that I recommend:

* **Antivirus:** [AVG Free](http://free.avg.com/us-en/homepage), 
I used to be a solid Avast fan until I found out just how much it conflicts with Windows 8. It caused too many problems.

* **General Maintenance:** [Glary Utilities](http://www.glarysoft.com/), a very nice feature packed suite that will do a satisfactory job in taking care most of your needs.

-The One-Click-Fix option will clean out your temp files and fix some minor issues, helping to keep your machine snappy.

-I HIGHLY recommend (especially those on HDD's, and W7/older) to use the ""Registry De-frag"" tool. Especially back in the day with Win XP it brought life back to my PC."

Your rating for CS is next to meaningless. CS isn't considered competitive anymore and is primarily used for farming credits for SF gear. Besides that, your rating will reset once a month anyways.

LoT isn't home to nearly as many English speaking guilds as MT for example. Since it's a newer server, there are also far fewer players at the gear cap (though since WHHM is so damn easy, pretty much everyone is 169 nowadays).

When you queue for a BG, you get matched up with players from every server, there are no battlegroups. CS is usually a gong show, whichever side has an even slightly competent team will usually win. Don't expect much out of this BG unless you queue as a group.

Alliances are endgame, faction-based PvP similar to...well, every faction-based MMO ever. Bunch of people go into specific PvP areas and beat each other to death. Unlike BG PvP, consumables are available to it's usually a little more vicious.

No. More often than not she already has plans during the time that you offered so she is suggesting another time because she wants to see you. 




&gt;Logic analyzation: If it was someone I know, she would never say 'a friend' (which implies I don't know them). If it was someone I didn't know, she would probably just say 'with my buddy, X' (because 'a friend' seems purposefully ambiguous). Seems pretty dodgy, ya' know? Especially since under most all other circumstances she(women) like/s to give way too many details even when you don't need or want them at all.

If you know anything about American football, it's similar to the salaries of NFL players. The best players in the league demand to be the highest paid, so every year the contracts get bigger and bigger. That's how it is in almost every sport. The next big signing will always cost more than the last. Ozil is the most expensive player we've ever signed, but I don't know if I'd say he's the best we've ever signed. 

tl;dr: every transfer gets more and more expensive because there is more money to spend."

Omega037,changemyview,1389757831.0,"&gt; 1) refusing to attack civilians, and spontaneously attacking the government are two very different things. we don't want to have to depend on the government to protect us from the government. its the entire point of the 2nd amendment.

Your reasoning seems to have become convoluted.  Either the government would refuse to attack its people or not.  

If they don't refuse, the army, navy, and air force would make quick work of civilians regardless of how they were armed.  

If they do refuse, then it means the government can't actually enforce its desire to attack the people, so it's a moot point.

&gt; 2) we are talking about assault rifles. that conclusion was refuted. but even if we are talking guns, we should eliminate pools too since they are nice, but they kill people so should be eliminated.

First, pools kill hundreds a year while guns kill tens of thousands.

Second, pools only kill people who actively decide to go to a pool and put themselves at risk.  Most victims of gun crimes did not choose to put themselves at risk.  This is an important distinction.

Furthermore, for something like cars, we do require licenses, insurance (in case you hurt someone else), regularly enforce rules on speeding, recklessness, and drunk driving, and have strict regulations on car design for safety reasons.

If anything, the way we handle car usage only shows that guns *should* be far more regulated.

&gt; 3) decades? we have millenia of history showing how easily despots rise amongst the unarmed. the last few decades are Pax Americana.

Effective guns haven't been around for more than 2 centuries, nor has a governmental system strong enough to actually enforce removal of weapons (be they guns or swords).  So saying a millennium is incorrect.

Also, you again keep bringing up this idea of history showing us that being unarmed causes you to be taken over.  This just isn't in any way true, and stating it again and again doesn't make it true.  

The fact is that most societies to be taken over *were* armed, but it didn't matter.  When they were unarmed, they usually also lacked a strong military force to defend the people against outside attack.  

I challenge you to provide a single example of an unarmed civilian population with a strong military that was somehow taken oven in this fashion.  If you can't, then drop this claim.

As for ""Pax Americana"", while we have avoided a World War sized conflict in the past 60 years, there have been many regional conflicts with large death tolls during this time.  The Korean War, Vietnam War, Iran-Iraq War, Algerian War, Nigerian Civil War, First Indochina War, and Sudanese Civil War all had over a million casualties each.

&gt; 4) the civil war was caused by the major flaw in the Constitution, the 5/8 compromise, not anything to do with guns, although the North won faster, and abolished slavery, because of the massive amount of gun manufacturing (amongst others) that they were doing.

Causes don't matter in the slightest, and I never implied that it was about guns.  

My point is that you had a large, fairly well armed civilian militia that wanted to rebel against the government because of various abuses.  

This is the exact situation you imply we need to allow civilians to keep their guns for.  However, even with broad support, good generals, and a large amount of weapons, they lost.  

At the time, the North may have had an advantage, but it was minute compared to the advantage the government has now.  Thus it confirms my original point, that historical evidence (and common reasoning) tells us that allowing civilians to have guns will *not* matter if the government decides to ""take over"".

If we are already screwed regardless of whether we have guns or not, then taking them away only does one thing, reduce the number of gun related deaths per year."

It was really well-received, and I was excited that people were anxious to sell these new packages. When I told him about it, he didn't say anything. I told him it was a big deal for me, and he said, ""what, do you want me to give you a gold star? Put something on the fridge? Maybe pat you on the head?""

Constant. Eggshells. All the time. I wasn't a saint either, but I was so tired of feeling stupid, being gaslighted (I learned that was a thing), being talked down to... 

And this is the one that caused me to file:  
When we went to counseling and the therapist asked each of us why we were there, I gave my response (I don't even remember it, but I'm sure it was something like learn how to better communicate with each other). His response was, ""I'm here to fix whatever CapOnFoam's problems are.""

I told him it was impossible: beasts were too expensive, it would never be competitive, he wouldn't have fun losing every day, there weren't enough good beasts, and he'd have no answers to wrath of god or Counterspell. 

But he tried.  He put it together - Krosan Cloudscraper, Krosan Tusker, Kurgadon, Krosan Groundshaker, Towering Baloth, Enormous Baloth.  It sucked.  I cringed every time I saw him playing it, stuck on 4 mana, unable to cast anything.  I had to take pity on him and at least give him a workable mana base. 

I added some land search.  Did some playtesting. Adjusted the curve.  Added Needleshot Gourna and Venomspout Brackus for a chance against flyers.  Eventually I had it humming to the point where he could usually cast a beast or two every game.  It died easily to aggro, more efficient beatdown, and flyers.  It keeled over hard to control.  I didn't give it much of a second thought until someone showed me [Contested Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=376282). 

I picked up a playset and did some quick testing.  Holy Shit.  That land changed everything.  Suddenly my vanilla 7/7 can attack and block at the same time.  It can attack a creature directly (fuck you Wellwisher).  It can block flyers.  This land turned the beast deck from an overpriced noob's prayer to a vicious creature based aggro-control deck.  Somewhere around this point my brother had become a better player and was winning FNM's with Kokusho, so I took the beast deck under my wing. 

A decade and many modifications later, it is still without a doubt my favorite deck to play.  If I only bring one deck with me somewhere, I bring Beasts.  Beasts is incredible.  It now runs Bird of Paradise &amp; Krosan Warchief leading into a turn 3 Tephraderm and a turn 4 Terra Stomper.  It's beautifully efficient, aggressive, controlling, and Timmy all at once.  There is nothing quite like an opponent saying ""sure, I'll take 2"" from a morph creature and seeing their eyeballs pop out of their head when you flip it into a 13/13 (yeah, forgot it had morph, didn't you? We all forget about that at some point).  [Bloodrush](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366287) changes chump blocking from ""ok, block your Cloudscraper with my 1/1"" to ""Fuck, I'll take 16"". Garruk's Horde is beautiful card advantage. Gruul Ragebeast is dirty. Spellbreaker Behemoth says ""go home"" to counterspells. Ravenous Baloth keeps me alive. Everything jumps off a [cliff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=376282) all day long. 

All said and done, it would never win against any decent legacy, modern, or even standard deck.  But it's beautiful.  It's brutal.  And the look on a person's face when they *don't* have an answer to a 13/13 chunking out 2/3's of their original life total is priceless.

KellyeTheGreat,AskReddit,1389757985.0,"I'm not a single mother, but I have 2 children from my first marriage that reside primarily with me. My children were 1 and 4 when their father and I divorced.

I tried to be very open about it with them. My younger son took it harder than my daughter. He would ask where's daddy? And I would try to explain to him simply that Mommy and Daddy still love you, but sometimes we don't get along. I know it's hard for you to not have us all together, but that's the way it is, and it doesn't make us love you any less. 

It's also important to gently remind them that Mommy and Daddy will never be together again. Because they can hold out hope for *years* that if they somehow figure out the right thing to say or do, that they can 'fix' everything. 

Some kids feel like it's their fault. You have to phrase it in a way that they understand it isn't. That's the hardest part. 

Another good tip that you've probably already heard, is *never* badmouth their Mom in front of them. Never! Always speak of her positively, and if you can't manage that, then neutrally. Your children, maybe not her, but *they* deserve to think their Mom is as amazing as they want her to be. If she isn't, they will come to their own conclusion when they're old enough.

Good luck."

The point I'm trying to make is that a person might not be ""perfect"" (should there be such a thing) if they do have a different skin tone.

Regardless. My point was that we are wired to be attracted to people with similar traits. Therefore it is perfectly conceivable that if a person has a very large descrepency in similarity they might never find that person attractive no matter what. 

Do you deny that a person can never be attracted to a person with a certain trait. Or do you honestly believe that every single person can look past certain things? Is a young person who cannot date an older person because they do not find older people attractive, an ageist? Is a tall person who is only attracted to people above a certain height, a sizeist?  Is a person who is only attracted to people who have rippling muscles now prejudice against everyone else.

Where do you draw the line. The thing is you can't. If you suggest what people can and cannot be attracted to, then the claim can be used accross the board."

sockalicious,space,1389758044.0,"You should take a look at Messier object #42, (M42), the Orion nebula, through a modest telescope (or even binoculars) sometime if you ever get the chance.  It is an emission nebula; most of the light coming from it is green light, a 'forbidden transition' of electrons from energetically stimulated oxygen molecules.  

I've often wished that I was 1200 light-years closer to that nebula so I could see what it looked like up close.  You can see it with the naked eye, but through a scope its wispy clouds glow with an eerie, unearthly light.

Human eye isn't great at seeing the more common type of emission nebula, which gives off particular colors related to the transition lines of ionized or molecular hydrogen.  Those are hard for us to see; Hubble and earthbound scopes see it easily with the help of CCD cameras and special filters.

Reflection nebulas are just dark dust illuminated by a nearby star.  I think those would be as spectacular close up as they are from far away; but they are much less spectacular than emission nebulas."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389758075.0,"I get what you're saying, but sometimes it's better to avoid something that might become an issue rather than develop a strong relationship that you might have to break for something you could have seen coming anyway.  Like I said, I know this isn't definite - but some people aren't willing to waste their time with something like this, and that should be fine. And it still can be a setback in some sense, like it or not, and I don't think it makes a guy any less decent not to want to deal with something like that.  All it means is he has more time to deal with something like this.

I mean, let's look at a scenario - she's probably going to date around her age range, so let's assume the guy is 25 as well.  He's at the point where he has a good career, and is looking for a good relationship that will end up in marriage.  So he finds OP, and they get along well enough.  She explains her situation, and that it may take time, she doesn't know for sure if everything will be cool, things *should* be okay, but she won't know until it happens.  Could be a long time, could be no time at all, there's really no knowing, so you just have to wait and see.

Now, of course every relationship is going to start off with determining compatibility, right?  But in this particular case, you have a guy whose looking to settle down, and a potential compatibility issue already staring him in the face.  It's not enough to make a decision for sure, but to get to the point she needs for sex, they probably has to be pretty intimate from the sounds of it.  What if he puts in all that time and effort and it doesn't work out?  He wasted her time, and more importantly, wasted his own time trying to find someone.  Sure, incompatibility issues can pop up after a year regardless of something like this, but the difference is that this is an actual condition that's causing a problem that may never be solved.  I can totally understand why someone ready to start a family might rather spend their time and effort on someone else."

lamblikeawolf,short,1389758172.0,"When I was 19, I struggled to come to terms with being comfortable with who I was as a person. I had KNOWN who I was as a person, but being comfortable with myself is an entirely other story. While the most obvious and most often criticized trait I had to come to terms with was introversion, a lot of the same things apply, because both have to do with a journey of accepting yourself.

Everyone would constantly tell me that I needed to ""network"" and ""go places"" and ""make things happen"" and to not ""play so many videogames"" with the implication that I was doing it alone. I didn't completely understand the difference between being shy and being introverted, and I didn't completely understand why I felt so drained when I tried to accommodate all of the people (who I found out were extroverts) in my life. Most important to this was finding people that were introverts, had similar information-gathering/thought-pattern styles, and could tell me being an introvert is a normal thing to be and okay.

Unfortunately, acceptance of short men is at a different stage than acceptance of introversion. But I think that everyone on this subreddit would be able to tell you that being short is a normal thing to be, and okay. (Just like being average height, or tall are also normal things to be, and okay.)

&gt;it's do to with the fact that I'll never look like or feel like the adult I'd picture I'd eventually end up as in my head. 

I don't know that anyone ever really does feel like they are the adult they pictured themselves being, either physically, or mentally, or both. And it sucks. I wish I had more specific advice about how to accept your body for the way it is. Hopefully some other short men can share their experience with that.

&gt;If I have kids and they're developing slowly I'm not going to feed them some bullshit about ""everyone catches up eventually""…I'll let them know there's a chance they won't, but that that doesn't matter. And I'd advise you all to do the same.

I testified 3 times during the stuff this summer and my supervisors didn't want me to make an ass out of myself so I had to learn everything about the topic in order to counter arguments lobbed against me.

Even if he does say something, if the woman is clear about her not feeling the same, then it is up for the man to decide to be friends with no hope of more, or not become friends at all.  Most men should not become friends if they aren't capable of moving on.

The man in this situation can only blame himself if he isn't capable yet decides to stay as a friend.

Chances are he's just eating that much because he is a big dude who is used to eating that much. Not eating that much makes him hungry, which makes him want to eat, so he does.

When I was bulking a while ago I went through the same sort of thing. My meals doubled in size, I was eating more food in a week than I normally would in a month - to put on weight. Obviously I was at the gym 6-7 days a week and eating cleanly so it was mostly muscle going on, but it's much the same thing. The more you eat, the bigger you get, the more you feel you need to eat to sustain yourself (hunger).

Your husband obviously went through something very different (Credit to him for getting through it.) which is the point I am making - I'm going to chalk this one up to just another unhealthy chap with a terrible diet and little to no discipline.

OP - Your SO is going to hate the first couple of weeks of getting healthier because the first thing you will need to get him to do is cut down on meal size and get rid of all the shit, which means most of the sugary/fatty shit he is probably chowing down in his spare time. He's going to be hungry and probably grumpy, he will have far less energy and will need to be using most of it to exercise.  His body will adapt though in time and he will be set on the right path, but the first few weeks are the worst.

I would be looking at seeing a dietician more than a therapist in order to get the meals straightened out. After that has happened and if he is still eating boatloads then maybe start looking at some kind of mental help."

keakealani,GirlGamers,1389758255.0,"To be totally honest, I've never considered buying an Alienware computer a) because I'm a silly Apple fangirl and b) because I don't think I could ever afford it (and if I could afford a high-priced computer, it's going to be a mac because point a). But I honestly don't care how other people spend their money. I don't even care if I personally might think it's overpriced (which you're right, is totally based on stereotypes rather than actually doing the research, since I've never seriously considered buying one), because it's not my fucking life. I would care if it was me, if it was my husband, or maybe to some small extent if it was another close RL friend or family member. And then I'd probably do the research before deciding to bash on someone. But if it's some random person online? Who the hell cares what computer you're using? It's the most silly, mundane, pointless piece of bigotry to get your panties in a bunch about. 

Although in all seriousness, I think you're also right that most of us have bigger fish to fry here - when we're worried about getting harassed online or just feeling generally unwelcome, bashing on someone within our community (which isn't a gendered thing - gaming is one big community to me) is just going to detract from real issues.

1) There can be racism against whites by PoC (People of Color), but it's not called institutional racism, since they aren't the privileged ones in the U.S. It's just individual racism. I agree that it is less common. As for the last sentence, there are scholarships that only Arfican Americans can apply for, but if you mean that African Americans are more likely to receive scholarships open to all races, I'd need to see a source for that. Same with a higher college acceptance rate and job acceptance rate.

2) I think it's both. Yes, if a black person is born into a low-income family and cannot afford to go to a good college, his problem is related to wealth. I think [this](http://erinvechols.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/institutionalracism.png) comic gives some good examples of white privilege."

Most people talk about the big money going to these researchers as motivation. You could point out the pretty pathetic salaries of academic researchers. Sabotaging the world for $75k per year? On that scale? Its absurd.

The second - probably more effective angle - would be to point out that there would be a massive incentive for a lone researcher to disprove the consensus or out the conspiracy.

The ""Ownership"" of the house securing a reverse mortgage stays with the Borrower. The bank takes a lien over the property to secure the loan called a mortgage.  
  
What happens is that the borrower is not required to make repayments on the loan. The interest will accumulate and when your parents pass away the bank will settle the loan out of the assets available to the estate. Because they have the security of a mortgage over the property if there is not enough money to satisfy all the creditors then they get to sell the house and use the proceeds towards the debt."

paratactical,AskWomen,1389758632.0,"I just think it's disengenious to not see the real problem as socioeconomic. If those women weren't poor, they wouldn't need so many of the assistance programs that are labeled as being part of feminism. I support and believe in Planned Parenthood's mission and have utilized their services before. 

But I cannot seriously believe that it's more important to address cheap birth control pills than it is to address a social strata that creates the need for cheap contraceptives. Furthermore, it's not as if teen pregnancy and having children at an early age only bears negative effects on women and has no effects on the life of the men who father those children.

I cannot believe that a woman raising children on her own is somehow a greater injustice than the mass incarceration of poor men.  This is exactly the kind of thing that I find to be distasteful about modern American feminism. Rather than address the actual causes of problems, feminism too often sets up women's health clinics and then allows people to wash their hands of larger issues, content that they've contributed to the portion of the population they care about.

This version of modern day feminism that you seem to think is ""done right"" is only addressing socioeconomic and racial injustices for women. It does not address them for the men that face similar problems. This is, at best, a laughably ignorant version of ""equality"" and, at worst, an intentionally dismissive system that only serves to drive the genders further apart and separate what should be mutual goals into a system piting men against women.

FountainsOfFluids,AskMen,1389758663.0,"I have mixed feelings about lingerie.

For me, the sexiest clothes are often clothes that look soft, comfortable, and easily removed. Of course that's assuming the girl has a sexy body to begin with. Sadly, lingerie does very little IMO to make unattractive or mediocre women into sexy women. It ends up looking tryhard and a waste.

My recommendation would be to buy pretty underwear for days when you are going to see your guy, but don't go overboard unless he specifies that he loves something in particular. I think most of us don't care much, we just don't want that underwear to turn us off en route from fully clothed to naked, like granny panties or anything difficult to remove.

leeceia,AskWomen,1389758762.0,"Probably when I went to an all day drinking event. The keenest started with breakfast beers at 8am, I started drinking later at 10 or so on campus. We had beer pong already going and our music blasting over the quad. Then we moved to an abandoned piece of land right next to the university and proceeded to get smashed. Wizard staffs were everywhere, someone brought a couch they'd found in hard rubbish, I was thrown in a paddling pool no less than 3 times, people were hot boxing in tents, I was offered a devils threesome, and there were about 200-300 people, about half of which I knew. We drank and partied until the cops dispersed us at 4pm, and then went back on campus to an underground club office to drink more. More beer pong, shoulder rides, pissing in corridors (not me) and stealing shit. Then we headed off to the pub and kept going until at least 1am when it closed. 

14 hours of drinking. Countless naked bodies. Avoiding campus security and police. Cute guys. Lunch time kegs. Wet t-shirts. Drugs, hook ups and beer pong. Beer bongs. Someone selling bootlegged alcohol. Penises being drawn on those who passed out. A couple of arrests and tonnes turned away from the pub. One fence was just coved in piss. A singlet where you had to mark how much you drank until we lost the pen at beer 6 or so...

And then having to make it to class the next day and just dying under the hangover. 

That and tomorrow night I have a toga party, with drinking starting at 4pm. Pretty sure I secretly live in Animal House. "

IamDa5id,AskReddit,1389758773.0,"This might be too late for people to see but, whatever.  I'll weigh in.

I have friends at varying levels of fame due to where I grew up and the industry I work in.

I was recently hanging out with a friend that has reached a pretty high level of wealth and fame.  He was only in town for a little while so I met with him and his friends at a house in the Hollywood hills.

It was insane, exactly what you think being famous is like.  Ridiculously beautiful houses, hot models running around, other famous faces all over the place, everyone you talk to is some kind of big-shot and lots and lots of drugs. (I happen to be sober)

Anyway, after hanging out for a few days I suddenly realized when we were all out to dinner that I had become part of an entourage.  It had never occurred to me before that and it completely tripped me out.

At the end of all this, my biggest observation about my friend and what his life had turned into is actually pretty sad.  See, everyone in this environment was very happy and positive all the time. Complimentary about everything anyone said or did.  Basically completely full of shit.

I realized my old friend no longer has any idea who really loves him.  Be it women or bro's, he doesn't know if they want something from him and he has become pretty paranoid as a result. 

tl:dr Being famous makes it hard to tell who your friends are.

PaulTheSkyBear,halo,1389758976.0,"Yes from what I understood of your rant you were more upset about the generalization of halo to the masses rather than catering to dedicated fans. I understand why you might feel that way but we must look at the series and franchise as a whole. Imagine if all halo games were the same. You would just have some updated graphics and a new piece of story every once and a while, and that is not what we (halo fans) want. what we want is for halo to maintain its innovative standards, and if that means taking risks by introducing new play styles such as the multilayer which deviates more from CoD than any game previous so be it. Even if it doesn't quite pan out as they and we would have like it still shows that they are making an effort to come up with new ideas and take us in new exiting directions. in conclusion I personally loved halo 4 the most out of the series maybe more for the story centered game play than the actual new mechanics introduced but my point stands that even if you don't like what 343 has done you must admit that they are trying their very hardest to give us what we want. and that is innovation."

Lots of people are up in arms because X is being suggested or Y might happen or something, and its not living up to their dream or vision or whatever and while i understand that, people also have to realise that it might not be exactly what they thought it would be and its not going to be exactly like they dreamed.

I suspect a lot of people might end up disappointed buying the alpha, because they bought it wanting something specific which, by the time its all said and done, might not resemble the thing they wanted.

Omega037,changemyview,1389759082.0,"Historically, we are at a all time low for war, poverty and torture, an all time high for rights and liberties, and income inequality matters less because the bottom end is doing much better than they were decades or centuries ago.

As for environmental damage, our air and water are certainly cleaner now than 50 years ago, and we are making more and more progress on efficiency and sustainable engineering.  Advances in renewable energy (including batteries) and GMOs will allow us to produce a lot more but with a lot less resources.

Those in power tend to be far less secure and more accountable now than even, especially in the age of the internet.  Information and distribution are not democratized, and this is reaching even the darkest slums of dictatorships and poverty stricken regions.

As for being a social animal, the proof is in our culture.  Most of what we do is *not* something we are hard wired for.  Spoken and written language is not an inherent trait, it is something that have developed as part of cultural evolution that is imprinted by society on pretty much all humans.  We now have an extraordinarily complex ability to communicate, all a result of social development and interaction.

Additionally, our ability to have extremely large yet stable social communities and living environments is astounding.  We develop and sustain knowledge and ideas, often starting projects that will take generations to complete.

Not to mention, for all our faults, we are incredibly altruistic.  We give tons of food, medicine, and money to a variety of causes.  With almost any other animal, these people would simply starve, if not outright culled.

So, it is true that we aren't perfect by any means, but as a whole I think things are pretty good, people are generally pretty good, and a lot of the ills that have plagued out societies throughout history are going to finally start falling away."

As to your claim that on Reach Spartans fell to similar numbers of opponents is incorrect. The human forces on Reach were vastly outnumbered even before the Spartans arrived after the majority of UNSC ground forces were defeated. As to Grace's death they were attacked by an unknown species of covenant that has strength even greater than that of the S-II's. Even the S-IV's die in ambushes, any person caught in an ambush is at a disadvantage. As to Anton's death he was hit by a plasma blast from a covenant starship, absolutely no chance of survival even for a S-IV. And yes more S-II's died from things that would not kill modern S-IV's such as the banshee strikes, but this i because the S-II's originally did not have the shields and technological advancements the S-IV's take for granted, and even without them the S-II operation record is the most successful in the UNSC.

And the children trained to be S-II's were instructed and pitted against ODST troops, yes John already had his augmentations when he killed the 3 ODST's in the gym but they were already equal to the ODST troops before. And Kurt was able to kill the hunters by hand after weeks of fighting both the covenant and the forerunner machines. And even the S-IV's die to elites, yes that one S-IV is more skilled than other just like John is compared to other S-II's.

I don't really understand your point about expenses. The S-III program was much cheaper than the S-II, and the S-II cost the same as it would to create starships or fighter wings, I don't remember what the admiral compared it to.

And the Augmentations received by the S-IV's did not make them stronger than S-II's. They are ""better"" because more survive and they are less invasive and overall cheaper than what was used by the S-II's. All the augmentations given to the S-III/IV's are only chemical, whereas the S-II's received grafts and inplacements. The S-III augmentations are described as better than the S-II but that is an outright lie. S-II's are faster stronger and smarter than the S-III's. The same probably holds true for the S-IV."

AFormidableContender,confession,1389759213.0,"&gt;TRP is hateful. I think you are correct that they are drawn to that community because they are hateful. The subreddit doesn't need to tell its members to be hateful, they do it already.

That's not what I said. I said the TRPers often hate women because the ideology leads to the hating of women. If TRP allows you to succeed, there is no inherent reason to hate women. If TRP teaches you why you will never be an impressive/desirable man to women, then of course you are going to hate women.

&gt;I didn't make any fallacy. Their ideology is fascist. Fascism is an idea, not a behavior.

*[Sigh]*, *[slams head on desk]*, You...are...saying...TRP...is...fascist...for...the...exact...same...reasons...Feminism...is...fascist...but...disagreeing...that...Feminism...is...fascist...

How...do...you...not...get...this?

&gt;I'll agree partially with the first two, though that doesn't mean my opinion is less valid.

Um, of course it does, but whatever. 

&gt;That's a complete lie. All of my academic achievements, I earned just like anyone else did. If you think people just hand me opportunities because of my looks, you couldn't be more wrong.

Lol, a lie? Puh-leeease lady....I didn't say people hand you things, although I would support that they probably do. I specifically said anything you have in life, I'd have to work twice as hard as you to achieve the same thing. You got off easy because you're attractive and people want to please you because they're desperate for your validation.

Furthermore, I can't trick women into paying my rent or bills for me. I have no safety net. You do. At worst, if your life turns to shit, you can strip or do porn and make tons and tons of money. I can't. 

&gt;So I'm only allowed to discuss mundane things? This is what I'm talking about, that the Red Pill is misogynistic. I've taken psychology, sociology, and many history classes, but you think my world view is irrelevant because I'm an attractive woman.

You're **allowed**. No one can stop you. I'm saying your opinion on it is not worth anything, that's all. 

&gt;Just out of curiosity, who does have the authority to discuss matters of gender and psychology?

It's not about authority, it's about credentials. The best source of information on gender, and attraction are unattractive men that became attractive and are knowledable about either *The Seduction Community*, or *The Red Pill*. Everyone else is more or less biased in extreme fashions, and you have to take their advice with a grain of salt. Attractive men who have never been unattractive are almost as a bad a source of information/conversation as attractive women, so It's not purely about hating on women.

&gt;What about my world view do you think is so twisted?

I think you're deranged if you think you work just as hard for your results in life as everyone else does

I think you're deranged if you think everyone can get a partner.

I think you're deranged if you think you need feminism

I think you're deranged if you think feminism isn't inherently anti-male

I think you're deranged if you don't believe in alpha/beta

I think you're deranged if you think sex comes easily to everyone, or that value isn't an inherent reality that people have to face. 

I think you're deranged if you think you're entitled to handsome men but men aren't entitled to their own preferences. 

In general, you are the prime TRP example of a good looking woman, whom, by virtue of her physical appearance, spends her time in a make-believe, airy-fairly la-la-land filled with lollipops and unicorns because there is no reason for you to face or accept reality. You spout none-sense world views that hurt men because you can afford to actually believe them because there is no social or sexual punishment for attractive women believing in garbage belief structures. You can pretend to live in a world where ""everyone is equal but hot guys are sorta, kinda, more equal to me, be still totally equal"" blah blah, ""I'd save fat people before I'd save hot guys"", garbage because there is no reason for you to accept reality that people are shallow, you are shallow, and lots of people are quite simply fucked, and have more than enough reason to hate women, and are perfectly justified in doing so.

&gt;What about feminism in action that you disagree with?

I disagree with the entire concept, and posting my write up as to why it's an morally reprehensible concept twice...

~Feminism = A social movement creating an overtone characterized by the perpetuation of victim mentality amongst otherwise perfectly equal or otherwise advantaged individuals (women) for the purposes of accruing social, political, and judicial privileges for women at the detriment of men due to a spiteful, though expected reaction to their poor performance in socially Darwinian meritocracies.

It's just a privilege group for women who do whatever they can to put men down and raise women up. If Feminists actually gave a fuck about equality, which they don't, they start addressing benevolent sexism, which they have no interest in doing. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHA6p9PC5JU

&gt;I never understood this claim that feminism is anti-male. You are seeing gender equality and a lack of gender roles, and call it anti-male.

I've answered this question 4 times...

~Feminism = A social movement creating an overtone characterized by the perpetuation of victim mentality amongst otherwise perfectly equal or otherwise advantaged individuals (women) for the purposes of accruing social, political, and judicial privileges for women at the detriment of men due to a spiteful, though expected reaction to their poor performance in socially Darwinian meritocracies.

^That has literally the answer to every question inside it....Feminism is anti male because they are attempting to hurt men by giving only women privilege(s). Any ideology that seeks to subvert or render meritocracy void is anti male as the only reason you'd want to do that is if you cannot compete, which women can't.  

Name one thing Feminism has ever done specifically to help men?

Furthermore, a lack of gender roles leads everyone to be unhappy. Women are validated by being women. Men are validated by being men. You will never deprogram gender roles because they're not societal, they're natural. It's in our genes. It's how and why we fuck. A man doesn't want a woman that looks and acts like a man, and a woman doesn't want a man that looks and acts like a woman. The concept of aboloshing gender roles is ridiculous and ignorant. 

&gt;Feminism is about women having the same rights and social status as men, and not having to be dependent on men. How is that at the detriment of men?

This is retarded. Women had the same rights and social status' as men, about, 35 years ago. Now, it's purely for accruing undeserved social privilege. No modern woman has a glass ceiling based purely on her gender. If you think women NEEDED Feminism past 1975, you are literally psychotic and you should see a doctor. Women have been the suprior gender for a very long time. 

Women's problem is thinking controlling the economic and political power is more important than controlling the social and sexual power. The day women realize how dumb they are for thinking economic, and political power is more important than socio-sexual power is the day all men should just put on their dog colars and hope women don't decide to treat us like dogs and put us all in chains. 

You really REALLY want to be the gender who has more CEO's in the boardroom? I don't give a fuck. Take it. Have it all. There's no power there. I will gladly let you control our boardrooms if it means I get to decide who gets sex and who doesn't. If I don't have to pay to get into a night club, but the women behind me have to shell out $20, if I get free drinks. If hitting me after I hit you is socially unacceptable. If I can cheat on you, then divorce you and take all your stuff just for fun. If I all I need to get by in life is to look decent in a pencil skirt. LOL, take alllllllllllllllll our male privilege. 

Speaking of male privilege...where is it? I certainly don't have any. When do I get mine?

&gt;I don't want to live the life of Crystal Harris. Marrying a guy in his 80s does not appeal to me. It works for her, but it wouldn't work for me.

She is set for life because she was intelligent enough to realize she was good looking and all she has to do to get rich is marry a rich man. She won life and it took her only the effort required to look hot at photoshoots. 

&gt;Most men I've dated don't find it unattractive.

I didn't say it was unattractive, I said it unattractive if you can't turn it off and make your man feel like a man, otherwise, it's moot. 

&gt; I'm not the type to go out of my way to make a guy feel wanted, appreciated, or masculine though. I've never felt the need to constantly accommodate someone's ego.

LOL. Yet I'm sure you demanded men make you feel sexy and feminine and treat you well, right? The more you tell me about yourself, the more egomaniacal you are. 

It has nothing to do with ego...it's about making someone feel loved, appreciated, and like their being has purpose and is successful. Men want women who make them feel like **men** and women want men who make them feel like **women**.

&gt;It makes one seem better than the other.

One IS better than the other. Is being handsome better than being ugly?

&gt;I don't understand the point of that. Some guys might be content being more passive

No one gives a fuck whether or not you're ""content"", the point is if it gets you laid, and weak men don't fuck women."

plusoneeffpee,AskMen,1389759293.0,"&gt;So at what point do you feel you left the ""honeymoon"" period of your marriage, and what made you realize it?

We've been married about 20 years, been together ~25. Honestly, I can't say there ever was anything like a ""honeymoon"" period. The only fundamental shift our marriage has ever really gone through was having kids. As long as the kids are asleep, the honeymoon is still 100% on. When they are awake, it's at about 50%. *That* does take effort sometimes....

&gt;Did your marriage improve or did it take more of a conscious effort to keep things together?

Our relationship has certainly improved over the years. There are ups and downs, of course, and the downs take effort....but it's a general upwards trend. It's weird....it really is like a maturation. Think about how you were as a kid, and compare yourself now to that kid...marriage is like that. You look back and think ""Fuck, I was all worked up over *that* bullshit?"""

Suppose you have a chunk of iron and you place it into a fire until it heats up white-hot.  Now remove it from the conflagration with tongs, and place it on a firesafe table.  It glows white for a while, then orange, then red, then it fades.  However, if you examine it with an infrared camera, it continues to glow for quite some time; the frequency of the glow keeps dropping into the far infrared until finally it equilibrates with its surroundings and quits emitting energy as infrared.

Hot bodies glow, but the glow fades down the spectrum towards the far infrared.  Hold that thought for a moment.

Imagine a giant explosion, say, from a nuclear bomb detonated in air.  The first thing you see is a [fireball - click here](http://www.rachelhulin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/atomic-10.jpg) - a giant sphere, growing, a big shockwave expanding and expanding.  It starts out white-hot - gamma rays - but eventually it cools as it expands.

Now imagine you're IN the explosion - right at the center.  Imagine for a moment you don't get blown to bits.  Instead, you can watch the sphere expand away from you, first glowing with gamma radiation, then X rays, then UV light, then visible light, violet to red; then into the infrared before it finally cools.

Now.  Imagine you are at the birth of the universe - the Big Bang.  The explosion occurs, but there is no shockwave expanding out into air, or into vacuum.  There is literally nothing else, nowhere else that exists; the explosion is that of space-time itself, rapidly expanding and coming into being, expanding super rapidly so that the energy density drops profoundly.  Pure energy expands to fill the new space, cooling as it does so; once it cools enough, first quarks and gluons, then baryons are formed spontaneously as high-density hot energy coalesces into lower-density, cooler mass.  The whole universe is super hot - unimaginably so - but as it rapidly expands it cools off quickly.  The universe has nothing to equilibrate to except itself; so it never stops glowing; but it expands to be billions of light years across, so the energy density and the temperature is very very low indeed, and so the glow is far past the infrared, deep into the - you guessed it - microwave spectrum.

Everywhere you look in the sky, you see the remnants of that glow - because the universe, unlike a chunk of iron, is everywhere; and we are within it.  Space-time itself is glowing as its energy density drops.

The picture you linked is of the entire sky sphere, mapped onto a sort of oval projection, the same way the surface of the earth can be mapped onto a flat map for classroom use.  It shows very, very miniscule fluctuations in the temperature (frequency) of the glow: hot spots, and cold spots.

These fluctuations have to do with the mass-energy distribution of the universe at the moment that matter formed.  If stuff wasn't quantized - if quantum mechanics weren't true - the glow should be perfectly even.  But as you can see it is not; mass and energy were not perfectly evenly distributed.  The WMAP picture you linked shows the unevenness in the microwave background, and so it helps us know about conditions in the very early universe, when the whole universe was tinier than the size of a pea, when the glow first formed.

Hope that makes some kind of sense.  I'm no expert."

myrrlyn,elderscrollsonline,1389759560.0,"Hi! I'm myrrlyn, and I'm contracted to go through the stylesheet here and tidy up, bugfix, and generally improve where I can. I haven't been working on it yet this **year**, unfortunately, because I only just got my development environment restored earlier this evening and I've been pretty damn busy with writing /r/teslore's sheet, going back to college, bugfixing the enormous monstrosity that is /r/teslore's sheet, etc., but I **promise** I'm going to pick this up again shortly.

Anyways, could you please send me a screenshot of the problem? Imgur is terrific.

The repository where my work is visible is http://github.com/myrrlyn/eso, so if you lodge a request there it will stay visible until I close it, unlike PM's which get shoved down by new mail. But I do take notes and try to get to everything.

So sorry I haven't been able to work on this lately!

If you have any other major complains, do let me know; I think I hammered the RES comment highlight for keyboard navigation and some other glitches, but there are always new things to break.

____

ninjedit: Well I'll be. I have no idea how that glitch would be occurring, unless one of the fonts in the list is an all-capitalized font...

____

edit 2: It is. Trajan Pro is caps-only, and it's pretty high on the font usage list. Might even be the first. I don't remember offhand. Anyway, I'll start looking for other fonts to use, and I'm more than open to suggestions.

Cheers!

When I was first figuring out masturbation I used to think my plateau phase was my orgasm mainly because once I hit it I didn't have the physical energy to keep going, but when I'd purchased a vibrating bullet I'd leave it on for awhile after petering out. Perhaps this exposure to stimulation after I'd exhausted myself helped me tolerate further use? It might be worth seeing if a gift of a bullet vibe might help!

* Should normally stick to Samsung for SSD's. They sort of control the SSD market since they are essentially the only brand that actually manufactures all of the parts in their product, as well as parts for their competitors.

* The 770 at this price is a far superior buy than the r9280x

* Switched the case to the one from your first build since I assume you want it.

* Switched out the PSU to a high quality model since I made a psuedo promise to myself that I wouldn't recommend entry models above $700 budgets. There are some cheaper options on deal ATM you might like if you check out PART 4.

SomeCalcium,movies,1389759734.0,"I think there's this sort of stigma with the IMDb where the list is taken too seriously as the be all end all of movie lists. Since the majority of IMDb's user base is an age group that isn't actually that familiar with classic filmmakers or directors, I think it's sort of a silly notion to treat it  as the film lovers Bible as there are a lot of lists out there which cover a much wider range of filmmaking and we'll educate you about film as opposed to feed you the same type of films you've already seen. However, it's a great list to go by if you're just starting to watch movies and you need help getting ideas.

To answer the OP's question it's not that some films should not be on the list at all. There's just over representation of certain directors. Christopher Nolan, in particular, is probably the most over represented director in the 250 that has films that fall below 100. The presence of his films alone is a warning sign that there may be some fanboy overrating his movies just a tad.

A good way of looking at is this: Vertigo, which currently ranks as the #7 on the Director's Sight and Sound Poll is sitting at 67 on the IMDb 250. Now if you take everything ranked above it, and take a serious critical eye whether any movies ranked higher than 67 should really be considered as some of the best films ever made I'm sure you'd see a lot of films disappearing. The current highest rated film ""Tokyo Story"" isn't even on this list where ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is currently sitting at 197.

CanadianGuy116,OutOfTheLoop,1389759846.0,"The friend zone is when a guy likes a girl (The genders can be reversed, but that's definitely more rare) and the feelings aren't reciprocated. The guy will usually remain single, and do nice things for her, spend time with her, do everything boyfriends will do without getting any of the physical benefits of being a boyfriend. Originally, the key to the term ""friend zoned"" was strictly when the girl leads him on and gives him false hope that they will eventually be together. When an onlooker would ask if they're together, the girl will reply with ""We're just friends :)"" He is in the metaphorical ""friend zone"". He has been FRIEND ZONED!!

However the term is beginning to be used more frequently even when the girl is not leading him on. 

Guy likes girl. Girl does not like guy ***and vocalizes this to him***. Guy tells people he's been ""friend zoned"". This is an incorrect use of the term."

iLoveMuse,xxfitness,1389759866.0,"This is a little controversial to be doing here, but currently what's helping me is eating ~1200 calories a day. My TDEE is around 1900, and between this week and last week I lost 1.5lbs (not water weight--I lost that already). I've only been able to do this because I pretty much have not eaten dessert for about 2 weeks now (unless you include protein bars--but I haven't even really been in the mood for those either!). I think having that extra sugar was not only stimulating my appetite, but stimulating my general carb cravings as well. So cutting out desserts and lessening my bread intake has really helped. 

Another thing that has really helped me stop late-night snacking is IF (intermittent fasting). I don't eat before noon or after 8, and if I do eat after 8, I wait 16 hours before eating again. Because of the tight eating window and my lessened appetite, I only eat 2 meals a day, but am rarely hungry--usually only briefly, in the morning. I think IF's helped my body burn more fat throughout the day, and weight training and cardio are supposedly more effective at fat burning when done fasted.

Here's essentially what a typical day looks like now:

Wake up

Go to class

Go to the gym (I go every day; MWF weight training, all other days cardio)

Eat lunch (usually an apple, a greek yogurt, half a protein shake, and some almond milk)

More class, until...

Dinner (which is usually meat and veggies, with a small amount of carb like french fries, a roll, or pasta for flavor)

I don't feel like crap from eating &lt;1200 net calories at all; I find that I actually feel much better than I did when I was eating 1400-1600. But YMMV, depending on your TDEE and daily schedule. This is just what's been working for me. :)"

Despite your best intentions, this is a really unhelpful comment. Just because his parents are taller than he is doesn't mean he should be an average of their two heights. Both of my parents are taller than I am, even though they're both short. I just happened to get the random combination of genes that said ""shorter"" rather than ""taller"" from each of them.

Also, telling him what he ""should have been"" is the opposite of helpful, especially considering he already feels that way. You have no way of knowing how tall he should or shouldn't have been. On top of the fact that it doesn't matter how tall he should or shouldn't have been, because he IS this height, and he WILL BE this height, and he can be an amazing person with what IS."

I have a little background knowledge on aviation - I am an instrument rated pilot and before switching majors I was in a commercial aviation program double majoring in flight operations and airport management. (I'm an accountant now)

Its laughable to suggest the aviation industry is free market - just for starters [here are the three main books of federal regulations pertaining to the aviation industry](http://generalaviationnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/asa-400x264.jpg) (and these books only highlight some of the major regulations - they are far from a complete list of all the regs pertaining to flight in the US)

There is only 1 privately owned *commercial* airport in the United States (Branson, Missouri if you're curious) - the rest are all government operations. We HAD a private aviation industry, until some of the bigshots teamed up with government to restrict their competition. Yes, our textbooks didn't even try to hide the fact that the early pioneers of aviation were eager to maintain a chokehold on their head-start in aviation. 

The air traffic control system was completely private until FDR nationalized it around WWII - a joint operation of the airlines working cooperatively. 

I mean, I could sit here an write an article as long as his on what all is subject to the government's whim - from who gets to operate out of which airport, to which routes you have to fly, how you maintain your aircraft, what equipment you must carry, etc etc etc. You get the picture."

The problem with marijuana is it stays in your system and has a lesser effect for a more prolonged period of time than alcohol. Our company has a rule, ""Eight to the gate"". Meaning that you're not allowed any alcohol eight hours before you walk through those factory gates, it's usually enough to clear most people's systems. Marijuana though isn't like that. It lasts longer and it's effects are harder to percieve. "

For a mixture of reasons, I don't think we'll turn it on to break back into the 4th spot. That's mainly down to tactics (and motivation) but some limited personnel options come into it as well. It would also take awhile for someone in the (creative) engine room to bed in fully. 

So I think we can wait til summer to avoid a stopgap and get a blockbuster. If we go for bargains and potential over at least one signing I am excited for, I will be extremely disappointed in the summer. If Chelsea can get matic for 25 then we should be able to bid to get a comparable player. That's not absurd. Depending on how much we spend and how much contingency money is available if a certain signing doesnt pan out then we can survive 1 year maybe even 2 out of Europe. There must be significant spending in the summer though because no one  wants to support a glazer trust fund. "

somanyrupees,AskMen,1389760503.0,"Honestly, and I'm going to get destroyed for this, but I think you are being too sensitive. It's been ten years. My girlfriend killed herself while on the phone to me four years ago (In fact, after being raped by her abusive father who had tracked her down after being separated for years) and I don't get all uppity whenever someone tells someone to kill themselves or makes rape jokes - which is surprisingly often, especially online. Maybe for a year or so it would have turned me into a wreck but you get over it. Hell, traumatic experiences happen left and right - I dated a girl in 2012 who had a fetish for getting me hammered to the point where I was helpless and taking advantage of me - genders reversed one would call that rape. She also ended up cheating on me for months and tried to pin me with a false rape claim after I found out. Traumatic? Yes. Did I get over it? Yes.

I think the problem here lies with you. What you've been through is fucking awful but you have to get over it, honestly. See a therapist if you can't do it by yourself.

And don't get all up in my shit about victim blaming or whatever the go to defence for this shit is, you all know ten fucking years is well and truly enough to get over just about anything in life and if you can't, you are pretty damn disturbed and need professional help, because you've let it become who you are as opposed to something that has happened to you in the past."

plusoneeffpee,AskReddit,1389760520.0,"I'm in my 40s, and it's going to be hard to get an answer for this. One, you idealize your youth; you make it bigger, grander, and just more awesomer in your mind. Two, I can only assume that you kids today party in largely the same way we did in the 90s. But I'll take a shot at it....

The main difference is that I stopped caring about them so much. Think about it...what's the primary function of a party in your 20s? It's not just to drink. It's not just to drink with your friends. It's not just to socialize, and it's not something as straightforward as meeting people..... The big reason most people go to parties in their 20s is to get laid. It's not the whole point, but it's a sizable chunk of the point. I know people go to parties to socialize and whatever....but the elephant in the room is that you are there because you are horny and you want to get laid.

When you push through your 20s and into your 30s and beyond, most of your social group is married. Hell, you're probably married. Going to a party is no longer about potentially playing hide the salami, it's about hanging out with friends, socializing....and you quickly realize that it's a helluva lot better to do that with a few buddies at the pool hall or hiking up a river with a fly rod. And parties turn into grabbing a few beers or watching the game or shooting some skeet.

Great insight about the texture. The only toys that I've tried so far are the Silk and an Aneros Helix, both of which are very smooth. I'm searching through the archives for more specific advice on texture, but it sounds like I should be careful not to overdo it. I could definitely see how texture along the shaft could irritate the sphincter. 

Lastly, great tip about the dildo cuff! Hadn't seen anything like that before.

Based on the feedback that I got to this post, it sounds like I should be looking for something with a little more girth, a little texture toward the tip, and not necessarily a ton longer. I'm thinking the Tango or the Feeldoe are looking very appealing, due to the vibration aspect. I'd expect that I would enjoy that, as well.

Kaep does as much community-wise and giving-balls-to-kids-wise as Cam.   
As someone that is a huge 49ers AND Panther fan, both squads have potentially GREAT QBs, so Panther fans need to stop with the butthurt. 

The fact is that the 49ers were and are the better team.  They went to the Superbowl last year and have been in the NFC Championship game every year for the past three.  

The 49ers have the better defense, have better skill players, and are just deeper than Carolina. 
Panthers have one hell of a defense but the secondary is weak.  Niners fans loooove Kaep, but Carolina has the better QB. (I dream of Newton being on SF and throwing to Davis, Crabtree, Boldin and Gore... SF would have a damn near unstopable offense).  But there is no one for Cam to throw to other than a healthy Steve Smith.   The Panthers just don't have a dynamic offense.  They need more WRs and a better TE, and a better OL.  
The Panther front 7 is GREAT.  
(Man to man I would still take the 49ers front 7 over Carolina's front 7, but I don't put Carolina's far behind.   Niners are just deeper.)  
The secondary needs to be improved dramatically.  I love Munnerlin, have since he was at USC, but when he is your best DB that's a huge problem.  

This is no knock on Carolina. Carolina Panthers will be back again and will be up there with Seattle and SF next years and years after.  As a fan of both teams there is nothing I both love and hate more then when the two play in the playoffs and I want to see that again.  I LOVE that there is a good rivalry developing between my two favorite teams. 
  
Bottom line is that Carolina had a GREAT season, and have positioned themselves well to have more great seasons.  
Hold your head up, Panther fans.  
Be proud of the Panthers!  That's a really good team. 
They'll have their chances at the Niners and/or the playoffs again soon.   "

Pachacamac,AskReddit,1389761188.0,"&gt;You sound like someone invented the wheel, but a focus group came up with a negative product review and they ditched the idea.

I describe a certain era of archaeological thinking (processualism, basically modernist archaeology, really popular from the 60s through 80s, still around but less dogmatic) as being just like that, basically. You read the papers of the hardcore processualists and it sounds more like they are talking about the optimal locations to place a factory, not the variation of human behaviour.

&gt;I think if they had had wheels, they would have damn well found a use for them.

But that's the problem. If they had wheels, they would have used them, maybe, but they didn't have wheels. And it is easy to say that there wasn't a strong impetus to invent them because of geography, which is basically what I said up there, but that's also iffy.

mgrinshpon,magicTCG,1389761366.0,"I actually think that the concept of reprinting to keep costs down is a good thing (although how Konami is going about it is terrible).

Yugioh is definitely going to be more inherently appealing to people with limited financial resources than MtG is going to be. Look at the price of almost any historically competitive Legacy or Vintage deck, as these are the formats that are closest to what a YuGiOh player plays (super-fast, combo, etc). Burn, maybe the cheapest Legacy deck, is what, $100, and at the very bottom tier of playable Legacy decks? Yeah, it'll beat something sometimes, but it kind of sucks compared to AdNaus, Elves, or NOBant. Let's not even talk about vintage pricing. Hell, even Standard isn't anywhere near budget friendly because of the number of people playing it! Competitive decks are made out of mostly rares and mythics and once again, that prices people out! Magic's New World Order has ensured that playables will sometimes exist at rare, rarely exist at uncommon, and almost never exist at common.

Compare that to Konami's game. YuGiOh reprints some pretty insane stuff at the common rarity. $100 in YuGiOh buys you if not a top of the line deck, then a pretty damn good deck. Tier 1.5, maybe as low as Tier 2 is $100 territory. You can go even cheaper than that if you wanted to and still have a good shot at winning! Then there are some cutesy rogue decks that sit at $50 and are actually fun to play. Monarch strategies stick out in my mind as the closest thing YuGiOh has to a red/blue tempo deck and that's actually some pretty cool stuff.

When a box of Modern Masters costs $250 at the time of printing and that's carrying a hefty quantity of the major playables in the eternal formats, or a Stoneforge Mystic+trinkets is going to run you more than most YuGiOh decks in their entirety, I think the hesitation of any YuGiOh player going over to Magic is understandable, especially when they view the time they've spent collecting their now cheapened cards as time invested and fond memories collected.

Do I think that Magic is the better game from a design perspective? Hell yeah. Is YuGiOh the better game for a spike on a budget, however? Yes, it completely is.

I gave up on competitive running halfway through my senior year track season. I was pretty good, but nowhere near the best runner out there (2:10 800, 4:48 1600, 10:34 3200, 17:24 5K), but I had the mixed blessing of being on a really good distance/cross-country team my senior year (short rundown of team history: team was bad enough freshman and sophomore years that I made varsity as a sophomore, then took advantage of the varsity workouts for three years to keep up as the rest of the team got better).

The process of me running out of fucks to give started junior year in track. With three weeks to go until League Finals, I got a stress fracture. I'd been poised to pull out a huge time drop on the 1600, just hit 4:50 that day, in fact, but then the season was shot. So I healed up and focused all of my energy on the next year's cross country season, and actually improved substantially, to the point where I dropped over a minute off my 5K (I'd been running at ~18:30s the previous season). The rest of the team had been doing the same, so we had gotten really damn good.

We swept our league meets, which consisted of 4 absolute dominations and one tense confrontation with our league rivals (who happened to be the 6-year defending league champions), then narrowly won League Finals despite half the team having a bad day. I didn't see the warning signs: our 4th position freshman phenomenon had been falling apart for the last couple of weeks, our solid third seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown every time I saw him, and it had fallen to me, normally fifth, and our sophomore sensation, a colossal wildcard and most often sixth, to carry League.* So I should have figured on not everyone performing their best, whether due to nerves or overtraining or whatever, but I didn't, and I held out hope that we'd qualify for State, and I ran as hard as my fucking legs would carry me, spent the next hour alternating between being curled up in the fetal position and violently vomiting everywhere, and when the results came out, we'd placed sixth. Not even close.

So I spent most of the offseason making up bullshit reasons to not go running because the very thought of it made me nauseous. Then track rolled around, and I was way out of shape, and after spending the entire season playing the catch-up game I decided this shit was for the birds and if I could manufacture enough fucks to give to make it through the season, beat my 4:50 mile time and beat this dude I hated named Joey, I would never have to stand on another starting line ever again. Well, I ran a 4:48 at League Finals, then beat Joey in the 3200, and I breathed a huge sigh of relief that I could finally stop giving a shit about competitive running and move on with my life. I still run for fitness with a group of guys I met in college, but every time they enter a race I have a convenient conflict and can't make it.

**If anyone's confused, cross country scoring gives 1 point to 1st place, 2 to 2nd, and so on, up to each team's fifth runner. Low score wins. Once we won a race on a sixth-man tiebreaker: the order was (H=other team, V=my team) H H V V H V V V H V H. They would have won by 1 if it hadn't been for me, our sixth, beating their fifth and pushing it from 27-28 to 28-28. In that situation it goes to the sixth, and I'd obviously beaten their sixth, so we won.*"

lamblikeawolf,short,1389761502.0,"My answer is probably going to disappoint you, but you're going to end up exactly the height you were meant to be.

It is nearly impossible for anyone to be able to predict that kind of thing with any degree of accuracy.

And, what point would be served by doing so? There are only a few options: You are predicted to be height X and you end up

* taller than height X.
* the same as height X.
* shorter than height X.

How do each of those options make you feel? If any of them generate negative feelings for you, you can easily realize that no purpose is served by predicting height. You're going to be the height you were destined to be whether you ultimately like it or don't.

For this reason, I suggest you find your self-worth in something other than height, and stop worrying about how much you're going to grow (or not grow) in your future."

ThePinkPanther2,AskWomen,1389761555.0,"Superficially? I like his hands. I never thought I'd find myself dating a tall guy, much preferred shorter, but I've come to appreciate his height. He can reach the top kitchen shelf so I don't have to drag over a chair. His monkey ears are adorable - I laugh every time he wiggles him. He giggles like a little girl every time I tickle his feet hahaha. 

Beyond that: I like that he's sensitive, easy-going, doesn't mind cleaning or helping out, he doesn't curse like a sailor ..in front of me. 

He's really good with his hands, doesn't complain about boredom, and is chill. He enjoys simply watching t.v. together or playing a computer game while I read on my kindle. He understands that I need a lot of ""me-time"" to unwind and enjoy my books, studying, redditing, painting, crafts, family, ect. 

He doesn't need to fill the air with a constant flow of chatter when we could enjoy comfortable silence. He doesn't bad mouth his friends behind their back - ever. I admire that because not many of my female relationships have been so refreshing and honest. Not much gossiping, no verbal backstabbing, and pretty much compliments the shit out of them in my presence. I love it because there's never any drama or mean spirited digs at anyone. Just a bunch of healthy relationships from my perspective. 

He's weird. Like, just as weird and socially inept as me. Okay maybe not as weird but close enough. Also, I don't *ever* have to hold in a fart, burp, or sneeze because he just laughs it off. He puts in TWO PACKETS OF HOT CHOCOLATE in my cup because he says it's better that way *and he's right about that*.

I like that his first reaction isn't anger but rather compassion and understanding. When we talk about issues, he doesn't gaslight my feelings (i.e. ""you're crazy"") but responds with such openness and lack of hostility that it makes me feel like communication is always on the table.

He's a damn good Christmas/Birthday gifter. I'm beginning to wonder if he makes a quick note every time I say ""I like this, it's cute."" More importantly, he'll let me eat off his plate and doesn't mind if I steal his french fries. 

He treats his mother with respect. He will schedule time to see her and makes sure to call her every week. Is this common? I'm not quite sure but it's sweet. 

To answer the second part of your question, it bothers me 
that he doesn't often ask about the books I'm reading, or share music links, or bring up Askreddit questions to hear my response. I watch the anime he's currently watching  because I want to know why he enjoys what he enjoys. I want him to feel and know that I *care*. That I'm happy to spend some time, after a tiring 8 hour work shift, trying to appreciate one of his hobbies. 

Hell, I'm uncoordinated as shit and blind as a bat but I even spent awhile trying to figure out how to download LoL on my Mac, gave up and downloaded it on a Windows laptop, then spent over an hour practicing the demo just to understand what League of Legends was all about. I did the same for Minecraft, Terraria, Katamari, and La Noire (all of which were fun). I'd appreciate some reciprocation but out of true curiosity and not because I'm whining about it. 

He likes to watch subtitled movies at night (when I'm tired) but he's willing to read the subtitles for me. 

He doesn't sing in the car. Or in the shower. He has super-radar senses so there's no surprising him! He knows when I'm about to grope him so he ducks and covers :(

He dutch oven'd me once which was evil. I will return the favor one of these days. Mark my words (10:48pm 1/14/14). Aaaand..I once cheated at Words with Friends and he'll never let me forget it. My god, it's like living with an elephant."

keakealani,socialjustice101,1389761559.0,"I don't at all want to be the definitive voice here - I think there are many different perspectives about this issue which are, in part, informed by the fact that ""mental illness"" is a *huge* umbrella that covers a variety of different illnesses and issues. But, here's my take as someone who has bipolar disorder and a long history of mental illness-related issues. 

I think context does matter when it comes down to describing someone, but generally I feel that a more specific, medically-oriented term is more appropriate than a generalized slur. For example, saying someone is ""mentally ill"" or ""has &lt;specific disorder&gt;"" is going to generally be more appropriate than saying they are ""crazy"" or ""insane"". Or, as you yourself said - ""somebody with a mental illness"". That is pretty much the most neutral and descriptive way of addressing that person, if you need to address it at all. 

To address your second question, again, I think using specific terminology, ideally medically-accurate terminology, is generally more neutral. For example, you could say someone is ""displaying violent tendencies"" or ""dangerously suicidal"" or whatever best describes the symptoms present. You're right - there are some mental illnesses that can cause people to do things that are dangerous for themselves and others. But it's usually more specific than a generalized phrase, and it is certainly more value-neutral to avoid words that are already loaded and considered to be slurs. 

To use an analogy, if someone has lost a limb, it's not really appropriate to call them ""crippled"", but rather to say that they have limited mobility, or lost a limb, or some other specific term to describe their disability. The same is true of mental illness - it's not really helpful to use a generalized term like ""insane"" but to describe their specific illness. 

Generally speaking, I think a first step is to begin talking about illness in terms of quantifiable specifics, rather than assumptions or generalizations. One big issue here is the fact that generalizations about mental illness become a strawman - when ""crazy"" is a euphemism for some extremely violent, socially inept, uniformly horrible person, it ceases to be useful when talking about *actual* people with mental illness, some of whom may be violent at times or socially maladjusted at times or even not very nice at times, but who form a much broader community with a range of nuanced and complex issues. *Most* people with mental illness are not unconsolable serial killers, but the discourse gets tarnished when the few extreme examples are used to represent the much more diverse whole. 

Another big issue is that continuing to use colloquial language makes it difficult to gain recognition that mental illnesses are ""real"" illnesses and deserve medical attention and support the way somatic illnesses are supported. It's like if society decided to call all people with cancer ""sickos"" instead of talking about their actual illness - it doesn't really feel like a ""serious"" problem if the language used to describe it is casual and colloquial. And because mental illnesses do have that problem (of being undersupported and unrecognized), it's especially important to adjust language away from reinforcing those issues. 

Ultimately, I can think of very few times where slurs are necessary (or even particularly useful), and many more times where slurs are actively harmful. As with every other adjustment of language, it's a small price to pay to undo the systemic damage it causes. "

Try on your bras backwards, with the cups out of the way, to see how the band really feels.  If it's too tight frontwards and fine backwards, you need bigger cups.  It is also possible that your ideal band is 33, which doesn't exist.  I suggest 32s with an extender for the first few wears, especially if you're doing VS, which stretches out quickly.  You're bang on with your measurement calculations, and from what you've said, 32DD is probably going to be the best, most of the time.

Omega037,relationships,1389761615.0,"I am of mixed minds on what advice to give you.  

Normally I would tell you that she is dating you, not your parents, so if you just need to keep them apart and out of contact, do so.  Also, you could tell them that you are an adult and when they disrespect her, they disrespect you.

That said, the problem here is that you are very, very young and very, very inexperienced.

First of all, for a number of reasons not worth getting into, you will absolutely not last.  It will be exceedingly painful for you, but it will likely end badly.  However, this experience will be important for your development.

Second, your parents (and possibly sister) aren't doing this because they don't like her, but because they love you.  They honestly think that you breaking up with her would be a good thing, and they are absolutely right.  They worry about the damage that might be caused by being with her, which absolutely will accumulate over time (as you make career and financial decisions for her that negatively impact you).

The problem is that they don't recognize that you aren't mature enough yet to be capable of weighing their opinions correctly.  All their attempts do is likely drive you closer to Jane and away from them.  Their best play would just to give you someone to talk to and let you know they will be there for you if you do end up breaking up.

Third, unless they are awful people (which I doubt), your family's opinions should matter a great deal.  These are people who love you unconditionally and, in the case of your parents, have a *lot* more experience than you do.  They also have a perspective that you may be too blind to see due to infatuation.  I think you will one day come to realize that you should probably *never* be with someone your family or friends don't approve of.  

So what is my advice?

Telling you to end it with her will probably not work (and will cause you to disregard everything else I say), so my advice is talk to your parents.

If you haven't already, here is a chance to have a very serious and mature discussion as an adult with them.  Schedule time to sit down with them and get their advice.  Tell them everything that has been going on and what you are feeling, and see what they say.  Don't be confrontational at all, as you are seeking their help.  You don't have to follow their advice, but you should understand their reasoning as much as you can.

You might be surprised what you learn."
rocksampson,Justrolledintotheshop,1389761616.0,It depends on the crank.
Takuya-san,LearnJapanese,1389761616.0,"I'd recommend starting kanji as soon as possible! It'd be great to nail around 1000 down in the first month at around 35 per day (should take an hour of study time each day if you follow RTK and use Anki, both described below). From there you could do something easier like 20 per day and spend more time on vocab and grammar if you so choose, or you could continue at 35 per day until you get to 2000 kanji.

RTK (Remembering The Kanji) is a book series written by a man called James Heisig. His method isn't revolutionary but it's probably the most straightforward. RTK1 (first book) is the key to the series and his other two books (RTK2 and RTK3) are easily skippable.

RTK1 teaches you how to remember and handwrite the kanji using an incredibly simple method and guides you through 2040 or so kanji - more than enough to get you through most basic Japanese materials without running into an unknown kanji every few sentences.

Its methods are actually applicable to life in general - they involve taking elements of the kanji and making stories out of them, and combining stories to make new stories such that you easily and (mostly) instantly learn how to write most of them. This technique isn't unique to Heisig and is used by other memory experts, but Heisig is one of the only (and most effective) writers to apply it to kanji.

If money is an issue, this is my recommended path:

* Pirate Remembering The Kanji 1 (find it by searching on TPB).
* Download Anki and the most popular premade deck for RTK. Also install the Kanji handwriting font (search for it) which will allow you to show stroke orders in Anki. This will allow you to practice kanji when you're waiting in lines or on public transport using your phone, and allow you to practice kanji at home in an [efficient SRS manner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)
* Follow the textbook for the first few chapters (~200 kanji).
* After that, follow the textbook and use [this website](http://kanji.koohii.com/study) to assist you with coming up with good stories.
* If you found success with the method, be a good guy and make a note to buy the textbook in a few years time when money isn't an issue to support Heisig's work

If money isn't an issue:

* Same method as above, but buy the textbook from somewhere like Amazon or something"

I mean, isn't there a non-zero possibility that maybe he's really that lazy, or maybe he's really technically inept and doesn't know how to selectively download and delete photos from his phone?

That's not even the point of what I wrote, though. I'm just sick of this hyper-critical, jump-to-conclusions, overreactive advice that seems to dumb down relationships and remove any sort of nuance from them. Instead, the crowds want to see heads roll.

For sure, there are some really basic posts on here where people are asking advice about their dangerous, violent, abusive partners. Yes, yelling at those people is an option because A) the situation is very clear, and B) their health, physical/mental/emotional, is at risk. But this is not one of those situations, so everyone should really stay away from the dramatics.

What I'd really like to see is people saying, ""Hey, that's pretty weird that he still keeps photos of his ex on his phone. Are you not okay with that? Have you tried sitting down with him and having a productive discussion with him? Is there any resentment that he holds against you for your insecurities? Maybe he's trying to protect his phone because it's some sort of privacy talisman that he's protecting in his last stand against your insecurities? Is it that bad? Is that a possibility? Have you explored these topics?""

Instead, we get ""RESPECT YOURSELF, DUMP THIS FUCKING LOSER"". Oh yeah? Is that your nuanced take on the situation after reading three paragraphs? Because I'm *pretty fucking sure* there's some wiggle room for interpretation."

dakru,AskMen,1389761928.0,"Your idea that men at a library are more likely to be looking for a relationship than men at a party or a club is a very solid one, however I don't think you quite realise how much men hear how it's wrong or bothersome to talk to women particularly at places where you go there with a particular task in mind like the gym, store, or in this case, library.

So you're in a bit of a bind. A party is an environment where it's less discouraged to approach women, but it's also an environment where men are less likely to be interested in a relationship. You have a few options to work with this outside of the party setting.

The most obvious is to approach men yourself. It might not be easy, and you're probably not used to it, but it's pretty effective. If you're sure you don't want to do this and you want to focus on making yourself seem more approachable, I think your body language is more important than your clothes (as long as they're flattering yet tasteful, but women usually know their fashion better than guys do). This means smiling at guys you'd like to chat with and trying not to seem busy. Take a break from doing work when you see a guy you'd like to talk to; push the book to the side, and sit back like you're relaxing or something."

If you want to try some ""quality"" tea, [Upton Tea Imports](http://www.uptontea.com/shopcart/help/HELPwhereToBegin.asp) has excellent prices and selection. [Harney and Sons](https://www.harney.com/) is also very highly respected. 

A lot of people will recommend David's Tea and Adagio - while the quality of their products seems to be high, they tend to be somewhat overpriced (IMO) and they specialize in flavored tea (which is fine, but it doesn't really help if you want to experience the variety of flavors straight tea can present).

Good luck...

EDIT: Not everything at Adagio is overpriced - looking at two of my favorites, for example, Ceylon black tea from the Kenilworth Estate plantation is almost the same price as Upton Tea (about $2 an ounce), but gunpowder green tea from Adagio is $9 for 4 oz, as compared to $5.40 for 4.4 oz for the top grade at Upton.

That's what I find so surprising about this statistic; if women do have worse problems than men, I would expect them to commit suicide more. Perhaps this isn't related to misogyny or misandry, but something else that only affects men. Is there a study that gives an explanation for this?

If you keep a karate fighting stance, with hands out between you and you opponent and your head back to create more distance between your chin and the other person, you won't necessarily need to worry about a *boxing style hook*. It is a very close range technique and keeping a good distance will most likely discourage any attempts or at least make it easier to evade with a slight head weave."

dunkybones,Blacksmith,1389762408.0,"Huh, I'm also in Maryland. I shoe primarily polo ponies, fox hunters and pleasure horses.  
  
I haven't made a shoe since farrier school, there is very little incentive to do so with the range of keg shoes available today. Every keg shoe needs to be modified in some manner to fit an individual horse, but many adjustments can be done cold. Forge work certainly has it's advantages, and I wouldn't think of not carrying one in my truck, but hot shoeing takes more time.   
  
I've been shoeing for ten years. I like the work, but it certainly takes a toll on your body. Last time I heard any real stats on the business, it was something like less then 10% of students last more than a year, and of those who do make it, less than half go for more than 10 years. Injuries happen, some in the blink of an eye, others accumulate over time. Sometimes it's the horses that are difficult to work with, sometimes it's the owners. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter, and you only get paid when you are working.  
  
I take pride in my work, keeping my horses sound and their riders safe, but being self employed requires a lot of motivation.  
  
I blacksmithed for a couple years before I started shoeing. As a trade, they are remarkably different. For smithing, you need to learn metals and process and finesse. For shoeing, you need to learn shaping, biomechanics, and animal behavior. Both trades require patience, devotion, an being willing to always learn something new.

&gt;So just because they feel empowered means they can have gay pride parades

Yes, this is a free country.  You are not required to watch or attend.

&gt;and gyrate and display degrading disgusting acts for the whole world to see?

Yes, funny how I don't see you complaining about women doing the same thing.  Again, freedom of expression.  It's very important to this country.  First amendment - freedom of speech.

&gt;They can change existing state laws because ""equality.""

Yes, absolutely.  Did you know that in Texas until 1978, a man could shoot and kill his wife if he found her in a compromising position with another man?  Did you know that slavery used to be legal?  We change state laws when we deem them to be unjust.  It's part of the system.  

&gt;they want to destroy the two-parent family, (mother and father)

Them wanting the right to be parents does not mean they want to ""destroy"" mother-father homes.  This doesn't even make sense.  

&gt;they want to force everyone to accept their perverse lifestyle under the guise of equality

I don't accept the premise that homosexuality is perverse.  

&gt;because some day, my church may be forced to perform gay marriages

No, the government cannot force a church to perform a gay marriage.

&gt;or else have their tax-exemption status taken away

This has nothing to do with gay people.  It has to do with their tax exempt status being unconstitutional.

&gt;or because their marriage will not benefit society as traditional marriage does

How does traditional marriage benefit society?  We are over-populated as it is, there is no need for rampant procreation.  Actually, gay couples are more likely to adopt, which is a very good thing.  Would you say that straight people who are unable to conceive shouldn't be allowed to get married?

&gt;Or maybe because their perverse lifestyle will lead some to abuse children. 

Again, homosexuality has nothing to do with pedophilia.  Many straight, married people abuse children.  Many church officials abuse children."

Go slow with the physical side of things.  If we went out and I didn't get *any* action at all, I would lose interest.  Play it as if you're some kind of really ""good girl"" or ""old fashioned"" - maybe only a goodnight kiss on the first date, and only get to some heavy making out after a few dates.  You're going to have to assert control over the physical progression.  This will require you to be assertive and confident.

Then, talk to me about it.  Tell me the whole story.  Something like ""listen, I wanted to bang you after the first date, but I couldn't.  I've been dealing with this condition... (explain exactly what it is - and be very clear that it's not an STD) yaddy yadda... I've only had sex a few times because of it and I'm really afraid that it will be a problem and I need you to understand etc etc.""

Personally, assuming there's an attraction between us, I would take this as a challenge and do my best to get us banging without issue ASAP.

It's debunked nonsense.  The owner of the WTC lost millions of dollars when those buildings were destroyed, because insurance did not compensate for the decades of lost rent and other benefits he would have enjoyed.

Furthermore, if this was the conspiracy, why bother with the other planes (that were headed for Washington, D.C.)?

&gt;Bush administration used it as a precursor for the invasion in iraq. You really can't fathom that to be the case?

I'm in full agreement they used it *after the fact.*  However, that does not show any involvement in, or foreknowledge of, the attacks.

Like I said, if they planned the attack in order to set up a war with Iraq, they would have planned it so that Iraq could be blamed.  Even with the attackers being from the Middle East, they still needed some pretty fucking complex mental gymnastics to justify a war with Iraq afterward."

 You could have a back story made for each new character of how they survived the apocalypse and who they lost. When they die an item such as a pocket watch or a picture could add some story and meaning to that character's life. As for something to slow senseless killing, I think you would need to create higher reward for trading and stronger penalties for killing with the damaged items system or add increased zombie threat to killers.

sockalicious,space,1389763169.0,"&gt;  If it weren't 2D, what shape would it be?

OK.  Imagine you're out standing in the middle of a flat field, with binoculars.  You are scanning the sky in every direction, 360 degrees along the horizon, and then elevating your binoculars bit by bit, in any direction you please, up to the zenith.

You have mapped out the inside of half a sphere.

Now take the Earth away, but still be standing there.  You now can map out the inside of a whole sphere.  You can look any direction you like.  The WMAP satellite also looked in all those directions; and the result was projected onto that flat oval you linked.  But it would be more accurate to paint the inside of a sphere with those colors and then stand inside the sphere.

&gt; Do we have a position on the image (i.e. is there a ""you are here"" spot"")?

Yeah, so, OK.  I intentionally glossed over this - I was intentionally super vague on this exact point.  Our train will now depart the station of Making Sense, headed for parts unknown.

We are looking at a glow from when the universe was young.  Really young.  Like 10 ^ (-35) seconds old.  That is a very, very short period of time.  The universe was unimaginably tiny at that time but it contained Everything.

Everything, in a tiny speck far, far smaller than the diameter of an electron.

Everything.

The universe did not *add* new space-time to itself.  The space-time that existed at that time merely expanded, stretched, like blowing up a balloon.

*Every* point in space that now exists was once at the center of that unimaginably tiny sphere, the one that grew until it was billions of light years apart.  So when you ask ""Where is the 'you are here' point?"" relative to the cosmic microwave background?

It's everywhere.  All those points in space were essentially in exactly the same place prior to what cosmologists call 'inflation'.

Worse yet, the universe is apparently 'flat'.  Horrifically, this means that straight parallel lines can never intersect - and the dimension of the universe is therefore infinite.  The WMAP satellite helped discover this too, but please don't ask me how.

The quantum mechanics I know assure me that these explanations are pleasant and simple when you just look at the equations.  Personally I find them a little brain-stretchy.  [This wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe) is of no help at all."

SpiralSoul,movies,1389763177.0,"Okay, so, Hank Pym was the first Ant-Man. He's a really interesting character - he's sort of a troubled mad scientist trying to do his best to be a superhero. He 's one of the smartest men in the world, was declared Earth's Scientist Supreme by the cosmic being Eternity, built Ultron, and founded the Avengers, and he gets pretty much no recognition, either in-universe or out. 

It's common for a superhero title to change hands over time - think how many Robins and Green Lanterns there have been. (Marvel tends not to do it quite as much as DC.) The second Ant-Man (out of three so far, but Eric O'Grady isn't relevant to the movie) is Scott Lang, an ex-con who steals Pym's technology to save his ill daughter. I happen to not really like that character as much.

Now, Paul Rudd was cast as Scott Lang and Michael Douglas is Hank Pym. Douglas is like 70, so he's probably not going to be the main guy in an action movie. So my educated guess is that they're just going to have Pym there to invent the tech and then shift the focus of the whole movie to the real star, Scott Lang/Paul Rudd. I'm disappointed because a movie starring Hank Pym would've been much better. And Rudd actually would have been a reasonable casting choice for a young Pym - in the comics he's roughly Tony Stark's age."

* Maybe I'm just not familiar with Japanese storytelling, but those stories that Yuuji tells are way too detailed to not have actually happened. Maybe it's a way of coping, since the fact that we the reader are never told what his job involves aside from vague hints that we pick up from his fighting skills and such, even though we see the story from his point of view.

* Those repeated instances of someone accusing someone else of being an alien are lending some credence to /u/fatestayknight 's theory from last week. 

Thoughts about the girls: 

Makina is no longer supressing her real personality because she's accepted Yuuji as part of the group. Judging from her comments about her mother from last week, I'm thinking it might be a rarity for her to be treated as an equal.

Yumiko acts tough but is easily scared by simple things. This is just a guess, but I think being a bookworm and being inspired by some character has given her the ability to put on a strong facade but it quickly shatters when she gets frightened, meaning she doesn't have a lot of experience with ""real life"" situations.

Michiru is truly an idiot, but we've seen that this benefits the group... somehow... so I guess it's OK. I'm curious as to why she feels the need to change her personality into a cliched tsundere for no apparent reason; I'm guessing self esteem issues in the past.

Sachi. Oh dear, oh dear. All that submissiveness is getting her into trouble. I noticed that she doesn't seem used to genuine gratitude, or at least compliments, since she kinds of freezes like a deer in headlights when Yuuji doesn't treat her like a maid. She probably isn't used to thinking for herself, something that was hammered into her, perhaps?

And finally, Amane. Her amiable attitude, like everyone elses', is most likely a facade to cover up whatever depression that was alluded to. How does she cope? By breaking into guy's rooms and rolling around in their beds...? Or she's just a creep like that, I dunno. "

2. Write VBA to open the word document and replace certain bookmarks with fields, I have only really done this once or twice.

If you are trying to do an invoice or the like, often times it's actually better to do the report in Access for more control on how the report will output."

In terms of why you should care, sure the planet has gone through hot and cold periods before - but never like this. This is extremely rapid warming. And because of this speed many, many species will be unable to evolve and will be driven to extinction. I wouldn't exactly call it a consensus, but there is broad agreement that we're in a period of mass extinction right now. That's bad for lots of species, but it's also bad for us. Our survival depends upon a pretty narrow band of conditions (temperature, rainfall, etc). Throw them too far out and we'll have widespread crop failures, or flooding, or droughts.

Our planet will be just fine. It will recover. Life, uh, finds a way, and all that. The question is how well human societies will survive - especially the most vulnerable of us."

The best thing for you to do is to go to your doctor and ask to be tested for Celiac. Some people choose to eat gluten free without getting tested, but Celiac can be linked to other health issues (like arthritis) so I think it's a good idea to know for sure.

Does anyone in your immediate family experience these problems? Celiac is genetic and runs in families. My dad has had bad joint pain and was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis years ago. It wasn't until I was diagnosed that he found out he had it as well. 

Prior to my diagnosis, I was instructed to keep a food diary and mark down when I got sick. It made it easier to pinpoint the gluten. For now, you can always do a trial and error with your diet. However, be aware that the tests for Celiac require you to have been eating gluten for a period of time in order to yield correct results.

Some think that our gm makes questionable draft selections. We haven't seen barely any improvement since lebron left. The fans (not all of us, just a very very small select few) representing the organization made us all look like fools. Burning lebrons jersey on national TV, then begging him to come back.

Same with how thirsty or tired. All i need is an (approximate) bar or tab or marker in the inventory screen and i would be completely happy. Its already there, but only shows up when you're in extremes.

Not to mention, for the sake of testing and alpha, we kinda need it so we know whats a bug and whats a feature. I don't want a HUD, i just want a way that simulates me going 'hm, how hungry am i, oh that hungry"" because right now i don't know if i'm hungry or tired or dying until i'm basically in one extreme or the other."

If ever they are sexualized, it's because they've included a picture from another source that they are unpacking as part of a critique.

My fiancé knows this and thus tries to make the whole month special and romantic for me. Starting on the first, he'll start a tradition and continue it up until the 14th. Last year, for example, he got a jar and two different colored post-its. Every day, we both had to write a comment on why we love the other person and stuck it in the jar. The night of the 14th, we have a romantic dinner and we read the notes. My contribution last year was leading a nerdy valentine for him every day. I'm still trying to figure out what I am doing this year. 

This may seem a bit mushy, but my guy does not really do traditional romance throughout the rest of the year. It's as if he saves it all for the month of February. I'm okay with this since it's generally over the top and sweet. "

winnacht,rpg,1389763900.0,"Sure, not knowing the exact chance for players is ok, but the real issue I have is as a GM (I almost always run games rather than play them), I find it difficult on the fly to know how hard to make something. As a player it is somewhat frustrating to not be able to make intelligent decisions about your character, you end up just throwing dice and hoping.

I also find it isn't fine grained enough for such a rules heavy game. When you standard target number is 4, a +/- 1 is a pretty dramatic increase, but it is the smallest modifier you can apply.

To be honest, my group and I have only tried to play it a few times. Those times we just sort of got annoyed at how clunky it felt and gave up on it.

kyrostolar,DebateReligion,1389764158.0,"Think about what morality is without the label of just being ""Good and Evil"". *why* is something good or bad? The golden rule is a good place to reference when talking about morality, ""do unto others as you would wish done unto you"" or some such variation. Ditch ""Good and Evil"" and replace it with ""positive and negative"" in terms of balance, it doesn't sound like much but it works. I believe morality is completely relative, there is no universal standard. If I kill someone, it's morally wrong because there is a negative impact on someone without any justifiable positive impact to balance it out - of course this is all left to interpretation and unbelievably vast grey areas. Objective morality says murder is wrong because you're taking a life. A relative standpoint might say yes I murdered him, but he was about to trigger a bomb killing ten other people, so I was really just saving lives. Of course, if you killed them for some petty reason then objective or subjective, you're still being immoral. 

Objective morality is the infallible pope, the genocidal God, the neurotic Saudi Religion Police. You can paint a pretty picture, but nothing good ever comes of it. Your teacher can paint the pretty picture of objective morality and a black and white side of ""good and evil"", but every day he's practicing moral relativism in some way and acting no different from an atheist. Atheists don't *start* from a position of ""what's the rule, what's the law, what's the punishment"", we consider and rationalize everything (not to necessarily say that it's always a rational outcome) but in short, we think. 

Objective moral law takes away the thinking step, you have right and wrong period. Atheists think and don't allow themselves to skip that step, and so does your teacher. His argument is not only ignorant and irrelevant, every day he is also being in some way moral without God. You don't need to be an atheist to see that you have atheistic values, it's the benefit of being human and not being God.

Tell your teacher to do some research on morality and really question the concept. The Christian God is a self-proclaimed jealous, wicked, cruel, genocidal psychopath. Yes I know, we hear the same adjectives over and over, but frankly the epitome of morality is, based on our own rationale, an incredibly immoral character. I'm trying to debate and study this further, but I don't believe ""objective morality"" is a real thing to begin with."

pretendent,gaming,1389764314.0,"I did literally the same thing 2 nights ago. I'd got Anno 2070 during the Steam sale, but had been playing through the Witcher. I decide to start it up.

1. Start Anno from Steam. Anno 2070 window opens and downloads an update.

2. A Uplay window opens, and downloads another update. The fuck?

3. A third, smaller gray Uplay window opens up and a 3rd update downloads. At this point I assume they're fucking with me on purpose.

4. Log in to Uplay? OK, guess I'll have to register.

4. User name taken? Must mean I created a Ubisoft account years ago. It's registered to a yahoo account I haven't touched in years. 

1. Yahoo makes me jump through some hoops to get into my abandoned email account.

243. Log-in finally! No wait, can't connect. That's funny, since my internet is working fine. Are you certain I should be forced to connect to your servers to play a game I've already purchased if you don't guarantee that your server will allow me to connect?

241879126. Try again 30 minutes later. Success! At last!

876. I see that Anno has been registered to my account, but where's the play button?

34. Is this it? Oh, wait, you want to download Anno again. WTF. I already downloaded this game from Steam, Ubisucks. Why are you making me do this again?

69. Quit out and search online for a solution. ""Just quit Uplay once and start it up again from steam, and you won't have to download it again."" lolwut?

666. Start up Uplay, and lo and behold, there's a play button on there that wasn't there before, which just screams good design, doesn't it? /s

123456. Open game, I can't remember why, but it definitely told me the game would need to restart. I am 100% sure Ubisoft is just trolling me to make sure I understand that I am worthless scum in their eyes.

89. I am at last able to start Anno and play the first mission. It's ok, not great. 

Steam took the pirate I was and turned me into a customer of game companies again. Ubisoft, meanwhile, is doing its damnedest to try to turn me into a Pirate again. I am filled with self-loathing over the knowledge that I've already given them money for Far Cry 2 and 3. Big mistake, as I no longer believe they, as a company, deserve a single solitary cent of revenue. I do not intend to be a customer of Ubisoft in the future, at least until Ubisoft treats its customers with decency and respect. And I would urge all my fellow gamers to follow suit, and refuse to give Ubisoft money. In a perfect world their choices would be treat customers with respect, or go out of business.

tl;dr Fuck you, Ubisoft. FUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYOU, I hope your executives spend eternity in the level of hell reserved for child molesters and people who talk at the theater. "

I wasn't too worried until he got home, turned on all the lights and there were footprints on the floor, walls and ceiling. Fucking terrifying.

Getting back to school, Lucia and Kotarou excellently demonstrated that bad communication kills. As someone who doesn't like spicy food, I can only conclude that Lucia has a mutation or something that caused her to be born without tastebuds.

Akane has control of black magic which turns out to blackmail, and I like her so far, because she appears to be the smartest of the bunch. 

Shizuru's bits are fun because seeing the conversation from Kotarou's point of view is funny as he fills in all the blanks for her. She's a cute character.

Eolond,AskMen,1389764363.0,"I'm a bit late giving a response, but I've had varying experiences interacting with guys as a female gamer.

In most cases, even if I was the only female in the group/guild, I wouldn't be treated any differently.  I would be flirted with sometimes, but that's really not unusual if you're the only female hanging out with a bunch of single males.  It was generally just in good fun.

However, there were times that I'd run a pug, doing a raid where voice chat was required, so I really had no way of hiding the fact that I was female.  Suddenly, the dynamic would just change.  I would be insulted, sexually harassed, or just put under a microscope when it came to my playing skill.  A male member could be screwing up right and left and no one would call them out for it, but as soon as I would slip up, everyone would just jump on me.  I would also get spammed with private messages asking me for nudes, telling me what they'd do to me (sexually), or just telling me to fuck off back to the kitchen.

I also ran into a few drama queens, but not as many as you'd expect.  Most of the time they'd get booted from the guild or group because no one wanted to deal with that nonsense.

Most of my experiences with other female gamers have been positive ones.  Not always, but mostly.

It's also certainly important to think about registers and labels in the context of voice types. It may not be helpful for a soprano to think about registers in the same way as a contralto, so it's important to avoid broad generalizations that don't consider a person's specific voice type and needs.

Punish him for lying or bringing illegal substances into your house as you see fit, but mostly try to make sure he sees that substances should never identify you.  

Michael Phelps smokes weed, but clearly he's disciplined enough to do so and be successful.  Some stoners use weed to avoid problems, and avoding problems is not a good path in life.  Try to use his goals as an example...until he can prove his maturity by having a path forward, he should not be expecting you to tolerate drug use."

Too many people come into it and believe that they're going to walk out of a classroom and into a 6 figure job.  That just doesn't happen, in any career.  If you go through school, when you're done, you'll know how to lay a bead, and you might think you know everything else there is to know, but it's going to take you probably 4 years on the job after school to get to actually know anything, which is to say, you'll come to the realization that the more you learn, the less you know.

The Portland program seems to cover the basics of welding, but for what it's worth there's a fair difference between sheet-metal welding like you would do on a car body and welding that you'll learn for pipe and structural.

As to if going through an education is worthwhile, that all depends on the costs of the course.  If you have to put out 20 grand to learn to weld and you're only making 14$/hr once you graduate, you'd likely have been better off starting out as a shop helper and learning as you go.

On a separate note, while a ten year age difference is nothing between 50 and 40 year olds, there isn't a lot positive to say about a normal 27 year old guy that dates a 17 year old. It speaks to a level of either predatory creepiness because he's trying to manipulate a girl into sex thinks a younger girl is easier to manipulate, or an overwhelming lack of maturity because he honestly gets along best with people ten years younger than him, or a lack of self control because he his attracted to a 17 year old girl (nothing wrong with attraction) but instead of dealing with it thinks it's okay to act on that attraction to the possible harm of the 17 year old.

I haven't investigated this matter thoroughly, and won't get a chance to tonight, but my first instinct is to condemn Shepherd and Bash Back! completely. This is what gives feminists a bad name, and that male studies program seemed completely fine and even admirable.

I call myself a feminist and not an MRA mostly because I was told on /r/MensRights that being an MRA necessitated being anti-feminist, and I think historically feminism has done and still does too much good to resort to that. I am, however, completely egalitarian and I care about many serious men's issues, such as family court bias and sexual violence in prisons.

I am using a measured tone, but I expect that I will have much harsher words for those that sabotaged Groth's male studies program once I learn more about this.

keakealani,singing,1389764736.0,"I absolutely second the comments to stick with it - this is just a part of your musical journey and there's no reason you have to follow the same path as others. 

However, I'd also encourage you to talk with your director! Let them know that you felt a bit overwhelmed, and maybe get some advice/help for improving your reading, if that's something you want to do. I think pretty much any teacher or director would want to know if a student is uncomfortable or needs advice, rather than you floundering silently and possibly not having a good experience. 

Also, don't necessarily assume everyone can sight read as well as you think they can. First of all, some people are just really good at faking it (heck, we're all kind of faking it xD) and that piece is also super popular so it's not unlikely that others with a broad choral experience have already sung it (I sang it at least once in high school so if I saw it in college it wouldn't be sightreading at all). 

And heck, even if everyone else can sightread amazingly, it doesn't mean you don't belong or don't deserve to be there, it just means you're bringing in a different background and skillset. Again, that's *fine*. But it can be really helpful to work with your director so that you can ensure the best experience and get the most out of the choir. "

Due to the other top groups falling, their relative position is rising by default, but they're not *rising*  via their own merit as much as sistar is. To me 4minute feels a lot like Kara, a group with catchy/decent songs but no particularly talented members. I still don't really know the members besides Hyuna. "

brikachuu,AskWomen,1389764827.0,"I reached a point earlier this year when I realized that:

a) I'm sick of this place and have a lot of things I hate/strongly dislike about it
b) And that's okay. I have legitimate reasons and I don't have to *love* it to get good things out of this experience.

I think for a while I was resisting admitting this to myself because I would somehow feel like I made the wrong choice to come here (or to stay for my senior year instead of graduating last spring).

I don't know, admitting this was super empowering and gives me strength to keep going these last few months to get my degree. It was kind of like a ""whoa, maturity"" moment."

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1389764831.0,"Not quite. Oils do go rancid, and they stink badly when they do. Emulsions can separate over time, and preservatives can become less effective. But all of these things depend quite heavily upon storage conditions, etc, so the official estimates are more certainly a bit rough, and they are motivated to error on the side of caution, certainly. 

Part of the reason we say 3-4 months for mascara is simply that we use mascara near a very sensitive area, so the consequences for using one where the bacteria have overwhelmed the preservation system are rather less pleasant than usual (I've used a hand cream which I later realized was improperly preserved. I cannot imagine that that hell anywhere on my face, let alone my eyes)."

The 49ers are a bunch of pissant whiners who cling to past victories before our rivalry was even relevant, and claim it makes their team superior. Doesn't matter that since we've been in the same conference we've been the more successful team. Doesn't matter we've both been 0-1 in the Superbowl in the last decade. They think their ""storied history"" makes them the better team, and lets some of their fans think they can be assholes to the rest of the NFC West.

I get that maybe, being a civilian as of yet, you probably don't understand -- I say that with no disrespect -- but having a gun pointed at you is... well, it's kind of a big fucking deal. The biggest of deals, actually.

So here's your thought experiment for the day to prep you for your academy in June. Why suddenly feel compassion for this individual? How would you feel knowing that as a result of his being released a day later, 2 miles down the road, he did the same thing and actually fired, shooting and killing a driver who then critically injured another driver due to the injured driver's inability to control the vehicle? Would you still want to be gentle? In what situations might having a gun pointed at you require you to be compassionate? Is this one of them?

whichever of the above it is, it doesn't sound like these guys are 'good friends', and you'd probably be better served finding others.

More than that, it's great to see that Whiz looks excited and happy to be here, and it's encouraging that he and Webster seem to share a common vision for how they want to build and run this team differently than it has been in the past. For a franchise that has been mostly mediocre over the past decade, an injection of fresh ideas and philosophies is a welcome change.  

I like his straightforward approach and how he handled the questions. Maybe my favorite point he made was how much he plans to emphasize competition for playing time. This was a concept that Munchak also seemed to place progressively higher value on in each of his three seasons, and I think it was one of his strengths as a coach last year (although he did keep running Reynaud out there for way too long), so I'm glad to see that will continue.

Woman's studies is, at least in theory, as important as any critical analysis program, like English Comprehension. When the courses were first developed, they were centered around the idea of reading into stories for gender biases to determine how both active and subconscious sexism occurs. This can be really important for Human Resources, Judicial Process, or writers looking to try to be unbiased and more empathetic to perspectives that are quite unlike our own.

The problem occurred recently when the group shifted from critical analysis of existing material into upholding the dogma spewed from former analysis. It's the major problem with academia now, we are not allowed to provide a critique of the materials from different perspectives. That was the original point of injecting post-modernism into the movement; to allow a common ground for *all* points of view to be treated equally. It ended up radicalizing because only those interested in changing the status quo participated in the discussion.

*You have now activated a number on a different plan with a different provider.  I am writing this letter to give you notice that this does not alleviate your agreement to pay half of the Verizon bill until this contract is up on (date).  Therefore, you can either pay the ETF, or pay your half of the bill for the remainder of months.*


Send that to her, certified, return receipt requested.  If you have a joint Amazon account you should be able to see her address, because the new AT&amp;T phone was shipped to it.

If she doesn't pay, you can use this letter as part of your proof when you take her to court.  This is called ""marshaling proof"" and it's something a prudent party does when they think they are about to head to court.

As far as the physical phone itself, if you paid for it, you can ask for it back, although you'll be hard pressed to find a court that will give that back to you two years later.

Especially this month, I am not one to wear any nail polish (besides maybe the occasional French manicure) so giant green sparkle sequins are definitely not useful for me (btw I have in my Birchbox profile that I don't like nail polish, yet I've received nail polish in my past 3 boxes!!?). I do wear eyeshadow, however I have actually never worn blue eyeshadow in my life, so that will probably just sit in my drawer forever and never get touched. I already own Viva La Juicy so I guess I can just leave the sample in my car or something for on-the-go spritzing? The Burt's Bees lotion isn't bad - but it is also something I can just pick up down the street at a drugstore. Honestly the only thing I am semi excited about in this box is the leave in conditioner (Protect &amp; Detangle) I have very long (slightly wild) hair that can always use a little detangling. Also I am a bit annoyed because for this month in particular I changed my profile settings to show that I was only interested in receiving makeup products... And I got ONE makeup product...

RegularGuyy,AskReddit,1389765797.0,"Hands on her hips, a new thought crossed my mind. ""Don't fuck this up!"" From the restaurant to homecoming, which by the way was located at a Marriott Resort, took about 20 minutes.  Let me tell you, never before have I been on a bumpier road.  Literally every single thirty seconds there was a huge bump.  With her bouncing up and down on my lap, you could say my good friend below went super saiyan.  It honestly felt like we were having clothes on sex.  But neither of us made one sound the entire ride.  But there was no doubt both of us knew exactly what was going on.  

Eventually, we reach the Marriott.  Immediately she grabs my hand and we walk into the hotel and find the ballroom where homecoming was located.  We sign in and immediately she takes me to the dance floor.  Since we got there about 40 minutes late, it was about time for the usual slow song to play.  At this point, I don't know what to think.  Here the prettiest girl in the school is paying me this attention that I was never expecting to get.  Me, RegularGuyy! The slow song starts and she grabs me.  She gets real close to me, and whispers in my ear, ""I really enjoyed the bus ride, RegularGuyy.  You know, we don't have to stay at this dance the entire night."" Oh shit. Is this really happening? ""What do you mean?"" I ask ""What did you have in mind?"" ""Well, we are in a hotel, aren't we?"" Oh my god. ""If we shared the price, I'm sure we could get a room."" Without hesitating, I grabbed her hand, left the ballroom and went to see if we could the check in. 

We went to the counter, asked for a room, and promptly got turned down.  Apparently, you had to be 21 to rent a room with a valid ID and credit card which I had neither.  Now, remember, I am in 10th grade and am inexperienced as fuck with these types of things. I've barely even got passed 2nd base, and I definitely was not expecting anything to happen that night.  Either way, I was in this position now and there was no going back.  

We were heading back to the dance when all of a sudden she remembered that she had a senior friend that drove to the dance.  She said maybe, just maybe, we could get the keys to her car from her.  At this point, I'm just following her obviously thinking with my other head.  Somehow, she gets her friend to agree to give over her keys.  We find the parking garage, turn on the emergency (because we couldn't find her car) and eventually reach her small Mini cooper.  She unlocks the door, I open the door, pull back the seat and she gets in. ""This is it."" I think to myself.  I get in, and shut the door."

I went on holiday for Christmas and New Years like a lot of people do... While I was away on holiday my account was Hijacked by a person from China (I know it was China, because I have their IP.) and began botting on my account doing (I have no idea what.).

I got home in the new year, at this point my account had already been permanently banned for Macroing Major for an entire week; I send customer support a message through the messaging system and appealed the ban.

A week went by, and I received no response.

At this point I contacted customer support via email, and received an automated message suggesting that they would respond within 48 hours.

Wyboth,AskReddit,1389765920.0,"I've just looked up the definitions, and it seems like there is a lot of debate over the words' definitions. Some say institutional racism is power + prejudice and individual racism is just prejudice, while others say plain racism is power + prejudice and racial prejudice is... well, prejudice. Whatever the definitions may be, my point was that racism against PoC (People of Color) by whites is different than racism against whites by PoC, because whites are in a position of power in society, so their racism can hurt PoC more. As for affirmitive action, if you go by the very basic definition of racism, then it is racist. But its intentions are to combat the power + prejudice racism against PoC by whites, so it could be seen as anti-racist in that respect. I think it's the latter. As for institutional vs. individual, it depends what definition you're using. If you say that institutional is society vs. a person, then it qualifies. But if you say that institutional is the privileged against the oppressed, then it's not, since it's the privileged giving the oppressed some privilege (or, if you prefer, the privileged vs themselves).

I agree that clear definitions need to be made for these terms. We can define them as we like, but we then must convince everyone else to use our definitions, and we just end up joining the debate.

Thanks for clarifying about the scholarships and job opportunities thing. I think the reason there are scholarships for minorities instead of just poor people is because colleges want a certain diversity rate. I think they put out the racial scholarships to attract more people of said race to their college. There will probably be enough applicants of a certain race to accept and still meet diversity thresholds, but many of them may just be mediocre students. For example, if a college must have at least 1,000 PoC enrolled and they receive 2,000 applications from PoC, they'll have to accept half. But, if that college offers a scholarship to PoC, they may receive 10,000 applications, so they'll have a much better selection of students to choose from.

You may say ""Doesn't that put whites at a disadvantage?"" Well, if there were less scholarships available, then it would. But as of now, any student who has a good enough score on the SAT or the ACT can receive more than enough scholarships and grants to cover the cost of tuition (I made a 34 on my ACT, and I'm swimming in scholarship money). It doesn't have to be academic, either: there are sports scholarships, departmental scholarships, club scholarships, frat scholarships, etc. Basically, if a college decides that it wants you, it's going to make sure that you don't turn them down because they're too expensive.

As for jobs, I agree that a PoC with the same qualifications as a white person is more likely to be hired, *provided that the person who hires them is not racist.* I don't know what percentage of employers are racist, or how you would determine that in the first place. Hopefully the people in charge of affirmitive action have that down and know where to set the threshold. If it's too low or too high, I'm all for changing it. Equality is the goal, after all. I haven't delved much into this topic as an SRSter, so I can't answer this as well as your other questions.

I agree with your last point; individual situations are going to be different than the average person to a certain degree. If there's someone who comes to us with a specific case which they outline in detail (e.x. ""My upper-middle class African American friend made a joke about poor PoC not being able to support their families. Is it racist?""), then I think we'd treat them differently than an average person of that race. It's more questions like ""Should we oppose the gentrification of this neighborhood?"" that we have to rely on averages for, since we don't know the situations of each individual. It really just depends on the context they provide. When there's no real context provided, the only thing we can do is default to an average, since that's the most likely situation the person is in.

keakealani,singing,1389765991.0,"I agree that it's definitely dependent on the institution. I think full-ride scholarships for music are extremely rare and probably only for a year at a time, not a full degree's worth. As /u/ghoti023 mentions, a lot of scholarships are disbursed after a full audition process and possibly additional applications/auditions while studying at the university. 

One tuition program that seems pretty common, however, is band and orchestra scholarships. At least at my university, both the band and orchestra had scholarships that were graded by seniority - basically the longer you're in the ensemble, the larger the scholarship you receive. This was especially true to encourage people to be in the pep bands for the athletic events, but I believe a few were also disbursed for orchestra section leaders and things like that. Unfortunately, it seems like little to no comparable scholarships existed for singers at my school (although this may differ from institution to institution) but if you play a band or orchestral instrument, you may want to look into those options. 

Also, if you're studying in a music department at a local university (e.g., a public state university), you may also want to check out non-departmental scholarships and academic scholarships. I do know a couple music majors who landed big academic scholarships due to getting amazing SAT scores or other general academic achievements. Similarly, the larger Arts &amp; Sciences department gave out scholarships based on a variety of factors. And of course, you should see what your school's financial aid office has to offer. There may also be options for private tuition assistance, which they'll probably be able to help you with. 

Finally, I would consider speaking with an advisor at the institution in question, and/or the teacher you intend to study with. Often, if they want a student badly enough, they'll ""make it work"", but it may mean piecing together aid from a lot of sources. But you'll definitely have to be proactive and put out a strong case for yourself, since obviously many others also want to study music and will be looking for the same resources. "

You also never know when you want to brush up on a topic in the future. Whether it be for the nclex, or something you hit in clinical or in practice that you swore you studied but just can't recall for the life of you at that time...that's when older notes are fantastic. "
bleeker_street,Advice,1389766000.0,"So depression can be both situational, or chronic and can manifest themselves in different ways. 

Situation depression is when something like a death in the family happens and people are, understandably, depressed.  Sometimes that depression can continue even long after an ""appropriate"" amount of time has passed.  This kind of depression can be clinical, but isn't chronic.  Another kind of situational depression which can become clinical depression is when an event like child abuse, rape, or trauma during war is blocked out but the person still feels depressed. These kinds of depression can also be called adjustment disorder. These kind of depression tend to have elements both of feeling numb, aches and pain, hopelessness as well as symptoms including intense sadness, uncontrollable and ""inappropriate"" crying.  In situations like these medication can be a temporary and useful form of treatment, but often in conjunction with some kind of talk therapy or something similar in order to help the person process their feeling and move past the original cause of the depression.  It would be ill advised to ignore someone struggling with processing a form of grief by saying that it's not really depression. It is always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to mental health. 

As previously mentioned, another form of depression is clinical and chronic.  This means that in all likelihood the individuals will require some form of treatment all their life.  This treatment is likely to include medication, maybe constantly, maybe on and off, and probably should include additional treatment options including therapy, light treatment, diet regulation etc. Chronic depression is more often (although not always) characterised by numbness, being too numb or ""off"" to cry, helplessness, hopelessness, low energy, poor sleeping, etc. It's true that dopamine can play a role in this form of depression (either the lack of production or the over-uptake of it), but it's definitely not the only neurotransmitter involved.  Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, androgens, serotonin, and CRF can all play a role. It is impossible to overstate how important it is for someone with chronic depression to seek out medical attention and monitor and treat their condition.  

So that's just two different types of depression. There are a lot more, including bipolar disorders types one and two, major depression, seasonal affectedness disorder and so on. 

So, when someone says they are ""sad for no reason"" it's really not possible to tell if they are depressed, clinically or not.  Only a professional with some diagnostic tools can do that, and even then it can be difficult. 

Identifying and finding tools to deal with ""I randomly feel deeply sad for no real or apparent reason"" is definitely not easy.  I would strongly recommend seeing a professional.  They can help you determine if what you're experiencing is clinical, if medication can be a useful tool or not (and I cannot stress this enough - medications are not boosts to your dopamine levels that's what sex or chocolate can do for you, there are a variety of medications that can do a number of different things with brain chemistry and are to be used in different circumstances), and if there are other tools that might be useful for you.  It might not be the answer you want to hear, but it's the best advice I can give. 

I hope some of this is useful to you.

When you eat food do you base your satisfaction on whether the ""main course"" was good or whether the ""side dish"" was good.

I have heard other women have pretty bad bleeding or other side effects though so I think it depends on the person. The procedure itself was super easy I just had some bruising around the area for a bit but now after about 9 months you can barely see the scar where it was put in. 

I first heard of the implant in college when an acquaintance talked about it and offered for everyone to poke her arm where the implant was. I actually poked at it and for some reason this stuck out as a strange but positive experience in my mind several years later when the Depo was no longer covered under my insurance and I needed to switch.

I would be driving and just be following the 18-wheeler's lights ahead of me and I was driving SOOOO slow.  I would pull over on the side of the highway for a while, but I would get scared when cars and trucks would pass me because I was afraid one might not see me and obliterate the fuck out of me.  So I kept going.  But I noticed that one person had driven their car into the median-ditch area, so I rolled down my window and shouted out if there was somebody there and if they were alright.  I heard an old lady shout back that she was OK.  I offered her a ride and I drove her to the next exit.  I guess her husband is a retired trucker and was able to call somebody to pick her up at this stop because she had me just drop her off there.

SilentAcidity,AskMen,1389766591.0,"Two of my sisters were estranged for about 10 years.  One sister (we'll call her M) was severely mentally ill.  She had been her whole life but the extent of her diagnoses would unravel over time.  At one point she burned a lot of bridges behind her due to being on a bad cocktail of meds, causing her to have severe manic episodes and erratic behavior, a lot of which she didn't remember as she was prone to episodes of dissociation.  The other sister (we'll call her R) was not ill, but tired of being subject to her behavior and the pain it caused she stopped having a relationship with her.

In recent years M lived with me.  She had a lot of physical health problems and I took care of her.  She came down sick in the beginning of November and she wasn't doing well.  I called R to tell her what was going on and I urged her to come see M, as she was really sick and didn't know what was going to happen.  R refused to see her, saying she didn't think she could forgive her, but said ""I will pray for her.""

M came home from the hospital 6 weeks later this past December with a tracheostomy, oxygen and a discharge plan to continue rehab with physical therapy and visiting nurses.  Her prognosis was good.  Within 36 hours M went unexpectedly into cardiac arrest and died on my living room floor.

I have talked with R at length about this and she is having a hard time with her decision to not see M.  She now wishes she had talked to her while she had the chance.  Her opportunity to have some sort of closure with M is gone and now she has new issues to pile on top of the old ones.  

My point here is that you don't know what's going to happen.  You never know when someone is going to pass on and life is too fucking short for regrets.  Give yourself and your ex the opportunity to share time, let go of the bitterness and perhaps get a little closure and peace.  Your wife is right, it's the right thing to do morally, but it's also the right thing to do personally.  Consider this an opportunity, not a chore, and make the best of it.  If nothing else, you will grow as a person and you will be a better man for it.

In closing, I'd like to say that this is a pivotal moment in your marriage.  If you do not go to your ex she will see you in a different light and it won't be a good one.  Whether your ex lives or dies, your wife will always remember how you handled this situation.  Going to see your ex will send the message that you are the stand up guy she married.  Not going will plant seeds of doubt.  Tread carefully and good luck, OP.  "

IndependentBoof,changemyview,1389766659.0,"&gt; I often hear about how mankind is a ""social"" animal. How mankind is fundamentally hard-wired to connect, cooperate, and empathize, but I find it hard to believe. Yes, there may be some legitimacy to the claim, but it comes off to me as new-age nonsense, sort of like claiming that people have ""auras"". If mankind truly is naturally empathetic, or social, or pro-social, or cooperative, I sure as hell don't see it.

It isn't a matter of perspective, it is a fact that homo sapiens (and our ancestors) are social animals. We form packs similarly to other social mammals like dogs, dolphins, and perhaps most notably... chimps.

That is why we find ancestors who formed tribes and civilization, because it was essential for our survival and working together benefited the group much better.

There are lots of other examples of artifacts of our social behavior: advanced language, atomic families, etc.

Moreover, most of your argument just uses anecdotes of bad things: war, greed, etc. There's a couple flaws in this reasoning:

* Being a social animal doesn't mean being perfectly altruistic. Being a social animal means we naturally interact with each other and we form societies. To quote [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_animal):
&gt; Social animals may exhibit one of more of these behaviors:
&gt;
&gt; * cooperative rearing of young by the group
&gt; * overlapping generations living in a permanent, as opposed to seasonal, group
&gt; * cooperative foraging or hunting
&gt; * cooperative defense from predators and competitors
&gt; * social learning (such as a young chimpanzee learning by observation to use a twig to fish for termites)
&gt;A chief debate among ethologists studying animal societies is whether non-human primates and other animals can be said to have culture.

* While acknowledging instances of poor behavior, you're overlooking instances of good behavior. Charity? Sympathy? Selflessness? How about those? If we're naturally ""bad"" then why do plenty of people show these traits?"

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389766676.0,"I much prefer if a guy gives me his number. Asking for mine puts me on the spot and that creates awkwardness. An awkward interaction lowers your chances that I will want to deal with you later--even if I found you attractive. I think the best thing to keep in mind when picking up women is that you want them to associate you with feeling comfortable, excited, having fun, etc. Not with feeling irritated, embarrassed, etc. 

I see that someone has already explained the issue of safety and privacy. That is an important point. Another issue is boundaries. A guy who tries to coax or pressure me into giving him my number isn't respecting my boundaries. Ask nicely once, that's fine. But a lot of guys persist or act entitled to it. It is seriously creepy and makes me wonder what else they will feel entitled to. Some guys just seem overly focused on getting the number and it indicates that they are just on the prowl. On the flip side, if a guy shows the consideration to give me his number instead, I give him bonus points in my book. It indicates to me that he thinks twice about how he treats people and respects me enough that he doesn't want me to feel obligated. 

It's harder to say no to giving out your number than guys may realize. I think most women have suffered some form of harassment from guys they have rejected. We've had guys turn nasty, even irate, at which point it is not only unpleasant but also a threat to our safety. So sometimes we make the decision to not deal with a possible confrontation by just giving you a fake number, or giving you our number knowing we will not answer the phone. This is what I mean when I say we feel pressured into giving the number. Even if you yourself are not pressuring her, the weight of her past interactions with difficult guys comes bearing down and creates a perceived pressure. 

Now, I mentioned that putting me on the spot creates awkwardness. It's more than that, though. When we meet guys who may ask us out on a date, they fall into one of three categories: yes, no, or maybe. This is true when guys gauge women, too. But I think the genders really differ in the way they decide on the ""maybe""s. The first difference is that women place more weight on the way the guy treats her whereas I think guys tend to look at the woman's personality more as an objective trait. So while a guy's main goal is to see if the woman is smart, nice, etc., the woman is primarily judging his personality based on how she feels around him. This is my theory, at least. Other people may disagree with me. So it's important that you don't put her on the spot and make her uncomfortable; it's important that you show that you're considerate. It *also* means sometimes we take a really long time to figure out if we like you enough to date you. We want to go home and think about the interaction. Whether we want to go out with you is based on whether we have a fluttery feeling later in the day because of talking to you. And that fluttery feeling often doesn't set in until later. So if you ask a woman out 5 minutes after meeting her, before she has digested the interaction, she may just say no to be on the safe side.  

Now the second difference in the way women and men handle ""maybe""s is how we define 'playing safe'. For men I suspect that to be on the safe side means that if a woman asked you out, you would give her a shot if she was at least attractive to you, especially if you talk to her for a while and seems nice. If she turns out not to be your type, then you can just walk away from it. So playing safe favors saying yes. For women, playing safe favors saying no. I shouldn't speak for all women, but it is always in the back of my mind when I am first getting to know a guy that if I get too wrapped into it before I know it's what I really want, then he could retaliate against me somehow if I try to pull out of the situation. Sure, I know that most guys are not rapists or stalkers, and women can be malicious or hard to get rid of, too. But the way our society tends to set up the dynamic, men get to steer the car and women get to push the break. Sometimes we feel like the only way to control the situation before it possibly gets out of hand is to push on the break. That's why if you give her the option to steer a bit, by giving her your number, it's a welcome bit of control. 

Sorry this is getting absurdly long. I just have one more thing to write. I think when you give a girl your number it is important that you interact with her and build a rapport beforehand. Just being handed a piece of paper out of the blue would be weird. Even if I thought you were attractive, I wouldn't know how to approach contacting you. In that sense I do like for guys to take the lead a bit. Make some small talk, make her laugh a bit, suggest a date idea, then write your number out and give it to her. I think that would be favorable to having it written out beforehand and making it seem too calculated. 

If you can't do that because the line is too long behind you, write her a funny note and your number ahead of time. (Avoid gushy romantic stuff. Funny doesn't mean you have to be witty, just creative/silly. Draw a picture or something.) Anyway, you still have to interact with her somewhat and make some flirty eye contact before you give it to her. Just be playful about it. You don't want her to think you are pathetically shy or something, even if you are.  

Sorry this is extremely long, ah."

bleeker_street,Advice,1389766809.0,"I'm going to post again, but this time from a more personal perspective and not from the point of view of an epidemiologist. 

If you're having outbursts of sadness it maybe means that you haven't processed some feelings. It doesn't have to be a big scary thing like death or an attack, it can be feelings around the stress of finals and finances, an ongoing issues in a relations - something like that. 

When we don't find outlets to deal with our feelings both in the form of expressing them and dealing with the underlying problem it's not like those feels go away - they are still there and will rear their ugly head when they get a chance. To quote John Green (TFioS) ""That's the thing about pain - it demands to be felt."" 

When I have had these issues in the past I would find myself having panic attacks when I was falling asleep, or super sad suddenly when I was trying to study the policy cycle. The solution for me to was to write down all the things that were bothering me.  To write about how I felt about all those things.  And then once or twice a week I would give myself permission to feel shitty for an hour.  For that hour I could cry, trash my room (within reason), write, sing, whatever I needed to do to express those emotions.  Then when the hour was over I'd take a shower and compose myself.  When I gave the feelings a space of their own they stopped trying to intrude on my time.  

The other thing I did was address the problems that I could deal with.  I talked to my boyfriend about the things that were bothering me.  I made a better budget and gave myself tools and tricks to keep it.  I made a study schedule and gave myself rewards for keeping to it.  This, then,  dealt with the underlying causes of a lot of my emotions (for me, stress), and so as each week passed I had less and less things I needed to vent.  Eventually I moved my venting sessions to an as needed basis instead of a weekly basis.  I don't know if that's going to help you or not, but I do know that it worked for me.  All the best, and best of luck. "

Unless they've pulled some sort of magical transistor made of a magical element not in the periodic table out of their ass, transistor degradation occurs faster at higher temperatures. Meanwhile you have a fan on there that's most likely rated along the industry standard to run for 50,000 hours at full load in 60°c. That's 5.7 years. And depending on the bearing and lubrication types, that fan will live a lot longer at full load in 60°c than it will at half load in 80°c. And when that fan does die, you can tear the cooler off the card and zip tie a 120mm fan to that heat sink.

I totally understand where you'd get the idea that it might be better to let the chip run hotter and the fan run slower. But it's simply not true. At all. In the slightest. Transistor degradation is a well studied phenomenon, and we know that they last longer when they run cooler."

About 30% of the time, it's already on Netflix so I obviously choose to watch it on Netflix to forego the charge. If your objective is streaming films, I honestly don't think you're going to come away with a big savings by switching exclusively to Amazon Prime. Eventually, you'll want to watch something that Prime has for a fee and end up renting it at $2.99 or buying for anywhere from $4.99-24.99 and those charges will be on top of your $79.99 annual fee.

thisisjustmyusername,nfl,1389767189.0,"1. Zach Miller- Not worthy of the contract, and never has been. He's being paid for his production as a receiver when he was with the Raiders. His contract is easily the worst on the team as we are paying a shit ton for someone who is primarily a blocking TE (and not a very good one at that). He is the highest paid TE IN THE FUCKING LEAGUE this season. 

2. Sidney Rice- This is another player we are paying a ridiculous amount of money to due to his performance elsewhere. The fact that we gave him this contract after he was coming off of injury is even worse. He has played 16 games only twice in his entire career and his only great season can be attributed to having one of the best of all time as his QB.

3. Russell Okung- Not the durable, dependable, and dominant replacement that we hoped would fill Big Walt's shoes but it would be unfair to expect anything that lofty out of Big Russ. He's lost time due to injury (thanks in part to [Trent Cole](http://www.nfl.com/videos/philadelphia-eagles/09000d5d824d3b7f/Cole-flips-Okung-draws-fine)) and frequently costs us with his false starts and holding penalties. He did have a pro bowl season in 2012 (for whatever that's worth) and seems to be pretty serviceable most of the time he's on the field, however. 

4. Marshawn Lynch- I would follow this dude into war. He's earned every cent of that contract by playing every snap as though it's his last. He will be remembered in this city for a long time."

We didn't mention specific considerations, nor encryption, nor relative privacy with common services, nor the complete lack of privacy you have simply by being online, nor the whole buffer of going through canonical, nor the length of duration for any logs, nor what information is kept in those logs, nor what use any of that information is. That is all stuff you'd only bring up when you get someone that wants to debate the issue. In context, this is just a guy answering another persons question about personal thoughts and beliefs.

As much as I feel up to the job of defending Canonicals position in the fight you seem to want to make, it's just not the time, place, or context that we should do it in. I'm quite obviously not going to convince you, by what you've siad so far I highly doubt you have any chance of convincing me, and not a single other person anywhere will ever see this to make it worthwhile.

Over the years, when its original intent was no longer needed it evolved into what many people now view as polygamy. Contrary to popular belief it is a very small percentage of the U.S population in very rural areas that practice active polygamy as it is illegal almost everywhere. (Including Utah where its biggest stereotype is found due to it being associated with Mormons.) I myself am not a member of the LDS church, but I am educated in American history, and anyone who would compare, or try to relate polygamy to LGBT rights is someone who is not burdened with an overabundance of intelligence.

bleeker_street,Advice,1389767610.0,"I don't think this can truly be called an infatuation -that's getting butterflies in your stomach.  This sounds like it has become an obsession and an unhealthy on at that since it is preventing you from living the kind of life you want to have (ie. moving on and meeting someone new).  

This isn't about if you're going to find a girl like her again because truth is, you don't know her.  You may feel like you do but given that you haven't spent time talking to her in the context of an actual relationship or friendship means that you don't know this girl.  You only know the version of her that lives in her head which is partially made up of her - the things you know about her, and your own imagination which has filled in the gaps.  And, as you said, because you've never really talked to her the gaps are many.  So she is mostly a creature of your own creation. 

So if it's not about this actual girl, what is it about?  I think that's going to be an important question for you to figure out the answer to.  You have to be getting something out of this obsession or your brain wouldn't be doing it.  Is it a sense of security like if you have this idea of her you don't have to risk it with real girls in the real world who could hurt you? Maybe not.  Maybe it has to do with boredom.  Maybe the obsession of a form of entertainment.  Maybe she represents something to you - youth, innocence, or something else.  Only you know what you are getting out of this obsession, but if you can figure that out you can figure out healthier ways of meeting that need than this. 

What is clear is that what started out an innocent high school crush is now interfering with your life, and so if you can't figure it out on your own, there is no shame in asking for help so you can move on.

Jedimastert,see,1389767748.0,"Sorry to be a grump, but please please to using the ""made in a lab"" vs. ""grows naturally"" argument. It literally means nothing.

You know what's ""made in a lab""? Penicillin, chemo-therapy (you know, the stuff that *actually cures cancer*) and hundreds if not thousands of vaccines that save the lives of millions of people. You know what ""grows naturally""? Fox-glove, blowfish, and thousands of poisonous plants and animals. Not to mention bears. I don't know if you know this, but bears, while they are completely natural, are not good for your health. Not to mention the fact that the term ""natural"" vs ""man-made"" is so arbitrary and fuzzy that it's completely meaningless.

In short, saying something is ""made in a lab"" in no way means it's poisonous or harmful and saying something ""grows naturally"" does **not** mean it's safe and harmless. Saying so makes you (and the cause you're arguing for) look stupid and pretty much negates anything else you have to say about it.

Also, just because no one's overdosed on it doesn't mean no one's died from it. Studies have shown that cannabis impairs reflexes and hurts reaction times, which leads to a much higher probability of accidents.

I'd love for marijuana to be legalized everywhere, and I do think it's much less harmful than things such as alcohol, but saying it's ""harmless"" is a bit of a misnomer."

WeaklyDominant,AskReddit,1389767750.0,Loud noises?
p3ndulum,TheRedPill,1389767757.0,"Neither you or OP are necessarily wrong, but what I think what you're missing is the fact that men come from an **active** and **strategic** world view and women from a **passive** and **responsive** world view.

So, for example, when a guy asks a woman for relationship advice, what he's really asking is ""what are the things that I can *do* so that I can (effectively) [have sex with you]?""

Because a woman is passive and responsive, having almost no idea what it's like to have a strategic mind, her experience tells her that all a person needs to do is just *be themselves* and a relationship will just *happen* to them - because that is generally how relationships happen to *them*.

When a woman is approached by a man she is attracted to, to her it just feels like the a Hollywood, reached-for-the-taxi-door-handle-at-the-same-time moment, where this Prince Charming just popped up out of nowhere and *boom*, there's chemistry - and a great romantic story to tell her friends. That's why they hate ""creeps"" - because they're not capable of giving her a fairy tale love story encounter. And that's why she hates pick-up artists and Red Pillers, because - at least in her mind - they/we're not ""being [ourselves]"" or being ""natural"".

When a woman is giving a man relationship advice, she is effectively trying to tell him ""just have the universe align you in a completely organic and natural 'romanitic' situation with a woman whose friends will think you're the perfect guy"", because that's what *she* wants to experience (solipsism).
Because her worldview is *passive* and *receptive*, she doesn't understand that a man is looking for step-by-step owner's-manual-like instructions on how to get a woman to fuck him. To her, either a man is just *plugged in* or he isn't - and if he's looking for instructions, he must be undeserving of it or broken in some way (a ""creep""). She would say ""just be yourself"" because, d'uh, that's what all the guys she dated did and it worked out fine for *them*. (More solipsism.)

From OP's title: ""A woman can not tell you how to proceed."" **That's strategy, and women are followers by nature and don't know how to lead/can't wrap their minds around the concept from a strategic perspective.** ""She can only tell you what she want to experience."" **That's because of her passive/receptive worldview. She can't tell you how to create the experience she wants to experience, she can only tell you what she wants it to look or feel like for HERSELF.**

This is why women become irrational/passive-aggressive. When their realities don't match what they want it to look or feel like, they begin to play the role of the victim - because they only see the world from a passive/receptive point of view, which what OP's translations are trying to illustrate.

To build on what OP said about when she says ""I'm a good person"", what she's (not) saying is ""I want you to *think* that I'm a good person because 'good' people are treated better and people like them, and that's how I want *you* to deal with *me* so then that may become my reality.""

She very well could be a *terrible* person, but because (again) she is passive/receptive, she can only follow your lead, not having any real clue how she might act in the future (good or bad) because she won't know until she has actually responded and then had a chance to reflect. (Even though her ""hampster"" will always rationalize that she didn't do anything wrong/it wasn't her fault/she was just the passive victim who was taken advantage of.

In the case of ""I want to be independent"", what she is really (not) saying is ""I want to be *thought as*, as well as *spoken to* as if I'm independent, even though I actually rely on the state/other men - whether it be financial aide or just by them playing along/not suggesting otherwise.""

Women basically spend their entire lives in fairy tale/make believe mode - it's like everything is a game of dress-up, with the hair and make-up, always ""pretending"" on some level, but don't really know it.

""Pretend"" is their reality.

""Women and men are equal.""

""If men can do it, we can, too.""

High heels, push-up bras, breast implants, fake eyelashes, often being referred to - and even regularly referring to themselves as ""princesses"".

So when they are communicating with men, especially, it's always from a place of ""I want you to play along.""

And as soon as you're *not* playing along, they *feel* like you're no fun, or a ""loser"", or a ""creep"", or a misogynist.

They are a princess, after all, there'd *have* to be something wrong with *you* if you didn't like her or agree with her or validate her for some reason or in some way.

And therein lies the difference between men and women.

Men mean what they say, and women say what they want to feel or experience, ala OP's post.

""You must be a woman-hating misogynist if you don't agree with feminism, because women are passive/receptive, so anything that you don't like about them must be because of something you or (probably) other men have done. So it's *you* who needs to change, not women.""

It's why just about everything men say and do is ""sexist"" or why they don't like it when men have an opinion about women - it's because it's often out of line with the fairy tale they want you to create for them.

It's also why they enjoy flirting so much. Flirting is always suggestive and vague and indirect.

Anyway, this has just turned into a stream of consciousness because I keep having epiphanies while I write this, so I'll just end it here.

**Edit** thank you for the gold."

madhjsp,nfl,1389767890.0,"&gt; I think Whisenhunt is a better coach than scout. 

Possibly. I just went back to read up on the Kolb trade, and it does appear that Whiz was behind it at least in some capacity. He clearly talked up Kolb to be the starter in 2011 and 2012, but injuries in both years forced him to make do for much of those seasons with the Lindley/Skelton combo (with a dash of Hoyer). So whether or not Kolb was the correct first choice, the point is that I think it still might not be fair to say he's an awful coach without the right QB if he coached most of those 2 seasons without his preferred QB at his disposal. 

I will point out, though, that he said several times in his introductory press conference today that he will work with the GM and defer to him with regards to assessing the QB situation in 2014. He also talked about how everything that happened in Arizona, good and bad, was a learning process for him, and that he hoped to build on that in running this team. Probably classic coach-speak, but maybe there's some truth to that, too.  

For Jake Locker's shortcomings, I still think he's a better QB (when healthy) than anyone that Whisenhunt worked with in Arizona post-Warner. So whether or not Jake is the guy in 2014, I don't think Whiz is as set up to fail this year as some people are making him out to be. "

ernestborgnine2013,PlusSize,1389767989.0,"An exercise series that gets people to participate in a 6 month challenge - not for weight loss but for general health. I lost a dress size or two by walking while dealing with a back and knee injury, but to me the more important benefits of regular walking have been a more peaceful outlook on life. I wouldn't have been as successful if I didn't have walking buddy, however. 

Over the years, what I learned about myself is that I like participating in challenges that are not too complicated - as soon as it gets to be too complicated or doesn't sustain for long enough, I check out. I am thinking about exercise pieces in magazines here - I hate seeing articles on how to get a better bum for example. Or things they do at work where you track your eating and exercise and meditating for points.

But if I saw an article where several readers were profiled in an exercise series, e.g. challenged to walk for at least 60 min twice a week, I would be interested in following their success. What worked and what didn't. 

I would also be interested in fashion for exercise for plus size women. It's something I am always struggling with. I have had to buy men's workout pants a few times.

Another topic could be exercise secrets of plus-size models. That was something I was trying to find recently.

Again, this exercise series would need to be about quality of life, instead of major weight loss. I can find a hundred and one other magazines that will tell me that."

Careful: I encounter a lot of people who believe they're truly this objective, when they're usually just mistaking a lot of opinions for facts. You're constantly forced to make choices, and on some level, most of these are based on subjective priorities or preferences. What are you going to eat for dinner? You'll probably choose something you enjoy eating (taste), or you'll choose something convenient (subjective valuation of your time), or you'll choose something inexpensive (subjective valuation of money versus gustatory satisfaction). Watching TV? Reading a book? Playing video games? Every one of these activities involves some subjective element. The moment you step out of bed in the morning, you've made a choice; it's inescapable. The nearest you can come to being ""completely objective"", as far as I can tell, is recognizing when objectivity ends and personal preference begins."

mundabit,TrollXChromosomes,1389768130.0,"I grew up with a rather severe case of vulvodynia that I am now only just overcoming, so I didn't really have an option to use tampons. I'm starting to use sponges and I agree, they are much more comfortable than the socks/washable pads due to the lack of bulk. But growing up I found the soft wool socks were better for my pain than the disposable pads, there was no risk of an accidental Brazilian wax, they don't bunch up/roll over or 'fluff' up and sitting on them was like sitting on a pillow rather than sitting on a firm wad of paper.

But if you love tampons for the lack of bulk, freedom of movement and 'not sitting in your mess', you wont enjoy washable pads of any design. I recommend looking into sea sponge tampons if you want an alternative to disposable tampons. Washable cotton tampons are also made, but they have a higher TSS risk compared to sponges. (sponges TSS risk is lower than normal disposable tampons)

and as always, an alternative to pads and tampons is the menstrual cup, I failed when it came to mine, so I can;t really say much on it, but /r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide  has [lots of discussions](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/search?q=cup&amp;restrict_sr=on) on the cup."

CheekyLittleCunt,magicTCG,1389768158.0,"The idea about a board wipe in yugioh is it punishes a player for overextending. 

Overextending is when you use a lot if not all of your resources to put a lot of monsters or a really strong monster on the field. This can be bad because if your opponent gets through this field, you have no plays left; you've used up all your cash. You have maybe 1 card in hand to your opponent's 5. 

We actively encourage field wipes because it keeps players from overextending, which is bad. Knowing your opponent can have a Mirror Force or Torrential tribute set or a Dark Hole in their hand plays mind games on you. It makes you think about your moves more clearly. It means you play more *conservatively* and the game is slowed down into many turns instead of just players trying to brute force each other. Always knowing the risk of your opponent holding a Dark Hole means that you're careful of what you commit to the board, as you know summoning too much leaves you at risk to getting them ALL destroyed and losing out big time on Card Economy. It forces you to play a slower-paced, skill intensive grind game, which is much like Magic in a way. 

Also, in yugioh its much easier to return from a field wipe. Even if your field is cleared, having sufficient cards in your hand can build up that field again. You can bring all that back in one turn. For example, if I drew a six card hand that allows me to summon 5 monsters, I'll only summon 2 in that turn. I'll let my opponent use his one-per deck dark hole that he luckily drew, and then next turn I'll summon my remaining 3, knowing I'm safe from Dark Hole for the rest of the duel. 


Field wipes, believe it or not, are healthy for yugioh, as it keeps people from playing too reckless. They're not even that broken, last format Dark Hole was rarely played at all, especially amongst the top-tier decks. "

DontRunReds,alaska,1389768385.0,"I think a bigger issue than making housing more abundant is making sure it meets some basic standards.  When I was renting in a different town than where I lived now I had a lot of trouble with bad landlords.  I had a pretty good landlord in my last apartment, but the others were so bad.  Two had mold, one with a very disgusting amount of it.  One had a leaky ceiling, which my landlord denied having prior knowledge about -- but the previous tenant also documented reporting it -- so I reported them.  

They wonder why they have problems getting young people to stay.  For my partner and I affording the place wasn't the issue as we both had decent jobs. But I guess we expected that when you plunk down $1000 a month or more for rent you expect to have a somewhat attentive landlord.  

Screw all the substandard housing in this state.  It's all a product of that low vacancy rate.  Landlords know they've got the upper hand and a lot of cities &amp; towns are afraid to take action because that could result in taking a few units off the market lowering the vacancy rate even further.

rising_son,Guitar,1389768396.0,"Various ways, some more complicated than others. Usually for guitar riffs it's pretty easy to tell. Yours for example is in Drop D, so will probably be using D as the tonic (first note of the scale, also incidentally the name of the particular key), by looking at the notes you played and listening I can deduce the key. You had a couple of C#'s in there (Major 7th of D) and F#   (Major 3rd of D), also B (Major 6th) so if I cross reference that to the possible scales of D and end up with D Major. No ""outside"" notes just notes of Diatonic D major.

It just comes with learning the notes of the fretboard, learning the keys and their scales, and using both of those areas of knowledge in improvisation and transcription. Eventually the string names and fret numbers melt away, and you are left thinking in terms of notes. For example when you said ""hammer on to 5 on the top string"", I would be thinking ""play open D on the 6th string and hammer on to G at the 5th fret"""

Dinaroozie,FeMRADebates,1389768482.0,"My gut instinct is that there are too few factual questions that have a consensus that spans feminism *and* the MRM. Definition questions might fly (what's the difference between sex and gender?) but anything based on real-world facts seems bound to run into trouble (What's the pay gap between men and women?).

Something that might be worth doing would be stuff like asking questions about a movement, rather than gender itself. Like maybe: ""What's a major point of debate in modern feminism? (a) Pro-life versus pro-choice (b) Pro- versus anti-prostitution or (c) Pro- versus anti-gun"". Although now that I write that out... I feel like the answer would be (b), but there are probably lots of pro-life feminists out there, not to mention those who consider gun ownership a means of empowerment against physically stronger males.

I'd lean towards questions about how a side defines something, rather than seeking out some 'true' definition. For instance, you can ask ""What is meant by the term 'apex fallacy'?"" or ""What is meant by the term 'benevolent sexism'?"" without asking the test-taker to accept that these are concepts with merit. It's still hard to judge what terms are actually in common usage without asking some kind of establishment - for instance, academic institutions - which might run into trouble simply because there are so many more feminists than there are MRAs.

Out of curiosity, what are some of the things that your nemesis/jerkface was being uninformed about? That might serve as a good place to start."

&gt; Asian guys here have actually told me ...

...

&gt; But if you choose to not explore the Asia option based on the advice of Asian guys, then you deserve to miss out.

You must be referring to TRPsubmitter or RedSunBlue.

It sounds like you fear that they are *""trying to hide 'their girls' from you.""* It's a silly concern, and if you must know, RSB was actually encouraging guys to go to Japan and try picking up girls there. I remember this clearly because I actually had a big fucking argument with him in that thread.

I know you edited your post and made it much more mellow, but the point needs to be made anyway. Racism works against you. 

Sure, there are some girls for which casual/benevolent prejudice works in your favour. For the vast majority, it's not working in your favour. 

Let's look at it from the very top to get an idea why. Those ""HB10's"" you talked about in that other thread. They actually know they are hot stuff and often pretty vain. They are called net idols, FZLs, ulzzangs and a whole bunch of other terms online. Ulzzangs/Eoljjang = ""good looking / best face"". You'll rarely see them with their boyfriends and pretty much never with a white guy. Why? Because they *know* their fanbases. They love the adoration. They know how to get it. And they know how they could lose it.

Let me explain, there's this idea that I often hear around here *""black guys are extra masculine and can hook up with white girls easy""*... but just fucking look at some of the comments we sometimes see here. Just a while ago, I saw this one: *""Once you go black, we don't want you back.""*

That's the kind of hostile attitude these girls deal with. Not just white girls, Asian ones as well. Men are not perfect beings, and I think a lot of people here forget that because we're so busy trashing on women all the time. A lot of us *men* are petty and jealous people. We show that in this sub, implicitly, all the time. 

These top level girls *know* they will lose a lot of SMV by dating foreigners. They're socially aware and practiced. 

trplurker, the white guy in Korea who responded before, is spot on with his insight. We shouldn't trivialize the problems white guys in Asia and black guys in the US have to deal with. 

So once again, racism overall is not your friend. It doesn't help people like you who are interested in interracial relationships. If we could magically erase the benevolent racism along with the hostile one, I guarantee you that you'd be better off.

&gt; Asian girls are often more feminine than other women, and they have some of the best personalities among girls anywhere - assuming you're looking in the right places; not affluent urban skank hives like Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

Maybe this sub spends so much time and effort bashing Western women that every other group of women look better? Look, I don't mean to dash your dreams, but the stuff that gets bitched about here, like hypergamy, is way fucking worse in Asia.

Here, in the US, I just hear snarky comments about ""materialistic girls"" or ""gold-diggers"" once in a while. In Asia, I've seen entire damned villages ruined by hypergamy. Abandoned by women who didn't think twice about leaving friends, family, and fiances behind to find better men and better lives in bigger cities.  They know they have this social mobility. The HB10s you're looking for will be fought for by not just mere wealthy white collar people, but gold collar and red collar elite.

Yes, you mentioned that supposedly this only happens in major metropolises like Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, etc... but it just so happens that these places tend to be the most cosmopolitan (likelihood of English fluency). The further away you go from top-tier cities, the less people understand English. The English translations on maps/pamphlets, on store windows... everything in general just starts to make less and less sense.

A lot of these ""feminine Asian girls with great personalities"" aren't going to give you the time of day either if you can barely even communicate with them and already make it obvious that you just want to jump into their pants. If they DO let you do that, then don't you think those specific individuals are being just as promiscuous as the Western girls that people love to bash here?

I'm not trying to discourage you. The last time some guy got the great idea to go to Asia, I encouraged it. There's a lot of opportunity. But he wasn't *just* going for sexual tourism. That alone might not be worth the effort. It's better to have other plans, goals, stuff in mind too. E.g. a lot of weaboos that go to Japan don't *just* go for the Japanese girls, they generally like various aspects of the culture (anime and shit).

**TL;DR:** One, racism isn't working in your favour. Two, if you like Asian girls, fine, but keep it real."

Hiding_in_the_Shower,AskReddit,1389768627.0,"What /u/Lucky_Bastard63 said below is correct. Curfew and other such restrictions on travel are perfectly valid in cases where people would potentially have to come in and save you because of your reckless decision to hypothetically break curfew. The restrictions are there not only for your safety, but for the safety of the people who would have to come help you.

As for possesion of illegal weapons, it doesn't matter the states rules, there a ban on all assault weapons, not to mention convicted felons carrying weapons they're not allowed to. The crimes themselves are victimless but that doesn't mean owning an illegal assault weapon or carrying a weapon you're not allowed to carry couldn't potentially lead to a future crime with a victim.

Again, I agree prohibition is stupid. But the fact remains that there are still illicit drugs being smuggled into the country. And that means the laws will be enforced. This is widely known, and anyone smuggling drugs is - for the time being - a criminal, and adding to the violence.

This is wrong. The climate dynamics of the Medieval Warm Period do not resemble the current warming trend or expected future warming trends.

&gt; modern idea of global warming is false because there's no precedent

Here you're wrong on multiple levels. Firstly, you're wrong because there is some evidence (data resolution isn't good enough to be certain) for instances of rapid warming (prior to humans as we know them, if I remember correctly), so you don't know that it's entirely unprecedented. Secondly, you state that it's similar to the MWP, so you believe that it is in fact precedented. Thirdly, the idea that something unprecedented cannot happen is ridiculous. The uniqueness of the event in human history is what makes it so alarming.

keakealani,Hawaii,1389768652.0,"Haven't been to all that many states, but I like Washington a lot (I was born there although my family moved back home when I was an infant, so it has a special place in my heart) and especially northern California (also have a lot of family out there). A special shout out for BC even though it's not a US state, because it's friggin gorgeous and Canadians really are so damn nice, it's not just a stereotype. (Okay maybe it is but I really enjoy visiting so whatever.) 

Living in Texas now, I can definitely say it's my least favorite state so far, although I don't have much experience with the midwest/southwest. 

It's hard to talk about this without making a distinction about visiting vs. living in a place, too. There are lots of places I enjoyed visiting (like New York City) but would never want to live (nowhere in my life has Hawaii rent felt cheap). I actually just came back from Vegas and while it was an interesting experience it really wasn't for me, although I can see how others would enjoy it. But I can definitely say I wouldn't want to live there - even if I could avoid the strip completely, I think the culture would eventually get to me. 

But, all that being said, it's basically just about different cultures and attitudes. Obviously, west coast shares more in common culturally with Hawaii since there's a lot more interaction and cultural exchange. Plus, the ethnic makeups are more similar, which itself creates some cultural similarities. And of course, politically Hawaii is a blue state - I hate calling it ""liberal"" but certainly Hawaii's values are not, for the most part, conservative, which generally means that it shares fewer political and social values with traditionally red states. But some people certainly have different values and cultural leanings, so they would probably feel differently. 

I also would like to think that I'd get along well with other indigenous peoples, as I think Hawaiians could benefit from hearing the stories of other indigenous people (although I wholly disagree with treating them identically in policy, but that's a separate discussion entirely). That's not really a matter of which state, though, since many states have large and active Native communities. "

audreyshake,sex,1389768718.0,"Oh, I just meant like snuggling with you or kissing you while you do yourself.

My other advice would be to try making masturbation more fulfilling. Block out a bit of time—say, at least twenty minutes—go lie down, and pleasure yourself. Touch more than your genitals. Don’t focus on reaching orgasm; just enjoy the sensations you’re feeling at the moment. Slow down. When you get close, back off for a minute, catch your breath, rub your thighs, touch your face. Repeat until you simply can’t stop yourself from finishing. Masturbating just to get off is rarely satisfying."

tangerinelion,intj,1389768728.0,"No need to say ""You're wrong"" or anything like that.  Now as the INTJ it's a ""me vs you"" situation.  You say he feels like you're attacking his character?  If you say ""*you're* wrong"" you really just emphasized the fact that he, in particular, is incorrect.

Now the thing is that INTJs just want to know what's right.  We're OK with being wrong, we're OK with changing our position.  If you can prove it.  I typically hold myself and my opinions as two distinct things.  You want to attack only the opinion/position/etc.  INTJs won't typically admit that you can hurt their feelings, but really it's quite easy to do this.  (On the other hand, if you ever suspect an INTJ is trying to offend you, you have nothing to worry about.  If we want to offend/hurt you, we can do a great job of that.)

So, I suggest phrasing this as a ""Help me understand"" kind of discussion.  ""OK, so I'm with you up to this part but then I can't get from there to your next step.  I have this instead.""  At this point he'll either explain his position and perhaps you'll realize you're wrong - this is good if you actually were wrong as you have now saved yourself from claiming he was wrong.  If, however, he is wrong then you can start picking apart the explanation offered.  ""I'm not familiar with your reasoning here, can you show me what you used to do that?""  

TL;DR: Make him prove to himself that he is wrong but don't say ""you are wrong"" because that changes it from a discussion about the problem to a discussion about him."

bleeker_street,Advice,1389768950.0,"First off, I don't know the best way to phrase this so I really don't mean this in an offensive way.  Text isn't always the best medium. 

I think it is so much easier for the younger person (especially when in their teens and early twenties) not to see age as a factor because for them it isn't.  Because of the way our brains are developed at that time we kind of all think that we are super advanced and mature for our ages.  We also see ourselves as basically adults that think like adults but that's only because we lack the development and experience to know otherwise.  It's a very natural thing, and not wrong or unusual. So from your perspective I'm not surprised that the age wasn't a factor.  Your relationship sounds way more normal than the crush on a 35 year old that I had at 17, and was totally convinced that it would work, btw. 

The thing is, that after around 25 that sort of thinking should diminish.  It's hard to imagine that someone who is 27 wouldn't at the very least be aware of the age difference in the context of: social pressure, maturity, stages of life, and interests.  What I mean by that is that even the most well rounded, mature for her age 17 year old is less mature than a mentally normal 27 year old.  The effects of exposure to working, paying bills, more relationships, possible education, and other 27 year old friends will make that maturity difference obvious to the 27 year old.  

Then, the stages of life: having graduated high school and maybe college, needing to save for a mortgage, thinking about potential marriage and children,  maybe a career path or international travel are all normal stage of life issues for a 27 year old. Stage of life issues for a normal 17 year old are more like doing well on the SATs, getting into a ""good"" school, getting a summer job, texting Sarah because she totally got super fucking wasted last Saturday and broke up with Steve OMG right? And that's okay, and good even because that what is supposed to be happening at 17, but it would be next to impossible for the 27 year old to miss those differences. 

Interests are a bit more mixed because at 17 I thought I was sooooo deep because I listened to Chopin and my favourite book was the Bell Jar, but a more well rounded picture of me would have also included a list of things like: hating capitalism, deeply caring about the song meanings behind Wonderwall and She Will Be Loved, getting Lance Havercamp to notice me, and trying out every style in my book of 100 different ways to wear your long hair.  I was into more or less typical 17 year old girl things.  Years later, my interests have changed, as they should.  And we talk about what we're interested in so it's hard not to notice the gap.  So I don't think that he could have overlooked those things. 

If you want to take the positive spin say he noticed those things but you're this fucking cool ass chick, with a kick ass personality, a good heart, and he decided fuck it - she's too cool not to be with. 

If you want a more nuanced approach - there were differences because the ages that he either didn't notice because he is not a mentally mature typical 27 year old, or that he did notice but chose to ignore for a myriad of reasons but ultimately it ended up okay because you grew because of those experiences, and don't have any particularly negative feelings about it. 

Or, if you want, you can take the negative outlook and say he fully knew what he was doing and took advantage of the situation because coed sex.  

It's really your choice how you want to look at it, and you're partners future, present, and past shouldn't dictate that for you. "

FreedomCow,truegaming,1389769254.0,"&gt;Well nobody is stopping anybody from creating games catered to women.

This is said all the time (usually by people who don't work in the industry) and it's just not true.  While smaller indie companies are not as tied up in marketing politics and are more free to create what they like, even things that go against the grain, bigwigs at larger companies often refuse to break away from things that have worked in the past, or believe are what worked, because they put a lot of money into those projects and need to see even more money return from it. [By believing that women are not a worthy audience to consider and creating stories and characters that alienate female players and marketing it as such, they don't really allow the possibility of growing a female fanbase.](http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed) It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Don't dismiss this as being a minor issue of just a few studios having problems. The biggest companies that produce video games are the ones that will have the biggest audiences and the greatest reach to players, where smaller, more flexible studios will have fairly little exposure in comparison - enough to succeed financially perhaps, but not create the sort of titles people think of when someone says ""video games"" out loud. These big companies are in many ways setting the standards of success that many others will attempt to recreate, and are also taken as representation of video games as a whole. If the biggest selling titles that are the most marketed and advertised are always the ones that have women as tertiary characters with little depth, that won't be taken as just one studio's games. 

I'm going to quote a game artist I really admire, Claire Hummel, from a discussion on this subject in an old post on her [Tumblr accouny](http://shoomlah.tumblr.com/post/48773415680/mukuo-characterdesign101-welcome-to):

&gt;*Look, I have to deal with this nonsense every day.  I have to deal with producers and art directors nitpicking a female character’s body to the point of optimum sex appeal.  [INSERT FEMALE CHARACTER HERE] is too hippy, her features are too broad, can we make her skin lighter, why isn’t she more feminine, but she should have heels, etc, etc.  And I work at a company that is generally pretty good about this sort of stuff!  The fact that I still see it, the fact that I go home from work with migraines trying to argue with these people, shows that there’s a significant problem in the industry.*

In a [more recent post](http://shoomlah.tumblr.com/post/58341711816/bridgioto-theredmages-bridgioto-in-cases) in a different conversation, she also said this in regards to game developers following the White Hero Dude formula:

&gt;*""But consumers don’t buy [x] so developers don’t make [x] so consumers don’t buy [x] so developers don’t make [x]!"" is some seriously cyclical logic.  Step back and listen to yourself.  If there were games out there not driven by white, male, 30-something scruffy dudes, I would buy them up in a second- but there aren’t.  You can’t preemptively assume that games wouldn’t do well without white male protagonists just because that’s been the status quo for decades.*

People aren't just attacking games and criticizing things they don't like for fun, and those criticisms aren't just empty words. I don't have the resources to make a giant successful game on my own, nor do I know people who do, but that doesn't somehow invalidate what I say when I say ""I don't like something for [X] reason,"" and think that's something that should change. I have a right to expect better and to ask for it, and and a right to complain when those expectations are let down and ignored. Saying ""use your wallet as a form of protest!"" is tired and ineffective because those big companies have the marketing power to succeed, especially since many of those games are otherwise very good and still fun, and I could easily see that form of ""protest"" being brushed off as more of ""girls don't game"" anyway. They'll still make lots of money and not really consider how much more they could have made if they consider the missed audience insignificant."

Neopopulas,dayz,1389769263.0,"Because the engine or the mechanics or rendering it might not be able to adequately tell you, visually, what happened. Having text is just the mechanics, the computer, the game telling you what you're seeing.

Games like this can't render absolutely every required detail and sometimes you need to accept information in a meta, technical way.

I think people need to chill out and realise that not everything about this game has to be ridiculously hard. Hard, yes, but not hard for the sake of being hard. Hard as immersion, but if you can't manage immersion or ""realism"" then you might have to accept something a little more technical.

Some things the game just simply will not be able to tell you in a visual, intuitive way, and just NOT having that information makes the game arbitrarily hard for no realistic reason.

Edit: This isn't entirely aimed at you and i apologies if i come of aggressive, i've just had a lot of arguments with people who can only yell about how everyone wants the game to be harder and anyone who wants any more information or to make the came more accessible is some pussy who can't play hard games and should go back to playing (insert insultingly kiddy game here). Its not always about the game being EASIER, its just about it being more accessible and giving you the information you should have instead of going 'oh well, you can't have that information because its *hardcore*

The heat inside the transistor is way higher than 95°c, but is relatively lower if you can keep the temperature of the chip down. And with the transistors cooler, they will wear down slower. I'm not saying you would necessarily have problems with the cards lasting 5 years running 24/7 at 95°c, because I don't have the specific numbers. But they will *certainly* run for longer if you turn the fan up. Even the fans will run better. 

Also, please explain to me what these paragraphs from AMD and PCGamer, both targeted at gamers who are concerned with things like noise, have to do with running the cards under full load, 24/7, for years? Because the way I see it, it says absolutely nothing about the nature the cards are run at when litecoin mining.

I said learn the names of the country. You know them in English, right? Why can't you, from the moment you learn them, just learn their original pronunciations? We're talking about roughly 200. And even then, there are people who don't know the 200 ""basic"" countries there are. 50 is fine. Heck, some people only know 10. 

And well, saying to someone ""Pfft you're just pretentious"" isn't exactly a smart argument. You're trying to put someone down for no reason.

And this is not even an insult: But are you that uneducated that you can't read? That's all this is about. Reading and learning roughly 200 words in their original transliterated (Keyword) languages. I do not need to prove anything to you because you can do the same thing!!! You can read! We just won't have the same damn accent. You can read Rossiya, can't you. Or Medīnat Yisrā'el. Zhōngguó is the toughest one because ""Zh"" does not exist in English, but your brain is smart enough to figure out something.  How about Sverige and Repoblikan'i Madagasikara? Can you read those words that are written in from of you with this oh so familiar alphabet? That's transliteration. Now imagine if someone did this with all the names of all the countries in their original language (though there are some exceptions, granted). Would you still be able to read LATIN ALPHABET? Even if the words you're saying are not of Germanic/Latin origin? It's not that amazing.

How bad, honestly, how does it really ruin the game, or immersion, if i hit the tab screen and see a little bar that shows i'm half full? 

What is wrong with this bar? Is it because its a bar? What if it was a little tab that SAID ""half full"" or ""Not hungry"" or ""full?""

What if, instead of only getting messages when i'm in an extreme, there was a little bar in the tab screen that said ""Tired"" or ""Exhausted"" or something like that?

I ask, because you're in the tab screen. Its not a HUD, you don't have to look at it if you don't want to and, honestly, if you're in the inventory screen, you're already destroyed all your immersion already, just having an inventory screen at all is far more ruinous to immersion than having something that comes up and tells me, in plain English, what i would instinctively know about my body.

Getting a random message saying i'm hungry, when i'm already WELL and truly hungry, isn't immersion, its hiding information for the sake of what? To make the game harder? I'm all for making the game hard, but hiding instinctive, intuitive information from me doesn't make the game immerse, it makes the game vague.

Thats what i just can't understand, and i'd love if you could tell me exactly what makes the game immersive for you, because people seem stuck on the idea that the game has to be super hard, and the only thing i can get from that, and what people seem to be telling me is that 'hard' means that game is *actively* working against you. It hides information, it keeps things vague and hard to understand, this is what makes the game 'hard' and thus 'good'.  

I don't understand why a game being vague, and hiding things from you, or making things hard on purpose is good. A hard game should be complex, it should be complicated and unforgiving, hiding things from you is a cheat, it makes the game arbitrarily hard, not because its hard, but because you don't have all the information you realistically SHOULD have. Its like saying poker is hard, but only if half the cards are hidden from you."

Ethnonationalism and ""HBD"" are actually favored here, not frowned upon. What I say are generalizations, true, but at least I KNOW they're generalizations unlike some people here. If you were actually interested in calling out ""racists"" on this sub then you could have found far jucier targets than myself.

Facepalm. I think you missed the whole point. First of all, I'm not even calling you out, even though you did espouse some ""benevolent racism"" (e.g. *""Asian girls are often more feminine than other women, and they have some of the best personalities among girls anywhere""*). Whether that is true or not is up for debate, of course.

Secondly, you misunderstood, because I'm saying ""racism in *general*"" (including that of *others*) is working against you. Did you completely miss the part where I said that top level girls in Asia care about their perceived SMV in their social circles and how that works against a lot of foreigners?

&gt; You obviously don't know what hypergamy means.

What the fuck are you talking about? What in my comment made you think I don't understand what hypergamy is?

This is what it means: *""Hypergamy (colloquially referred to as ""marrying up"") is the act or practice of marrying someone of higher caste or status than oneself.[1] Although the term is not gendered, it is generally used by social scientists to refer to women marrying higher-status men, rather than to men marrying higher-status women.[2]""*

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy

That is all. I'm not sure what the confusion or hostility is about, but I described the social mobility of women (marital social mobility, specifically) in Asia and how it was more pronounced than what I see in the west."

You've got two options really.  The first is to continue doing what you are doing.

You must learn to accept that you cannot control his behaviour, you can only control your own.  If he's after money he'll eventually realize this isn't working and move on and leave you alone. 

The other thing you can do is involve the police.  While you probably don't have grounds for a restraining order, you can ask the police to have a chat with him.  This will also put him on their radar so he'll be suspect number one if he did anything stupid (and would probably also deter him from trying anything stupid). Next time he's banging at the door and won't leave call the police.  I know it sucks to call the police on a parent, but I honestly think it's your best option here. "

TryUsingScience,pagan,1389770337.0,"It depends on the deity and the sort of the people doing the ritual. If you have a bunch of people with more power than experience who are calling up some war god from a pantheon none of them work with, it might end really badly. As in physical and emotional damage badly. If you have a bunch of people with no actual magic, probably not much will happen. If you have a bunch of people who are generally solid on their stuff calling up a typically beneficent deity probably everything will be mostly fine. But it's still not a risk I would want to take.

My primary patron is the Morrigan, but before she decided I was hers I worked with Apollo and he's still my buddy. Lately the Morrigan has thrown me at the Norse and specifically Odin. I tried to say no to him but found that I couldn't, because I was more interested in learning about the runes than I was in avoiding him. I do know people who've said no to him, but only a few. Well, only one. And she is very, very, *very* dedicated to her patron so when she tells other gods, ""sorry but my dance card is full,"" they listen."

It's acquired a bit of a reputation as a silly deck that shouldn't be underestimated.  While the build right now folds pretty hard to many combo lists (Belcher, ANT and TES especially), it has an even or favorable matchup against every fair deck I've played it against, including RUG and UR Delver, several Stoneblade variants, Maverick, Zoo, Punishing Lands, BUGstill, Nic-Fit, and more.  The only card it's really afraid of is Pernicious Deed.

Reasons I love my deck:

1. It's basically Bird Tribal

2. Eleven anthem effects (earlier builds had up to 15)

3. It mainboards both Armageddon and Humility

4. Turn 1 Chrome Mox into Crusade, Turn 2 Spectral Procession

Check it out, tell me what you think.  It's very easy to tweak around the shell and tune to any given meta and most of the options for it are dirt cheap.  Heck, at one point I was running Ajani Goldmane just for his -1 ability."

Now if you're a fast food chain or a restaurant, and you want to stock ice cream, but only have room for two or three flavours, you don't really care what everybodies favourites are, because you can't possibly stock them all anyways. Instead you find something plain enough that it's not going to be too sweet, too minty, too chocolatey, but pleasant enough that everybody can agree it's not too bad.

Some people like hard rock, some people like rap, some like [Newfoundland folk music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcHpVhxomY8) If you own and run a radio station you can't possibly play everybodies favourite genre, so you just play vanilla and people tune in because it's 'alright'.

These links may be helpful.  It's important that you let him know that he's not alone.  Over 5 million men in the USA are in or have been in abusive relationships, and the numbers are probably a lot higher because it's so under-reported.  It's also important that you tell him that there is no shame in it.  Many men who are battered end up battered because they are stand up men who don't believe in ever mistreating a woman, and don't necessarily know how to handle the situation or feel responsible in some way.   It is not a mark of weakness.  Nor is it a mark of weakness to get help.  Dealing with shit is hard, and takes strength and bravery.  Working through the fall out from the abuse will also make him a better person, future partner, and father in the future, and anyone willing to do that is a real man in my books. "

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1389770914.0,"I'm going to be honest. The drinking isn't helping.

I don't mean to seem like a prude, but alcohol is a depressant. It may bring your nerves down, but for some people it can also bring their mood down. That makes it harder to be patient.

But, I would not say to stop drinking now. Since you're interested in that, you should see a doctor first to see how dependent your body is on alcohol. Everybody's tolerance is different, and I'm sure you know that some people who quit drinking cold turkey died from extreme withdrawal.

I find I'm more patient when I put myself in the shoes of people who annoy me. I remember that we all fuck up for a myriad of reasons that may or may not be obvious. 

For example, my road rage has reduced tremendously over the years because when someone cuts me off or speeds up when they see me signaling to get in front of them, I think maybe that person has some place really important to go or is feeling sick. Reddit's take on it is ""assume that person really has to take a shit."" Whatever works."

I speak as a guy who came out of an environment where all forms of 'feminism' were considered evil, an affront to whatever was perceived as god, were what was wrong with society, blah blah blah dogma-diatribe et al.  I also saw what that sort of misogynist attitude can do to the females in a family and want no part of that nonsense... my sister and mother are some of the brightest and best of my family but were constantly made to feel like they somehow didn't measure up simply because they weren't born into the 'has a dick' club."

I spent a long time thinking about the ramifications of this life style up to and including if I would end up single forever, because I would be unable to find a partner that had CF desires as well. 

I get that women actually have to deal with the physical aspect of child birth, but when it comes to having children a man's roll gets widely ignored and overshadowed as a parent, and traditionally the bread winner. Now I don't personally subscribe to this line of thinking, but many people do. 

For me specifically its not a matter of one gender or the other. Being CF is a choice born from a desire for freedom of lifestyle. That is an idea that breaches gender gaps. Some people choose to look at it as consequences, but I think that's associating a negative connotation to something that is strictly personal choice.  "

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389771511.0,"Yes I have. We have super low taxes for the first world, and this would bring us roughly in line with a European structure. Also, a lot of people on the low end would pay less. If you make $40k, for example, you'll pay in $16k and get back $15k for a grand total of 2.5% tax."
pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389771513.0,"No, the only way I can see that being an issue is if it was clear that you bumped her on purpose. (For example, if you did it repeated times.)

I'm talking about cases where a guy touches a woman in a manner that is just not normal interaction - poking, tickling, pinching, petting, coming up behind her and wrapping your arms around her, etc. It becomes harassment if the girl tells you to stop and you don't.

The pacing in Frozen was awful. The first half was so long and boring. It picked up and got better in the end. But the music was just not good. Let it Go is a fantastic song. But the rest seemed like a bad broadway musical. Plus they beat you over the head with it in the opening 30 minutes. Like 4 or 5 bad songs. Lets turn mundane conversations into a song because its Disney. IMO very mediocre movie. If it didnt have the winter tie in I think the nobody would remember this movie in 5 years. But because it does Disney is going to merchandise the hell out of this every winter and beat us over the head with it in their parks. "

Rodalli,AskReddit,1389771616.0,"I think the problem is less about Ayn Rand or her writing, and more about her modern day fans. I'm talking about the whackos who wave her books in people's faces like some kind of bible, arguing with everyone, and making claims about how society would so much better if we would just &lt;insert thing that has been repeatedly proven to be disastrous public policy&gt;. It's usually really young people. College kids who are going all holier-than-thou-mode about their new-found philosophy, like they're the first person who ever read Atlas Shrugged and *really got it*.

I never had a problem with Ayn Rand until I had to talk to someone who was just a little too enthusiastic about her."
BuildMyPaperHeart,Warframe,1389771618.0,"&gt; does anyone know if this claim was actually true?

Probably not; however, with Trading allowing the use of Platinum as a bartering tool, it's possible that he found the means to replicate the resource. 

At the same time, perhaps he simply traded a lot and obtained a lot of Platinum. Also, if he sent a Ticket in about it, then he should have gotten a response (or at least waited for one) before posting about it.

&gt; anything about it getting fixed? 

If the OP of that thread indeed sent a Support Ticket, then it should be high on the priority list of bugfixes. If not, then this thread will at least open up some discussion about the glitch, and hopefully spread awareness of the exploit to DE so they can get it fixed.

Tomatomoon,WTF,1389771695.0,"I found the type of pump made and enormous difference in what I could produce... When my firstborn was having trouble nursing and had newborn jaundice, I rented an electric pump that made these horrid skreeching noises and stretch my boob out to scary proportions and I couldn't get anything but colostrum out. We were told to supplement, and we did , with an eye dropper sort of thing, and he got a bit stronger.  I tried pumping colostrum and giving it to him in a cup, and he figured that out. A couple days later, he luckily figured out how to latch on despite my cluelessness. The jaundice subsided... And he started his career as a champion nurser.

But the initial stress of the whole thing made pumping with that top of the line-industrial pump a no-go. Every time I would hear that noise, I would feel stressed and clench up. In order to store up milk, I tried three other kinds of pumps before I hit on the manual one that did the trick for me. I was super fortunate to live in a city with a lactation center that would let me rent different kinds of pumps. Buying them just to try for a few days and then toss away would have been cost prohibitive. But one I found what worked, it was a good investment.

This stuff is not always simple and straight forward, and all the anxiety about how much is being produced, and the ""stigma"" of supplementing can really interfere with ""production"". And what works for one person, doesn't always work for the next....image that, we are unique individuals!

I went on to nurse three more kids. The second and third both knew just what to do, latching on in the first hour. And my fourth? Well, it was like my first all over again, it took her a while to get the hang of it, but she had the benefit of her oldest brothers tribulations, and after a while ( and some necessary supplementing) she and I got into a groove.

Ugh, didn't mean to write an essay, just wanted to say, there is no one right way to do this mothering/parenting thing... And what works for one mom, doesn't always work for another, and what works for one kid, doesn't always work for another.... We are messy and complicated individuals!
