balathustrius,mead,1390058592.0,"In beer, there are unfermentable sugars, so FGs will be above 1.000. You add priming sugar so the yeast that remain in suspension have something to eat after bottling, causing renewed fermentation and, as a byproduct, carbonation.

With mead, you will generally have fermentation potential as long as sugar remains, that is while your gravity readings are above 1.000. Even if a mead stops and clears at 1.005, unless you stabilize it, there is a possibility that fermentation will start again. That's what happened with my cherry melomel.

To intentionally carbonate mead, you can use whatever fermentable sugar source you want. Lots of people use honey, but priming sugar is probably easier to dial in to the right amount without getting any bottle bombs. To figure out how much to add, Google ""priming sugar calculator"" or something similar. There are quite a few web-based tools to help you figure out how much to add, but the [Northern Brewer tool](http://www.northernbrewer.com/priming-sugar-calculator/) is particularly slick. 

All of this assumes that your mead was completely dry on bottling day. And if you bulk aged for a long time, it's not a bad idea to add a pinch of some high tolerance yeast.

Be aware of the maximum pressure your bottles and closures are designed to withstand. Normal wine corks won't take hardly any pressure without dislodging. 12 oz beer bottles with crown caps can handle around four atmospheres maximum; 3.5 is the safer limit to assume. Champagne bottles with champagne corks + wire or crown caps can take somewhat more.

Edit: You can also carbonate with a keg and pressure system, just like beer. That's the *only* way to get carbonated sweet mead. Exception: bochet, but that's another post."

My financial situation is a tad tight right now (read, living on $150 every two weeks after bills), and the idea of him being really sick like mom's kitty just... I'm nervous.

It was a very quick recovery and helped with some of his behavioral problems (namely jizzing in shoes but that's a tale all it's own).

Considering it's a damp environment in most shaving areas, double headed nails might also be good. You should be able to get a hold of ones with a little stopper in the middle - then you just hammer the wood down with a rubber hammer. Maybe look at some additional support like an additional angle brace or two on the underside of the arm? Also, it'd be good to do the sanding where the pieces meet after assembly. That way you get a nicer edge between them. Other than that, there's just the small aesthetic issue of having certain pieces with nice rounded edges, and then a block of straight lines in the middle. And there might be some use in small rubber feet (preferably ones that nail in) on the underside to stop the wood from soaking up water. The rounding and edge work looks fantastic!

FmMan3,leagueoflegends,1390059121.0,"In theory it does yes, and I'd definitely like to see Riot trial it. The only issue, really, is player numbers. League of Legends has *forty* times the numbers of players at one time online compared to RuneScape... That's a fucking lot. I would imagine for a test of the system, that what would need to happen, is say, appoint the ten players who submit the best, and most accurate reports and let them free. They'd be normal players, however, when there's a troll/flamer in the game, then when they report, Riot reviews it, and takes appropriate action.


Another thing to note, is while RuneScape player moderators are definitely as normal as any other player, they have one extra little super power. They have the option to mute on spot. So, for example, if I was a mod, and someone was being verbally abusive to another person, I could hit report, and choose something along the line of ""Mute and report"". From there, an automated, 24 hour mute gets applied to the abusive players account, and his report gets flagged as very high priority. That way, the most abusive players are tackled first, and most of the time, are snuffed out fairly quickly. But, what if that mute was applied by someone who was power hungry and just wanting to mute someone he doesn't like? Well... Riot would see that, and they'd be able to warn him, ""This guy you muted... why?"" - As a moderator, you'd be accountable for all mutes you apply, and if you fuck up, or abuse your powers, Riot could simply remove your mod status as easily as they applied it.

dog_in_the_vent,AskReddit,1390059150.0,"Commercial space travel.

When aviation was just getting off the ground in the early 20th century it was at first limited to daredevils, then rich thrill seekers, then rich businessmen, and now it's widely available.  They even offered prizes for aviation accomplishments.

Space travel will do the same thing.  Right now we're in the ""rich thrill seekers"" stage, but there are plans on the horizon for using space travel to get across the planet extremely quickly.  The X-prize is also notable because it did a lot to encourage civilian space flight."
ta1901,FeMRADebates,1390059150.0,"&gt; You seem to be implying that women are told to be submissive -&gt; women don't know how to work hard -&gt; women are unable to maintain LTR. 

Badonkaduck made a comment that ""women are expected to act like children"" and I expanded on why I think that is: because of some parents. This is common enough that I see it fairly frequently. That does not mean it's a majority of women, but at my age (40s) it is a problem with a majority of women who are single. 

&gt; Can't one be submissive and still be capable of the work required to maintain a relationship?

Yes. I'm not saying being submissive is bad. I'm saying a parent teaching their child (on purpose or through poor parenting) to be lazy is bad and affects their relationships later in life. Because some people *claim* be be submissive, when in fact they are just plain lazy or don't want responsibility. Men and women.

&gt; As well, do you think this is really a women thing? 

No, I guess I wasn't clear about that. This is an American thing for sure, there have been a rash of articles about this too, and business is fairly concerned about this trend. The complaints of business about the younger generation (currently in their 20s) are lack of good communication skills, lack of people skills, lack of follow through. 
You can google for some articles, I don't have time to list them right now. 


&gt; His defence? Well, he did buy her a Christmas gift, so he just didn't understand why she was upset.

This is the lack of knowledge of relationships I was dancing around. 

&gt;  I don't think it's as easy as ""women don't know what it takes"".

I agree I didn't phrase it well. This does not affect just women, it affects men too. But since I date women, I see this problem frequently and it's quite frustrating for me since I want a serious relationship. 

So, I agree with you, and admit I didn't write my opinion as clear as I could have. Please accept my apologies.

derleth,badhistory,1390059186.0,"It's more true in physics than in a lot of other disciplines, I'll grant you, and that's because of this:

&gt; it's more like brute-force hacking someone's computer by guessing password after password until you eventually get it right

This can't be the case in an observational science, because scientists aren't even going to bother with theories and laws that obviously don't match what's observed.

For example, in watching how projectiles move, you see they arc in parabolas, so simple linear equations can't describe that, so the simplest possible equations for projectile motion must be at least quadratic. And that happens to be correct.

Another example: Trying to explain the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe using a specific virtual-particle-based theory gives an expansion rate that's 10^120 orders of magnitude too large. That's non-viable right there. We don't need to develop all of the ramifications of a theory that's *that* far wrong.

And existing theories sometimes contain the seeds of the next step. For example, Einstein based Relativity (Special Relativity, to begin with) off of well-known existing physics; namely, the fact that Maxwell's Equations implied a propagation rate for electromagnetic radiation that would be constant for all observers. His main shift was *taking those equations seriously*, which is something later physicists find a lot easier, given how equation-heavy (and impossible to interpret *without* equations...) quantum physics is.

Empirically deriving constants is another example: Human-size events happen with time scales of seconds and distance scales of around one to ten meters. This helps justify why Planck's Constant is so small: We don't directly observe tunneling behavior, for example, so it must happen at a scale much smaller than we can directly perceive. That rules out a huge range of possible values.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but the progress of science isn't blind, partially-correct theories do give partially-correct results, and we typically *do* get feedback from reality as to how our theories are deficient."

It's still a benefit that comes at almost no cost once you've invested in the rest: the USA wouldn't pay a penny less to maintain its military if it decided to ditch the NATO.
&gt;This is made more expensive by actions the EU does such as 
turn back refugees, while doing nothing to ameliorate the situations that gave rise to those waves of refugees.

Why is it Europe's responsibility to set straight every wrong in the world? It's the USA in particular who preferred decolonization after WW2... you made your bed, now lie in it.

&gt;Arming and advising rogue nations (ex-yugoslav republics, Libya, Iraq)

We're integrating Yugoslavia nicely, thank you very much. How did you manage to fit that microscope next to the warehouse full of beams, anyway? If we don't go along invading Iraq we're free-riders, if we do we are are arming and advising rogue nations. It's impossible to do good that way, make up your mind.

&gt;Actively provoking the russians (and the turks).

If ""not giving them what they want straight away"" counts as actively provoking, that might be true.

&gt;Concerning that last point, It was really a telltale sign when a NATO &amp; EU candidate country (georgia) reneged on its negotiations with russia in 2008, and attacked a breakaway region, and the called for NATO help to deal with the Russian military response. Subsequently, a poll done across europe revealed that if a NATO member would be attacked by the russians, most of the EU's voters would be against their countries honor their treaty obligations for mutual defense.

- Georgia isn't a member of either organization yet.

- We didn't exactly applaud eg. Serbia for attacking its own breakaway regions either, so it's a consistent position.

ronearc,AskCulinary,1390059925.0,"1. Get a thick baking sheet (not the really thin ones that heat up fast). 
2. Line with foil for easy clean-up. 
3. Place bacon strips on foil so they're not touching - I usually try not to fit more than 8 strips on a sheet (usually more like 6), but as long as they're not touching, you're fine. 
4. Place baking sheet in cold oven at 400F. 

And now we're out of science and into art. The time is going to vary according to thickness of your bacon, freshness of your bacon, how many strips you have, fat content, etc. 

For 7 slices of thick, fresh, meaty Applewood Smoked Bacon, I have gone as long as 24 minutes if I want the bacon crispy. 

Fresh bacon is still very 'wet' usually from the way it's been vacuum packed. After the package has been opened (this is especially true of non-ziplock packages), the bacon will dry out some, and it will cook faster. 

Also, the more fat there is in the bacon, the faster it seems to cook (fat renders and it cooks in its own fat - I always save this fat for use later). 

For 3 slices of really fatty, normal (non-thick cut) bacon from a package that's been open for a few days... I might only cook it for 13 minutes. 

Also, if you're using a thin baking sheet that heats up really quickly, you might need to reduce your cooking times. 

Lastly, once you get this down, you can easily make perfect bacon in the oven every time, regardless your circumstances. 

Of course, once you're somewhere else, using someone else's oven, all bets are off. 

So if you want perfect bacon every single time, hands down... then cook it in a well-seasoned cast iron skillet, low and slow, flipping it often. "

To start off with I might have:

VPIP: voluntarily put chips in the pot %

PFR: preflop raise %

There are considered the most important stats.

I also started with the number of hands you have on that player and how many Big Blinds deep they are.

Once you are comfortable with this you could add in:

c-bet, fold to c-bet and aggression factor. There are loads more on offer, probably 200+ stats are offered by HM.

I would not recommend starting with 10 or more stats, you will get confused and not know what anything means.

hasitcometothis,AskReddit,1390059975.0,"A similar thing happened to me when I was a little girl. I was about 5 years old walking down the road from my sister's friends house back to mine around 8 am when a man pulled up. There was a little girl in the front seat that looked scared and the man just looked terrifying. He rolled down the window and asked me to get into the car so I ran up to beat on the door of the house we were in front of and he sped off. I ran home so fast and tried to wake my mom up to tell her how scared I was and that I thought maybe the girl was in danger. She just told me I was overreacting and when I said I know I wasn't, she just told me to call 911 on my own and passed back out. That was when I realized my parents were selfish and cared more about sleeping in after partying all night than worrying about me and my sister.

And yes, some people do detransition, but it's extremely rare (although it doesn't seem that way because every case of it gets wild amounts of attention and publicity). The cases of trans people *not* detransitioning outweigh those that do exponentially. It's so statistically insignificant that it would fall into any margin of error. I do believe that people who detransition need the same support and respect as the rest of us, but the fact that they exist doesn't change me or the rest of the trans community one bit."

She talked a lot about the heterosexual normative which in my city, to me, does not happen unless the normative is simply the majority and nothing else (in which case the term would be pointless to me, like the people who use patriarchy instead of plain sexism). And even more, the heterosexual normative does not exist in my college, where homosexuals are more common than heterosexuals. Yes, she said, but we are not the majority in society. Then me and a heterosexual friend of her proceeded to point out how that meant that in that case, to her, the normative was simply the majority, and not a set of social rules which are nonexistant at least in out social circles. She ended up accepting that we were mostly right. She suffered a lot during her teens so I understand (and she does too) her bias.

Ja kad sam bila u Bosni 2010-te godine bila u jednoj ćevapđinici u Fojnici. Ne znam da li znaš, ali mi imamo jednu 'kliniku' koja je poznata sa Arapima (Reumal). U ljetne mjesece, Fojnica je puna Arapa jer dođu tu na rehabilitaciju. U glavnom, ja sam sjedila tu sa rođakom čekala da mi završe hranu pa da ponesem kući svojima ( došla Kanađanka puna para pa mora malo rodbinu nahraniti /s ;) ) kad ulazi momak sa ocem u kolicima. Nije ni jedan znao Bosanski ali su znali malo Engleskog pa pitaju da li imo može pomoći. Ja, da budem fina i da ugostim strance, kažem da im ja mogu pomoći. I tako, njih dvojica naruče šta hoće uz moju pomoć i svi krenemo svojim putem. Sutra dan, ja idem u čarsiju kad na ulici blizu te ćevapđinice taj momak što sam mu ja pomogla dan prije priđe meni. Hajd reko da opet budem pristojna malo počnem šavrljat sa njim. Kad on mene pita da li bi moj Babo bio za to da se on oženi sa mnom. On će ko dati mom babi dvije koze, kravu i kobilu. Nikad se nisam nasmijala ko taj dan. Nako sramota me bila momku u lice smijat ali nikad nisam mislila da će se to meni desit. Ja mu kažem nema šanse. ( sad kad pomislim; da sam barem rekla da mi da babi par krava i kobila možda bi dobro bilo. I takvi su ti Arapi u Reumalu.

* Have excellent communication. It's the foundation for a solid relationship. 
* Being overweight too much (about 20 lbs) reduces your dating pool by about 90%. Be aware of that. 
* Ask about what he wants and his needs in a relationship. Encourage him to be honest. Only when he can be honest with himself, can he be honest with you, and really find a good match. 
* Understand how healthy relationships work and demonstrate that knowledge. 
* Don't assume he wants to pay for all dates simply because he has a penis. Ask him.

 I paid $1,900 to take language courses at the local VHS for 8 months.  I got an Aufenthaltsurlaubnis.  This is a permit to let me stay until my courses are done.  After that I either have to get married or attend college.  If I don't do any of that, I leave.  Of course you MIGHT and I mean that's a real far might, you might find a job who will sponsor you....but I doubt it.

* ""P is for Pain."" Oh, Pinkie Pie... :)

* So many background ponies!

* Boom, Rarity out of nowhere!

* Hold on, I recognize those flight patterns.

* ...Why would the Wonderbolts be flying for Cloudsdale? They work for Canterlot, don't they? And they're a professional team, so they don't count!

* What the hay is AJ doing?

* ...This episode kinda sucks so far.

* Oh hey, the *actual* Wonderbolts' trainer.

* And we end with Soarin' falling to his death!

* ...Anypony seen Derpy yet? If we get another Derpy debacle...

* Did Spitfire always sound like that? At least Soarin' sounds the same.

* Is that where this plot is going...

* Hey, a Wonderbolts Academy reference.

* You do know she *willingly* chose to have a lesser team, right? Does this plot twist make sense, then?

* Feed bags. Those are new.

* Hey, Rainbow Dash. You just got your own uniform. They're tricking you, genius.

* ...Wasn't this what the Shadowbolts offered in the second episode? Which Rainbow Dash rejected without a second thought?

* I'm pretty sure this scene is supposed to be sad or whatever, but it's just so darn obvious where it's going.

* I... wasn't expecting that. It's obviously not going to work, but still.

* Don't do this, Twilight. Don't you dare.

* ...How is this working?

* :O

* :D :D :D

* ""Choosing not to choose isn't a decision."" That's an interesting point.

* Are they saying the Wonderbolts... lied? Or did I misunderstand what Soarin' said?

* Hey, a rainbow. If there was any doubt that wasn't a key, it's certainly gone now.

* I wasn't wrong! That's messed up.

* This episode still sucked, but at least that had some interesting twists.

* And Derpy. I guess that raises it up a little in my opinion. A little.

* They're really going to qualify if they're doing that poorly?

* Aha, and a rainbow-themed prize.

* I was thinking the rainbowified ponies were gonna show up here. Now I'm thinking they're gonna be in the finals.

* Good moral. I think we've probably gone over it at least once before, but still.

Many Americans may have seen the Japanese as less than white, but they didn't go about attempting to eradicate them as a race. Even after being attacked the Americans showed notable concern for civilians and POWs.

Also tell the boys that just because girls are different does not make them bad. Just because girls cry  more does not mean they are bad. They are just more emotional. Likewise, just because boys are less emotional, does not mean they are emotionally stunted. 

&gt; Do you feel as if younger boys are sent the wrong message when it comes to attracting women nowadays? 

I think the problem is most parents don't teach their boys about dating or girls, so they get bad advice from their peers.

ronearc,AskReddit,1390061401.0,"I've driven over 2 million miles, with a large percentage of it on great road trips. 

Even the ones that had mishaps were great though.

Make sure you're prepared, have what you need, including emergency rations, blankets, water, flashlights, first aid kit, spare tire/hardware, basic toolbox, etc. 

Then, even when something goes fucking haywire, and if you do enough road trips, it will...just make that part of the adventure. 

If you're trying hard to get from point A to point B on a timetable, then that's not a road trip, that's just driving. 

If you're really on a road trip, then embrace the random shit that can happen, turn it into part of the trip, and part of the story. 

I've had times when we had to pull over and park because the weather was just too bad to drive another foot. 

I was a passenger in our rented motorhome when my dad ran the thing into the corner of the motel balcony. 

I've had flat tires, engine trouble, missed my exit, was stopped in traffic for hours, etc. 

The only time I can think of a ""worst"" though was when I caught the flu on the first day of the trip. We're just trying like hell to make it through Oklahoma so we can get to our first stopping point. 

My dad is driving, and he's going a bit fast. We're on the Indian Nation Turnpike, and that's when we're pulled over. 

My dad explains to the cop that I was really sick, and he was just trying to get to where we're going to I could rest. 

The cop looks at me in the backseat and says, ""Well, I tell you what Mr. Ronearc's Dad, I'll make sure I write fast.""

So yeah...I leaned my head out of the car and threw up on his shoes. 

From that day on, my dad claimed that only two good things ever came out of Oklahoma, I-35 and I-40. "

PotRoastPotato,CFB,1390061875.0,"&gt;against the 16 team playoff because it takes away from the regular season

If I may quote myself:

It really wouldn't. There would be 11 automatic bids and only five at-large bids. You'd have to be either (a.) a conference champion or (b.) a Top-10 team (at worst) to make it in.

This year, the Big 5 conference champs were #1 FSU, #2 Auburn, #4 Michigan State, #5 Stanford, #6 Baylor. Six other conference champs would have made it. That leaves five at-larges, which going strictly by AP ranking, would be #3 Alabama, #7 Ohio State, #8 Missouri, #9 South Carolina. 

The lowest at-large team in this scenario is #9 in the nation. None of the at-large teams had more than two losses. Regular season is still important -- I would say even more important, because you still have something to play for after you trip up. But one loss doesn't guarantee you anything, so every game is still important.

&gt;I am more anti a the conference champion gets an auto bid

Yes, The weaker teams would be the weak mid-major conference champions. This is the part of the of the system people will attack most -- but my theory is that this is worth it; the ""conference champion"" allowance gives every unexpected mid-major success (like UCF) a chance to prove themselves in the playoffs. I think this outweighs the downside of a weak conference champion making it in.

If you disagree with the system allowing mid-major conference champions in, I would like to know your thinking for keeping mid-majors in the same division as the Big 5."

WeaponsGradeHumanity,facepalm,1390062227.0,"&gt;True, but with babies and the severely mentally handicapped, we assume certain things based on our own perceptions and on how they react to stimuli. 

Children might enjoy sex but we don't infer consent from that.  

&gt;I don't see a big reason why we shouldn't assume some of the same things for animals, who also feel pain and can suffer.  

We extend more rights to humans than we do to animals.  Whether or not you support that is a different question.  

&gt;But in regards to animal products, it's perfectly good for us to go without them, possibly even better for us as well as the environment.  

Goodness no.  It's beside the point though because the ""necessity"" in question is that we eat something.  After you accept that, all you're left with is a subjective evaluation of what should and shouldn't be eaten.  

&gt;But do you really think that [the system that we use now], which occurs to animals on a scale likely thousands of times larger than any death would occur in the wild, is better than a life of freedom and curiosity (that may end quickly)?  

That depends entirely on your definitions of 'better' and 'freedom'.  It also assumes that we never choose to make farm slaughter a painless experience and it forgets that farmed animals are protected from a lot worse than sudden death.  
I don't see the use of 'scale' as an argument either as we are only able to slaughter so many because we breed so many in the first place.  A number of species could be saved from extinction if we suddenly decided they were delicious.  "

In your own post, you talked about how many reasons there are for doing NoFap and said that none of them should be judged etc. So why would you chastise someone and judge them if *that* is their reason for doing it?

Not necessarily agreeing with the view you are judging here, but I also think it is short sighted to talk about that reason as if it is less worthy than any of the other reasons around here. NoFap is great, but it is neither a cult nor is it some kind of high and mighty group of people who are better than others simply because they are conquering porn. In fact, I bet many people who come here aren't even doing it because they are ""addicted"" to porn or have ED or anything. I would bet the average user is here because they want to get a little bit of discipline about the whole thing.

mmp31,counterstrike,1390062360.0,"We're going back a while but I'll try to remember it as best as I can. Some of them are objective and subjective things that I didn't like.

They changed the hitboxes and gun recoil patterns around so that everything was more random. It had the effect of decreasing the skill of better players while elevating the skill of lower players to even the playing field a bit more. The one autosniper is BS because there's basically no recoil and does so much damage now...it did not used to be that way. The AWP didn’t used to have that delay between when you pull the bolt back and when you can scope again. It was a lot harder to avoid people who were good with AWP’s...again, this was a way of “leveling” the playing field by putting AWP users at a disadvantage. Can’t tell you how many times that delay has gotten me killed. To this day if I try to play CS, I am still not used to it.

I don’t like how the round clock now stops after the bomb is planted. It slows the pace of the game down because the rounds can be 30-45 seconds longer. It also changes the balance of power more in favor of the T’s. I also think it’s pretty lame that the person who planted the bomb has their score go up if the bomb detonates. It makes the player score less meaningful for determining how good another player is.

They changed the buy menus so that they’re in order of price, which is so illogical. For example, the AK47 used to be #1 on the rifles menu for terrorists, which made way more sense. I think AWP is #5 on the rifles for T’s and #6 for CT’s? So confusing, and always causes me to buy the wrong gun. You also can't buy a gun that you already own, so if you want to buy the same gun for someone on your team, you have to drop yours first. Slows the game pace down.

You used to be able to hit tab and click on someone’s name to mute them. Good luck muting obnoxious people in the middle of a round in 1.6. Again, makes the gameplay slower. I think they also may have changed around the damage that weapons do in a way that I and a lot of others found unfavorable, but I might not be remembering that correctly. They added the riot shield which is cheesy IMO. I also didn't care for the new guns they added (Defender and Clarion) because again it fucked with the balance of power. 

I don't like the new gun skins but that's obviously cosmetic. Who the hell runs with a knife pointing straight up? So cheesy. That knife looks pretty lame too, compared to the 1.5 knife. The guns used to have real names and then they made them fake names which is also cheesy. I don’t like the 1.6 versions of Aztec and Inferno. The text fonts in 1.6 look horrible compared to the fonts in 1.5 which looked more professional.

One of the big issues was that when Steam first was released, it was garbage. There were a shitload of bugs and nothing ever worked properly. When Valve started talking about Source, I realized that they were just never going to make CS 1.6 right, so I stopped caring about the game. I tried to play 1.6 about 5 years ago but I gave up because the server list has obviously been hacked and I couldn’t find any decent servers. So apparently, after a year or two of ruining that game, Valve ALSO decided they didn't give a shit about it anymore either and stopped updating it.

With how fast computers are today, this is probably a moot point, but 1.5 runs so much faster than 1.6. And the gameplay is a lot slower for several reasons that I pointed out. Coupling those two together makes 1.6 feel bloated and slow. Don’t get me wrong, there were some bug fixes that they did in 1.6 that I found favorable. But the bad far outweighed the good and it just made the game not as fun as it used to be."

In all seriousness though, a lot of vegans and vegetarians seem to feel it's wrong to farm animals in the first place. Yes, they'd go extinct if we didn't farm them (a lot of people do forget to think of that), but a few farmed species going extinct wouldn't actually have a significant impact on the rest of the ecosystems on earth. And arguably, life for farmed animals isn't a happy one (in my opinion it really depends).

With bees, though, bee farming is very important for sustaining bee populations that are currently around. And farming the honey keeps the bees active and pollinating in a sustainable manner. "

Just because someone is morally reprehensible does not mean that we sacrifice our humanity for the sake of punishing them. We utilize the death penalty as a statement of our society. When you are executed by law, the society is stating that what you did makes you unfit to live in our society based on our preconceived notion of what is barbaric. What you are suggesting is that we become barbaric ourselves to punish the barbarian.  
  
If our justice system used a procedure that involved raping and killing the accused, our justice system would be just as barbaric as the murderer we punish. By using cruel methods to enact justice, you remove the integrity and honor that's attached to the justice system. Every barbaric thing a legal system does compromises the system. The legal system is supposed to punish barbarism and reward noble action. It no longer has the moral authority to be this ideal arbitrator when it in itself is barbaric.

mindovermacabre,AskReddit,1390062723.0,"I've always been the new kid and I've always been a little not-normal, so I've been bullied quite a bit.  The other kids were brutal and I could go on about what they did, but most of that means nothing now.  The one single thing that fucked me up the most was this:

'Your father would rather have you live on the streets with me than live with him in his nice house.  You're an inconvenience to him.'

My mom said this to me when I was eleven years old.  It is the worst lie anyone has ever told me.  We were on the verge of being homeless at the time, and unbeknownst to me, she had asked him if he would take me to live with him for awhile.  His father had just died that month, and he asked for a few weeks to get his things in order so that I could have my own room and everything.  She hung up on him and told me that I was an inconvenience to him.

It doesn't sound like much, but that was all she ever had to say.  For *years*, this ate at me.  For years, I thought my father didn't want me, that he was settling down with his new wife and would have a new daughter and would be happy without me.

I don't think it was a conscious thing- I doubt it was, as my mother has a tendency to play the victim.  But in doing this, she drove me away from my father and into the only other support pillar I had: her.  While the groundwork had already been laid, that one statement built the foundation of my reliance on her that resulted in the emotional and mental abuse that I endured throughout the majority of my teenage years.  I couldn't tell my father.  I was scared that I was an *inconvenience* to him.

Years later, that word still makes me shudder.  I'm 22 now, moved away, successful, and I've since confessed to my dad and watched him almost break down in tears because he never knew why I withdrew from him.  But I still cannot shake the bone-deep fear that I'm an *inconvenience* to someone.  Anyone around me, anyone at all.  My boss, my coworkers, my friends, the rest of my family.  The instant I feel like I'm imposing, making you do something you don't want to do, or just that you're not completely happy with me, I kneejerk and freak out and try to fix everything myself and usually just wind up making a bigger mess of things.

I'm working through it, but it's hard.  And it just goes to show that *one* simple statement can entirely change someone's life and how they see the world around them."

We still talked while she was in NY and I was still working in MN.  Then she came back to MN for a weekend and she said she wanted to see me.  I had no idea what to expect when I picked her up at the airport.  We were still very much ""up in the air"" and I was just going to do whatever she did.  She came out of the airport and planted a big one right on my lips.  

She went back to NY to finish school and I followed but I lived at my folk's in NJ.  I made the 10 hour round trip to see her every couple weeks.  Then she graduated and moved back to MN which is our current situation.  2.5 years of long distance and still going.

All the people who, when they're really angry, decide it would be a great idea to go and kill their girlfriend who cheated on them.  The people who find it's really easy to kill their target and all the people around them when they perform a driveby.  You don't get collateral damage with a knife.  The people who don't take adequate precautions, leave their loaded gun out and then sue the manufacturers/gun shop/state/whoever when their four-year-old shoots themselves in the face instead of blaming their own stupidity.  The idiots and dangerous people, in short.  Without guns, all these people go away.

In this country, it's generally considered good practise to either cooperate or run when confronted with a knife, and I think that's the best way forward.

The items arent even dropped in a manner that makes the term ""grind"" make any sense. You get a random chance of finding any of the items in the game based on how long you have been playing. Its not like you play a set mission a certain number of times to try and find a specific item. The definition of grinding is doing something boring over and over hoping a specific item will drop.

I think the real way to make money in an automated society is through owning capital.  Everyone needs access to automation, thats where the value comes from.   Basic income is just a bandaid to keep people alive, IMO.  Not to say we won't need that band aid, and I actually feel it will be very useful in allowing the average person the agency to invest in a small business without the risk of dying.  But the real money makers are going to be the ones that own the robots or have the valuable skills.

I don't like the idea of basic income with the goal of income redistribution.  It should be a safety net, something to keep you alive until you can retrain or get ahold of some capital.

Just look at the average increase in budget of AAA games for the last 10 years to understand how the increase in graphical fidelity and resolution has affected top tier games development. I've shown you the numbers, and broken them down for you, you have just mindlessly asserted that iOS and Android is taking over everyhting but a small segment of mobile gaming, their best days of GBA has been surpassed.

With the axioms of normal math (e.g. ""x=x is defined to be true"") you cannot say that 1-1+1-1 ... = 0.5 is true, but if you introduce a definition saying that it is, the entire manipulation of sequences change and you get this funky result. Its a bit like defining infinity to be 42 for practical purposes and then using that to prove that god can exist hence proving his non-existing vis-a-vis the saying ""god cannot be proven to exist"".

kakersdozen,askscience,1390063571.0,"Yes. The residual chlorine is what you are smelling.

There are a few reasons why you don't notice it in a glass of water or while washing dishes. First, the sheer volume of water. When you shower, you are using gallons and gallons of water, so there is more chlorine gas to start with. A shower is also a semi-enclosed space, so less air circulation means you are more likely to smell it.

Assuming you take warm showers: hot water holds less [chlorine gas](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/gases-solubility-water-d_1148.html). When the water gets warm, the chlorine gas separates out. You probably drink cold glasses of water, so you don't smell it there. Even if you wash the dishes with hot water, the amount of water you use probably isn't enough for you to notice a smell.

Most people think they just live in a cage, eat pellets and don't do anything.  It couldn't be further from the truth (keeping them in a cage all the time is cruel, and not giving them a variety diet is going to limit their life span and the quality of their health and digestion).  Ours is a free range house rabbit, just like a cat!  He's very social, too clever for his own good, and just as much of a joy as he is a butthead.

TheFarnell,AdviceAnimals,1390063851.0,"In-depth follow up:

There are only **five possible ways** in which a guy can be friends with a girl without there being some sexual subtext.  Note that these are not a *guarantee* that there is no sexual subtext on his end, it's just the *minimum for it to be possible to be ""just friends""*. Those are:

1. **Incompatible sexual orientation.**  If the guy is gay, asexual, or otherwise not interested in your gender, you can be ""just friends"".
2. **Westermarck effect (and variants).**  If you and the guy have been close friends since well before he entered puberty and have not had a prolonged period of time apart since then, you can be ""just friends"".
3. **Clear family relationship.**  If you're the guy's cousin, neice, sister, aunt, etc., then you can be ""just friends"".
4. **The guy does not find you sexually attractive.**  This is usually the hardest to gauge because it's such a touchy subject that most guys will lie with whatever they think you want to hear.  Surprisingly, ""do you find me sexually attractive?"" is usually a good way to get the truth out of him.  If he doesn't (and it doesn't hurt your ego too much), then you can be ""just friends"".
5. **You've already had a relationship that ended on *his* terms**.  If you've had a relationship (usually involving sex) and it ended because *he* wanted it to, then you can be ""just friends"".  Note that if there were external factors pushing him to end it with you, this does *not* constitute it having ended on *his* terms.

So ladies, take all of your guy friends and put them through those 5 conditions.  Any who meet at least one *might* be looking to be ""just friends"" with you.  All those who do not meet at least one of these conditions wants to bone you.

**Edit:** The early slew of downvotes seems to indicate I poorly expressed my point.  I certainly *do* believe it's possible for a man to be friends with a woman if none of the above conditions are met - this happens *all the time* in normal society because we're not animals driven solely on sexual impulse.  What I meant by ""just friends"" is the notion some women seem to have that their male friends are completely disinterested in them sexually, which is very, very rare, and which I feel is ultimately a barrier towards better understanding between friends."

Beekeeping is a possible cause of colony collapse:   
 
&gt;beekeeping practices (such as the use of antibiotics, or long-distance transportation of beehives)  
   

&gt;Management stressors: Among the management stressors that are possible contributors to CCD are poor nutrition due to apiary overcrowding and increased migratory stress brought on by the honey bees being transported to multiple locations across the country.

jenniferocious,doctorwho,1390063910.0,"I don't think he's attractive or unattractive at this point. He's just a man, somewhere in the middle. Though when they unveiled him as the next Doctor my first thought was that he *looks* like the Doctor, if that even makes sense.

That being said, I don't think Tennant is attractive or unattractive either, and I never did. Initially I thought Matt Smith was just plain *odd* looking, but I think the fact that he became my favorite Doctor (and learning more about him through interviews and stuff) changed the way I perceive him physically. I still don't think he is a ""pretty-boy"" or anything like that, he isn't traditionally attractive at all. I totally get why people would say he is weird looking or unattractive, and I definitely have moments where I would agree with them, but that doesn't change the fact that I have a bit of a crush on him.

I don't think Capaldi is icky any more than I thought Tennant was icky. I don't find either of them particularly attractive, but certainly not *icky*. I'd put Eccleston in this category too. None of them are typical ""pretty boy"" types, so I don't get why a lot of people are claiming that they are. Just because they are younger than Capaldi doesn't mean they are automatically more attractive. But I think that the youth factor is a bigger issue here; many Doctor Who fans are younger, and they can picture themselves with a younger looking Doctor a lot easier than an older one. Also, having a physically younger looking Doctor makes it easier to whine about how he should hook up with Clara (even though 11 and River had a bit of a Mrs. Robinson vibe going, and nobody was upset about that).

I just don't get why everyone thinks we've had an era of ""pretty"" Doctors just because a lot of female fans have been getting hot and bothered by them. Correlation does not imply causation. It isn't even like we've had an era of particularly *young* Doctors, Smith being the exception. Eccleston is 49, Tennant is 42. 

Anyway, I don't watch the show because I'm hot for the Doctor. I watch the show because I like the show. Anyone who thinks otherwise is welcome to jump ship, but I think it is silly to watch a show and to claim to be a fan if the only reason you watch is because you have the hots for one of the actors.

Animal Crossing: New Leaf- Great for relaxing, and playing when you want to have no stress

Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D- A recreation of a masterpiece, not my favorite game, but if you haven't played it, by all means go for it.

Zelda: Link Between Worlds- You already have the game, but one of my favorites.

Fire Emblem: Awakening- My favorite 3DS game. An extremly good strategy RPG, even if you don't like them, it is still an amazing game.

Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon- A great continuation to Luigi's Mansion. It is presented in a mission based structure, but each level fells good, and it never becomes boring.

Super Mario 3D Land- A great 3D Mario game for the 3DS. This game perhaps has one of the best 3D effects on the system. Everyone should play the game you can get it for pretty cheap nowadays.

There are tons of other great games I don't have time to explain. Including Pushmo, Crashmo, Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies, New Super Mario Bros. 2, Pokemon X, Pokemon Y, Rune Factory 4, Cave Story, Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward, Mario Kart 7, Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan, Kid Icarus: Uprising, Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, Shin Megami Tensei IV, VVVVVV, Resident Evil: Revelations, Professor Layton: Miracle Mask, Steamworld Dig, Gunman Clive, Art Academy: Lessons For Everyone, Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team, Star Fox 64 3D, Mutant Mudds, Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millenium Girl, Dead or Alive: Dimensions, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, Mighty Switch Force!, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move, Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked, Rhythm Thief &amp; the Emperor's Treasure, Style Savvy: Trendsetters, Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, HarmoKnight, Sakura Samurai: Art of the Sword, Scribblenauts Unlimited, Nintendogs + Cats, and Rayman Origins. Just to name a few. Haha.

There are also countless new games coming soon, like Super Smash Bros., Bravely Default (Febuary 7th), and even more coming soon.

Let's not even talk abut the fact that it's backwards compatible with the gargantuan DS library!

By moving the speaker you are making adjustments to how the cabin is being loaded and developing.  In real basic terms,  generally as the distance from the sub to the ear increases the peak transfer function frequency decreases and makes it sound ""boomier"".  This is accomplished by loading the rear wall or trunk.   Secondly, phase comes into play which is a question more of ""how far should I be off of the loading surface?""  unfortunately this is a very setup and vehicle specific question that can best be answered with lots of testing.

ToastedOtter,college,1390064498.0,"You're going about this the wrong way. MIT is a dream. That's what you want. But you have to realize that there's a very real possibility that you won't get in--if you're unlucky, you might not get into any elite colleges. That's the nature of the 10-15% admission rate at these schools.

You'll have an awesome experience at a variety of other universities, too. Just keep that in mind, and have an open mind about the places you apply to. Look at Cali schools, midwestern schools, go look down south. Tulane, etc.

Also, you're a freshman. Chill yo tits. You have plenty of time to figure out where you want to go to college. There's more to the experience than just the name. I remember visiting MIT and coming out thinking 'I would never go here.' You can go to the best school in the country, and it won't do you any good if you despise every hour you're there.

Finally: if you want to stand out, do stuff that you really love. I rode horses and played violin. None of that has anything to do with academics. But I did those, and I did them well. I enjoyed the time I spent riding and, uh, musicing. If you spend all your time on 'what looks good,' then you're not going to enjoy life, and you'll be just like every other academically focused person out there. Too much work, not enough play."

Also, it would be easier to support the UN if every time a military intervention was necessary they didn't just issue a directive and expect a US-led NATO coalition to take care of it. 

That is the biggest problem I have with them. It is easy to say things, its much harder to *do* them. The UN relies on the US/UK/French  militarires far too much. 

Its a similar situation to NATO. Every single NATO member voted for intervention in Libya. Very few participated. When military intervention is necessary its easy to vote for something with no intention of actually committing any resources.

That is similar to how the UN works unfortunately. All most member countries do is sit around and talk. Then whenever there is grunt work to do they expect the US, UK and France to take care of it. "

What people don't seem to pay enough mind to is that all these tragedies are caused by *bad people*. Guns are just a tool.  They re neither good nor bad.  They do, however, make it easier for bad people to do bad things.  They also make it easier for good people to stop them."

The tachometer tells you how fast the engine is spinning (RPMs), and the speedometer tells you how fast the transmission is spinning (and driving the wheels).  The clutch is what links these two pieces together.  When the clutch pedal is depressed, the connection between the engine and transmission is broken, so the engine can spin at whatever speed it wants without moving the car.  


The clutch has a friction disk attached to the transmission, and as you release the clutch pedal, the disk is pressed against the engine's flywheel.  When the clutch is fully released, the friction disk and the flywheel are firmly together and spinning at the same speed.

blorgle,legaladvice,1390065006.0,"In Texas (where I worked at a vet clinic and processed many quarantines) if an animal bites someone, it has to be either euthanized and sent to a lab for testing or quarantined for 10 days and examined by a vet at the end of that period for signs of rabies.  The rational behind the quarantine period is that rabies is a virus that travels through the nervous system at a predictable rate.  If the rabies virus infects the salivary glands, then the animal can transfer the disease through bites.  Additionally, by the time the rabies virus infects the salivary gland, it will move to the brain and the dog will start showing neurological symptoms within 10 days.  If the animal is not showing neurological symptoms at the end of the quarantine period, then you know for sure that the dog was not capable of spreading rabies and the bite victim does not need the expensive and dangerous human rabies vaccine.

The law doesn't care if the bite broke the skin or not.  

[It looks like NC has similar laws on the books as Texas.](http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusscst47_3_10_47_7_170.htm#s47_5_100)

The HVAC guy has a bruise, your dog has a history of nipping people, and you didn't witness the incident?  Dogs are quick--it would have only taken a split second.  

The law cares more about public health than fairness--based on the facts you gave it's not beyond reasonable doubt that your dog nipped the HVAC guy and the consequences of him getting rabies are worse than the consequences of you having to quarantine your dog for 10 days.  

Take your dog home in a week in a half and pay the $200 or whatever the quarantine fee is where you live and put your dog in another room when strangers come to the door next time.

let the skin of your lips slide loosely and get lots of spit/slobber going on (even if you're sucking hard enough to pull him inside out): this will provide a smoother contact surface and help prevent teeth contact (to describe it in non-technical terms, this is when it feels ""silky smooth"").  if size is an issue and teeth are unavoidable, just make sure not to catch them on the ridge of the penis-head.  that's... not pleasant.  remember to breathe through your nose.  you know how when you swallow, your tongue pushes against the roof of your mouth?  *do that*.  if just bobbing up and down starts hurting your neck, move your upper torso instead, move your head in a nodding ""yes I agree"" motion, or change positions so you use different muscle groups.  try different things.

YOUR_VERY_STUPID,lewronggeneration,1390065127.0,"""Satire"" isn't a blanket defense against all criticism, though.

You can always say ""SATIRE! YOU TOOK IT TOO SERIOUSLY!"" if someone doesn't like something, which is a little bit ridiculous.

There is definitely such a thing as poorly done satire, and it's *really hard* to point it out sometimes.

There are plenty of legitimate fans of that song who don't care or don't know that it's satire- they just like it because it's catchy and funny^[1].

It's a little tiring to be constantly told that not liking something is the same as not understanding it. It really is possible to see the reasons why someone would like a given thing without actually liking it yourself.

ST_Lawson,CFB,1390065241.0,"Nope, FCS has a limit of fewer scholarships than FBS, but there are a couple of conferences that have agreed to not offer scholarships for football at all: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)#Scholarships

""A few Championship Subdivision conferences are composed of schools that offer no athletic scholarships at all, most notably the Ivy League and the Pioneer Football League (PFL), a football-only conference. The Ivy League allows no athletic scholarships at all, while the PFL consists of schools that offer scholarships in other sports but choose not to take on the expense of a scholarship football program. The Northeast Conference also sponsored non-scholarship football, but began offering a maximum of 30 full scholarship equivalents in 2006, which grew to 40 in 2011 after a later vote of the league's school presidents and athletic directors. The Patriot League only began awarding football scholarships in the 2013 season, with the first scholarships awarded only to incoming freshmen. Before the conference began its transition to scholarship football, athletes receiving scholarships in other sports were ineligible to play football for member schools. When the transition is complete in the 2016 season, member schools will be allowed up to 60 full scholarship equivalents."""

Almost all of my male friends say the same thing... can't cry, have to be 'manly,' can't show weakness.

Instead there's a cruel culture of 'man up.' It's horrible.

All they do is stall out, stuck in their loneliness and pain. Burying it and suffering alone just hurts them more. They get more and more isolated, and eventually just helpless...

I try to be there for them as best I can. I'm married, but I've let other men hold me, or held them. Sometimes they cry. It's okay. I would never think less of them for it.

So find the people in your life who love you and care about you, and go to them with what's happening. They can help you. They can comfort you. And they won't look at you as being less of a man for it.

You live in their home, it sounds like they contribute towards your phone bill, and they cook for you, apart from times when they don't feel like cooking. They advanced you the money for a LifeProof case, although granted they should have told you it wasn't a gift. There's a few things there that make it seem like you don't have it so bad. 

You work 9 hours a week at what /u/SteelSings suggests is less than minimum wage - of course you're broke. To fix that, your options are to look for another job or take some kind of action to deal with your exploitative employer. 

Granted, your stepdad sounds like a dick, but there's a few points in there that make me feel like you're being a bit of an ungrateful jerk too: 

- **if they cant afford it, that would be because they each go through $25 worth of cigarettes in a day.** So what if they do? You're 17 and have a job, you shouldn't need to mooch cash off your parents now.

- **I was told by my step dad to get a second job because I wasn't going to be ""sitting on my ass playing computer games all summer."" I told him to get fucked and that what I do isn't his business.** If you tell someone to get fucked, don't be surprised when they're not willing to support you financially. 

$55 from your first check does sound harsh, and I'd be asking if I can split it over 2-3 paychecks, pointing out that if you don't have enough money to support yourself, you're likely to need to borrow from them again anyway. 

Maybe things are drastically different in the UK to Australia, but at 17, I was expected to be self sufficient. I never had to pay rent, but I was also expected to manage my own finances as soon as I got my first job. "

When a woman feels strongly about a guy, she believes it's a universal truth and that he has to feel it and get it on some level too. She believes that he's somehow blocked from doing it, and all she has to do is hang in there long enough and whatever the issue is will break loose because love *always* finds a way.

Ovdje su ti oni haos. 


Kod nas je najgori problem sto nas u dijaspori je strah da nađemo momka ili curu u Bosni jer možda hoće samo zbog papira. A onda imaš problem ovdje jer dosta naših momaka, poslije 20-22e godine, ode u probleme. To postane haos. I onda ove cure, kao ja, nemamo izbora nego udati se za Arapa.

H gas + O gas reacts to form water, but it also happens in reverse to a lesser extent.

When an acid is added to water, you have an equation: Acid + water forms conjugate base (from the acid) and hydronium (Water plus the H atom) but this reaction ALSO happens in reverse so there will always remain some acid in equilibrium with the product, the conjugate base. 

The dissociation constant is a measure of the ratio of acid and its conjugate base. A strong acid will readily form LOTS of hydronium and conjugate base while a weak acid will form little product and stay largely as the acid in solution."

Exis007,AskAcademia,1390065676.0,"Okay, let's back up for a minute. 

PhD funding and MA/MS funding vary greatly. 

Funding for these programs vary greatly between departments, disciplines, and universities. 

What you're asking is difficult to answer. It is not so much that they fund international students. If a program is going to fund students at all, there's not *usually* a distinction between an international candidate and a national candidate. The question is with regards to whether or not a university funds that graduate program and what the university gets as a result. 

The PhD is a lot more straight-forward with regards to what the university gets. The University gets a teacher in most cases. That person will teach within the department. Sometimes that means they'll TA a larger lecture course, sometimes that means they'll get someone actually teaching their own courses in the department. For a very small living stipend, they can increase the number of classes/the size of the classes they offer. You also get someone who is going to work under your name. People pay attention to where mover and shakers in a field did their doctorates. If Example University is putting out great econ minds who are publishing, speaking at conferences, and landing good jobs they get a lot of clout and attention. This diversifies over different disciplines but the idea is pretty constant between them. That Example University is going to get a reputation as being strong in that field. They'll get grants for research, notoriety, and overall clout within the larger university system. This attracts undergrads (who really pay the bills for the university) and other boons like conferences, journalism, national ranking data, etc. 

With MAs it gets more complicated. Some programs fund the Masters level, some expect you to pay through loans. Most programs do a little of both. It really depends on the role of that program within the department. For some departments, the MA is a money-maker. They attract people going for the MA in the hopes of landing a funded PhD so they get people willing to shell out a lot of cash. Sometimes they'll fully fund the MA to have the most selective candidates (the better the funding, the more attractive the candidates will be who apply and the more selective you can be in admitting them). The MA will earn their funding in similar ways to the PhD. They could get teaching gigs in the department or the university more generally. They can be doing research or, more likely, take on research assistance positions that help the tenured professors complete their work more quickly. They can also be publishing/producing conference work as well. Their role can be an echo of the PhD. **Alternately** some MAs will basically just send checks and take classes without giving back to the university. Those are more likely to be the students who don't get funding. 

There is a quid pro quo in every instance. The University funds the students so they don't have to work outside of the university. Instead they work inside of the university. What that work looks like is department specific and discipline specific. This is (almost) always applicable at the doctoral level, and kind of a toss-up for the MA level. What you work in matters a lot as well. 

You asked in another comment about GPAs. Keep in mind that, for my program, there are only three grades you can get [A, A-, B+]. An A is expected. An A- indicates that you need to do more work to play at that level. A B+ is kind of an autographed sign that says, ""You may not be cut out for this work"". The idea is that if you are strong enough to work at this level, an A should be attainable. They don't grade on the curve the way they do for undergrad programs, the expectation is that most/all students will get an A in the course. Grades change a lot in grad school, so keep that in mind.

shytemptation,offmychest,1390065702.0,"This is why there needs to be a path for rehabilitation for sex offenders instead of a permanent branding and permanent listing ruining the rest of their lives. There are so many people like this who are either falsely accused or convicted of a one-time minor incident who manage to live a straight life and don't ever cause any more trouble. Lumping them all in with people who are repeat rapists or have multiple victims or are violently abusive does too much damage. Even if your dad did hug a student wrong, why shouldn't he be allowed to go back to being a fairly normal citizen after 5 years of good, law-abiding behavior with no further incidents?

I really wish there was a tiered system where people who committed less serious sexual crimes could be removed from the lists for good behavior while leaving only the most severe offenders permanently listed (although really if they are that bad they should just be in jail, why let the worst of them go free and leave safety to people checking an internet list?).

I say this as a sex abuse victim, so I know sex abuse is a serious crime and can cause serious damage, but it isn't a permanent life ruiner. If even some murderers can be released from jail and rehabilitated back into society, why not the guys who dated a high schooler while they were in college or got a little too touchy-feely but didn't cross any other boundaries?"

Sparkdog,Helix,1390065857.0,"Pretty spot on review, I think.  The show is well shot, and has just enough going on that its maintaining interest just on *potential* alone.  But the characters are falling pretty flat so far, their relationships and motivations too ambiguous, thinly scripted, or just non-existent.  The bit about the show needing to find the difference between mystery and ambiguity is very accurate.  Billy Campbell is a pretty decent actor, and is barely managing to carry the show almost entirely on his own, what with the fairly thin characterizations.

I'm still keeping faith that the show will find a groove and start going places, but I really hope it can start getting there over the next 2 or 3 episodes.

edit: Also, I think they were pretty ambitious with how much plot and setting they want/need to establish for the viewer right from the start, just to get the show working.  Its a fairly convoluted setup to explain right from the beginning.  I don't know if thats a good or bad thing, but it seems like they are intent on getting the plot rolling before they delve into the characters more.  I think more polished scripts and a bigger budget would have allowed them to do both at the same time."

itsachickenwingthing,truegaming,1390065883.0,"Y'know, when I was a kid I had this theory that the size of a game's manual was directly (and positively!) related to its actual quality. It was hardly scientific, but I found that nine times out of ten, the games I ended up loving also had fairly dense manuals.

And there was a certain utility to manuals for me. For one, back before I had to drive to the game store myself (or before I had my own amazon account, and before digital downloads were a thing), manuals used to make for a great read on the way home so that I was able to breeze through the first few levels when I finally got the disc in. In a time with horrendous loading times, they made for a good read while I waited through the screen. Of course, I never went so far as to actually use the notes section that a few manuals had, if only out of some innate allegiance to maintaining a mint condition on them.

Nowadays as we're moving closer and closer to digital-only releases, and as environmental protection becomes a bigger and bigger concern, I can understand why publishers would want to ditch the format. And of course, there are always community-wikis (which I actually use a lot, admittedly) and digital manuals. The latter is still kind of inconvenient since loading times are still kind of bad on consoles, particularly when I want to pull up the manual itself; the work around is that I could just pull up the wiki on some other device.

But if we move to a reliance on wikis, it takes away one of the major hurdles in development that was potentially very useful to the whole process. Having a useful game manual, with the caveat that it's frontloaded in the package, required that developers be able to concisely summarize all of the core game mechanics and systems in an easily digestible manual. This provides a useful exercise to the design process, if you ask me.

Now, manuals were still a little redundant in a lot of games. I suppose there must have been some data coming in saying that not many players were reading the manuals and so there was a need to make more comprehensive tutorials. Maybe tutorials and manuals were developed simultaneously, with the intent of them either being rivalrous or complementary solutions, and somewhere along the way developers just forgot that they were supposed to be refining the two or phasing out one of them (or they're in the process of phasing out manuals).

Regardless, supposing that there is some data pile indicating that no one even reads the manuals, and given the AAA sector of the industry's recent tendency to cater to the lowest common denominator, ditching manuals makes perfect sense if it overs any kind of marginal savings. Likewise, considering most AAA games just copy &amp; paste their controls and mechanics from previous titles in the series or popular titles in the genre, there's not much utility in a comprehensive manual/tutorial, as most players have *""played""* the game before.

And on the other end, with games that cater to relatively niche audiences and which have highly technical systems, they often didn't include *enough* information in the manuals and tutorials such that beating them almost necessitated the development of a community around the game. For example, games like Devil May Cry 3 which are renown for their punishing difficulty and hailed for having a cavernous skill ceiling. What's the utility of a manual/tutorial there? A stepping stone to maybe get through the normal mode by the skin of your teeth? Should a developer count on the community to do a majority of the ""tutorial"" themselves?

TL;DR: Maybe community wikis and youtube tutorials are just more useful than developer-made manuals and in-game tutorials. Certainly, there's little point to manuals in this day and age."

Yes, it is here to stay.  That doesn't mean it isn't wrong.  They are not *ours* to do with what we want.

Animals killed in the US through testing: 

&gt;Dogs
12 per day - one every 115 minutes    

&gt;Cats
one every 37 hours

&gt;Primates
7 per day - one every 3 1/2 hours  

&gt;Pigs
12 per day - one every 2 hours

&gt;Estimates exist that 100 million animals are used wordwide, which is about 274,000 per day, or three every second.  However, this estimate is for vertebrates only.

&gt;The US has been very poor at recording the number of animals used, and does not officially record the total of rodents.  A midpoint of estimates is 18.5 million per year, which is 50,700 per day, or one every 1.7 seconds.

&gt;Demand for these (mice) may be unpredictable, and they therefore breed more than they expect, and kill the rest.

Then there is e.g. Nvidia who can do driver support and this way go and try enable Mantle for theirs architecture, but to get 100% out of it they would need to do redesigns towards AMD's. At least it's my understand after reading about Mantle.

callc92,ireland,1390066140.0,"A lot of people have been saying to defer a year, this is probably a good idea but make sure that you look into other options first. You may be able  defer your exams until summer resit time instead of sitting them at the normal time and you may get an extension on your coursework. I would only suggest doing this if your health will return to normal fairly quickly. Obviously tell them, Universities tend to be really good about this sort of thing. Remember that it may well be worth dropping out, you will not get as good a grade if you are ill for the year and the stress may slow your recovery.

Also see your GP or a councillor (your university probably has one) since you have been feeling depressed for more than two weeks. Stress and depression can make physical symptoms feel worse so getting help with depression can also help with that. It can get better, the fact that you managed to get out of bed today is proof of that.

I would also suggest that you tell your friends and family,they will want to know and will want to be there for you. If necessary leave a note, record a video message or get someone else to tell them if you find that easier. getting it all off your chest will help and it is better that they find out sooner rather than later, even if it turns out to be nothing too serious.

Basically, make sure you tell people, get help with your feelings of depression and best of luck!"

I_Wish_to_remain_ano,loseit,1390066331.0,"Umm pretty difficult at first, until I got my schedule in check. This was during the summer, so I would wake up late, like 8-9am and go for a 30 min jog. I would then come back and reward myself for a job well done by eating, sometimes forcefully, a massive 600-700 calorie breakfast. This would keep me stuffed for hours on end, it was friggin hot so I would drink a lot, I mean A LOT of water, which would further keep my hunger from rousing. At around 5pm then I would allow myself to lunch, usually the whole remainder of my caloric allowance. I would allow myself a very light snack usually a fruit after that before sleeping. I would ignore the hunger, accepting it as a part of my evolutionary desire. But most of the time, seeing my progress everyday, in terms of stamina and body shape I learned to suppress it even more. 

After my medical uni opened, I shaved around a 300 cals from breakfast and lunch for a small meal at night and upped my cardio run to 45 min in the morning or after my uni. Usually soup or grilled chicken. Even though the majority of my weight loss occurred during the summer, losing the last 10 pounds was the most difficult.

Just in case the French get uppity again.  I don't think they've bothered to repeal that one, but the point is that it can be, very easily, because it's not written into the most fundamental law of our country (although admittedly we don't have a direct equivalent of your constitution).  It's just a law that's lost its meaning, just like the second amendment did... actually several years *before* its instatement.

Tavarish,Games,1390066846.0,"My combined hours of 480 [Bf 3 + Bf 4] disagree with yours assessment that I haven't played them.

On PC there is very very few weapons you can't 100% control with mouse and keep doing full auto at close to ~mid ranges. While scoring kill, SC or HC. Easiest for this is picking up AR and go at it, even if you don't want go full auto you can do surprisingly long and accurate *bursts*. In 3 &amp; 4.

Bf 3 had overkill suppression and random deviation models because of it where Bf 4 has it little bit better with less suppression effect and random bullet throwing.

I don't think you have played Bf 2 that much if you think Bf 3 or 4 has more random deviation bullshit than Bf 2 has. If we don't count in suppression crutch.

In the end I don't think developers should use same balancing for consoles and PC because of controlling mechanics are so different. With mouse it's a lot faster to aim, a lot easier to control recoil pulls and even easier to control fire than with pad. At least in my opinion after playing Halo's and now KZ on PS 4 on top of years of PC FPS gaming.

I think PC version of the game should always have stronger recoil pulls so player can't negate it so easily with mouse while making visual recoil movement of weapon more obvious to indicate how full auto causes larger spread.

That all said I can see Titanfall going basically *No recoil* -route as it's sci-fi FPS and not modern military shoot em up like CoD of Battlefield."

My body really wasn't used to either the excess alcohol or elevated tylenol intake. I did this for *maybe* two and a half weeks. Then the bloodwork:

Doc: Your liver enzymes are three times higher than they should be.

Me: Well, looks like I won't be drinking or taking Tylenol anymore!

Just that one week before surgery was awful. No painkillers so my shoulder ached all day and my neck was stiff and sore, I was sleeping terribly, and then after surgery I only took my Norco (as prescribed) for a week before going to once a day (before bed, to help me sleep without pain). A month after my initial tests I had all my blood work redone and the levels had dropped down, some to the normal range, some were just slightly above normal.

Put most people in the same situation on almost any other subject and they would probably seem the same way.

If a student who was male wanted to just ""try out"" the ladies restroom, they would have to inform their parents, their school administration, and eventually the entire school that they are trans. They would then have to start seeing a therapist and come up with a transition plan. This plan will most likely lead to hormones and will definitely come with the expectation that they will start presenting as whichever gender they identify with, in this case it would be female. This all happens before they use the ladies restroom.

I have never met a cisgender teenage boy that would be so dedicated to see some closed stall doors. I mean with all the emotional and societal torment that comes with being transgender, why would anyone fake it? It would likely be months before this hypothetical person was even allowed to use the ladies bathrooms. That's why they usually try to plan these transitions around breaks in school.

Critiquing a popular franchise is always gonna attract this controversy, but ultimately the bigger franchises need that critique in order to evolve, rather than stagnate, which I'm afraid the AC series has been doing for the last three or four games. A shame, too, because it was a series I was pretty heavily invested in, but after playing AC3 I'm pretty much done with it.  "

Omega037,relationships,1390067149.0,"I am first going to start by simply saying that you need to accept that your dad might just not be capable of having the kind of relationship you want to have with him.  

If you focus too much on it and base your happiness upon it, you could end up very hurt.

That said, it doesn't sound like any of this is born out of maliciousness or even resistance to having a decent relationship with you, so there is decent hope.

Without knowing you both a lot more, I am limited in the advice that I can give.  I will just say that for many familial relationships, proximity is key.  If you want to be closer with him, you might just need to see and call him more often.  Make yourself a regular part of his life and the bonds will likely grow.

Also as a word of warning, you don't represent your siblings, nor should you.  Their relationship with him is between them and him.  Don't try to fix it or expect him to become closer with them just because you become closer to him."

We shall see if Nvidia jumps on to Mantle train and does those drivers at some point, but I can't see them doing architecture redesigns to get all Mantles benefits. It would mean compromising theirs design direction and basically adopting AMD's.

Both companies are dickheads with proprietary stuff if we are honest here. Nvidia tends to want cash for it where AMD this far has made sure that theirs stuff runs like shit on Nvidia GPU's. Maybe I'm naive as shit when I think PC gaming would benefit greatly if these two companies would co-develop stuff like Mantle or PhysX or TressFX instead of doing them solo."

&gt;Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy, and the official Nazi party paper, the Völkischer Beobachter, wrote in the strongest terms that Jews and Black people should not be allowed to participate in the Games.[2][3] However, when threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations, he relented and allowed Black people and Jews to participate, and added one token participant to the German team—a German woman, Helene Mayer, who had a Jewish father. At the same time, the party removed signs stating ""Jews not wanted"" and similar slogans from the city's main tourist attractions. In an attempt to ""clean up"" Berlin, the German Ministry of the Interior authorized the chief of police to arrest all Romani (Gypsies) and keep them in a ""special camp,"" the Berlin-Marzahn concentration camp.[4]   



Or, what about the [1972 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre).

&gt;The Munich massacre was an attack during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany on 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team, who were taken hostage and eventually killed, along with a German police officer, by the Palestinian group Black September.[3][4][5][6] Shortly after the crisis began, they demanded the release of 234 prisoners held in Israeli jails,[7] and the release of the founders (Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof) of the German Red Army Faction, who were held in German prisons.[8] Black September called the operation ""Iqrit and Biram"",[9] after two Palestinian Christian villages whose inhabitants were expelled by the Haganah in 1948."

They are remakes of the same tried and true games that will sell millions of copies but they alone won't sell more than a few thousand systems. Nintendo needs new new games, something that players haven't experienced before. They have great opportunity to create a new experience with the gamepad's extra screen and they're completely wasting it.

I'm just hoping they port Kid Icarus Uprising to the Wii U. That game was a refreshing addition to their IP catalog; it would be a shame if they keep it 3DS exclusive. "
WhirlingDervishes,asoiaf,1390067570.0,"I was the same as you until I got to my reread where Tyrion and Illyrio are riding to meet the Halfmaester and Duck. I don't think I even want Aegon to be a Blackfyre, but it seemed that the whole dialogue was pointing to it.

All in one chapter we see: Illyrio has an interest in Aegon/Dany that isn't about gold, he broke the Gold Company's contract for ""blood,"" a summary of the Blackfyre rebellion and that the **male** line of the Blackfyres died ~40 years ago, and that the love of Illyrio's life had blue eyes and ""pale gold hair streaked by silver.""

Then the last we see of him in the next chapter he has a gift for the boy and Tyrion notes that he sounded ""oddly sad."" Plus the fact he had boy's clothes at his mansion... None of that is proof, but man. I absolutely believe in it after rereading those parts."

Maybe no one would be talking about banning kids from restaurants and planes if parents would just use a little common sense the rest of the time in other places. Like the parents someone posted about a few months back who let their baby crawl around on the mats at a rock gym. Just why?

I also can't believe the gym didn't say anything-everywhere i have lived has a 14 or 16 and up policy. It is too much. And completely unsafe.

Photons are used because they're much easier to produce, and they require significantly less shielding of the treatment room. Additionally, modern linacs can operate in both photon therapy and electron beam therapy modes, which makes hospitals more likely to invest in them.

Also, keep in mind that neutrons are significantly more damaging than photons. While that is great for killing cancerous tissue, as you can see on the depth-dose profile it will also kill a large amount of shallow tissue if the tumor is deep. This would limit its uses to shallow tumors far from essential or radiosensitive organs, ultimately making it impractical in comparison to proton, photon, and electron therapies."

I will say that most women have to put in time in the gym AND do hair/makeup/wardrobe to look the way they do. It also usually takes longer for women to see results from the gym (~~toning~~ gaining muscle, losing weight) than it does for men. 


Anecdotally, I put in at least 10 hours at the gym every week, and then still have to do my hair, makeup (which includes a skin care regimen), and make sure my body is relatively hairless (shaving, waxing, plucking, Nairing).

First, even though the doses of naloxone that antagonize morphine are similar for bees and vertebrates, the D50 [50% inhibition of the stinging response] of morphine for honeybees (927 ug/g) was found to be far greater than that reported for behavioral tests in vertebrates (0.30 - 10.0 ug/g), and 3 to 10 times higher than that reported in other arthropods. Second, bees injected with enkephalins and related peptides at a dose of 200 n-moles/bee did not exhibit the effect of the same does of morphine. The results obtained by the morphine experiments suggest that an endorphinic system is responsible for pain modulation in bees (Balderrama 127).

Pain is usually the most primitive and necessary senses to be present in animals.  It is protective.  Think of humans who can't feel pain, their life expectancy is significantly lower.  Pain is pretty fundamental to survival."

razmataz08,offmychest,1390068462.0,"10 out of 100 couples getting pregnant a year is in no way the same of having a 1 in 10 change of being pregnant every time you have sex. 

Think of is this way: out of those 100 couples, they could each be having sex 5 times a week, or 260 times a year. That would be 10 pregnancies in 26,000 sexual encounters. Meaning 1 in 2600 times of sex with a condom would result in pregnancy, which sounds much more reasonable that 1 in 10. If everyone get pregnancy once every 10 times they had sex with condoms, I'm pretty sure the condom companies would be out of business pretty quickly. "

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1390068549.0,"I actually *would* like to see a return of chivalry in the traditional sense, but it has nothing to do with gender roles or TRP. Historical chivalry, up until the past few hundred years, was always about a behavioral code of honor for the military and war tactics, and I wouldn't mind seeing it become trendy to be a good, decent, non-corrupt person in the armed forces and in law enforcement. But that has nothing to do with what you're asking.

As for what I guess I would call chivalric romance, especially the way it is portrayed in modern media, it seems heavily intertwined with the idea of courtly love. It is a romantic notion that makes little to no sense in our current society. Courtly love was when two high-ranking nobles (typically a knight and a lady) who were married but not to each other would engage in a subtle, non-sexual love affair, where polite social gestures like holding a door open or pulling a chair out were the only way they *could* be intimate with each other. I guess the modern equivalent might be the way some people have a ""work spouse"" who they dote on. In a courtly love relationship, the man isn't suggesting that the woman can't open a door for herself, rather, she is giving him permission to perform a task for her, however trivial, because he wants do something *for* her, no matter what it is. Personally, I find the whole scenario to be rather cute and sweet under the right circumstances, but not a model to script any given interaction between a man and a woman by. If I'm newly dating someone and he gets the door for me, that says to me that he's interested and possibly even nervous, which I find endearing and would enjoy. That doesn't mean I'm going to blush demurely any time some random person holds the door, which I've actually been criticized for, hilariously enough. I've even had a guy flat out refuse to let *me* get the door for *him*. That was pretty funny.
[
Another commenter](http://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/1vhav2/study_men_and_women_happier_with_chivalry/cesmq4h) in this thread gave a perfect example of the breakdown of chivalry. She has male friends who will insist on taking the side closer to the road when walking down the sidewalk together. The idea being that if a car were to crash into them, the male would be shielding the female. I would imagine that both parties know deep down that if a car *were* to crash into them, it probably wouldn't matter who was on what side. However, instead of arguing or making it into a big deal, she allows her male friends to do so, because it strokes their ego. Even though she thinks it's silly. That, to me, is the *essence* of chivalry. I would even argue it's a matriarchal concept when viewed that way.

However, things get twisted, and there are men out there who really *do* think that women are incapable of opening doors for themselves, and there are women who think any given man is obligated to perform small tasks for her that boil down to flirting. Both are wrong, in my opinion. Both reek of entitlement, the women that they are entitled to the flirting and the men that they are entitled to the positive response, from any given person. 

For the record, I know it's been repeated through this thread that it's more than just holding doors open, but that's a good example so I'm using it."

In political theory you have different views on the social contract but the main theme is you join a society and you give up your natural rights for the protection and benefits the sovereign provides. When joining you can't pick and choose what you want to agree to, you agree to EVERYTHING. Now, you can try to change things but nothing is guaranteed. Some political theorists argue that the state has absolute power over you. They are the only ones that can kill, punish, etc.

Their whole political ideology is extremely skewed. They need to read Rousseau, Hobbes, Locke, etc. Fancy wording doesn't mean anything."

It was severely infected and nearly gangrenous. Several of the staples had created micro fractures on the skull too apparently. The ER doc's face when the man nonchalantly described how he just got drunk and had his wife use the staple gun on his skull was hilarious.

AdamColligan,news,1390069117.0,"Good. 

First of all, my impression is that for many people who make and then distribute child pornography, the existence of an audience, even a non-paying one, is part of the motivation. If we are smart enough to understand that the visible admiration of someone's stolen art or poached ivory is important in driving that market, we should be smart enough to know better than to contribute to this same effect in the production of child pornography. 

Secondly, I think that people are too quick to dismiss the ongoing effect of re-traumatization. While I have not personally been in that situation, I think it is quite reasonable to assume that there is in fact a ""new"" pain derived from the knowledge that somewhere *right now*, someone is getting off on an intimate record of one's terrible experience of victimization.

But there is something perhaps even more important that I think gets left out by the kind of people who on threads like this say ""viewing does nothing"".  And that is that most of the child victims, even those who are quite young and don't live in the richest countries, are not going to be idiots,  nor are most going to be people who, even as minors, live in a cave and don't know what the Internet is or what digital photographs and video are.  I don't know of any definitive research on this, particularly recent research during the era in which children most everywhere grow up immersed in Internet videos and portable recording devices. But I don't feel too out of bounds in speculating that experiencing abuse in front of a camera, knowing even in that moment that you are being assaulted both for pleasure and mass entertainment, must add a whole extra dimension of pain. 

When people contribute to hit counters on child porn websites or to other more subtle ways in which society knows that there is a large audience out there, they are surely responsible for instigating that pain in victims who are being abused even today or tomorrow. 

If nobody out there were interested in watching, and it if it were well known by everyone down to young teens that there really wasn't much of an audience, then it stands to reason that (a) fewer terrible sumbags would add camera torture to their victims, and (b) the presence of the camera would not communicate with such awful certainty that part of your abuse is knowing as it is happening that your pain is becoming a permanent spectacle.

EDIT: To clarify, I do understand that some abuse videos, both of children and adults, get viewed because they are posted to mainstream sites, are difficult to distinguish from the mass of both fake and real ""amateur"" pornography that involves all consenting adults, etc. There is probably no fair way to demand compensation from unwitting contributors to the popularity measures of those photos and videos, although the law should continue to demand that sites be vigilant about moderation. But judging by the regular mass arrest stories, there are still plenty of people out there who know exactly what they are watching and sharing and plenty of images and videos that are totally unequivocal. The people who seek out that material almost certainly do create ripple effects both in demand and in social awareness that there is demand, and they need to be held responsible in some way for that."

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390069131.0,"Many artists talk about the *visual library*, a mental collection of props, textures, surfaces, environments, colour and lighting schemes, architectural elements, and other such things that an artist develops over a long period of time through studies and observation. It is for the sake of this visual library that a lot of artists will endorse traveling a lot throughout one's life, because of the chance to observe and absorb a wide variety of elements.

So, because of that, studies like this one, and also more specific explorations of machinery, architecture, anatomy, etc. are extremely important. But at the same time, a lot of people will find it intoxicating - once you get used to painting from observation (which you appear to be quite good at, at least with landscapes, despite your having just started), it becomes far easier to just paint studies all the time, because they'll usually look great. Of course, that limits you as an artist, to fall into that trap.

I would advocate doing both, studies and personal works from your imagination, in equal amounts. Working from your imagination can be difficult, as you stated, because you might not know where to start.

In your case, I would probably start in whatever medium you feel most comfortable scribbling and doodling - for some people, it's pencil or pen on paper, for others, it's lines in photoshop, or large swathes of greyscale value in photoshop, or some will jump directly into colour. Even a single artist might feel more comfortable with one approach one day, and another a few days later. If you don't have any ideas at all, try scribbling and doodling until something begins to emerge - just the beginnings of something that you can latch onto and push. If you do have a vague idea, try exploring different ways that you can approach it, in small thumbnail drawings.

Once you feel you have enough information to start working off of (what constitutes enough also varies from artist to artist), you'll probably want to decide on your light sources (to keep everything unified), and then you may want to go hunting for reference. Just because you're painting from your imagination does not at all mean you are not allowed to use any reference - the difference here is that the composition, and virtually all your decisions are your own. You will only be taking information from these references - what does a sword look like when held at a certain angle? How do the laces on a woman's corset look? What elements would a space ship require to look believable? You may even want to work off on another canvas to design especially important elements based on your reference (or even without reference) before incorporating them into your illustration.

I usually keep progression shots of my paintings as I work on them, so this is what I mean by starting with scribbly-doodles first to get your general idea out of your head and on paper. [Here's one](http://8pointfont.blogspot.ca/2013/09/20130926.html), and [here's another](http://8pointfont.blogspot.ca/2013/12/20131211.html).

There's a good chance that your studies will look far better than the work that you do from your imagination. [The one piece I did](http://8pointfont.blogspot.ca/2013/04/20130417.html) while watching Shaddy Safadi's youtube videos is probably by far one of my favourite pieces, and it too was a landscape study. But you have to force yourself to remember - each painting you do is not for the sake of churning out something as pretty as possible, but rather to push yourself to improve just a little bit more each time.

Anyways, this reply has gotten a bit long in the tooth - so best of luck, and I look forward to seeing your work in the future."

fnredditacct,sex,1390069325.0,"I don't mind giving details, but I'm really not sure how much of it will be helpful to you.

If there is any takeaway for you, I think it's this: **I didn't learn to be okay with feeling uncomfortable. I didn't push past bad feelings.  I identified what made me uncomfortable, why it made me uncomfortable and fixed those issues.**

The learning to enjoy it part came after talking to him extensively about why exactly it aroused him, and it made sense to me. I get off on what it does to him, more than anything else. But some aspects, like the power I have, how pathetic he looks, how sad he looks, the Sadist in me likes that just fine for itself.

My issues with multiple partners were mostly about health/life practicalities: STIs and pregnancy risk. I did also feel a lot of pressure to do the whole cuckolding thing for him. It is his primary fetish, his main turn on. This pressure was uncomfortable for me and made me really hesitant.

I didn't really have any trouble with intimacy with other men, nor did I worry for our relationship, or our intimacy being at risk from these interactions. If those had been my problems, I'm really not sure how I would have gotten past that.

What it came down to for health stuff is this:

First of all, I was NOT comfortable doing this before we were married. I needed our bond to be strong, really, really strong, before I risked getting infected or impregnated by another. I needed to know that he is with me, through whatever happens, before I risked, for him, something irreversible that could distance me from him and *change my life forever.*

I have an IUD, so risk of pregnancy low. 

*(Actually, right now I need to be on a medication that causes severe birth defects and can't get pregnant at all. That is, it is recommended by my doctors that I not try to keep a pregnancy should I get pregnant, which again, probably won't happen.)*

(Obviously) I use condoms with my other partners.

But on top of this, I'm just not attracted to PIV with men whose baby I wouldn't want. I do not, and will not, have PIV with any man whose child I wouldn't want to have for my own.  In the very rare chance that I get pregnant, the baby is my husbands baby. He is to raise the baby as his own.  He is completely comfortable with this idea now. I know him *really well,* and I think he would struggle with it some should the occasion come up, but ultimately be okay.

*(When I am no longer on this medication, I will need to re-evaluate partners and pregnancy, to take their feelings/desire about a baby into account. For now, it doesn't matter as much, although they know about my medication complications.)*

Pregnancy problem: solved.

STIs: There is no perfect system for this. I am okay with that. But mostly because I do not just have partners for him. I get to play, and have sex, with partners I choose outside of his fetish. That makes the risk worth it to me, as I get far more out of these partnerships. If I only ever risked myself for him...that would be a harder pill to swallow. Maybe not impossible, but I think the resentment would be a struggle for me, should I contract something.

Neither of us have any unprotected sexual contact with anyone. We don't kiss others, that is an unprotected sexual contact that transmits Herpes and HPV. Oral to gential contact must be barried, (dental dams, condoms- balls also can fit nicely inside a separate condom). Genital to genital contact, also condoms. 

And most importantly, I (we both) talk to potential partners about their safer sex practices. If they play fast and loose...then that makes them risky people to play with, and I pass.

The pressure was alleviated when he saw I was actually going to do this for him, and needed to do it in ways I felt comfortable with. Which meant we went slow. The guy really mattered to me, and mattered in ways that didn't to him, which makes finding someone somewhat tricky. It takes time. When I saw that he was okay with my slow pace, I became much happier about doing it. When I realized he expected me to also fulfill my fetishes/kinks, I became excited to do all of it.

And in the end, we have agreed that if, for any reason, one of us has a problem with the other's partner, or need to take a break and have it be just us, that's that.  We'll break back to monogamy, possibly forever, but certainly as long as we need.

Knowing there is an out if I need it, or just want it, also provides comfort for me.

Second, thank you very much for this response, even being a girl it applies. 

Right now I think it has to do with a fair amount of my friends being in relationships, getting engaged, having babies, ect thats bumming my very single self out. I'm also in school but the only one of my group of friends within my major that lives on campus and within my apartment I'm not really friends with my roommates and I have friends who live in the same building, but they are all guys and hanging out with them is hard because we are all super dedicated to school so once classes we all throw ourselves into our work and only see each other when we take smoke breaks. I'm thinking about trying to get involved more on campus to meet more people outside my major. I'm struggling with the fact that I was dating a guy, I thought we really clicked, we got on really well and when I admitted my feelings he basically stopped talking to me. I'm not the ""fall in love"" type of girl, feelings take a while to develop and even longer for me to admit to myself, let alone the other person, so I think that was a blow to my confidence that I wasnt prepared for. I'm a really confident person when it comes to meeting other people, I have no problem walking up to someone and starting a conversation if I feel like it, but I also have a tendency to keep people at a distance in general because I have some irrational fear of being hurt. Once I'm back at school I'm going to start being more active in activities on campus, things that maybe put me outside my comfort zone, and I really want to start going to the gym because I'm a bit overweight and that is something I can control and I know it would make me feel much better. Basically I'm going to force myself to not be lonely, I live on a college campus, there really is no excuse for it. 

Sorry, kind of went on a rant here. "

Dogs can easily be vegan.  Cats, not so much.  Dilemma, huh?  Hopefully we will stop breeding pets, too, as there is so much suffering involved.  But the only thing prohibiting cats from being vegan is high blood pH resulting from a vegetable-based diet.  There is a new food out there that deals with that.  I haven't investigated though.

Even IF it was possible to raise animals humanely for slaughter, there couldn't be enough to meet any of our supply.  Right now only 3% of cows are grass fed.  There isn't enough land in the world to keep up with our meat demand.

You say a lot of things but don't back any of it up. The fact is, there are millions of 3DS out there and nothing is going to stop that. People like you have been claiming that the mobile phone market is going to cut into handheld sales but it hasn't done that yet. The 3DS is selling like hotcakes and IIRC the Vita is picking up too.

bunker_man,TrueChristian,1390070228.0,"&gt;“Atheists don’t have any moral foundations.”

The problem with this one is that a huge percentage of the atheists on this very site will in some ways admit this, not even try to downplay it, but straight up insinuate the nonexistence of any kind of scale that qualifies whether morality is good or not... but then still be bitter that people say about them what they say about themself. If someone says morality is wholly opinion and nothing else, this goes beyond pointing out that morals are not absoluteely deontological. It means they reject even the vaguest form of consequentialism as well. Morals don't have to be a universal force in order to ""exist."" They're literally a quantifier of attempts to maximize positive experience. If nothing else, casing someone pain is a tangible thing that actually exists. Sure, this is a bit abstract, but anyone who wants to read into philosophy of ethics knows about these things. And would very likely be willing to admit that at the very least some objective reality exists that is the thing that what morality ""is"" is an attempt to measure.

The other things on the list are good, but let's be honest. This one many atheists bring on themself. Sure, many of them in theory THINK they're trying to advocate empathy based utilitarianism. But the ones who want to reduce everything to nihilism and struggle to reconcile these together; ultimately siding with language that is more on the nihilistic side are saying something very sharp, but then want to not get flak for it.

If you want them to understand your views, sit them down for a serious conversation and be as respectful as possible.

She reached across the cage table and laid her hand on mine - the burn of her icy touch forcing me to recoil in shock.  A a brief moment of shock passed over her as well.  Her fingers left hanging in the air, alone, reaching for something that always seemed as if it was just beyond her grasp.  Frowning, she withdrew and wrapped her hands around the cup of coffee that sat steaming in front of her.  Frost immeditaly formed on the mug.

""I'm sorry about that.  Being what I am, it comes with the territory.""

Despite her immaculate appearance and the grace with which she recomposed herself, I could see the sadness dancing in her eyes.  If not for the paralyzing sense of horror that always took hold when she came to see me, I might have actually felt some amount of sympathy for this....thing.

""Its all right,"" I mumbled, forcing myself to stare into my own cup.  We both knew it was half-hearted and insincere, but given the circumstances I would like to believe that she accepted my forgiveness.  *What an idea*, I mused, *the embodiment of Death itself seeking my forgiveness. *  I half smiled at the thought.

We sat in silence for a time, her gaze fixed on me, peering into my soul.  I always felt so naked under her gaze.  I didn't know what she could see, or perhaps even sense in me, but from our first encounter she proclaimed that I was the one who could understand her.  More than any other, she would often tell me, that we were of kindred spirits.  The thought unsettled me and twisted my stomach into knots.

""Why have you come here?"" I finally broke the silence.

""Business."" The word flowed from her lips like sweet honey.

""I'm shocked.  What business?"" My words were so harsh compared to hers.

She paused for a moment and the look of sadness burned back into her eyes.  I wondered how sincere that was.  She leaned forward in her chair and looked back into her coffee, now a block of dark brown ice.  She stared so intently it seemed as of she was divining the future from the coffee grounds.  Finally a whisper escaped from her focus, ""Emily. I have come for Emily.""

A wave of confusion swept over me as questions began to spring up into my mind.  Why would she come for her?  She's still alive.  She's not in danger of death, at least not yet.  What was the game here?  Surely this was a mistake?

""Its not a mistake.""

Her words snapped me back to reality.  Could she read my mind? My mouth hung open, the confusion apparent on my face as I searched for something to say.  All I could manage was to stammer ""What?""

""In exactly twenty two minutes and fifty three seconds, Emily LaPonte will develop breathing complications.  Through the amazing efforts of a nurse and yourself, you will save her.  I am asking you not to.  I am asking you to let her die.""

""Just...let her die?"" I asked bewildered.  

""Yes.""

I couldn't wrap my mind around this.  Here I am, sitting in a cafe across from Death herself - itself - and she asks me a favor?

I needed to know what was going on.  I quelled the gripping horror that was still causing my heart to pound in my temples. ""Why are you asking this?""

""It is simply her time to go.""

""But you just said that I, that we, will save her from...from you.""

""But that's not supposed to happen,"" she frowned.

""What do you mean that's not supposed to happen?  If its not supposed to happen and she's supposed to die, then why are you even here asking me?  Why don't you just ask which room number, which I can't fucking figure out why you bother to do to begin with, and just take her?""

She sighed and produced a worn out ledger from black mist.  Conjured from nothing, it fell to the table with a thud.  Its edges were frayed and the stitching in the binding was starting to come undone.  Pages stuck out haphazardly from inside the cover.  They looked like rats trying to escape a trap.

She flipped open the ledger and turned to a page somewhere in the middle.  There was a single entry on both exposed pages.  She slid the book across the table and turned it so that I could read what she wanted me to see:

*Saturday, January 18, 2014, 12:56.42 PM - Appointment with Emily LaPonte.  St. Jude's Children Hospital.  Intensive Care Unit. Bed 12. Reaping.  NO RESCHEDULE.*

I gave her an incredulous look.  ""What is this?""

""My day planner,"" she smiled coyly.  The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.  ""At that exact moment, Emily is supposed to release her last breath into this world and join me into the next.  And she will, if not for you.""

""I'm afraid I still don't understand, you are Death.  How is it that I thwart your plans?  How is it that I somehow stop you from taking this child?""

""Even the best laid plans can be ruined,"" she looked worn.  A shadow seemed to cast itself over her.  Her back hunched slightly and I noticed for the first time her normally immaculate hair was in some what of a disarray.  She seemed, deflated.  As if a huge burden had been laid on her shoulders and she was being crushed under its weight.

""John, I need you to do this for me.  I need you to let her go.""

""Why?  Why should I?"" Frustration built inside me. ""All you have ever done is come here and torment me.  Taking people whom I always believed had the greatest chance to be saved.  Never for anyone else.  Always for those who were the closest to cures or some kind of healing.  And now, now you come and ask me this?  I have the chance to preserve something as special as the life of a child.  To ensure a family can have more time with her when every fucking second counts.  And you, you want me to throw that away.  Rip that away from them and force me to confront another weeping mother and father and tell them, no, LIE to them, and say that we did everything that we could!  How dare you have such audacity.  How dare you, you-""

My pager started to alert.  One, two, three tones.  I went from boiling rage to panic in a second.  I spun and looked at the clock over the exit.  12:48 PM.  I didn't even need to hear the dispatcher.  Turning back to the table I opened my mouth to speak.  I do t know what I was going to say but I found an empty chair waiting for me.  The tones repeated.  In my mind they sounded like the death knell of a funeral procession. Without another thought, I began running.  I ran as fast as I could to the intensive care unit.  I ran as fast as I could to Emily.

I burst into the crowded room.  The clock over the bed was reading 12:51.  Five minutes.  I had five minutes to save her life.  I began barking orders to the nurses.  Hit her with thrombolitics.  Begin CPR.  What are her vitals?  What is the EKG readout?  Time slowed.  Emily began gasping for life.  Agonal respirations.  Her body was shutting down and she was circling the drain.  I felt Death's eyes on my back.

""She's suffered enough.""

""She has a chance."" The clock read 12:54.

""A chance at what?  A dominished life?  You don't know what's going to come of her if you save her now.""

""She will be alive. Can't that be enough?"" I pushed a shot of arenaline into Emily's arm.

""Is being trapped in your own body while connected to machines truly living?  Is that truly worth preserving?"" She came behind and leaned over my shoulder.  Her icy touch burning into my flesh.  I pushed on.

""That is not for me to decide.  I'm not god.""

""No, you are not."" I could feel her breath in my neck. ""But you work to disrupt his plans.  His plan for this girl.  His plan for the boy down the hall.  His plan for yourself.  You see this as a valiant attempt at preserving what you think God holds most sacred, yet you deny the dignity of death.  You deny this girl her everlasting peace and leave her family with a shell that will trap her soul.  You are trying to save her, but the reality is, you are building her cage.  You are constructing her personal hell.""

""I don't understand."" Doubt started to tug at the back of my mind.  I glanced at the clock. 12:55.

""Do you know what happens when you deny a meeting with death?"" She whispered, moving to Emily's bedside.  She placed a hand over the young girls forehead and gently brushed strands of hair from her face.

""I...I do not."" I realized I was at a loss. Swept up in my own frustration at what death had come to ask, I never once asked about Emily.  What would happen if her soul was not taken?  Why was this so important that Death itself is making a plea with me to let her die?  Death turned back to me, tears trailing down her face, leaving scorch marks in their wake.

""If she does not come with me now, she will never get the chance.  She will be trapped forever in the shell of her body, suffering until she is lowered into the grave.  Suffering as her body decomposes into nothing.  And then she will no longer exist.  Her soul will vanish.  She will never have peace.""

""What do you mean her soul will vanish?"" A lump formed in my throat the size of a baseball.  ""What happens to it?""

""I do not know for certain.  Nothing does.  It is taken from the universe to join the others.""

""What others?"" Even before I could finish, I knew the answer.  All the others I had ""saved."" That all medicine had supposedly saved.  They missed their appointment with Death and they never found the peace of an afterlife.  The horror that gripped me squeezed tighter than ever.  I had done this to children.  I have worked in a children's hospital for twenty years.  How many had I damned?  How many never really reached their deserved rest?  How many?

""DOCTOR!"" A nurse yelled.  Time started so abruptly that I almost fell over from the impact.  

""Doctor, what now?"". A room full of people stared, waiting for my order.

""V....vitals,"" I stuttered.

""BP is dropped to lethal levels, 57/20.  Pulse is at 30 beats per minute.  What is your decision?""

About transportation:

&gt;This study suggests that bees experiencing transportation have trouble fully developing their food glands and this might affect their ability to nurse the next generation of workers.

Nothing I said is actually controversial.  

Yes, bees are VERY important.  Thank you, I understand that.  But you know bees are natural and can exist without humans, yes?   

If we did need to ""supplement"" the bee population, sure we could do that.  But our main goal with bees is honey production.

In fact it is suspected that bee keeping may compete with local bees, so far the competition doesn't look like a problem, but:

&gt;Nearly half the native species declined during a year that displayed peak honey bee number. That competition from honey bees on an island the size of BCI was necessarily reduced below impact levels expected on the mainland is discussed using a model of resource and consumer density, foraging range, and island size.

Air could have some sort of control, using it to push and pull (or just push the other direction) people. Definitely should have some buffs too I guess, using air to speed stuff up, perhaps to reflect projectiles. And then mid-ranged attacking seems to make archetypical sense.

Fire. Melee fighting makes sense. Using martial weapons to combo with their bending does sound good. A few ranged attacks sure but focuses on martial makes sense for at least one spec. Using fire to shield/block attacks using an ""offense is the best defense"" mentality.

Earth. Sure use earth to protect damage but then using long range earth daggers or earth fissures/quakes to immobilize and disrupt enemy movement. The earth attunement in GW2 elementalists is really cool in that it uses geological forces to control position and causes a lot of KDs.

Water. A bit of healing, again, makes sense, but using freezing and slipping to wall off or control the field of battle is cool.

Handyland,todayilearned,1390070479.0,"&gt;If the parent's I've seen are anything to go by, it's not hard to make sure a kid grows up right. My parents didn't do much of anything besides forcing a regular bed time and ensuring homework was done first thing at a younger age. Besides that, they simply pushed college and getting work done. No real teaching went into anything else. Me and my siblings turned out okay.

&gt;And most people have children. And IMO most people aren't responsible or smart enough to have kids. Yet, they all survive. So I'm not that worried about messing up.

That's actually a really good point.  I feel confident I could beat out most people's parenting skills.  I'm still never having kids, but that's an interesting perspective on parenting."

Cookster997,ads,1390070483.0,"&gt;You don't know what I'm talking about

You're right, maybe I don't. I'll try to break down what you are saying to really understand this.

&gt;You got those guys pewdiepie smosh skydoesminecraft and so on that has a job to entertain people

Okay, smosh, pewdiepie, and sky do all make money from their content, but it isn't really a good stable job. 

&gt;they can get a job if something bad happens.

Where the hell could they get a job? Lets say Google permanently shuts down YouTube. These people will have to go looking for jobs. To use the skills they have, they probably will want to go into the entertainment and gaming industries. Just one problem: Most entry-level positions in both of these fields require at least associates degrees in college. I don't know whether the people you mentioned have degrees or not, but they would have to get them to be considered at all for a serious job. Okay, so if getting a job related to their current ""job"" isn't possible where do they go? McDonald's? I'm pretty sure they wouldn't like working there...

&gt;but for those who knows this is a big deal, 

What does this sentence fragment even mean? It is awkwardly worded...

&gt;some guys at twitter stated something important right here

And all of those people have good points. But I just want to talk between just you and me. What arguments do you have?

&gt;I will say also I think is really disrespectful of you to tell me to get a job 

Sorry, this was a massive fuck-up on my part. I was an asshole. Sorry, I just wasn't thinking straight.

&gt;I didn't meant to aggro you 

Holy fuck, please, tell me you don't use that when you talk to people... You remind me of my friend Mike. Sometimes I just want to smack him. Aggravate is only four keystrokes longer... It looks so much better if you use a real word instead of slang when you are posting an argument on reddit.

&gt;but I tell you if there where no ads in the first place there wouldn't be no YouTube at all!

*cringe* Please watch your grammar.

Anyways, what the fuck do you mean ""If there were no ads, there would be no YouTube"" ? Are you kidding? Even if YouTube had no ads, do you realise how much fucking revenue google makes off of all its other products? They could run YouTube ad-free if they wanted!

&gt;and that's why I say as I do.

Did you ever take an English class? Damn...

&gt;it is not fine to get 30% what you can get just because you can't take 10 secs to watch a ad.

Are you saying that a full **70%** of all the money the YouTubers get is from the ads? Are you shitting me? Unless Google has massively rehauled their ad scheme, the money form the ads goes straight to Google. Then,  if a video or channel produces enough revenue for them, they will pay royalties based off the number of views an likes and subscriptions. Please, correct me if I am wrong, but I am pretty sure Google suck out most of the revenue from the ads before giving the scraps to their top submitters. 

&gt;You might think that it's just a video sharing page where people put their crappy videos but it's not just that, it's entertainment that people like me watch everyday and makes me smile and forget about everything! It's great!

I could be wrong again, but from my experience, about 85% of all YouTube videos are crap... Then there is the 10 percent that is good, and the 5% that is great. My point before was that for each video that deserves ad traffic, there are at least 70 or 80 that don't but still get it. Therefore, I block the ads provided by Google, and then I personally donate money to the submissions I find worth payment. I am just trying to give credit where it is due."

I always got terrible cramps a few days before any bleeding, so that part at least was no concern.  My previous doctor had told me to just take Advil before the cramps hit, but I was so incredibly irregular that I could never predict them, and the cramps were always the first symptom.

I'd been thinking of going to a new doctor (that previous one pretty much told me to suck it up) about period issues, but this really triggered me setting up an appointment for the next week at a place run by my university.

Dark, stormy night, out in front of my own house when I hear a noise behind me.  I turn around and see a pair of eyes, at about waist level.  Then I see another pair behind that.  At that point, I knew things were gonna be pretty bad.

I tried to turn and run towards my house, but only got one step toward the door before one lunged, sinking his teeth into my back and dragging me to the ground.  Of course, I start screaming like nothing else and my brother comes out to see what is going on, calls for my dad who then comes out and dives on top of me to shield me.

My other brother then came outside with a wiffle bat and starts beating on the dog, who still has his teeth lodged in my back, to no avail.  It was around this time I looked up at my dad and told him I loved him, because at that moment, I thought, nay I *knew* I was dead.

The same thing goes for 2010's Medal of Honor, which has a much more active console community than it does on PC. So, I have both copies, and if one is low on servers, I can switch to the other.

Additionally, depending on what you are riding I guess, it may not be a good idea to let the engine slow the bike when there are cars right behind you, you may be slowing down too quickly. Since motorcycles are more narrow than cars it's harder for people to tell how fast or slow they are slowing down, regardless of brake lights. And often times the engine will slow the bike much faster than any cars normal braking habits. It is best to try and do most of your braking before you come to the stop like cars do.

Ensurdagen,masculism,1390070896.0,"""Problem Talking"" isn't the same thing as sharing emotions, bitching constantly is apparently mentally unhealthy. Sharing emotion isn't saying ""THIS is bothering me,"" it is saying ""THIS is what I feel"" without regarding it as negative. Awareness of emotion gives other people insight and makes social interaction far smoother, if everyone involved is emotionally literate. Believing that sharing emotions is ""weird"" IS a problem, it means they don't see how to fully integrate how they feel with how they interact. If something is weird it is strange, and therefore would often be experienced as embarrassing socially--but these boys don't have the emotional skills to distinguish embarrassment and share it. Guessing what other men are feeling and expecting them to do the same isn't sustainable unless you happen to make good guesses. There are healthy, assertive ways to share emotion, and none of them involve bitching.

She makes some good points otherwise.

Pretty badly, and all the blame is yours.

Just because you didn't stick your penis in her doesn't mean you didn't completely betray your girlfriend.  If you wanted to pursue someone else you should have broken up with her and given it a shot.

Instead you decided to be a scumbag about it.  It very well may be that E did still like you, until you tried to get her to help you cheat on your girlfriend.  I can imagine that it would sour her opinion of you pretty quick.  She probably thinks you are disgusting, and she is right about it.

Anyways, my advice is that you breakup with your girlfriend (something you probably should have done a while ago) and avoid both her and E.  

Go no contact with both of them and take some time alone.  Then go try to meet someone new after you have had time to be introspective for a while."

No one said they are the same thing.  How is it that people cannot deal with comparison for similarity and analogy without assuming equality?  

And you know slavery isn't *just* American, right?  

And as Alice Walker said in a book review:
&gt;The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white, or women created for men.

&gt;inexpensive way for a population to eat

Oh geez.  You *know* how heavily subsidized meat and dairy is, right?  (And corn and soy which is used for their feed).  It is not ""cheap"" we make it that way.  Cheap is beans and rice.  

No, it is MUCH more inexpensive to eat veggies.  How much per pound is meat?  It is much less than a dollar a pound for beans and grains. 

Humans are by nature scavengers.  Yes, we can eat everything.  But we live *longer and healthier* when we are vegans.  And what is ""meant to"" anyway?  Are we meant to fly planes?  Get operations?  Use the internet?

Yes, eradicating livestock is a HUGE step towards solving hunger.  This is an issue you may be very interested in.

This practice can be seen back in a lot of popular fiction, such as The Last Samurai.

I also read a story once about how Japanese elders in a village would want to commit suicide if they were no longer useful to their community. Normally this was done at the point where they lost their teeth. One woman though had perfect teeth, even at an old age where she could no longer work on the land.

sockalicious,personalfinance,1390071632.0,"The trouble with this question is that there are a lot of unknown factors.  Let's list a few:

* The 10 year old car is an unknown quantity and may not in fact be cheap to maintain.  It's out of warranty and someone may have abused it.  You're gambling when you buy it.  If it turns out to be cheap to maintain and insure it and the fuel economy is much better and driving it prevents you from wearing out your WRX, it is a better option.  That's an 'if'.

* Depends on the warranty and maintenance coverage of the WRX, too.  If your warranty is straight years without a mileage limit, and you're putting 30K a year on it, you'll get more out of your warranty for the WRX than you would if you drove it 5K a year.

* Depends on how long you'll keep the WRX and the beater.  In general the longer you can hold on to any car, the better off you do from a money perspective.  If the WRX is going to bore you in 3 years and you're going to want a different car, then just drive it for 3 years, run the odometer up, then sell it.

* Google thinks an WRX gets 19/25 mpg.  A late model Camry gets 25/35.  Assuming mostly highway travel on your 25K commute, that is a difference of about 285 gallons per year on your highway commute, which comes out to $940.  That about covers your insurance; oil, plugs, tires and other maintenance will not be covered by the $40 a year difference, although those things also would presumably be more costly on the WRX.  Taxes, smog and registration as well as the up front cost of the sensible car make this idea a non-starter.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1390071755.0,"&gt;we had a goodbye, she held me tight, cried a lot, and then kissed me three times (everyone I've told has been amazed at that part)

Look, I know this can be tough, but the fact is there's nothing that amazing or strange about the above. She probably doesn't even know how to articulate what's going on (or isn't confident/brave enough to), so I'll put it out here: for awhile now, she has been feeling the strength of her feelings for you fade. People fall out of love. That's what happened here. Sometimes there is no reason, as in this case. She hasn't had a ""good"" reason for her fading feelings, so she hasn't brought it up because there is no external reason for it to happen that you could address or fix - she just doesn't love you or want to be in a relationship with you anymore. 

She cried and kissed you because she still cares for you - you didn't do anything to hurt her, you seem to be a great guy, and she is feeling guilty and upset about hurting you. I know it's cliche, but it might help to think of the old phrase: she loves you, but she's not in love with you. 
There are still strong lingering feelings of affection but she has lost that ""spark"".

Think about it this way, the worst case scenario is that you are right and she ends up leaving you.  If that happens, you end up exactly where you are right now, just with more experience.  In other words, both outcomes from trying and hoping things work out are better than the outcome of not trying at all.

As you get more relationship experience, you tend to realize that if things don't work out then you were simply not compatible.  If you ask out a girl and she says no, you weren't really rejected, she just wasn't interested.  You shouldn't want to date someone who isn't interested, so her rejecting you was a good thing.

Anyways, focus on just doing what you want to do and less on why it won't work.  It sounds like you wanted to be in an LTR with her, so you just should have said so."

No, Jesus is not literally a yeti or bigfoot. Furthermore, the existence of God has absolutely nothing to do with the existence of Jesus.

My point was, while nuclear disasters have the *potential* to be incredibly dangerous, fact of the matter is that such accidents that do such damage are the result of *gross* human error, and nuclear power shouldn't be judged on those grounds alone, especially considering that modern reactor design negates that risk even further.

Your logic essentially boils down into ""It has the potential to be really bad, so we shouldn't use it."" For an analogy, let's take air travel and automobiles. Cars have lots of frequent, small scale accidents - one or two people dead, but very often. Airplanes, though, oh *man* - when they crash, you've got a body count in the hundreds or even *thousands,* depending on what you hit. Does that mean we shouldn't use airplanes for travel? No, it just means that we have to take extreme care in negating the #1 cause of air accidents - pilot error. You can see it in modern aircraft in spades, in terms of automation systems: the planes can practically fly themselves, pilots stick around to make sure the robot doesn't screw up and the people don't panic about there being ""no pilot."""

bunker_man,Christianity,1390071944.0,"I think it's possible that many religions in general will after slowly decreasing, have a slow evolution-resurgenece, after the same thing happens to them that is happening to buddhism in the west now. People will begin to interpret it not as a set in stone concrete whole, but as more of a philosophy school of possibilities. As time goes on, people's attention will shift, and religion will become more eastern. This will likely also relate to a lot of the things that are kind of vague ideas now becoming more mainstream, and actually effecting people's philosophy. In fact, a vague spiritualist mentality may resurge as well, once descriptions of likely fundamental properties of the universe that are actually more science based become more commonly known. One obvious example being that as time goes on, materialism has less and less meaning, and ultimately we are most likely dealing with a form of neutral monism. Maybe even mathematical monism, which many people will interpret as Idealism. 

The word ""God"" will probably take on a more new age approach in geneal too, leading ultimately probably even to eventually atheism stopping it's growth and going back down, as it loses anything to define itself relative to."

Life-in-Death,AdviceAnimals,1390072036.0,"In my study of neurobio we never talked about insects but I'' do my best.

Here they are are talking about hormones (not nerves) specifically.  Bees have the same hormones other animals do that reduce pain. 

Basically they are saying since they have pain-relieving hormones and pain-relieving receptors and they are activated in circumstances which would cause pain, it means that they most-likely feel pain.  

Here is evidence for pain-response in fly larvae: 

We describe a paradigm for nociception in Drosophila. In response to the touch of a probe heated above 38°C, Drosophila larvae produce a stereotypical rolling behavior, unlike the response to an unheated probe. In a genetic screen for mutants defective in this noxious heat response, we identified the painless gene. Recordings from wild-type larval nerves identified neurons that initiated strong spiking above 38°C, and this activity was absent in the painless mutant. 

And:
&gt;Also, crustaceans, insects, and mollusks show less reaction to a noxious stimulus when they receive morphine. For example, morphine reduces the reaction of mantis shrimps to electric shock, praying 
mantises to electric shock, and land snails to a hot surface.

synonyms:	homosexual, lesbian; More
relating to or used by homosexuals.
""feminist, black, and gay perspectives""


2.
lighthearted and carefree.

""Nan had a gay disposition and a very pretty face""
brightly colored; showy; brilliant.
""a gay profusion of purple and pink sweet peas""


**3.
informaloffensive
foolish, stupid, or unimpressive.

""making students wait for the light is kind of a gay rule""**

------------------------------------------------------------

It's kind of an actual definition now...type ""define: gay"" into google, and that last (#3) pops up.

&gt;I believe it's school-yard homophobia that hasn't been stamped out by the ""wisdom of age."" If that's the case, how can any of us accept it?

Well, for one, you can accept it because it's not used in a school-yard homophobic sense anymore, and definitely not the case. It doesn't matter if that's where it came from. It's not used in ANY homophobic sense, *unless* someone is specifically referring to homophobia.  You can't act like there's no distinction. It's all in your head if you think it is. 

&gt;we have specifically stopped calling the disabled those words

No we haven't. Again, you're in denial if you think we have.

&gt;so I don't see how any continuation of the word used to describe exclusively negative things can be a step in the right direction.

So you're happy with it keeping it's derogatory meaning then? Oh okay. Well we're done arguing I guess.


And just for good measure:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change

Gay is used as an example here, though I would say it's incomplete in it's morphology of meaning. It's changing, with or without you. You can think it's hate speech all you want, but it's too widely used to stop it. Sorry mate.

Just to be clear, I'm not defending it's usage in a derogatory way. I'm defending it's usage and meaning in a non-derogatory way. It can be used in both senses, but it's vastly different context, body language, ect ect. I'm sorry you're so offended by it, but you'll have to stay offended for a really long time. You can't make a law against using words when the meaning is changing, so you'll just have to stay offended. Sorry."

&gt;And there IS the space we need to raise our animals on pasture

I have no idea where this wildly incorrect belief is from  

&gt;Extensive cattle ranching is the number one culprit of deforestation in virtually every Amazon country, and it accounts for 80% of current deforestation (Nepstad et al. 2008). Alone, the deforestation caused by cattle ranching is responsible for the release of 340 million tons of carbon to the atmosphere every year, equivalent to 3.4% of current global emissions.

&gt;Since the 1960s, the cattle herd of the Amazon Basin has increased from 5 million to more than 70-80 million heads. Around 15% of the Amazon forest has been replaced and around 80% of the deforested areas have been covered by pastures (approximately 900 000 km2).

http://www.fao.org/docrep/ARTICLE/WFC/XII/0568-B1.HTM

Uh, you know the *actual* proportion of land needed to raise animals than ""malls"" right?  But yeah, malls and racetracks and roads suck.  Public transit rocks and multiuse living rocks.  You also know that livestock contributes more global warming gases than ALL TRANSPORTATION COMBINED?  

No, the problem is too many people eating too much meat.  America is like 5% of the world's population eating 20% of the worlds meat.

Take this advice with a grain of salt, but I would not go this route. Wasn't her original problem that your relationship was too much like a friendship to begin with? Why would you then try to start another relationship with her... by imitating a friendship? This girl has made it clear she does not want another friend. She wants to be courted, so court her.

Talk to her honestly, tell her you've thought about things and want another chance. Ask her if you can start over, and ask her on a *date*. Be very clear. ""I think you're really beautiful and I want to take you on a date. Will you go out to dinner with me?"" Do subtle things to build the spark between you two - compliment her (but not too often), touch her gently on the arm or the back if you think she would be open to it, basically build a romantic vibe between you two, *not* a friendship vibe. After dinner, if the date's gone well, you should try to kiss her. Whether on the cheek or on the lips, you need to make your intentions clear. If you're uncertain, ask her. ""May I kiss you goodnight?"" Don't hug. Friends hug. Boyfriends kiss. This doesn't mean shove your tongue down her throat but make your intentions clear.

The point is that personal perspective, childhood indoctrination, and the pressures exerted by our society and family all have very powerful effects. It allows us to see so clearly the flaws in other people's religions to the point of ridiculing them whilst simultaneously being frightfully blind to the flaws in one's own religion. It allows one to excuse the immoral actions of a revered character whilst simultaneously abhorring them were they to be committed by a contemporary. it allows one to live by two moral codes, their own (far more benevolent) moral intuition and the absolute one espoused by their religion. It people to deny science based upon evidence simply so as to hold on to unproven self-contradictory faith based ideas.

ThePinkPanther2,AskWomen,1390072808.0,"Several times. But to be honest, I think I do this to myself. Say for instance, a group of guy friends are in the middle of a scientific joke, you know the ones I'm talking about, and when it gets to the ""funny"" part - everyone is laughing but me. Very much a wet blanket moment.

For me, it feels  dishonest to laugh when you don't get the joke. I see people laughing for the sake of keeping the group dynamic less awkward (and cheerful?) but I don't like doing that. Maybe that makes things more awkward, pushing myself out of their group, but laughing when I don't understand something cheapens the sincerity. 

&gt; and the people at the party didn't want you there.

Dunno why people wouldn't want me there. I don't necessarily intrude on anyone's conversation; however, my female presence in all male groups does shift the topic. They'll try to lighten the conversation rather than straight talk about technology, science, and their studies. Making people feel comfortable and included in the group dynamic is my number one priority so I accept their peace offering and will roll with the different topic change. 

Unless I'm tired. People who have spent 9 hours on their feet, dealing with demanding customers or a micro-managing boss, can understand that a long hot shower and a good book is a bunch more exciting than interacting with more people. Even when they're your friends. That was NYE for me.  I wanted my pajamas, a cup of hot coffee, a good book, and some music - ended up the anti-social wet blanket at my SO's NYE party. Probably could have fallen asleep on a warm shoulder at any moment. Too tired to eat, too tired to talk, too tired in general. Entirely consumed with dread for tomorrow.. shuffling to work at 9AM on less than 4 hours of sleep. 

Boggles my mind that I had forsaken the CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN because I was too tired. I missed out on a chocolate fountain. God damn it all. I think I'm more upset with myself about all the good food I didn't try than fitting in with the group. I forgot the point I was trying to make.. ah, yes. Sometimes it's nice to know you're not home alone (per usual) and you can say that you tried to socialize (not in my case though). Also gives you the opportunity to develop a thick skin and to see what type of group you 'click' with best. "

This statement actually AGREES with the article I posted, and yet you think you disagree because, like I said, you didn't read it.

Here, I'll quote some of it for you since you can't be bothered.

&gt; While the team and fans may expect more from Bickell because he signed a contract, perhaps these expectations are a bit out of touch with reality.  Bickell's new contract was based upon known performance over several seasons.

...

&gt; Over his career with the Blackhawks, Bickell has maintained, even into this season, a rather steady Points Per 60 rate. 

...

&gt; His possession statistics indicate fairly consistent performances despite a few off games so this might be more of an indictment of the defense and/or goaltending.

... 

&gt; Bickell's possession rates last season and this season show increases over those earlier in his career, and his individual numbers on a game by game basis this season are consistent with his teammates.

...

&gt; In the games since being benched in the third period against San Jose, Bickell has put up sparkling possession numbers and while this is obviously a small sample size upon which to defend him, it is also a small sample size from which to condemn him.

TL;DR: maybe you should read more than the headline before you comment."

You were right!"" - that's totally ridiculous.  He should have believed me because obviously I know better than him.  As far as I know, men don't really face a cat-calling problem.

This is different because *both* men and women have it hard when it comes to dating.  He believed that he had it so hard, that a woman couldn't have it harder.  I don't think that, if you experience a hardship, you should just take someone's word for it when they say their hardship is harder.  I also don't think that shows a reluctance to take a woman's opinion.  If I'm working a tedious office job, and a friend is working in construction, and I don't believe him when he says his job is harder, it's not because he's a man, but because my job is hard too, and it's hard for me to imagine that his job might be harder.  So maybe I try it out, work construction for a day, and say, ""Oh shit, you're right.  This is harder.""  It doesn't mean that I think a woman needed to try it out to be sure, it just means that we both have hard jobs and knowing which is harder when you haven't experienced it can be difficult.

And now I've said ""hard"" more times than a romance novel."

I actually feel like /u/twistedcodex's post would fit in perfectly in /r/talesfromtamriel, which he has actually posted in as well. So I'm happy about that.

I would be more than happy to discuss why things won't work with people in the TES: VI threads, and in fact I have tried. What follows is never intelligent discussion, however. My comments are received with downvotes (which goes against the function of downvotes, but that's a different argument for a different time) or comments to the affect of ""Why are you being a buzzkill?"" I try but nobody is receptive to it. What's the purpose of the ""democratic"" nature of this place (using the words of /u/Moonburn elsewhere in this thread) if every voice isn't heard equally?

I *am* glad you agree with me in that the frequency of the posts are irritating. If the mods could work out some way to sticky a thread at the top of the sub once a month (every two months would be preferable for me), it would be much less frustrating. If people want more than that, there is a subreddit for TES: VI discussion over at /r/nextelderscrolls.

/r/nextelderscrolls is not a *division* or *separation* of /r/ElderScrolls that takes away members forever, because that's what I see people painting it as. Imagine it as DLC, an add-on to the larger subreddit that improves existing content.

If people are so ""bored,"" wouldn't they have just been using that sub anyways? Is there a lack of awareness for it?

You concern is both wise, and timely.  Issues arise when, e.g. in an overvalued market like we have today, economic growth is not sufficient to exceed inflation, and negative real returns are produced.  E.g. right now CAPE/PE10 and Market Cap:GDP metrics (both of which are extremely reliable indicators of future returns) indicate nominal returns of 1-2% at today's valuations.  Couple that with record corporate profits (&gt;2x historical average), record low wage:gdp, and much higher than average earnings multiples, and you are pretty much guaranteed that you will not beat inflation by buying index funds at today's prices.  It's bad enough that the financial planning community is starting to reevaluate 4% as a ""safe"" rate... just read an interesting study recommending ~2.5% as a safe withdrawal rate, as 4% has an estimated 18% failure rate at today's market valuations.

bunker_man,Christianity,1390073303.0,"&gt; Being anti-abortion doesn't make a person a misogynist, but the stance in itself is - in my opinion - misogynistic.

Thinking it is comes from a rather extremist interpretation of either what's actually going on, or how to actually interpret mysoginy. The issue is not about sex in general, except circumstantially. Projecting that it is is merely something used to circumvent discussing the isue itself in favor of an ontological conclusion. People's opinion on the issue may be wrong, but the only way to interpret it as mysoginistic is basically to ignore the actual crux of what's being discussed in the issue in favor of an extremist interpretation of postmodern thought that essentially amounts to saying that since if the issue is indeed an issue that it would be inconvenient for other social balances, that therefore it is not allowed to be considered one. In other words, dishonesty trying to be an ideological point. Even if being pro life was wrong, this would still be a dishonest reason to indicate why.

Teams need to have regular reports, and before a consumer can give them money to gain access, the team *MUST* present a schedule of major milestones. There must be penalties for the team missing a milestone in addition to some kind of payment for ""damages"" to the players if the game goes too far off schedule. If the community investing in the game comes to the consensus, they should have a ""kill switch"" power to cancel their support for the project altogether, just as publishers do.

This would require some kind of board of professionals who have experience in managing projects, as they will have the experience to evaluate schedules to see if they're feasible."

When I came home, my parents sent me to my room while they discussed it. They said they weren't mad, just disappointed and they could see my points, but to never do such a thing again with out their permission. They even allowed me to go to a party that night. I remember being really relieved and thinking I had the best parents ever. I still have the piercing, almost 6 years later. "

There are a couple problems:  
1) You can't see the tiny glimpses into the fog of war (you can often see parts of tiles in normal view with normal settings) which hurts early scouting a tiny bit  
2) You can't see buildings being built (especially when checking to see how close people are to finishing wonders)  
3) You can't see river flowing (to get a sense where the ocean/lake/sea is.  
4) Of course, it looks less cool :(

PatHeist,battlestations,1390073656.0,"80c might be a little hot for some CPUs (many intel ones are recommended to be kept under 72 or 65c). For any GPU it should be fine, though. Other components should generally be kept under 50c, with some exceptions like power delivery systems if you're overclocking.

Generally you want to measure the temperature under a stress test, but if you don't really do that many intensive things it would probably be fine launching a hardware intensive game and playing with HW Monitor open in the background for an hour or so and seeing what the maximum temperature readings are. The only real issue with keeping it in the closet is that the air would heat up over time. 

If it does end up getting a little hot, there are plenty of things like after-market CPU coolers and silence optimized fans that would let you keep your computer out in your room and still be inaudible. There are also PSUs that don't turn the fan on unless they go over 35-45% power usage.

The Fractal Design Define R4 is a case that would probably fit your space - especially the white one. Corsair AF120 (quiet edition) fans would be a good cooling option, or perhaps something from Noctua if you're willing to spend a bit more. For the CPU cooler Nocuta is also a good bet, but there are other (often cheaper) alternatives that will also be far more quiet than the stock one. The Corsair RM series of PSUs are quiet, produce little heat, and won't run the fan until your power usage goes up (like in games). If you need a quiet video card, I'd recommend the ASUS DCII cards, or an after market cooler like what one can get from Arctic Cooling with their Accelero Xtreme series.

Beyond that, water cooling is also an option, but far pricier and a little more involved (to say the least). But it can get you far lower temperatures and more quiet systems than you could with air cooling."

mugen_is_here,Anxiety,1390073806.0,"&gt; because you absolutely cannot help it

While I agree with the context in which you're explaining this I feel this fact can be mistaken by people and have meanings that you did not intend. So I'm going to put in my two cents here.

The image advices the reader to just ""not care"" about whatever is bothering them. However, people who have anxiety problems (myself for ex) start thinking about how things are going to turn out and start worrying. So I agree that it's difficult to let go of the anxiety where it feels like we just cannot help not worrying.

But it's not that we can't do anything about it. There are different ways of decreasing your anxiety in situations. And there *are* exercises that you can do that really work. As an ex. I've been practicing CBT while meeting with a Therapist for the past 2 years. While my progress has been slow, I have made some positive progress. When I compare myself from how I was 2 years before I can see that I have definitely improved and my anxiety is much lesser. I'm just letting it out for other people like me out there who are suffering from anxiety - to have some hope, there are ways to get better. If possible, do try to meet a therapist and get professional help. You will enjoy the experience of improving yourself."
PixelOrange,AdviceAnimals,1390073806.0,"There's a gas station that I frequent that sells 55oz drinks for a dollar. Refills are $0.79. Other sizes vary.

When you're going to a place that sells their drinks for more than a dollar for a 24 oz, no one is going to buy a second one.

It's worth the potential loss in sales for customer loyalty. People are irritated by things like ""fill your own - no refills"". Either put it behind the counter or give free refills.

For what it's worth, whenever I've wanted a refill at a behind the counter place I just to ask for one and I've always been given it. I've never experienced a place that would deny me something like that. I don't drink very much pop anymore but when I did, refills were easy to come by."

Despite being in the same conference, Florida State is on a completely different level than Wake. But in the NFL, the the 6-8 Jets were able to beat the 14-0 Colts in 2009, ultimately leading them into the AFC championship game. So no. CFB isn't more entertaining than the NFL because upsets don't exist the same way they do in the NFL. The concept of under dogs is essentially dead, as evident by the seemingly perpetual dominance by the SEC. When will a MAAC team win a National Championship? Never.

Because not only do I want to have all the same advantages and opportunities offered to men at my level, but I also want those men to ask *me* out. I want to be bought shit, and I *like* the power that sex appears to get me. I hate when guys hold the door open for me or think that I can't carry something because I'm a girl, but I love feeling provided for. I *like* that I probably got into better colleges than I should have because of not only *who* I am, but *what* I am. I'm heavily into raising awareness of both male and female sexual harassment, but I'm also a huge hedonist and enjoy flirting and dangerously toeing the sexual harassment line (I do stop when people get uncomfortable though. It's not fun when it's not fun for both parties...) for my own amusement.

I volunteer at domestic abuse centers and vouch for any local men's domestic abuse centers (so none of the men's ones right now. There are none in any of the areas I am frequently in and it's rather concerning.) I vouch for the Innocence Project and regularly diplomat my way into in-conversation teaching moments about healthy sex and what rape is and laws and everything, but if I don't think I can swing it, then I won't pipe up.

jednorazowa,AskWomen,1390074252.0,"If I were the one trying to lose weight in this situation, the ideal would be for my spouse to prepare healthy foods that I enjoy and that meet whatever my current dietary requirements are (especially foods that are time-consuming to prepare, like big awesome salads).  That would make optimal eating effortless for me because the food is right there and I'd have to go to more effort to eat something else.

I do get that not everyone would want to do this. It is a lot of work (that's why I don't always do it myself!) and it might feel like a waste of time if you don't like that food yourself.  But, nevertheless, that is what the ideal would be for me.

On a more reasonable level, I'd want my spouse to ask me - only once, at the beginning - if there's anything they can do to help, and then do that, but not raise the issue again.  I don't want to have to keep ""discussing"" it or feel like my food intake or fitness levels are being monitored or that I'm being judged if I have a lapse.  It's a difficult and awkward and unpleasant process, so I really just want to be left alone.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs
Consider Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As the basic level, people require food, water, sleep, air, shelter. These needs are just the bare minimum to keep us alive. I would agree that most, if not all, of these are met by the majority of users on Reddit. However, beyond the bare basics, it all falls apart.

Some people post that they are not safe in their homes, for various reasons. There could be an abusive family member to blame. Many people claim that they do not have love, nor family. This makes the need for love/belonging not met. Then, there are self-esteem issues. People post that they have low self esteem due to inability to hold a job, or because of lack of love, whatever. Finally, there is the inability many feel to self-actualize, that is, they feel they cannot accomplish anything worthwhile, cannot solve problems in their lives, or have issues of morality that are making their lives difficult.

Therefore, very few people are actually getting their needs met, in reality. And many come to Reddit to post as a way of seeking help.

I spent my entire life in various parts of CO. I love it, but I moved to SLC, because CO became too expensive. 

In SLC I prefer the east side of the valley up against the mountainside. I moved from sugar house to Sandy and both neighborhoods are great for different reasons. Sandy is where I am now, and because it's further south from downtown the pollutions is not quite as bad as it is downtown. We live 5 minutes from 2 of the main canyon entrances, so hiking trails and things of that nature are very close. We hike just about every weekend in the summertime. 

As others have mentioned SLC has a great counterculture presence and a lot of diversity. There is something for everyone. It's big enough to have elements of a big city and varied enough to also have a small town feel. I know that sounds contrary, but it's the best way Incan describe it. People here are very friendly, crime is relatively low, there are plenty of jobs, and the cost of living is reasonable."

We had a very high match so I wrote her a nice long message.  She responded that she thought it was funny and I seemed really nice, but that she had just ended things with someone and needed some time.  I told her to contact me when she was ready and basically forgot about it.

After a couple months I was occasionally going on dates but nothing serious and I got a message from her asking if I was still interested.  I was, so we started messaging, then texting, then calling, then having long phone calls every night, and finally going on a real date a few weeks later.

dianthe,politics,1390074745.0,"&gt;So you genuinely think that /u/JLContessa thinks that every pregnancy ever should be terminated? That is what you just said.

Of course not. We are talking about situations where a woman is at an abortion clinic which is where the ultrasound being discussed in this thread would be administered. I guess you weren't following. What I genuinely think is that if a woman at an abortion clinic changes her mind about abortion after seeing the ultrasound it is still her mind to change and changing that mind could be the best decision, not going through with the abortion."

Can you even pronounce the words ""hypostasis"" or ""homoousia""? If you don't know what these words mean and how they apply to Christian philosophy of God, then you have no room to talk.

&gt;Not to Christianity. Jesus is god incarnate, a different aspect of the same being...that Barron would have you believe isn't a being. You can't have it both ways.

Or, you are completely out of your intellectual league so you're grasping at straws to come up with ridiculous conclusions. 

I'm listening to his lecture now. Yeah, you have no clue what you're talking about. God is not a thing in nature. That's what he said. It does not contradict anything about Christianity no matter how much you want it to.

&gt;Claiming Barron is more qualified based on a career of promoting his beliefs is like claiming a homeopath is qualified to make pronouncements of the validity of homeopathy. 

Except that's not what I said, I claimed he is qualified based on the fact that he is extremely highly educated and a professor of philosophy.

&gt;The priest class doesn't get to be ""an authority"" on matters of religious philosophy. Arguments should stand on their own. Dedicating your life to the skywizard doesn't mean your opinion on the skywizard is any more valid than anyone elses, and in fact gives good reason to discount your opinion as someone with a vested interest.

It's like you didn't read a word I said and just started babbling nonsense all over the keyboard.

nostalgicBadger,MMORPG,1390075081.0,"- Ragnarok Online - I played it for a very long time and did everything I wanted to do. This still might be my favorite MMO I've played.

- Granado Espada - I played this off and on from beta to about a year ago. It was another Hakkyu Kim title and had a ton of potential at launch, but it was poorly marketed, dropped out of p2p within a few months, and has increasingly suffered from a poorly implemented, economy-breaking cash shop system and some truly awful service from the various publishers that have picked it up.

- World of Warcraft - Maybe it's because I'd been playing MMOs for a long time before it was released, but for the few months I gave it, it failed to impress me. Not that there was anything wrong with it -- the class system, while it wasn't especially innovative, certainly wasn't bad either, and the story was probably one of the better I'd played up to that point. It just felt so generic to me. 

- Mabinogi - I really wanted to like this game, but it honestly just never grabbed me.

- Perfect World - It was a very pretty game (for the time), but it became too repetitive.

- Final Fantasy XIV - Despite a very restrictive class system (yes, you can play any class, but there's little to no variation in *how* you're able to play those classes), I actually enjoyed this game a lot. Unfortunately, my account go hacked by a gold spammer, and Square Enix terminated my account ""after a thorough investigation"" -- which was interesting, because the hacker was probably signing on from another country and created a new character named ""asfg asfg"" to spam; I think any investigation would have made it clear the account had been hacked. Support told me several times that they would fix it and they never did. The game itself was solid, but I don't think I'll ever buy another release from Square Enix, because of how they handled this. 

- The Secret World - I plan on picking this up again soon. It could stand to be more polished, but it's one of the most unique (and I think better) MMOs I've played. Unfortunately, if you leave for a while, re-orienting yourself can be difficult, and that's normally the problem I run into. I do hope they stick around for a while, because I appreciate that they branched out from the usual sword-and-sorcery and sci-fi themes, and I don't want publishers to be afraid of that risk.

There have been a bunch of others, but most of them are either too old to be worth bringing up (Nexus, Dark Ages, Redmoon, the original Lineage, etc.) or they didn't leave much of an impression at all."

The first cigarette I ever smoked was on my best friend's 17th birthday. Some of my friends were already heavy smokers at the time, and I completely looked down on them. What a waste of money, I said to myself. How could they fall for such a stupid thing. Feeling cocky, I wanted to try one just to prove that they won't get to me. I was kinda drunk at the time, it made sense back then. So I light up my first cigarette ever, almost burning my fingers in the process, I might add. After the first couple of coughs it wasn't too bad, I sure as hell wasn't going to let my friends think I was a pussy for not liking it, so I smoked it and had another one later that evening. I didn't think much about it at this point. 


Then, next monday at school, my friends are standing outside, smoking. Since nobody I knew was inside, and I didn't want to be alone during lunch break, I join them. They ask me if I want to smoke too, I said sure, why not. Makes me look cool and edgy. I still was adamant that I would never ever ever get addicted. I am someone who occasionally smokes now, is that such a bad thing? Grow up.

Then, as I joined my friends outside more and more, they slowly start accusing me of mooching off of em. They wouldn't give me any more cigarettes, told me to get my own if I wanted to smoke so badly. I was like, fine, whatever, try to stop me. I was still mostly scared that they saw through me and thought I wasn't 'cool' anymore. So I bought my own pack of cigarettes, with a lighter. Felt kinda weird, but I still didn't think much of it. 

That weekend it all changed. I am sitting at home, saturday night, there's nothing to do this evening, so I'm sitting at home, playing video games. The whole evening I had a small feeling that something was missing, but I could never put my finger on it. I thought I was hungry, so I took a snack but I was left unsatisfied. I thought I was thirsty, so I took another beer (legal drinking age in the Netherlands was 16 at the time) but I still wasn't satisfied. It wasn't until I did some major thinking that I realized I craved a cigarette. Really, really bad. But my parents had just quit smoking a few months prior (yes, really.) and they didn't think/know I smoked at all, so I waited until everyone went to bed, then secretly smoked outside of my bedroom window. 


If I were to write a thousand page novel on the euphoria of smoking after you've been craving, I still wouldn't be able to properly describe it. It's awesome. It's completely and utterly mindblowing, and if you've never smoked before, you can't know what this feels like. Imagine not drinking anything for a year, and after that year, you drink the best drink you ever drank, except its only side-effect was that it added the entire year of thirst back within an hour after drinking it.


Fast forward to today, three years later. I'm still a smoker, and my family still doesn't know. I kinda want to stop, but at the same time my gut says I should never ever stop. The euphoria is just... wow.

OctavianRex,AskMen,1390075190.0,"Ok let's say we're making a movie. We want our character to appeal to the largest audience. To do so we're going to create a character who lacks as many cultural touchstones as possible, giving us pretty much a blank slate. 

1. Make the character a white mutt or unknown Caucasian ethnicity. There is no real unified white culture, so our character isn't going to have to follow any real set rules based on culture.
2. Make their religion irrelevant or non nondescript christian if the movie takes place in the winter. Christmas is the only holiday worth marketing for. Can use Catholic for better set pieces.
3. Give them either a nondescript office job or make them an architect if we want them to be more creative. Architect is the go to I'm creative but make money job as most people have no idea what one does. 
4. Age wise, go for mid twenties to thirties. They need to be out of college but not at the point where its weird that they aren't settled down. 
4. Finally sex. Make our character male. Men are not perceived to have man problems and are more believable if increased physicality comes into play. Also Men usually don't include their maleness in their self identity while women often define themselves in part due by their womenness. Now this might be because Men have a history of being the dominate group in society, but the effect is the same.

Now our mid twenties white male architect who leans christian can go out into the world. He has no culture or really any identity that needs to be explained. Our audience has zero preconceived notions about him. He can just be slotted into any role as we see fit, and our audience will project themselves onto him. 

Deviation from this pattern can be done for plot reasons, but for the most part if a character doesn't need to deviate it isn't worth the loss in projection. The one exception is Will Smith."

myhonestyaccount,nyc,1390075467.0,"Here's where I've ordered from before:

Hummus and Pita Co: Order took FOREVER! But food was pretty good.

Il Baggato: Absolutely disgusting, undercooked chewy pasta. Was supposed to have basil, but there was a tiny shred of basil on top, with tons of gross cheese and a thin coating of sauce. Also asked for grilled chicken to be included in pasta, received one breast in a separate container grilled to a crisp.

Aroma Espresso Bar: i love this place! A few blocks down from my work, but took forever to come. Food was cold even though i asked the lady to assure me that my coffee and food wouldn't be cold. Oh well.

La Churreria: This is the place that gave me the despicable salad in my salad/sandwich lunch combo. I just threw it all out because it was embarrassing to even have in the open. Sandwich was cold.

Hot Kitchen: Pretty good soup dumplings. Fast delivery (Chiense food always comes so quickly!)

88 Orchard Irving Farm Coffee Roasters: Awesome place!

Calexico LES: WORST ORDER EVER. TO DATE. It was completely inedible. I asked for sauce on the side, and the food arrived LATE&lt; COLD, with the sauce ALL OVER, not on the side, and completely inedible. It was so bad that i wasn't even sure if they included meat in my dish, everything was plastered in this congealed sauce gunk on top. I've never felt so nauseous from a food order.

Houston Village Farm Deli Cafe &amp; Grocery: Awesome place! You can order pints of ice cream and all your grocery needs from here. The food is pretty good. No frills.

Le Basket: Don't get their Italian Sub Sandwich. Flavorless, with all the shitty bits of lettuce and flavorless, dead peppers.

Je'Bon Sushi &amp; Pan Asian: Spicy ramen was awesome! Very fragrant so many don't order it while at work! They put the spicy stuff on the side in a container, so you mix in as much as you want. Ramen as well.

Oaxaca Taqueria (East 7th): Loved it! Not the best by any stretch, but still fresh tacos!

Motorino Pizza: Ordered the margherita pizza. There is nothing more disappointing than cold pizza. Nothing.

Fiat Cafe: Hard, undercooked penne. Tiramisu came lopsided and messed up."

It goes beyond not being the ""best source"" - it's pretty much the opposite of a credible source.  That website is pretty much a repository of discredited nonsense - anti-vaxxers, ""9/11 truth"", and the like.

&gt; but I'm on my phone on my work break. 

Perfectly understandable that you wouldn't have a good source available in such a circumstance.

&gt; If you'd like, I can find more later tonight. 

If you do find a credible source, please let me know.  

Oh, and don't just tell me - tell the organic farmers who tried to preemptively sue Monsanto. They lost the case - pretty badly.  They essentially said that what you said was happening and wanted to get the court to preemptively block Monsanto from suing them under similar circumstances.

The judge then said what I said - please give a single credible instance of this happening.  One.  They couldn't -- even after offering a fairly substantial finder's fee to anyone who could find one for them.

So you won't just win an internet argument if it turns out you're right -- you might get a sizable amount of money, too.

&gt; There are plenty documentaries, articles, and blog posts on this subject.

Homophobia is more prominent towards gay men than gay women. 

Most films/sitcoms/etc feature male leads. 

Being tall is seen as authority and men are generally taller.

Young men are more likely to commit suicide, dropout of school, abuse drugs and become homeless yet we are not using the necessary resources to alleviate these social ills. While masculinity is the default we to understand the cultural and social blind spot we have for men's issues

Cancer cells are almost constantly dividing.  When we treat cancer we often give the patient chemicals that kill dividing cells.

The problem is that other cells (hair follicles, immune system, stomach lining) that frequently divide tend to get killed as well.

 I see some things that would be more effective.

* Fox farms is a decent nutrient; but is so acidic compared to alternative products. Starting with R/O or neutral pH water, the Fox Farm is guaranteed to give you an acidic pH. It will definitely work but isn't optimal.

* Do not use pH adjusters, it's nasty stuff and an entirely arbitrary band-aid for an issue you aren't supposed to have in the first place.

* I recommend a pH neutral solution such as FloraNova for beginners. As always, with soil, feed the nutrients every other watering (unless you are conservative).

* That light is off to the side, rather than above the plant. The reflective material will help, but you'll need to be turning the plant at least twice a day.

* Avoid miracle grow products next time, it will work for sure, but it may throw some odd flavor to the bud.

This is definitely an interesting start, I'm intrigued to see how it turns out.

Mainly, I think you and I are not seeing eye-to-eye on the definition of 'truth'.

I know too much about the problems in finding an interpretation for quantum mechanics to ever imagine that science is about finding an absolute truth as you seem to mean it.

Iverson is probably the closest to being the exception, but he never won it all.

Parker and Billups won, but they complemented the likes of Duncan/Ginobili and Wallace/Sheed/Prince/Hamilton.

Rose and CP3 combined have 1 Conference Finals.

The point is is that you'd have to go back to the 80s and early 90s to find an NBA team win a Championship led by a PG. It does not happen nowadays. You can have a great point guard and still win, so long as he is complementing a better player (ex. Westbrook-Durant and Parker-Duncan, previously Rondo-KG/Pierce, Kidd-Dirk).

Foliagus,playrust,1390076277.0,"Any of this advice can be disregarded if you're ok with dying. (AKA you have a sleeping bag somewhere, and you're not carrying a tonne of resources.)


1) To get into a fire, you HOLD E and click open.  This is how you cook meat.

2) Do not eat raw meat. 

3) Gather every wood pile and rock you see.

4) Run from anybody better-dressed than you, ESPECIALLY if they say stuff like ""Hey, come here man, you want some food?""

5) Build a frigging wood house with a metal door eventually, a shack with a wood door will do while you get enough wood and metal.  This is because wooden doors and shelters are easy to hack through with hatchets.  Metal doors and wooden houses are deterrents, they require C4 or something powerful to get through. 

6) Do not put a metal door on a wooden shelter, this is a giant bullseye.

7) Hide your real house.  Don't tell people where it is.  My entire happiness in Rust has come from this piece of advice, if somebody knows where you live, eventually they can raid it.

8) Try to find friends, probably near where you gather resources, but be prepared to die while you do so.  (Leave all your good shit at home)

9) Learn the map.  Watch the video ""getting around in Rust"", I find it quite helpful.  Rad-towns are unique, learn where they are so you can find yourself. 

10) Have fun!  Put on some music (I recommend any Songza or Pandora: Pink Floyd or Rush.), you'll be hacking for a while, so music helps keep away the monotony.

Since I'm in Arts and Science my convocation is on the 4th of June which is a Wednesday, official Grand Prix events start Friday but the party often starts on Thursday. When we were booking our hotels we had to tell them that we were here for McGill grad and NOT for the Grand Prix, and they said that the room rates were going to double from about 150 to over 300 per night on the Thursday, so my parents are basically flying out the morning after my convocation. FWIW we talked to the Delta on President Kennedy and also Appartement Hotel on Sherbrooke and these were the prices they quoted us.

You can look [here](http://www.mcgill.ca/travelservices/accommodations/hotelprogram) for supposedly exclusive hotel deals through a partnership with McGill, but the hotels we talked to said the deals weren't valid from the Thursday of Grand Prix weekend to the Monday following, for obvious reasons.

Not hotel-related, but remember you're asked to bring a maximum of 4 guests per student. AFAIK you don't need tickets to get seats if you get early enough to be able to sit on Lower Field, but if you need to go to overflow seating in Leacock you do need tickets."

ThoughtRiot1776,AskHistorians,1390076336.0,"Wikipedia actually does a pretty good job at summarizing everything.  I know copy/paste stuff is usually frowned upon, but this is pretty simple and I didn't have to go through my copy of The Two Lives of Charlemagne to find the same quote.

Charlemagne's personal appearance is known from a good description by a personal associate, Einhard, author after his death of the biography Vita Karoli Magni. Einhard tells in his twenty-second chapter:[85]

""He was heavily built, sturdy, and of considerable stature, although not exceptionally so, since his height was seven times the length of his own foot. He had a round head, large and lively eyes, a slightly larger nose than usual, white but still attractive hair, a bright and cheerful expression, a short and fat neck, and he enjoyed good health, except for the fevers that affected him in the last few years of his life. Toward the end, he dragged one leg. Even then, he stubbornly did what he wanted and refused to listen to doctors, indeed he detested them, because they wanted to persuade him to stop eating roast meat, as was his wont, and to be content with boiled meat.""

The physical portrait provided by Einhard is confirmed by contemporary depictions of the emperor, such as coins and his 8-inch (20 cm) bronze statue kept in the Louvre. In 1861, Charlemagne's tomb was opened by scientists who reconstructed his skeleton and estimated it to be measured 1.90 m (75 in).[86] An estimate of his height from a X-ray and CT Scan of his tibia performed in 2010 is 1.84 m (72 in). This puts him in the 99th percentile of tall people of his period, given that average male height of his time was 1.69 m (67 in). The width of the bone suggested he was gracile but not robust in body build.[87]

edit: whoops, forgot the link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne#Appearance /edit

TheDrunkenChud,AskReddit,1390076364.0,"&gt;Are you 12 years old by chance? 

no, i'm 34 and have seen my fair share of ugly divorces and shit marriages. people marrying someone with the intent of divorcing them for monetary gain. and people marrying thinking they would be happy for the rest of their lives only to have the spouse step out. 

&gt;Because everything you just listed is preventable.

you can stop someone from cheating? as a male i can stop the courts awarding custody of kids to my wife (though, in michigan they are starting to be less mom dominated in the custody these days, so that's nice)? you can stop someone from entering into a marriage with nefarious plans of monetary gains? if you say prenup, i agree, they are amazing i would never get married without one., not that i plan on marrying ever. however, most people don't agree with me on this. and getting someone to agree to ""plan for divorce"" is hard, even when you explain that a marriage contract is already a divorce contract, and not one that generally favors men, regardless of who was in the wrong. 

&gt;I feel sorry for whoever eventually wants to marry you.

considering i don't plan on marrying, you can save you pity. if i ever married, it will only be once. unfortunately, that's not for me to decide. "

The middle ages were also not caused by ""religion."" They were caused by rome's knowledge being lost by being taken over and collapsing. In fact, some historians theorize that if a centralized religion had existed earlier in the form of catholicism, that the knowledge may not have been lost, since it might have been more widespread.

Not only that, the idea that science and religion are different things is something that simply would not be an obvious distinction to non-advanced peoples. So before modern day no religion would almost certainly also meant no science. Since it would have meant that very little people were working on advancing human knowledge in general. Possibly even that they were not yet evolved enough to do so."

gualdhar,AdviceAnimals,1390076641.0,"Yet again, you missed the mark. Where does that disagree with anything I've said before? It makes no mention of amino acid content of foods, only that consumption of meat correlates with higher risk of cancer:

&gt; Red meat and processed meat consumption are consistently associated with an increase risk of colorectal cancer (25). Those in the highest quintile of red meat intake had elevated risks, ranging from 20% to 60%, of esophageal, liver, colorectal, and lung cancers than did those in the lowest quintile of red meat intake (31). In addition, the use of eggs was recently shown to be associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer (32).

and that consumption of vegan-appropriate protein sources show a reduced risk of cancer:

&gt; Although vegans avoid consuming red meat and eggs altogether, they consume greater amounts of legumes than do omnivores (14, 16, 20). This protein source was seen in the Adventist Health Study to be negatively associated with risk of colon cancer (23). New data suggest that legume intake is also associated with a moderate reduction in the risk of prostate cancer (33). In Western society, vegans also consume substantially more tofu and other soy products than do omnivores (14, 16). Consumption of isoflavone-containing soy products during childhood and adolescence protects women against the risk of breast cancer later in life (34), whereas a high childhood dairy intake has been associated with an elevated risk of colorectal cancer in adulthood (35). Cancer risk in vegans may be altered because vegans consume soy beverages rather than dairy beverages. Data from the Adventist Health Study showed that consumption of soy milk by vegetarians protected them against prostate cancer (36), whereas in other studies the use of dairy was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (25, 37–39). 

The one thing it does mention:

&gt; To obtain a nutritionally adequate diet, the consumer must first have an appropriate knowledge of what constitutes a nutritionally adequate diet. Second, accessibility is important, ie, the availability of certain foodstuffs and foods fortified with key nutrients that are otherwise lacking in the diet. This accessibility will vary greatly, depending on the geographic region of the world, because different countries have different fortification laws

and subsequently talks about a few vitamins and minerals that may be deficient in a poorly-planned vegan diet.

Yet, I've said over and over that anyone switching to a vegan diet has to carefully plan what he is eating, whether it's a dog or a human, and possibly take supplements.

So I'll ask again: where does it say anything that I haven't said before?"

Saying ""there is always going to be someone above you"" and that people need to accept that is just a way to excuse an unjust social order. It does not have to be this way, and there are lots of arguments significantly more subtantial than ""half thought complaints"".

WraithPDX,AdviceAnimals,1390076716.0,"Nothing is to be honest, hence why they are drugs. Especially in the US. Drinking culture is exceptionally bad and glorifies binge drinking, blackouts, etc, especially among those not yet 21. But I have this feeling that if any narcotic/psychoactive drug was 100% legal we would be encountering a similar issue alcohol has, just having different negative effects unique to that drug. 

To give you an example, a friend of my family had her son hospitalized a year ago. He apparently hooked up with the Santo Daime chapter in Portland. As part of their rituals, they gave him Ayahuasca, which has been found legal to use for religious ceremonies despite being classified as a Schedule I drug. When he woke up in the hospital, it was two days later. He had no recollection of the events that happened and no idea how he got to the hospital. These are very, very isolated cases and most are in controlled settings (his wasn't, obviously) but imagine how dangerous it could be if it was widely available."

I think that it's great when people are able to come out, but I also recognize that it's not so easy for everyone and that not everyone wants to. I don't really like some of the pressure there is surrounding coming out because not everyone's situation is the same. Ultimately, it's your decision. 

I do think that at some point you might start to feel sort of repressed or something along those lines if you continue to suppress your feelings and desires. You might have some regrets someday if you don't pursue those feelings. Maybe coming out wouldn't be as dire as you're imagining it to be, though obviously I don't know your situation. In the end, maybe you should just try to take it a day at a time instead of making a big decision right now when you're only 18. You have a lot of time left and maybe someday you'll change your mind.

Besides. The more uses a word has, the further it gets from its source, and the less it's associated with homosexuals. In the end, that makes hate speech less powerful. The same already is happening with the even more offensive word ""fag."" Nowadays, if you live in most places, using it for an actual gay person will make people think you are a bigot redneck.

it is possible but requires long extensio cables for HDMI or DVI/audio.

what you need to do is:

* connect your PC to your monitor or whatever using one DVI link or HDMI

* get cable extensions and run the cable along the wall all the way to the TV. using the other port of DVI or HDMI.

* As for the controller AFAIK the 360 are the better ones out there, if you want to use a wireless one you will need to buy an adapter for the PC, so it can get the signal from the controller. Or use a wired one and avoid the hassle.

*I really doubt a cable-less option is available here, but that is not my area, so search around maybe your TV has some setting to transmit a PC's signal through WI-Fi or whatever.

It is entirely possible that the people who contribute in these threads have never seen a thread like that on /r/ElderScrolls before. I can understand the ""If I haven't seen it before, it's new to me"" mindset because that is something I ascribe to.

I am willing to concede that there is nothing that can be done about that variable and will stop judging the number of threads so harshly. I reserve the right to remain frustrated by them, however, as I still believe threads that are posted with minimal effort do nothing for the dynamic of the sub.

If someone feels they've had an original idea and it begins to receive flak from people like me who feel strongly about this topic, I can understand that they may become defensive and respond by downvoting and rebuking comments from those who disagree with them. However, people who have been in threads like that before (and I know who they are based on my RES vote counter next to their name) repeatedly become offended.

Well the Heat are a perfect example as to how little the PG matters when you have a player like LeBron on your team. If you have a good enough Forward or Center then you can get away with having a decent PG. Dwight Howard made the Finals with Jameer Nelson at the Point. In 2008, when Rondo was still finding his role on the team the Celtics won that Championship with Sam Cassel playing plenty of minutes at point. If you have a good enough Forward or Center you can hide your inferiority at the PG position, but if the PG is best player you really cannot get away with mediocre play at Forward or Center."

I think that sexuality is more complex than that and that it exists more on a scale/dimension. Some bisexuals favor a certain gender. Some bisexuals feel differently about the genders at different points in their lives.

I don't really know how I'd quantify my attraction, but in the end I don't really care either. Bisexual is what fits me best, so that's what I go with. Self-identification can be important and I think that it's a pretty personal thing. Everyone's experiences might differ a bit."

dianthe,politics,1390077199.0,"I'm not sure why you took the assumption that my desire is to outright make all abortion illegal. My desire is to reduce its numbers as much as possible because it is a horrifying thing that shouldn't even exist in a moral society. And I think the best way to do it in our current situation is via good sex education as well as teaching children from a young age about prenatal development, that an unborn is just a human in an early stage of development, to teach them to respect all human life. To make adoption easier and *cheaper*, because currently most people who would love to adopt simply cannot afford the tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. To provide better support and assistance to young and single mothers. I think we would be a better society for it. So no, I do not believe in emotionally detaching ourselves from this issue to make the decision to abort ""easier"". 

&gt;And for the record? You don't know what you'd do until you find yourself in the situation. Maybe you'd do what you believe right now that you'd do. Maybe not. Those clinics see all kinds. ALL kinds. I asked.

For the record, I was in that situation, when I was 18. The last thing on my mind was an abortion because how can I take the life of another being when the whole situation is not their fault? How could I live with myself knowing I robbed someone else, someone absolutely innocent, of life? After 3 months it turned out that I was not pregnant and the reason I didn't have a period all that time was Plan B really messing up my hormones. 

But yes I am sure clinics see all kinds of people, it's just the sad state of our society.

Supershinyface,PCOS,1390077203.0,"Months. Years for some people. Some people never get relief from everything. It's not like you have a headache and you can take some aspirin and expect relief in 30 minutes or so; this is a long-term, complicated problem, with very individualized and complex, intertwined symptoms that will take a long time to get sorted for each woman that goes through it. 

But you do it anyway, because the alternative is to have all of your symptoms at full blast all the time. 

So, with keto the basic induction phase usually takes about two weeks, and you may have all kinds of symptoms just related to that. I really recommend checking out /r/keto and especially /r/xxketo (lots of PCOSers over there) for support, and making sure you've got everything on-target, since usually from water alone in the first couple of weeks there's an initial weight loss of several pounds. If you didn't experience that, something may be off.

Have you spoken to your doctor about the Metformin?  There are long-term release options, and even the generic vs. the name-brand can make a difference in how any side-effects manifest. You don't say what it is that makes you hate it, but there may be other options (or even other medications) available.

You should really talk to your doc about the pain you're experiencing in your ovaries, too - ruptured cysts are no joke. 

I'm sorry - it sucks.  Go ahead and rant away if you need to; we're all in this together. "

I'm sure there are tons of other issues with the bill. Even this small excerpt could (should) create a debate about whether the government has a right to prevent you from getting medical care from an unlicensed institution, whether the government should have this much control on medical institutions. I just want to understand why we're not discussing those but a 'ban' that doesn't even seem to exist instead."

darthbarracuda,atheism,1390077622.0,"The universe is a scary place. It's cold, heartless, and uncaring to your existence. Religion offers people a cozy fantasy that helps some mask the reality of our universe. It tells people that there's a big daddy that's watching over you, that he loves you, that there's an afterlife. But only if you follow their doctrines. Very convenient, eh? It also gives people a sense of community, where they will always be welcome (as long as they believe). I don't think any faith can become a major religion without having a sacred place of worship. Churches have plays, concerts, Bible studies, fundraisers, etc to keep people involved and engaged. If there's nothing special coming up, people lose interest. When you look at it this way, religion starts to look more like a business. The more a religious organization has to ""offer"" someone, the more they are willing to place in the collection basket. Now, that doesn't seem any different from a secular organization offering the same things, like a school, a fitness club, or a charity. But the difference is that religions offer something that doesn't exist: salvation. It's the ultimate item and people flock to it out of fear of the wrath of god. And other people claim that their religion is the ""one true religion,"" and that the others are false. Conflict begins. It's adults fighting over who's imaginary friend is better. That's the problem. All the cool activities churches offer are fine. But the fact that a church is organizing people to worship something imaginary and even cause conflict is not. Everything a church offers people can be offered in a secular organization, except for the imaginary parts."

Not really. You can buy cheaper PCs, but usually a Mac/PC comparison for the same stuff comes out reasonably similar. I'm sure you can find counterexamples, but it's been shown often enough to establish the point.

&gt; They make it as difficult as possible for people who haven't been specifically trained on their products to do any sort of repairs to the hardware

Depends. Older models are unusually well documented for end-user repairs and upgrades. Now, not so much - the stress is on small size and long battery life rather than user maintenance. It's a hell of a lot easier to fix the sw than on Windows, though.

USB charging - 30-pin is obsolete now, but your point is sound.

&gt; They tailored their pc OS so that it doesn't run as well on hardware they didn't make, 

Translation from the Serbo-Croat: they don't include drivers for equipment that they don't supply. Why should they? The only use for them would be on Hackintoshes. The reason desktop Windows does it is because they can't control what hardware the manufacturers will bolt together. But it's perfectly possible to get 3rd party drivers for hardware to run with a Mac. Getting 3rd party drivers to run MacOS on a non-Mac PC - well you may find that more difficult.

Japanese houses tended to war against each other instead, and so the ideology of honour is still a part of their culture, as opposed to, say, victorian England where a lot of those societies concepts died off and were replaced by other things from other countries, or thinkers.

SageWaterDragon,Eve,1390077914.0,"First of all, Valkyrie and Dust 514 integration will become more and more complex as the game's player base increases. The player base will increase due to a larger marketing push, as well as the release of the television show in 2015 (which is when they were aiming for, right?). If they can get the show on something like FOX, hundreds of thousands of people will get interested in playing it. If only for 2 months, CCP will get flooded with massive amounts of money.

EVE Online itself will encounter a few bumps along the road to 2023. When they finally release player systems and jump gates, there will be a large public outcry when the ""bubbles"" of alliance space almost immediately extend into these areas due to the sheer size of their exploration groups. The trade centers will move away from areas like Jita, and into player-driven areas. Due to this, that cluster of systems will become largely abandoned, which will immediately make them redundant, as CCP's Jita server will become irrelevant. They will then try to focus it on a player area, but that will cause an uproar as CCP would be interfering with player actions, which would ostensibly remove the purpose of these areas being player driven.

By 2016, both the average computer strength and the average bandwidth of the internet will be massively increased. This will mean that, in order to stay even remotely relevant, World of Warcraft will entirely overhaul its systems. A large group of players will leave WoW at that point in time, so the MMO space will be left with a huge gap in the stock-space, as it will lower holder confidence. The direct effect on EVE Online will be massive, as CCP will scramble to completely overhaul its structure, in order to make sure it doesn't go the way of WoW. During this time, the servers will be down for ~3 weeks, which will put a huge part of the EVE economy in a stalemate. At this point in time, CCP's efforts to keep its playerbase will fall apart, as a huge amount of people won't want to play after 3 weeks anyways.

However, since the huge influx of cash in 2015 from the television show, the number of subscribers will still massively outnumber more modern games like EverQuest Next and The Old Republic. In a similar tune, Star Citizen will turn out to be a massive flop by the time it is released piecemeal over time. This will both alleviate a lot of CCP's problems about potentially losing a massive part of their playerbase, but it will also start creating another bout of distrust in the investor area of things. CCP will have to ""step their game up"" in order to stay relevant.

However, even though the quality of the game is exponentially increasing due to pressure on CCP, the world of EVE will go into complete anarchy around 2017. Both TEST and GoonSwarm will be completely gone, just like B.O.B. is today. When they did completely overhaul their codebase, they finally completed the integration of Dust and Valkyrie into EVE Online. They will all become one game simply entitled EVE. It will be multiplatform, and switching between characters and playstyles will be a simple change that you can do whenever you dock at a station. Speaking of stations, you will be able to walk around them, but they are going to restrict player interactions so places like the new market hub don't get filled with WoW-that-was style scantily clad dancing girls with rainbow text advertising their cheap deals on Tritanium and EMP S.

Mobile integration will become a huge deal in EVE. Almost every mobile platform, including the inevitable 3DS and Vita successors, will feature EVE Gate applications that allow you to, essentially, do everything but actually control characters. That means real-time chat, corporation management, and market integration will become a major thing. This will also start a huge wave of complaints that playing EVE will become a complete waste, as a vast group of players will barely ever launch EVE. This never really pans out into anything true, but the complaints will definitely be there.

In 2020, there will be an EVE expansions simply entitled ""Eden."" This will unlock two huge things: a threefold size expansion in the world as the Sisters of EVE finally find a way to open the EVE Gate again, as well as adding both the Jove and Terrans as playable races. Their ship designs will be very different from previous creations, and they will completely change the way combat is dealt with. This will also be the year that an EVE movie releases, but it is digital only, for all intents and purposes; it will have a limited theater run in Iceland and 3 major cities across the United States, and this will create a huge slice of EVE lore that didn't previously exist. Again, this will cause an influx of players, but nowhere near as large as the TV series did, as it will have smaller potential reach.

By 2022, there will be a lot of hype for what CCP will do for the third decade of EVE. EVE will be almost unrecognizable to those who began playing in 2003-6, but will be almost universally viewed as a better sandbox. Player options and abilities will have been massively increased, and less bubbles will have formed now that the game world is larger than the giant alliances of old would really allow for. Serenity's player count will have similarly moved to the same trends as Tranquility did, but the giant bubbles of alliances will still exist due to alliances refusing to change their ways and move into unexplored space, especially after hearing the horror stories of disbandment in Tranquility.

In April of 2023, CCP will announce two things: they are going to be holding a panel at E3, as well as the fact that they are working with advertising partners to bring back the EVE television series that ended its run in 2017. The second option will never pan out, but the first one will gradually get more and more hyped until the conference itself, and it will be universally regarded as worth it. 

They will open their conference with an overview of the last 20 years of EVE Online, including interviews with major players over the years. This is going to seamlessly turn into a new trailer for an upcoming expansion, which will bring back some old features, as well as adding a fair amount of new ships. There will be some typical state-of-the-union style speeches, but they will close out with one last piece of information that will drive the fans of EVE into madness in both the crowd and the stream. The last big feature that they didn't mention in the first expansion trailer was that they were going to make the entire EVE universe fully traverse-able on every front. Think the No Man's Sky trailer; seamless exploration of each and every area across of all of EVE, by foot, sky, vehicle, with no visible loading screens and, incredibly enough, no performance loss due to over 2 years of code optimization. And, at this moment, EVE gets onto almost every single major magazine cover in the industry, and his hailed as the ultimate gaming experience.

And, incredibly enough, everything lives up to the hype.

**TL;DR: EVE goes through a trial by fire and comes out stronger than before.**"

kakersdozen,AskWomen,1390077937.0,"I can't find the study, because googling ""cohabitation before marriage"" and any form of the word ""religion"" returns a lot of christian websites, but if I do I will post it.

Anyway: A study was done that controlled for that variable. I always thought the same as you, and so some extent I do think that many religious people simply feel divorce isn't an option, so that skews the numbers. However, after controlling for religious/conservative views on divorce, the cohabiting couples still divorced more. The authors attributed this to the idea that cohabiting couples may not actually be happy prior to marriage, but moving out and ending the relationship is too hard/too much work/too scary, so they kind of go with the flow. They wind up married to people they would not have married if they lived on their own. 

It sounds crazy, but from personal experience I can say that this DOES happen. Even if it doesn't get as far as marriage, which mine did not (thank God!), a lot of cohabiting people will continue in an unhappy relationship for longer than they would if they lived on their own. This can be due to fear, obligation, societal pressures, family expectations, etc. For some, this results in a marriage that ultimately becomes unbearable. Thus, divorce."

All it takes is one failed system, we all know that. Their selection is an issue. And that issue is primarily due to the fact that their system required special programming. And you can't get a base of companies used to that if you change the entire user interface every time you release a system. Hence: make a more advanced wii. That formula worked just fine, there is still plenty of juice, and the only gripe is that it has mostly kiddie games. Exclusives are no longer a selling point, in my opinion, on systems. Interface is. And the wii is the perfect opportunity to capitalize on something the other companies aren't doing (advancing the motion technology). Unfortunately, now Nintendo is falling behind in their own 'game' as it were. Nintendo is TOO focused on exclusives. Mario, Metroid, and Zelda are great, but they can't be the only reason to purchase a system. They just can't. They can't bear that weight forever.

Everything in the box looks like it's ready to be skated, the deck isn't autographed from what it looks like.

Wheels usually run around 25$, and those bearings cost around 11$ a pack.  

The trucks look gold but that's just gold paint, some trucks (especially the Pro model trucks) come like that, it doesn't mean they shouldn't be skated.

If you want, you could skate that deck if you want to learn.

It's nice that you won it in a contest, but since the deck isn't signed it's pretty much begging to be gripped and skated.  

The youtube channel RatVision has a lot of skateboard information.

All you really need to do is press the bearings into the wheels (search pressing skateboard bearings on youtube or google), put the wheels on the trucks (unscrew / screw bolt, very simple, just dont over tighten or it won't spin), and then grip the board (search how to apply griptape) and attach the trucks to the board with the hardware.  

It takes around 30 minutes to put together, maybe up to an hour if your new and going slow. "

You probably just caught the ones where it happened to be one or more of the guys; there are more of them than there are of the female characters, especially in the earlier seasons, so they do seem to get it more often. 

One of the things I like about the show is that all the characters have immense personality flaws and this isn't glossed over or made desirable: these are people who can be really annoying or unpleasant or dumb sometimes and yet they still manage to live their lives and have friends and all. I think some viewers mistake ""these people have blatant character flaws"" for ""these blatant character flaws are actually super awesome and make them great people"" tbh.

Bear in mind that a lawsuit isn't going to happen unless damage is done, so no, the venue won't get sued because people are selling mushrooms inside, but if someone eats a bunch of mushrooms then gets in his car and kills someone, the venue can be held accountable, the same way they can be held accountable for alcohol related deaths where the person was served inside the venue.

I dont think they have little confidence in us, it is just if fewer people have access to the machine, it is less likely to get broken and if it does, it is easier to pinpoint who did it.

I believe their original plan was to train a few nurses on each floor to use it, but started in ER/ICU to pilot it. It was broken during that period so no more nurses were trained and only the ones that were trained back then can use it now. I don't know what they will do when those nurses get different jobs or retire..."

blackrat47,biology,1390078383.0,"Firstly, some genes are a lot bigger than others- it follows that the more bases there are in the gene, the more likely it is for a point mutation to occur within it. The gene which, when broken, causes cystic fibrosis is a good example of this. Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well. 

It's also worth remembering that selection can happen at a very early stage. Housekeeping genes seem to have a very low mutation rate compared to genes less directly correlated with fitness: however, this is because if a loss-of-function mutation occurs in such a gene in, say, an ovum, it probably won't survive long enough even to be fertilised, let alone to come to term. So even though the mutation rate may be the same in two genes, it's possible to *see* mutations in one gene much more than another. 

I believe that there are some genes which are selected to be highly mutable in certain regions (immunoglobulins, for example, where a large variety of binding affinities can be advantageous to the genome); I imagine the mechanism is something to do with epigenetics and the bundling of the DNA, but don't quote me on this, it's something I vaguely remember.

audreyshake,legaladvice,1390078473.0,"&gt; My example, admittedly ludicrous, was to point out that you give up your normal rights in any government building. You can’t take prescription drugs into a school, you can’t take guns into any government building (in most states)&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

But those are statutory prohibitions: For example, the law makes it a crime to carry guns into certain buildings, and that’s permissible. What the law doesn’t do is allow governmental officials to dispense with Fourth Amendment requirements by virtue of visiting certain areas, like prisons.

&gt; you can’t yell anything, let alone anything threatening, in a courthouse or state capitol.

But that’s not by virtue of it being a public building. Disturbing the peace or making threats anywhere is usually a crime.

&gt; It seems now that our failure to connect is based on your notion that these people were under arrest. No, they weren’t. They were in a jail and being searched while under lock-down. Unless one of them had a medical incident or got touched in the privates, or it lasted much longer than can be justified (which would be much longer than OP’s narrative), there’s nothing here.

I wasn’t under the impression that they were under arrest (although for constitutional purposes they may have been); even without an arrest, a detention or search is subject to Fourth Amendment requirements. But, the police may only detain a person on reasonable suspicion, and only so long as is required to confirm their suspicions; the police may only search a person with a warrant, consent, exigent circumstances, incident to an arrest (requiring probable cause), or for weapons on a reasonable belief that she is armed and dangerous. The fact that this occurred in the visiting area of a jail changes none of that."

your theater argument, which would have been better, no one with a gun, or everyone? if no one had a gun, and ol' boy had a knife, i believe the same outcome. if everyone had a gun, i don't believe ol' boy even draws. if he does, he gets drawn on. 

&gt;And more so, why don't ""defend-myself, stand-my-ground"" gun rights advocates choose knives instead?

that's an asinine question and you know it. i will however point you to the [australian murder weapon profile (fig 11)](http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/facts/1-20/2012/2_profiles.html) to point out that after strict gun control in australian the murder weapon of choice in almost 50% of murders is a knife. same with england. to the point they now how ""knife control"". you can't buy silverware under the age of 18. oh, sanity. also, if you check the murder rate in aus, (i'm using aus because i had a debate with an aussie in this same thread and i have the data at hand) their murder rate has remained mostly static over the last 15 years. some troughs, some valleys, and right now they're at a low, but it hasn't really changed in a significant amount. if people want to kill, they're going to kill. removing my ability to defend myself just makes me a victim, police don't prevent crime, they report and investigate. there isn't a police force in the world that can get between me and an attacker when the moment counts. 

i'd like to point you to [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concealed_carry_in_the_United_States#Research_on_the_efficacy_of_concealed_carry). yes, it's wiki but you can check the sources. i didn't feel like posting a ton of sources here. 

&gt;Which is precisely why the rest of us want them out of the public?

concealed carry holder account for less than 0.01% of homicides. the correlation between concealed carry and crime is inverse. more concealed carry means less murder. the data bares this out, and has over many years. in fact, in years in which guns were bought at record numbers, crime drops to all time lows. 

an armed society, is a polite society. 

taking guns out of law abiding citizens hands, does not in any way keep them out of the hands of criminals who wish to you harm. "

The bottom line is, KD is proving to be the best scorer in the league, and definitively one of the the top 2 players in the league in overall effectiveness on the court.  These metrics ultimately mean nothing and just because a player has a high PER doesn't mean he'll be MVP, or that his team is in any state to win rings.

"
Escape92,TrueAskReddit,1390079132.0,"I have a few theories,to build upon your original one. 

We encourage boys to compete and girls to be pleasing, which translates to boys being encouraged into competitive team sports and girls being encouraged to dance or do gymnastics. Dance and gymnastics, whilst lovely to watch, are not the most exciting sports, and so they will never scoop the same audiences that soccer does.

Women who never got involved with sport are unlikely to have been encouraged to have been active followers in any case. Whereas it seems that boys who choose not to play sports still are expected to understand and enjoy watching them, women are not particularly encouraged to do either, so there isn't a large female audience clamouring for role models, and women athletes are not expected to be role models because they are not expected to be particularly successful.

I also think it's interesting, although not directly relevant to your question, that the sports women do tend to be popular for being good at are those which cost a considerable amount of money to develop at. Dance, gymnastics, and equestrian events are all popular with women as competitors and they are all activities where money has to have been spent on equipment. In contrast, some of the most successful male footballers (soccer players) are from the Brazilian favelas and similar slum areas. Boys are encouraged to be good at sport because it will make them rich, whilst girls are more likely to be successful if they already have money supporting them. And that's a damn shame.

*edit. There are always exceptions to the rules. For example, one of the most famous British athletes currently is Jessica Ennis."

DiamondMind28,worldnews,1390079153.0,"There's no strict definition. 

To give a bit of history: Originally, Hebrews were a group of people who lived in the general area of today's Israel/West Bank/Jordan. At one point, part of the group was conquered and dispersed, leaving only the tribe of Judah. Centuries later, the people in Judah were also conquered and some were sent into exile. And the Jews, (the name is derived from Judah) travelled throughout the world, and most carried the religion with them. 

Jews aren't really a race in the classic definition of the term, as there are Jews from every race and ethnicity. Think of it more in terms of peoplehood, which is united by a common religion and history. Classically, you're Jewish if you're born to a Jewish mother or if you convert. A convert, once the process is complete, immediately becomes as Jewish as someone who can trace their ancestors back to Israel 2000 years ago.

But I’m skeptical that a mere sign on the wall would suffice to establish consent in this context.

If you were to evade security at an airport and make your way into the secured area, you wouldn’t be subject to search merely by being present. There are no “Fourth Amendment-free” zones; law simply doesn’t work that way. But, you *could* be lawfully required to leave, and depending on how you’d gotten around security, you could be placed under arrest and searched for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1036(a)(3) (area secure area entry by fraud or false pretenses)."

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390080193.0,"Welcome to /r/DigitalPainting! I'm so glad to see all of these people taking the dive into digital art.

So, this is the classic fruit study that lots of beginners like to start with! I can't quite tell if this was done from a reference photo or not, but if it wasn't, I recommend that you do these studies from photos or better yet, from life. The reason for this is that we have all seen bananas before, so we believe we know what a banana is supposed to look like. In truth, however, we have seen but never truly observed and studied a banana, so we are working off of a lot of incorrect assumptions.

If you were working from reference, then good on you.

For the painting itself, I can see that you were painting a fruit, but I'm not actually entirely certain what kind of fruit it is. My first guess was an orange, but the blue ring on the top is puzzling. Is it a persimmon maybe? The colour is definitely more similar to a persimmon, but the surface texture is more like that of an orange. In my paintover, I think I'll go with persimmon, just because it's more interesting.

First of all, you've kept to a consistent lighting scheme, with the light source sitting between the viewer and the object, towards the upper right. It's very important that you keep your lighting in mind, so kudos for that.

One major issue I notice, however, is the edges of your shapes. This is perfectly normal for beginners, especially for those just getting used to using a tablet (I do hope you're using a tablet with pressure sensitivity, as opposed to a mouse which would be considerably more difficult). The reason you're getting this sort of jagged effect along the edges of your shapes is likely because your hand is pivoting from the wrist as you draw. In order to achieve smoother strokes, try locking your wrist and pivoting instead from your elbow or better yet, your shoulder. A good exercise for this is just drawing straight lines, from one end of your canvas to the other, or marking out two arbitrary points on your canvas and attempting to draw a single, unbroken, straight line between those two points. This is a skill that will take time to develop, and one that everyone struggles with.

The biggest issue with having jagged edges or linework is that it compromises the sense of weight and solidity of an object. This relates directly to drawing a 3D object instead of a flat image. Currently, your fruit appears flat, despite your consideration for light and shadow.When drawing, you need to convince yourself that you are not drawing on a flat surface, but rather making your lines wrap around a 3D form. Your pencil, pen, or stylus is carving into and out of space, and your paper or canvas is merely a window into that space. If you can capture the weight and solidity of an object, you will have accomplished 80% of the task. Don't worry about the texture - the little pockmarks on the surface of the fruit, or any of that, because all those little details amount to so little of the impact of the painting.

Last of all, I want to point out an issue with colour. I appreciate the fact that you laid out a lot of your swatches around your study, because it makes it easier for me to understand your mindset, and help you learn. Your colours are all extremely saturated - that is to say, they are very vivid. As you do more studies, and observe the world around you more carefully as all artists ultimately learn to do, you will realize that very few things in this world have such saturated tones. Also, a helpful tip to keep in mind is to use more less saturated tones in your lit areas, and more saturated tones (though not blazingly so) in your shadows.

There will be ""levels"" on equipment and such, so if you wanted to, you could think of progression in this game as leveling up your ship instead of leveling up your character.  Having multiple ships is like having alts, each of which will need to be ""leveled up"" separately (by upgrading the equipment on each).  And the different kinds of equipment are like having different skills.  You can ""level up"" your ""stealth skill"" by upgrading to equipment with less impact on your signature.  Might be pushing the analogy too hard here, but... if you enjoy that kind of gameplay in other games, you shouldn't worry about the fact that characters in SC won't have it.  That kind of gameplay still exists, it's just focuses on the ship instead of the character.

enobrev,minimalism,1390080242.0,"First and foremost, I agree with what seems to be the overall sentiment in this thread: let her keep her stuff.  That's the thing about relationships - it's two people coexisting, not one person living in the other person's world.

That said, I've had to share very small spaces with SOs in the past, where the clutter was weighing too heavily on both of us because they had too much stuff.   One tactic that has definitely helped was to put everything that's not immediately needed in a closet somewhere.  Somewhere she can get things if she needs to, but out of the way.

Over time, the stuff she needs will come out of said closet, or at least rise to the top of the pile.  After 6 months, see if she might be willing to part with some things at the bottom of the stack / pile / whatever in said closet that she hasn't touched in all that time.  If not, then not - it's her stuff, but you might suggest she puts it into storage.  But if so, then she gets rid of stuff she doesn't need and you both gain a little more closet space.

Point is, sometimes even for people who don't strive to be minimalist, they might find over time that they don't need _everything_ they own, which I think most people in this sub would agree is a healthy lesson to learn."

Contrast this to how real people work: There were multiple odd reports during and right after the event. For example, I recall people saying *on the day of* that there was a car bomb at the Pentagon. There wasn't, of course, but everyone was so confused that strange stories could spread before real information could get out. However, as the information did get out, the real people abandoned the strange stories and converged on the only narrative supported by the facts.

So:

RocketMan63,microsoft,1390080410.0,"&gt; Making secure passwords 101: don't re-use the same passwords for multiple logins on different sites.

Yeah you definitely sound like someone who only knows the basics of security. The password was only well established because I've been using it for a while and it fits into a more secure set of passwords.

&gt; When users change their passwords, don't allow users to recycle their previous password. Make them actually change it. Most systems will allow you to recycle the old password after there have been a dozen or so intermediate passwords or after a year has passed.

This is retarded, sure Microsoft can make as many recommendations as they want but at the end of the day I should be able to set my password to whatever I want. Restricting the User's power in this context is not needed.

&gt; Making secure passwords 101: the user is responsible for making passwords...they need to be coached on how to generate secure passwords that meet complexity requirements and don't include dictionary words.

This is hilarious, I'm not a noob to passwords or online security in the slightest. If you knew anything at all about it you'd know the systems that Microsoft use are only for mitigating other users access and little else. As I mentioned before, my password is a derivative of a more complex set of passwords and I tried to use the ""parent"" password which would have made my password more secure. Unfortunately Microsoft asshat of a policy limited me to 16 characters.

Now I will concede that I shouldn't have said nobody likes those restrictions. I forgot there's idiots out there who don't know better than to just approve of Microsoft and unperfected systems."

hytone,AskWomen,1390080420.0,I did the HCG diet program once after a coworker swore by it and suggested it to me when I was really desperate to lose weight fast. The period I had after I finished it was horrific. I bled heavier than I ever have in my life (and I have some pretty damn heavy periods) and I had cramps that I thought were going to kill me. The pain was so unbearable that I couldn't move from a fetal position and I was light headed and essentially passed out after a while. I think stopping the HCG made my body think it was having a miscarriage. It was awful.

I was in so much pain I vomited in the bushes on my way to the exam, and I was feverish the entire time. Teacher knew something was off and kept asking if I was ok, I said no, and rushed through the exam. There would have been no option to retake or postpone the test regardless.

The exam slot was for two hours but teacher said to expect about an hour and twenty minutes. I finished in about 35 minutes. As soon as I was out the classroom door, I vomited in the trash can in the hallway and hit up the bushes on the opposite side of the street on the way home.

Pain killers were doing nothing for me. Next day I felt fatigued but otherwise completely fine. It was also one of the messiest periods I have ever had. Just in terms of flow heaviness and duration.

I scored somewhere in the low 90% on that test. Always made me wonder if I could have gotten a 99-100 if I hadn't been so out of it.

So I know all about having to stay committed. But yes, I definitely don't plan to just ""pick up"" banjo just to have one more instrument to play, I'm willing to put in the time and effort into mastering it.

As for finding a teacher, do you think it'd be possible to be relatively self-taught? Through books, online videos, and so on? I mean I know my fair share of theory and know how to analyze playing styles and adopt them in to my own playing, but if Banjo is as big of a beast as you say it is I don't know if that'll be the right path to go this time.

And as for Bela's style being a more difficult style to learn, that's an obstacle I'm willing to attempt to overcome. I mean right now on bass, I'm learning to play the guitar solo in Chuck Mangione's ""Feels So Good"", so I'm familiar with taking unfamiliar ideas and applying them in a new manner.

Night-Ocelot,childfree,1390080714.0,"&gt; I personally wouldn't translate either of those quotations the way you did.

This depends largely on the person making the quotes. Most parents will respond strongly to news stories about kids because they are parents themselves, much like I, a cat owner, would respond more strongly to stories involving cats. People have stronger reactions to what they can relate to the most.

On the flip side of this, though, there are those few people that see this as a way of going around saying ""Pay attention to me! I have this great comment about the current situation, so everyone should listen to it!"" I've seen people react to child abuse stories by going on about how they are such a great parent and how if that were their child they would do (insert action here) and why they are so much better than that parent, and then they get pissed when the conversation doesn't focus on why they are such a better parent.

Granted, the quotes in the OP are more than likely people following the first example, but there are people out there that see news stories as ways to get more attention to themselves and whatever they have to say about it."

But don't judge them if their reasons for doing NoFap happen to be that they want to get better with women and have sex with a lot of them. That should be judged the same way that ED or being a virgin or anything else should be: not at all.

Don't selectively not judge people. Don't judge people at all. You wouldn't see alcoholics anonymous members saying that someone addicted to drinking beer didn't have as much of a problem as somebody drinking tequila. Likewise, you wouldn't see them judge someone if they were trying to get their alcoholism under control to pursue other things. Here, we are judging reasons why someone wants to do NoFap. I think it shouldn't be done at all. It's fine to say that you don't want people spouting christian beliefs, or religious beliefs, or philosophical nonsense, or PUA stuff...but its another thing to say that their end goals are not as good as someone elses end goals."

If you want to stretch your money the furthest without digging through racks of clothes at thrift stores or TJ Maxx/Burlington/Marshalls (note: these are good places, just unorganized and sizing is inconsistent), check out the juniors sections at department stores. The clothes are not the nicest fabrics, but you will get things that look nice and fit for cheap. Make sure you look online for coupons before you go. These clothes won't last as long as things from LOFT or Ann Taylor, but you can get more pieces.

Ann Taylor has great clothes and sizing. LOFT is actually ""Ann Taylor LOFT,"" so it is similar, but cheaper. LOFT has a lot more casual pieces (think t-shirts, sweaters, business casual tops) and Ann Taylor has formal business attire. These two stores ALWAYS have sales. NEVER PAY FULL PRICE! Also, depending how your finances are, Ann Taylor has a credit card. You get discounts as you earn points, plus the day you sign up, you get an additional 20% (I think) off everything from both stores, even if it is already on sale. I just got a job too and spent most of my money there. I got $750 of clothing about $500 with all of their sales. Even after this initial buy, keep an eye on their site/stores. End of season, you can get stuff for more than half off.

ClutchHunter,SubredditDrama,1390081093.0,"&gt; Are you commanding me to do something that isn't in my control?

I'm *asking* that you stop putting exclusivity forward as a positive thing and stop buying consoles/platforms *solely* for exclusives. If enough people did that then it'd make business sense for Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and whoever else to release for other platforms too. 

&gt;Easily? IDK. You'd want a small silent media center pc. But you can't use that thing for real gaming, so you would ahve to use a HDMI cable and stream to the TV (which I'm doing atm). It works, sure. But a dedicated media device is still better.

You can easily build a small form factor PC, or get a friend to build one for you. Said PC will be capable of both of the above.

&gt;It's much easier to game on console

Have you gamed on each platform extensively? As someone who has I'd argue that the slightly more extensive setup process on PC is offset by the lack of the ability to multitask on a console, and the fact that on your PC you just click and play. On a console, well, it's a different system, you've got to drop what you're doing and go over there instead.

&gt;The problem has for sure stopped coming up so often, still there are still more cases for pc than console....because that problem doesn't exist on console at all.

No, instead you just get abysmal resolutions/general graphical fidelity and framerates/general smoothness, and you can't even upgrade if you want to. Oh, and you hold the rest of us back too beyond the first year or two (and funnily enough, affordable PCs have been more powerful than these consoles for a good year or two already). 

&gt;Higher end cost doesn't matter to some people. They can afford more in the long run, but not such a high price of entry right now. It's not a sound finical decision but it doesn't matter to a lot of people.

Then those people should see if any of those ""buy now, pay later"" deals are available anywhere, the sort that are always available for furniture and such. Stupid fiscal decisions indeed. "

If im a skinny dude im going to get my ass whooped by a 250 pounder nine times out of ten no matter how much i train. but that doesnt mean that the martial art is useless or should not be trained. it will still help you in lots of other situations.

On valuble way it helps is that it gives you more options in a fight. on a one on one fight (yes ten guys could still kick my ass before you say it) i dont jsut have to knock the guy out or get knocked out. i may be able to arm lock him, or hold him on the ground till the police arrive. given how the law is, this can save a legal case against you.

also it can give you confidence in dealing with situations around you that get ugly, like if you see someone starting trouble in a bar you may have the confidence to go over there and stand between them.

also it useful for low level trouble like drunks. ive had a drunk throw a hook punch at me. i blocked it and countered, without thinking becuase i drilled what to do with a hook punch so many times in the dojo. I didnt even hit him. i stopped my fist half way because he looked so shocked that i countered so fast. he just walked away after that.

so martial arts wont help you beat up a man 3 times your size, but it will give extra options in a lot of situations that dont have to turn ugly

BarkingToad,DebateAnAtheist,1390081348.0,"&gt;Materialism is the theory that matter is the only thing that exists in the universe

The very first sentence is false. Yeah, not having high hopes for the rest. But I'll give it a shot. Will edit when done.

EDIT the first:

&gt;How does one chemical state that leads to another chemical state in the brain produce proper logical inference? There is no known mechanism that enables this.

1. This is an argument from ignorance, which is a logical fallacy.

2. It's also incorrect, there is a known mechanism that enables this: It's called a brain. I've worked with neural networks and reinforcement feedback into them enough to know exactly why I trust my brain (and why I don't, in certain circumstances and with certain things, such as periferal sensory input, interpretation of input when sleep deprived or near-sleep, etc.).

&gt;This would mean that given the exact same circumstances, the exact same responses would always occur. 

This author, on the other hand, has clearly never worked with neural networks. The way a given network (such as a brain, or an artificial neural network in a computer, which is the kind I've worked with) responds to a given input will be determined by two things: It's initial values, and what sort of feedback it has received previously. In the case of humans, the predicted result of this is that no two humans would be expected to respond identically in every instance, or at least, that would be extremely unlikely.

&gt;This would mean that the atheist has no real freedom of will

I never claimed that I did. But then, I don't believe the author of this piece, or anyone else, does either.

&gt;and has no reason to trust his thoughts about reality.

I disagree. That's a non sequitur, it doesn't follow that just because my thoughts are the result of previous input, that I cannot therefore trust them. On the contrary, because my thoughts are based on previous feedback from the environment, they are that much more likely to be linked with reality, at least to the extent that I have experience with what I'm thinking about.

&gt;Therefore, materialistic atheism is self-refuting because it cannot rationally defend its own position as being true.

And, even if I had accepted all his premises, which (see above) I don't, this would still be a non sequitur. Again.

I don't know who this author is, but his logic is flawed, his rationale is ill informed, and his information is incorrect."

It doesn't feel right to hold all the anger in, but at the same time it definitely doesn't feel right to just shrug it all off.

It'd be foolish to forget the hurt that I went through, and to this day, still go through from time to time based on how she subconsciously treats me. But if I have any hopes of having a positive relationship, I can't put up such a wall all the time, she IS trying to be a better mom to me now."

wolfkin,boardgames,1390081431.0,"[Bohnanza] It's a fun theme that's just cartoony to not seem nerdy. Fits your group size. doesn't look intimidating with it's small cards and single deck worth of components. You can get them playing right off with little explanation. The only tricky bit ""you can't harvest a single bean"" you can explain when it comes up. Beyond that it's very engaging and fun.

[Dixit] is a nice and easy game that you can really get goofy with. I had a guy throw the last round by saying Hamburger... his card was the one with a ballerina on it. Depending on the version the board looks like it's a bit intimidating but it's not that bad compared to say risk or Monopoly.

[Forbidden Island] it looks beautiful but it's a bit piece heavy. But it's a group game so that will help. I'd take FI in it's simplicity over Forbidden Desert or Pandemic because they fear complicatedness. (but ouch... that's 4 players)

[Hanabi] is a replacement. it's a card game. very small but easy enough to learn and after 2-3 rounds people will pick up on it and be involved.

[Anomia] for sure should be in your library. it's a fast high intensity game but it's DEAD SIMPLE to teach to learn to play.

[Snake Oil] because now you're looking for dead simple card games but CAH gets boring and Apples to Apples starts boring. Snake Oil is the perfect mix. Like Dixit (which it plays similarly to) you can get goofy or serious depending on how the group feels that day.

Good luck. Just noticed you're coming from Serbia so you'll appreciate the cheaper shipping involved with buying card games. 

**Edit**

[Fluxx] it's not a GREAT game but for getting people interested it's goofy fun. It's practically no teaching. 

[Get Bit]

[King of Tokyo] this game is FANTASTIC for getting people involved. There's a bunch of pieces but they all look FUN.

[Munchkin] it's an easy enough game to play. I know a lot of people here don't like it. But I have met a lot of gamers IRL that do.

[Saboteur] is a nice entry level hidden role game. Easy enough to play. Plays better with 7 players but 5-6 should work."

The point is that American English is useful as a classification of dialects, but no one speaks ""American English"" per se, because it's a set of shared characteristics, not a specific dialect.

ClutchHunter,SubredditDrama,1390082055.0,"&gt; No? I'm nto a console gamer, but my gf got me a ps3 this Christmas for the few good exclusive titles not available on pc. It's a fact that exclusive titles are a selling point and if I'm going to name positive aspects of consoles, good exclusive titles are a plus for owning one.

If you didn't do this, and if others didn't do this, then they wouldn't be exclusive and they'd in all likelihood be available on PC. 

&gt;Show me dude, show me. I tried and I was neither happy with the price, the power and the projected noise. Afaik you can git a completely silent pc media center and some light gaming, but it'll cost you. If you found another way, show me I freaking need one.

Be more specific. I used to frequent /r/buildapcforme so I can certainly try. It'll be more expensive than a console initially (as with most good PCs) but still cheaper in the long run. 

&gt;No, but enough. Turn on the console, pop in the game, press play GO! Little more complicated with a pc and not everyone is a multitasking junkie like me, so just playing a good game on the couch is the preferred experience for many people.

Turn on the console, put the disc in the tray, press play, wait for an eternity for it to load, versus, assuming you're already at your PC doing any manner of different things: Click on the shortcut, wait a short amount of time for it to load, bam. (This is assuming you have an SSD - why wouldn't you?)

&gt;But for some people that doesn't matter, at all. They just want to GAME and a console lets you just GAME which can arguable be the superior experience.

If they don't care, fine. I'd argue they're probably being facetious about it, but fine. But *superior*? No. It's *literally* inferior. 

&gt;Anyway, the steam box is worse than a regular windows 7 pc in every aspect and much worse in the most important aspect for console gamers, games.

The OS is free, more secure and more ethical. You're also breaking free of Microsoft's chains. That may not be a plus to you but to me it's enormously positive. 

&gt;There is no market for it right now.

Perhaps. In a couple of years once PCs are so far superior to these consoles, inevitably, it may be more viable when Valve can go ""look, this is so much better."" Hopefully by then game support on Linux will be better too, I certainly expect it to be thanks to Valve primarily. "

Riali,ABraThatFits,1390082065.0,"I'm rather with heatherlorali on this one; I'd be pretty darn skeptical of an etsy bra shop.  Sewing is time consuming in any case, and with bras in particular, having complicated construction, lots of hardware, nice fabrics (because really, if it's a custom bra, one is going to want something a bit posher than white cotton), I don't see how you'd turn a profit, or enough of one to make it worth your time, without cutting some corners.  Also, as to fit, there are a quite a few common fit problems that can be addressed through sewing - strap placement, band length, asymmetry, etc, but anything wire is another ball of wax.  I'm assuming you're looking to buy the wires available from sewing suppliers.  This means that you're pretty constrained in regards to customizing wire width and height, two big fit issues for a lot of people.  There'll be a certain amount you can do by altering the amount projection you incorporate, (ie, making a very narrow projected 32FF by using wires meant for a 32E with more cup fabric) but ultimately, you'll be held back by your hardware, unless you have some sort of plan to get custom underwires made, which sounds expensive.  

I've read a few blogs about bra sewing, and made a bikini top myself (easier than a bra, cuz stretch everything!) and the consensus generally is that it's just not worth it.  It's really hard to keep the cups from getting pointy and torpedo like, the embellishments and lace that are possible with commercial machines are a pain in the ass with home systems, and the whole process is just plain finicky.  I'm not familiar with your sewing experience, you might be incredibly awesome, but I'd be cautious trusting someone with a lifetime of professional tailoring experience to make me a custom bra, let alone someone with a history of hobby sewing.  

If you can somehow design a cup shape, sizing system, and construction process that are effective and cost efficient, and make attractive designs, then I can see you having a limited market in asymmetrical bras and particularly hard to find sizes, especially small bands, but in the end, you're competing with Poland, where we can order a customized, embellished, beautiful, resalable bra from a well established company for ~65 USD.

tangerinelion,buildapc,1390082102.0,"There are two important numbers about RAM that you need to know: the clock speed it can handle and the latency at that speed.  Achieving higher clocks is relatively easy if you use a high latency; achieving low latency is relatively easy if you use a low clock speed.  

The trouble matters when you start to have applications that are RAM limited.  Gaming is *NOT* one of them.  If you're building a PC where gaming is the most taxing thing it does, all you need is a 1600MHz speed or better with decent CAS latency (meaning 9 or lower; avoid 10+) from a reputable vendor.

However if you do have RAM intensive applications then you benefit from doing a bit of research and figuring out what you can get.  For example you would ideally want a high clock rate with low latency, which requires only the best of memory chips.  IMO, if this is your build goal and you can expect to see a 5% improvement in real-world then you should be willing to pay up to 5% more than the *SYSTEM* cost for that.  In that regard, I think the difference between a $200 set of sticks and a $130 set of sticks you'll find that $70 difference is acceptable if the system costs at least $1400 and you can get at least 5% or more out of your intended application.  (Of course, ask if another $70 towards the CPU would get you, say, 8% or not as that would be a better use of the money.)"

yup, im pretty familiar with asio since I do quite a bit of music production. Meant more about how would the features you want compare to something like asio.  
  
 about the snap and pops, I have never experienced that in the past few years,but then again I'm not sure what kind of DSP you want to put on top of the audio output from the game.  But I have played game demos running with various forms of realtime audio effects and no hiccups.    
Not saying its not an issue, but I personally haven't experienced it in games other than general IO or game refresh errors, but I imagine that would happen with non cpu dsps too. I think it really depends on the implementation. Maybe there is something in DX that could get you close to what you want with some monkey patching?  I'd be really interested to see what sort of things you could push with that. Have you tried going to Mac side dev too? Atleast for audio production, core audio blew asio and dx audio out of the water.
  
Also I don't think Microsoft are turning their backs on businesses. There are a lot of enterprise features added into windows 8. About gaming, I would say that's a maybe. I haven't seen anything that shows they are going either way on that, but I think they're making the right decision and focusing on their gaming platform and porting the changes back to windows and DX. No point having two teams do the same work.

Most (~90%) PhDs are not going to end up with academic jobs, and ""alternative careers"" don't necessarily require a PhD. However, if the choice is between being cheap labor as a grad student and earning a steady stipend for ~6 years with your loans in deferment or being unemployed/underemployed and stuck with student loan debt, I can see why a PhD would look like the best option.

EDITED TO ADD: You should be applying for the [NIH postbacs](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs) if you haven't already (assuming you're American...)."

I should note I don't *let* him have human food, he's just a mastermind at finding stuff. He spends his entire waking life prowling around the house looking for anything edible, he even goes fishing through all the bins. Anything dangerous has to be put in the outside bin right away or he'll have it back out. 

We even have to store bread in a leather bag hanging on the back of the kitchen door as he's stolen and eaten several loaves. Every week I have to find a new hiding place for the cat food or he figures out how to get at it and eats about 10 days worth of food - this is 3 cats worth of food, so an entire months worth of food for a single cat.

The only time in his life he's not been looking for food was late Christmas day. He eat his entire packet of Christmas treats in one go when no one was looking, then had his special treat tin of food for dinner. Ate the skin off the turkey, the fat off the ham, the giblets from the turkey, then he started on the left-over veggies, and finally licked clean everyone's plate eating every scrap of leftovers as well as all the gravy (we thought the kitchen door was shut). He then beat up the younger kitten, stole his packet of treats and waddled off to bed and couldn't move for about 8 hours. I have all three cats trained so that when I call ""Nom Noms"" they run to the kitchen and wait by their bowls. I called it that evening and for the first time in his life he didn't move -he's normally the first one there.

He's been on a diet ever since to try and get all the extra weight off since he looked like a football by that point. Oh did I mention he is only 8 months old...

I'm going to start letting them outside in spring as it's a quiet area with lots of grassy places to play in and have got them all wearing their collars with tags now to get them used to them.

I used condoms every time with my ex and we were together for 6 years also, BUT I was not on any other kind of bc. now, I have the BC implant and I don't use condoms with my current partner because I trust the BC. also, we used the pull out method for quite a while and didn't have any problems with that, so the only time we used condoms was in the very beginning and it didn't last for long."

That's not the whole story though.  The other cases have been avialable for much longer.  So people are tired of them.  The winter cases have not been available long and they have a upcoming end date .  Also new is always better, people like the new skins.  They see the old skins all the time, new skins are cool.  

So now you might ask ""why is the winter eSports worth so much less than the winter case?"".  That's easy, the winter case has cooler weapons. 

You may think that the winter case prices will jump after the winter event ends.  Which should be true, EXCEPT for the fact that valve will release a new set/box and nobody will want the winter stuff anymore.

myth1n,mtgfinance,1390082603.0,"also a good idea to spec on foils of those you mentioned if you have the access to. I love speccing on slow moving gainers, but the foil versions of those slow moving gainers. Right now sliver legion foils that i picked up for about 25-30 are at about 50 in worth, the non foil is creeping up to about 25 recently, the foils that are left at 50 (i think there were maybe 3-4 on tcg thats it), after that those foils will probably go up to about 60-80. Same with foil griselbrand, i picked up 5 of them for anywhere between 32-37, now it seems like the cheapest you can get one is 80 and come modern season, it may even creep above 100. Other foil specs i like are, scavenging ooze m14 foil. there are a lot of the dotp foils, but the actual m14 print foils are going to be worth more later on, you may be able to come across them for cheap. definitely thoughtseize foils if you have access to grab some of those as well. since you said you draft often, i would say master of waves if you can grab foils would be worthy, they are used in modern merfolk, and should definitely retain value overtime. Foil chromatic lanterns which ive been picking up for $4-5 in trades or bought on ebay for $5 average, will be edh staples and definitely be worth more than $6 that they are going for now. Foil edh specs are nice because edh players love to pimp out their decks. I also picked up 4x forced fruition off tcg for $4 each, now those are worth $15 each due to how popular nekusar is. I picked up 4x phryexian obliterators for $20 each, even though this card may just be hype, it doesnt change the fact that it is a 3rd set mythic rare, from a older set, so its rarity itself lends it to be worth more than $20 even if it never gets used in modern, those foil obliterators go for $50 now. If you see foil swan songs, def try to trade for those as well or draft them, Ive picked up a few here and there for 4-5, but i think they should be worth $15 at least, side board in some modern and maybe legacy decks (i havent seen it used too much yet, but i still think its a good spec).

wraith313,NoFap,1390082698.0,"Idk. I havn;t even seen the PUA talk the topic is about tbh. But it's beside the point to me. Personally, I do NoFap because I get depressed when I masturbate. And that depression was preventing me from accomplishing goals and meeting new people (and meeting women - the end result of which would be sex and/or a girlfriend). Personally, I was never ""addicted"" to fapping. I never had ED. It never messed up a portion of my life. But with NoFap, my life has improved. 

So idk how to read that. But I certainly don't fit into the category being described up there as the type of person who comes to NoFap. So that makes me think that, because I don't fit the mold, I will be judged myself because my end goal isn't simply to ""end an addiction"". That is what led me to make these posts. Not necessarily to defend PUA or whatever, but more to defend people who don't fit the mold of being ""addicted"" to porn and fapping. Not everyone in NoFap, I believe, is addicted. I just think they are working on self control, discipline, and perhaps have physiological reasons for it. My *mood* is DEFINITELY affected by masturbation. I definitely realize that, and NoFap helped me realize and overcome that."

I imagine he could feel a bit weird about dating a 23 year old also, even if he typically dates younger women. I asked a girl out right after I turned 30 and it turned out she was 19.

What? No, I'm saying that the goal is to destroy strategic targets such as industries, ports, etc. Which there were a lot of in both Tokyo and Kyoto. The goal was never to kill civilians.

For example, these were the [targets considered for nuclear bombing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Choice_of_targets):

&gt;The Target Committee nominated four targets: Kokura, the site of one of Japan's largest munitions plants; Hiroshima, an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters; Niigata, a port with industrial facilities including steel and aluminum plants and an oil refinery; and Kyoto, a major industrial center.

The point is: killing civlians is the unfortunate side effect of bombing strategic targets, not the other way around.

The next half an hour was excruciating. I had to pee SO BAD and my mom had to drive me to the doctor (every bump gave me a heart attack) and then they actually had the gall to make me wait a long time in the waiting room. When I was finally seen, she started the ultrasound and stopped for a second and was like ""That's the fullest bladder I've ever seen"" and right after just opened the door in front of me and it was a glorious, glorious toilet.

wraith313,NoFap,1390083135.0,"My response to that is that it wouldn't be overcoming alcohol addiction at all. If you try to stop masturbating so you can get better at having sex with real women, that isn't the same as doing NoFap to get better at jerking off or edging. 

If you are trying to move in a direction that involves NoFap, why should we tell you that your end goal is stupid or wrong? Who cares what the end goal is? The NoFap part is what we are here to help with. A lot of people do NoFap because fapping affects their mood and, thus, their social ability. Maybe they are lonely. Maybe they want to make more friends. Maybe they seek outside validation. Maybe they see shame in their masturbation but not in having sex with women. Who are we to say one reason or another is better. The reason *does not matter*. The *process* matters and that is what we are here to help with and support. That is what I am saying.

Perhaps sadness and loneliness is why they are masturbating to begin with, and then they come on here and get excited and talk about how they want to be around people and meet a lot of women and be with them. Then someone posts telling them how stupid that is and how they are just ""replacing an addiction"" and how that isn't good at all. What happens then? They get upset that their supportive community is just putting them down and masturbate more. That isn't helpful. And it doesn't matter *why* someone is doing NoFap, again."

wolfkin,boardgames,1390083198.0,"my first time at my FLGS was awkward. like radically awkward. But it wasn't that bad. I hovered a bit trying to figure out what was going on and I'm a 6'2"" black guy so I have a bit of presence to me. But eventually someone pulled me aside to play Thurn and Taxis. Great game. Dead boring theme. Had fun. From there I made it to other meetups.

&gt;What is the protocol for going to a game night? Presumably you arrive on time and not in the middle of people's games.

In my experience it's pretty flexible. The Thursday one I go to is 6-10. I arrived near 7 and I wasn't the last one. Everyone was already started so I just waited out the games and others came. I brought out Smash Up and we played that. Ended up playing Chaosmos afterwards and by then it was 10. Be early if you can and if you're worried about hovering. I also suggest you bring a game you can teach. something quick-ish. 

&gt; Is it usually the same crowd most weeks? Are people who go to game nights so hard-core that they get frustrated with others who are learning a game for the first time?

From what I can tell there is always a few people who are regulars, but they aren't 100% of the people there. The Thursday group isn't new by any chance and I've been going on and off (mostly off) for months. Last time there were two new people. 2 of the three of us knew how to play Smash Up the third was new. It took him about 5-6 rounds until he really picked up on how the game works. I mean I'm super patient but I've been that new guy too struggling with analysis paralysis and such but people are generally pretty patient. It helps that I'm willing to lose. I never count the first game. Every move I make is about testing what happens and how it all works. yeah that means in Game of Thrones I 'offended' my neighbor and started a war on turn 1 that would lead to him winning the game by taking over my last castle but whatever. Now I see how important territory is and how much the Tyrells suck balls."
KingNarcissus,AskMen,1390083203.0,"I totally get what you're saying about the ""once in a lifetime"" feeling. I can feel really attracted to a girl on the street, and feel it back from her, but at the same time logic and rationality kicks in. I think ""There's attraction here, there's also x amount of reasons why this wouldn't work out, even in the short term."" Even when I cross paths with a girl that is my exact physical type, I still doubt our real compatibility. (I don't think an exact match on physical type is the limiting factor in dating, anyway; there's more physical matches than personality matches in my experience.) Plus, I've had enough of these interactions to know it's not a once-in-a-lifetime thing for me, either.

You can probably guess that I've never talked to a girl after this kind of interaction. Some of it is probably approach anxiety, and the other part is the rational explanation above. It'd be a great story in serendipity if a relationship started this way, but I think the effort-to-return ratio is too low for me.

My canine teeth never grew in, but about a month ago (I'm 30) I felt something coming down behind my front teeth. It was one of my canines.  I had to go to the dentist yesterday and get 2 fillings replaced. She started explaining to me what might happen with my tooth, and I had a full on panic attack in the chair.

Luckily, after a lifetime of horrible experiences with the dentist, this new lady I've been seeing for about a year is amazing. She talked me through it, helped calm me down with breathing, and was overall amazingly reassuring. Just having someone there, not judging me for my fear, and willing to work with me meant so much.

I think you're lucky that your wife is supportive of you. My husband doesn't understand my fear, and sort of rolls his eyes when I get all panicky before my appointments. Having someone be there for you makes all the difference in the world.

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390083308.0,"I just flipped through a bit of your comment/submission history - and I saw that you are in the IT field, but have always been interested in pursuing art in some capacity - and from the looks of it, you're fond of concept art. Based on this particular drawing, where you've *begun* to explore the purpose behind the various elements of your design, you seem to be interested in hard surface and mechanical design. Mechs, space ships, high-tech contraptions, etc.

Yes, it's true, a formal education can help. That depends heavily on the individual, however. These days, the idea of education, when it comes to art, is extremely varied. You have your normal art schools, which are often prohibitively expensive, like Art Center College of Design, Rhode Island School of Design, etc. Then you have smaller schools, that instead of pushing you through a set program of courses over several years, offer individual classes. For example, Concept Design Academy and Red Engine School of Design. Far more affordable, but **not everyone has the funds to relocate, or even take time off from work to study**.

Then there's online classes; these definitely require you to be far more driven and self-motivated, but they offer the guidance and advice of an instructor as well as a set curriculum. [CGMA](http://2d.cgmasteracademy.com/), [Schoolism](http://www.schoolism.com/) are two that are well known.

The pricing of these are similar to those of the previous tier, but the classes can be taken from anywhere in the world, and some provide a great deal of flexibility.

Last of all, and this is the one I suggest to you right now, are books. I'm sure you've flipped through plenty of books, and while they all look exciting and helpful at first, they may not have done that much to improve your work. I've experienced the same thing, since I had been entirely self-taught until October 2013, when I attended a single term at Concept Design Academy in Los Angeles.

I will recommend one book to you, which I actually purchased after returning home in December. I haven't had a chance to work through it entirely, but I very much intend to. I've flipped through this book's contents, and it very much mirrors one of the classes I took at CDA, and I think it's the sort of thing that would apply to you. It's called [How to Draw](http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Draw-Sketching-Environments-Imagination/dp/1781166862/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390080881&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=how+to+draw+scott+robertson) by Scott Robertson, the former head of the Entertainment Design department at Art Center (one of the most highly regarded art schools in the entertainment industry). It covers things from the absolute basics, building up to more advanced topics, and does so in a manner that reflects the structure of a course. It's the sort of book that I intend to read and follow along, doing all the exercises from beginning to end.

The manner in which he draws, and that he teaches the reader to draw, matches up with hard-surface vehicle and mech design. A lot of focus on perspective, and establishing the solidity of a three dimensional form. I strongly recommend that you invest in this book, if you are in fact interested in pursuing this field, or even interested in doing it as a significant hobby. Before you do, though, to get a better idea of how Scott Robertson approaches these things, take a look at his [Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/scottrobertsondesign), where he's posted several instructional videos.

Last of all, I wanted to point out that though you are in the IT field, you are entirely capable of achieving any artistic aspirations you set out for yourself. I myself spent five years getting a degree in Interactive Multimedia Design, interned for a year as a student web developer, worked for fourteen months as a game programmer for an educational game company and still spend a lot of my time developing websites and HTML5 web apps. I haven't made it yet as an illustrator a concept artist, but the past couple of years have shown me that it is more than possible to do so, given the effort and drive.

**Actual critique regarding the image you posted**

It's a good start, but try and break your space ships down into primitive shapes (rectangles, triangles, circles etc). For now, feel free to work entirely on a profile (side) view, but keep in mind that when you want to rotate this ship into a 3/4 view, your rectangles will become boxes, your triangles will become triangular prisms, your circles will be come spheres, etc. As such, it will make your transition into 3D space far easier.

I absolutely love how you've started to put in those little callouts as to the purpose of different elements. Try and push that as far as you can, and spend a lot of time thinking on how SOL-4 would work. Where is the engine situated? What kind of fuel does it burn? Where is that fuel stored? Where does the pilot sit? Is there room for cargo? Is it an offensive ship, or intended to transport people, or goods? Concept design is, as a field, entirely focused on problem solving. You are faced with a problem; I need a space ship that will do serve a specific purpose. Now, I need to design a space ship that will serve as a solution to that problem.

Best of luck, and I hope that, if you are truly interested in pursuing an artistic field, that you do so in whatever capacity you can, despite any fears or worries that you might have."

I thought that they were separate products, but both of them seemed to reduce the appearance of lines. Things are very expensive here, a bottle of cetaphil cleanser is like $20. So $40 is expensive, but not creme de la mer ridiculous.

&gt;Also, fyi Differin is not a spot treatment.  You should be using it on your entire face.  It is a retinoid and it takes up to 16 weeks for your skin to acclimate to it.  

Really? The doctor said to just put it in the areas where I get pimples - they're almost entirely limited to my jaw area. I've been using it for about 8 weeks at this stage.

&gt;For under your eyes, try Aquaphor at night.  It's less greasy than Vaseline and I find it does a great job of helping with dryness.

I woke up in the night in a puddle of my own blood and panicked. I ran into the bathroom, where I promptly passed out from the blood loss. I came to, in another puddle of blood, from my dad shaking me and my brother calling the ambulance. The EMTs had to scrape me off the floor (oh, and I was only in my bra) and transport me to the hospital in the middle of a blizzard. 


They gave me painkillers there and brought a variety of doctors around before transferring me to a different hospital where they tried to get my period to stop. No dice. The first set of painkiller had actually *accelerated* the bleeding (IIRC) and I went from bad to worse.

Within a couple more hours, I had lost enough blood that I was in pain from the start of organ failure and required blood transfusions if I wanted to live. I floated in and out of various states of awareness before just blacking out, not quite sure if I was going to wake up or not. 

Obviously, I survived. I've been hospitalized several times since for severe blood loss associated with my period; it's from VWD and it happens randomly. I still can't get anyone to remove my uterus, though, and birth control and I do not get a long thanks to thyroid problems. I think my all-time-record length period was three months while on shots to prevent my period, which culminated into another hospital visit for, you guessed it, blood loss. "

Wuffles70,loseit,1390083402.0,"Speaking as someone who also has some body dysmorphia and binges fairly easy... I know you're kinda crawling out of your skin right now and want to get it changed as soon as you possibly can but your daily calories are too low. 

I've done a bit of number crunching and the absolute *bare minimum* your body uses just to function is 1500. Even assuming you have a relatively sedentary lifestyle and don't do sport, you need to be eating around 1785 calories to fuel your daily activities and loose weight safely. If you keep at this level, you're not only going to make the BDD worse, you're going to get tired, feel sick and binge eat - not fun. 

The best way you could reduce your body fat and look less 'chubby' (quotation marks because you may well not be - BDD does some horrible things to you) is through exercise. I would work out, eat a bit more than you are currently and go see a therapist. Whilst you wouldn't count as underweight on the BMI at 115, It's by a fairly narrow margin. A lot of people look really unhealthy that thin and you will probably find it hard to maintain - it'd better to weigh a bit more but, because of your muscles, come out with smaller measurements and a BF% that guarantees a more defined jawline.

The thing I'm emphasizing above EVERYTHING though is a therapist. Go see one - no amount of weight loss is going to make you feel better if this negative body image is still there and you deserve to feel good about yourself. You don't need our permission to pursue any goal you might have BUT I do think your focus is off. Nourish your body, see someone who can help and, if you want to drop a few pounds as you do so, do it in a healthy and responsible manner. You'll look better when you get there and feel better if you do it that way. I wish you all the best - feel free to PM me if you'd like any information about how I figured out your calorie counts or would just like to chat. This stuff can be really, really hard and you deserve to feel better than you do currently. Best of luck. "

austex_mike,AdviceAnimals,1390083646.0,"&gt; you sure as heck can't use that shitty logic on any other products (gas comes to mind, along with food in gas stations, hot dogs, nachos, the candy you bag yourself).

Soda is very different from most of those other examples. 

Gas is sold by the gallon (or litre). That is the price you agree upon. I am charged a different amount if I fill half my tank than I am charged for a full tank. With soda I am charged the same price for a cup of soda no matter how much I fill my cup, or how much soda/ice mixture there is, so it is extremely variable leaving lots of gray area. 

Food in gas stations is mostly the same. Candy by the bag is charged by the pound (or gram), you pay for one hot dog at a time. 

The only example that you cited that is similar is if there are self serve nachos. So that is probably worth exploring. Although I have seen the trend towards weighted charge for this as well. A salad bar will charge by the pound in places like Whole Foods. Also I have not seen a full self service nacho stand in years. 

But what I am curious about is why people feel like it is some great crime to expect free refills? I love getting free refills and think it is one of the better aspects of American food culture, even if it makes us fat. ;) "

Yeah there are a few nice places to visit there, like the rade, the castle, the naval museum or Oceanopolis. Stangalars greenhouse makes also a nice visit if you are fond of endagered rare and beautiful plants. But If you're going to make the trip, I would recommand you include some cool villages &amp; places around the coast as well. You could even visit an island like Ouessant or Molene. Brest's architecture itself is usualy not viewed as very beautiful because the city was pretty much destroyed during the second war and rebuilt in a hurry with the help of Americans. So it has lost a lot of charm in the the process. 

The most well-known event which takes place in Brest is the convergence of thousands of sailboats for a big party every 4 years at summer. But it happened last year so you'll have to wait 3 more years for the next one.

DrinksWellWithOthers,POLITIC,1390083660.0,"Fine, an AR-15 isn't an assault weapon.  You win the word choice argument.  What if it were an assault weapon -- a distinction without a difference.  Also, I probably wouldn't have jumped out of the car either, but I also wouldn't call someone who did a retard, but a person who was very surprised and justifiably so.  I was using the dead body as analogous to something that would surprise them but wouldn't, as you say, ""jump up and bite them.""  Third, if they were pulled over by the cops and there was a visible weapon that could be construed as an assault rifle, the cops may take extra precautions and have everyone get on the ground or even cuff everyone until they sorted things out.  So if a cop would be justified in reacting by pulling his weapon or taking other precautions, civilians might be excused for overreacting without being called retards.  The ""it's not mine I swear, it was in here when we got the car"" I think is going to be seen by a cop as a flimsy excuse for possession without a license.  This has nothing to do with rights.

lamblikeawolf,short,1390083684.0,"In your position, I would tell your supervisor about it, and I would continue to tell them to stop. When they tell you ""aww, it's fun, you're so cute."" you need to respond that it is not okay to touch someone else without their permission, let alone physically lifting a person into the air. You need to tell them that if they don't stop, you will be notifying their supervisors, and have already notified yours. It is inappropriate behavior in a professional setting. (If you're all adults working on a project, it's a professional setting. It's not a casual hang out and grope people setting. It is not a make out with your boyfriend/girlfriend instead of working setting.)

If this doesn't make them stop, tell their supervisor, if different from yours. (if it's the same as yours, report all incidents to them.) If the supervisors do nothing, take it higher up the chain of command. As much as I hate how women are treated differently in these kinds of cases, you're going to have an easier time of reporting and getting somewhere with it because you're female.

It is inappropriate behavior from co-workers, even if you're all ""just students"" and none of you are getting paid. You have a right to not be touched. They have no right to lay their hands on you without your permission."

If you're already in a 38 with too small cups, I'd throw out the 40 bands, and probably start at 38DD.  The fit you're describing actually means a too loose band (riding up, falling straps, scoop and swoop not staying) but if your bra is not very new and not the greatest quality, I'd bet it stretches to quite a lot over 38 inches.  I'd look for wider bands, with firmer stretch. It's not a size range I'm hugely familiar with, but I think Elomi is pretty good.

wraith313,AdviceAnimals,1390083829.0,"Not to put down your accomplishment, but consider this: You keep your minimum wage job for 4 years and scratch and save every dime you can to hit 5 figures. 

4 years: you saved and saved and put off buying things you wanted, didn't eat out much, didn't do many social things to save money, lived near the poverty line (not such a bad thing), don't have a lot of prospects besides advancement at minimum wage.

Alternatively, you go to a community college and get a certification, lets say EMT, that takes 2 years. It effectively doubles your base income. Then you spend a year working and pay off your degree relatively easily while building an emergency fund and saving, lets say, 5000 because CC is pretty inexpensive. Thats 3 years. Year 4 you study and take tests for advancement in your job while you are working and you manage to hit 5 figures of income saved, no debt, you get a job advancement because of the tests and now you get paid, lets say, 2.5 times minimum wage.

4 years: emergency fund, investments, better job/prospects, networking contacts in the field you are in,  degree/certification, transcript to go to better school should you choose to do so, and over 5 figures in savings.

This is not even remotely difficult or not possible. Honestly. Especially if you managed to save 5 figures on minimum wage. The difference is, you were scratching and scraping so hard to do it like you are now and you could be making it much easier on yourself and not living in (likely) poverty to do it either.

huisme,Bowyer,1390083850.0,"Accuracy isn't so much my concern as structural integrity.

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390083945.0,"Even in my paintover, I didn't start with any lineart. It's all about what makes you feel most comfortable, when interacting with a particular subject. Fruit is generally quite simple, so it tends to be easier to just blob a shape of solid colour onto your canvas than arduously drawing out a line drawing of it, then worrying about trying to adhere to it.

Line drawing will, however, become useful in the future, as you approach more complicated objects, because it allows you to plan things out. It still is totally possible to avoid working in line, but doing so just because you're bad at it isn't really a decent reason. Working at it will simply cause you to get better at it. Furthermore, the exercises that help you get better at your linework will also improve the flow of your brush strokes while painting.

When I started my paintover, I put down an approximate blob-shape of one colour. It wasn't entirely correct, though, so similarly to how you went about it, I cleaned up the edge. I didn't, however, do it with little strokes - instead, I used broad strokes to carve into my shape. Think about it in terms of carving a block of wood into a bust of a person's head and shoulders. When you start, you're not going to go at it with the finest, most precise chisel in your toolbox - you're probably going to start smacking it with an axe, or at least something reasonably large and imprecise. Once you get into the fine details of the face, you pull out your tiny-tools. Between those two points, you're slowly working from rough and approximate gradually moving towards more precision.

Similarly, when digital painting, you will probably find it far more effective to move from big to small.

As for the colours, that's a common mistake among beginners. It's just a matter of developing one's ability to look at a colour, and have a sense of how to achieve that colour in your painting. The best way to practice that is to do a lot of studies from photographs or from life, and to avoid colour-picking with the eye dropper from your reference as much as possible.

**Edit**: I see the sticker, now. I think the only issue with the sticker is that you have an orange dot in the middle of it, which to me appears as though it's the orange's skin, and not part of the sticker. Since that makes the sticker appear to be more of a ring, I think that's what's confusing your viewers."

If your grip is good in those tricks you grip in split grip aysha should be fine.

stinatown,FireflyFestival,1390084108.0,"I've been to Roo three times ('10, '11, and '13) and Firefly twice ('12, '13, going again this year). 

The vibe at Roo is unique, at least among the festivals I've been to. There is a ton of camaraderie. Being on a farm in the middle of nowhere makes you feel like you've stumbled upon some sort of utopian village. The acts are top-notch. All things you know.

Roo has had over a decade to establish this kind of vibe, though. Firefly is pretty new. The first year of Firefly was wonderful in a different way--there were some amazing artists, the crowds were small, I had a really great campsite, etc. The second year, there were a lot more people, but I still enjoyed the vibe and it seemed well-organized. It's not Roo, but for a new festival, I had a great time. There were a few hiccups--the sound at Ellie Goulding was really bad, for example--but I've been to new festivals that have had much bigger problems. One serious disadvantage is that Firefly is very close to the ""real world""--you're right next to a highway--so it's hard to get that ""closed off from the world"" feeling. On the flipside, if you need to get something from the real world, it's a short walk to the nearest gas station--I went on a snacks-and-cigarettes journey during the first year that only took about 40 minutes round-trip.

The main advantage for Firefly is that it is much closer to where I live. Bonnaroo is a sixteen hour drive, and driving there--and back--is exhausting and expensive. Also, the weather/heat is a little more forgiving in Delaware than Tennessee. 

Bottom line: there is a world of difference between the two. Firefly is still a very decent festival that is getting bigger and better each year."

Wolvee,leagueoflegends,1390084245.0,"I think the attempt at fixing her Q (to scale better when she's doing poorly, and scale worse when she's doing well) was exactly the right thing to do. It means she doesn't necessarily succeed or fail in the first 5 minutes of a match. Time will tell how the specific numbers play out there: whether it was overdone or if it (more likely) will need tweaking as they monitor the situation.

What I take umbrage with is the shield nerf. If they had done one or the other, I'd be more okay with it. But nerfing her shield time by 60% is just crazy. 2.5 seconds is not a long time, especially on a 10-6 second cooldown. 1.5 seconds is such a ridiculously small window.

I guess the idea is that, with changing the Q damage scaling to total AD, there is less incentive to go complete glass cannon (with the shield being the one saving grace, that allows the glass cannon build some survivability). That is: without the necessity to go almost entirely AD items for the Q, the nerf to the shield might be offset by increased item flexibility for a little more tankiness. But I still think the shield nerf was overdone."

What was life like BEFORE you got married? He certainly needs to see a sex therapist of some kind. because I can imagine that the 'I couldn't help it, I was horny' line won't work again. 

Men supposedly think about sex every 7 secs or minutes (not sure which!) it seems accurate to him! as for wanting sex in the morning - we always get ""morning wood"" it comes with the territory of not really concentrating in our sleep so all the blood rushes to our 'other head'! I know I'm being over humourous, and I apologise if this is inappropriate, given the situation. 

Given that he has to come up to 20 times a week... that could well be a problem - or as someone put it, maybe he is still immature. If he's constantly horny - how does he manage at work? I did read once of a woman that was constantly orgasming up to 200 times a day - now that is extreme, but maybe the issues are similar. I'm actually surprised he's not more exhausted.

Obviously, Alice enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter, but will Bob?

If Bob doesn't enter with the counter, shouldn't you be using the singular rather than plural (e.g., ""The creature recruited by Royal Recruiter [...]"")? After all, only one creature will ever be recruited *by the Recruiter* each time you cast him. (Not considering Strionic Resonator)."

I think you've got that backwards, dude. When middle schoolers ""sort out their own problems,"" it often ends with referrals. Source - I teach middle schoolers. Part of growing up and learning to be an adult is knowing how to ask for help before a situation gets out of control.

Also, I would say that OP has already attempted to handle the situation as well as possible. She told them not to pick her up. They aren't being respectful, and obviously don't think particularly highly of anything she has to say by ignoring it.

On top of this, physical harassment is never appropriate in any setting. It isn't ""weakness"" and it doesn't make you a ""snitch"" to get an authority figure involved. If they didn't want the consequences of the action, they shouldn't have done the action. The person on the receiving end of the action did not cause the consequences.

Jadzia Dax is arguably beyond gender, what with being both Jadzia and Dax simultaneously, as well as all the previous hosts of the Dax symbiont. I always understood her attraction to Worf (and his attraction to her) to be deeply rooted in her memories of living as a Klingon. To me, she is one of the most fascinating characters in the Star Trek universe. I also don't know if it's fair to call Worf an alpha-male. Maybe in comparison to the human characters based on appearance alone, but he lived in exile and shame for many years (TNG era Worf anyways) and was considered weak and damaged by other Klingons, both for the scandal surrouding his House and his choice to join Starfleet and work with humans. And if he were a true alpha, wouldn't he be put off by her insight into the male mind? Her masculine habits? Her bromance with Sisko? 

That's getting way off topic though, are you agreeing with the RoK article that women with short hair are damaged? Do you really think that a short haircut is a rejection of feminity? I read the RoK article, and it was pretty ridiculous to put two pictures of the same woman next to each other with different hairstyles and claim ""No woman in all of human history has ever looked better with short hair than she would with a head full of healthy locks. Despite this irrefutable fact, American women are “chopping it off” in greater numbers every day."" That is absurd. That is laughable to claim. Irrefutable fact? No woman is ***all of history***? It's a ridiculous claim to make, and it reeks to me of click-bait instead of genuine advice, like it's claiming to be."

terp02andrew,overclocking,1390084533.0,"1) Is that the best OC he's achieved? Usually you will reserve delidding for only the best chips, and while 4.2Ghz at 1.232 isn't necessarily a bad OC...for a delidded chip, it's an odd overclock to showcase.

If you are in the US, buying a new 4670K for $199 at MC is a better option. 
If you aren't local to MC, then yeah your options are a bit more limited (e.g. forum sales) - in terms of a competitive market price anyway.

2) In terms of recommended mobos, I would suggest something like the [GB Z87X-D3H at $135](http://us.ncix.com/products/?usaffiliateid=1000031504&amp;sku=84040&amp;vpn=GA-Z87X-D3H&amp;manufacture=Gigabyte&amp;promoid=1217). The only reason I have my UD4H (and not a more mid-range board) is because Microcenter sold this board for $75 in July :P

3) Power Consumption - depending on the voltage it takes to hit your desired clock, it will probably vary from 50-75W. PCPer's 4770K took 1.33vcore to hit 4.5Ghz, and you can see [the difference in power consumption from stock to 4.5](http://i.imgur.com/lGCh8UA.png). 1.33 is a lot more than the 1.188 it took for me, so there is a marked difference in power consumption from chip to chip.

All things considered, even with an overclocked Haswell and a mid-range GPU (e.g. 770), you are looking at a combined 355-380W combined load. You would be looking at either a quality 450W or 550W unit. What PSU do you have currently?"

&gt; Just because a person needs more calories to maintain their weight doesn't mean it's easier for that person to lose weight.

I disagree with you here. If a person requires a higher number of calories per day, it leaves room for a greater caloric deficient than would be possible for a person requiring fewer calories per day. Ex: A person requiring 3000 calories per day can take in 2000 and be in a 1000 calorie deficient. A person requiring 1500 calories per day is going to have a harder time cutting out 1000 calories. It takes about -3500 calories to lose a pound. The first person is going to meet this goal faster, which is part of the reason I feel men see results faster than women. 

Men absolutely have to put on more muscle than women to be the built kind of attractive that this thread is all about. I never said it was easier for men to reach this ideal, I did say that men see results faster than women. I was addressing this part of the OP:

mahlzeit,karate,1390084639.0,"I'm in it for the fitness (I do lifting and Karate, awesome combo!) first and foremost. If my body (and my mind) would stay in shape while I lay on the couch and eat ice cream all day, I would much rather do that than get my ass to the gym or the dojo.

But as it is I need to train. And don't get me wrong, I love training, but I wouldn't do it if it didn't make me feel so much better about myself and if it didn't make me admire myself in the mirror a little bit ;)

Anyway, I chose lifting and Karate, and although both are very different from each other I feel like they share a very important component: both are more a battle against yourself than anything else. And the goal in both is not to defeat someone else, but to better yourself and be a better, stronger, more disciplined and confident person. It is something that I think will be with me for the rest of my life.

I feel like an MMA fighters' goal is the fight itself. Having that adrenaline kick. Having the courage to go into the octagon, in front of potentially millions of people and having the crap beat out of you. Having that willpower to take a beating for 15-25 minutes and still stay on your feet and throw punches. I do find that inspirational. And those guys always remind me that my punches could be a little bit faster.

But they pay a price for that which I'm not willing to pay. That much punishment to a body will not go unnoticed in the long term, and this is nothing I could accept.

Everybody has their own goals in life. Mine is being a better me than I was before. I don't feel like MMA would be helpful for that, and that's why I prefer plain old Karate.

I have to say, though, that I don't actually think it's as black and white as I've laid it out here. People are always much more complex than a simple Reddit comment."

Everyone starts out all calm and collected, then the chants hit.  Obviously, Daniel Bryan is amused as hell (and it fits his character):

Miz immediately starts smirking, Show and Punk are trying very hard to keep their faces straight before Show just gives up and starts smiling.  Miz gives up also, and Mark Henry keeps bringing a hand to his face, probably to hide his own reaction.  Stephanie repeatedly rolls her eyes while keeping character, and then HHH finally stops talking and they cut to the crowd.

Then, 1:00 in, Shawn Michaels tries to 'quiet the crowd' (and clown around), and Show is obviously laughing.  Booker T has also lost composure at this point when Mark Henry raises Bryan's hand at which point the crowd erupts.

Around 1:10-1:15 we finally see a bit of the other side of the group:  Foley's smiling, Punk's smirking...and luckily the heels (and Khali) do a good job of keeping focus.  I wonder how much JBL and Cole were fed as far as lines to say though."

The fact is, people change *dramatically* between the ages of 16-25. You're almost not even the same person anymore, and you don't want the same things. There's very often no real reason you can point to, and no way to fix it. You just are no longer compatible with a person anymore, no matter how great that person is. It's so hard to be both dumper and dumpee: the dumper, because you feel like a jerk and you can't provide someone you care about with a ""good"" reason for why the relationship is over, the dumpee because there's often none of that ""closure"" that everyone says you need and because it comes as a shock.

I have survived with a [solar camping shower](http://www.wayfair.com/Coleman-Camp-Hand-Shower-2000003481-L6123-K~CLM2126.html?refid=GX21919199460-CLM2126&amp;device=c&amp;ptid=32490523260&amp;gclid=CMWbxpzkiLwCFWRk7Aod1X4AKwP) and baby wipes/baby powder.

With the solar shower, you fill it up with water (I've found that the ice runoff from your cooler is a good way to get water without having to lug it from somewhere or sacrifice your drinking water), then leave it in the sun. Once it warms up, put the bag on the roof of your car and open the hose. You can't get naked (or you can, but at your own risk), but you can rinse off and wash your hair (as a woman with long hair, this is really essential for me). You have to be frugal with the water, since there's not a ton, and it helps to have someone helping you out so that they can shut off the hose or reposition the bag. 

At most festivals, I've gotten away with washing my hair and face with the solar shower and baby wiping/powdering my pits/crotch/elsewhere. You're going to be sweaty and gross no matter what, but this keeps me in check.

Last year at Bonnaroo, someone I was with brought some (new) gasoline containers and filled those with water. He used them to pour water over his feet/legs, arms, and torso. It was nice to rinse off my feet after they got all dirty from walking around. So that's an alternative/addition, as well."

Lots of contemporary practitioners of Islam are living according to stone-age religious/tribal cultural beliefs that are backwards and barbaric.  You can't argue that away with grand visions of a past ""age of enlightenment"" type of empire, nor should you read into it that I am maligning everybody of the Muslim faith by saying so.

Something about being huge makes me very averse to fights. 1) you lose, you look really bad. 2) you win, you look really bad in court as the bully picking on someone smaller. 3) you genuinely frighten someone, even when they started it, and they resort to weapons. 

Of those, 2 and 3 always seem most likely. I've had lots of people take swipes at me with bottles while bouncing, and in college a guy my roommate beat up at a house party kept coming around with buddies looking for revenge. With me and another huge friend there every time, they got scared off. Eventually after two months of that, they did a drive by on our house. Full clip of . 45 into the house.

If she says no, in Louisiana, you can petition a judge to expunge the charges. After the charges are expunged pay the fee and than go after your attorney in small claims court.

legohax,Alienware,1390085573.0,"Thanks for the reply jrebs.  Yes it is easy to feel this way seeing as how I am the one suffering from the bad hardware.  If a car company puts out a defective part, they do a recall and take care of it (at no cost to the customer, warranty or not).  I see no difference here.  They put out a defective mobo, yet if I am not inside of my 1 year warranty, its my responsibility?  Does not seem *right* to me.

The only reason I feel this way is because it is a COMMON problem, not normal wear and tear.  I paid a premium for this brand because I thought it would be superior quality.  It's like paying 15% extra for Samsung or Sony televisions.  I do it because they are better.  This has not been the case for Alienware, and I am extremely disappointed in their (Dell's) customer service.

Thanks for the tip about the warranty, I did not realize it was next day on-site warranty.  I put off the screeching and sound card issues because they were infrequent, and so would have been hard for a technician to troubleshoot.  I wasn't too concerned with the fact that it would not shut down without a hardboot (perhaps I should have been), so I did not get that looked at.

I am going to try to use my brothers adapter to see if it works, but from my research, its probably a defective motherboard.  I will probably end up buyingi an extended warranty because I am a sucker.

You'll lay back with your feet in stirrups, they'll use a speculum to visualize the cervix.  They may or may not numb the opening of the cervix and then clean it with Betadine.  They'll put a thin flexible catheter through the cervix and add about 10ml of saline, then they'll look at your uterus and make measurements.   It's mostly pain free, but you may feel a pinch as the catheter passes, and you may have mild cramping from the saline.

It's not a double standard, different women have different opinions is all. I would have no issues with it if we worked and your child was accepting of it or young enough to grow up knowing me, but other women might not, and that is entirely their choice. It can be an incredibly difficult life, especially if you don't want your own kids, or if the child(ren) are old enough to resist or disrespect new partners."

The blood atonement doctrine was the impetus behind laws in the territory and state of Utah allowing capital punishment by firing squad or decapitation. Though people in Utah were executed by firing squad for capital crimes under the assumption that this would aid their salvation, there is no clear evidence that Young or other top theocratic Mormon leaders enforced blood atonement for apostasy or non-capital crimes like miscegenation. There is, however, some evidence that the doctrine was enforced a few times at the local church level without regard to secular judicial procedure"

There are other things, though be sure to take it slow and steady - don't rush into trying to find out everything that's wrong and fix it all at once. It will come with time, and with numerous attempts at portraiture. One major thing, though that I should have mentioned beforehand, is noise.

I can see that you're trying to put a lot of texture in different places, which causes the viewer's eye to jump around a lot, instead of being guided smoothly through the composition. I can see a bit of stubbly-hair-texture on the scalp, as well as a really contrasty texture in the irises. While it's true that those textures match what probably exists on the subject, you as the artist have the choice to ignore it, if it benefits the composition. Areas of high-detail and information should be reserved for your focal points, and these should be placed strategically to lead the eye around your image. Often times, in illustrations, focal points will even be used to lead the viewer through a story.

Another issue is that the face appears to be somewhat flat. If you compare it to the arms and hands, you'll notice that the face is considerably less defined. I don't actually know too much about the facial structure of a baby, but when doing these portraits, you should push yourself to observe the planes of the face carefully. They're much easier to find on an adult face, where they are quite clearly defined. On a baby it's much more difficult, so you need to push yourself that much harder to find them and incorporate that structure into your painting."

PatHeist,bisexual,1390086172.0,"Hey Lauri! 

I know Finland isn't always the most welcoming place for 'people who are different'. And unfortunately kids, especially around your age, are very susceptible to opinions around them, on who to be and how to act. Growing up can be very confusing, and there's a very strong urge to find somewhere safe where you can belong. Often this makes people feel like they have to act like others around them do, and they can end up pushing people away only to try to fit in themselves.

Do you know if your mom has any gay or bisexual friends? Or how she feels about gays? Often it can be very difficult coming out to your parents when you don't know what their opinions on the subject are. Maybe try talking to her about current LGBT happenings in the news that she might have heard of? See how she reacts, and tell her that you're bisexual if how she talks about the subject makes you comfortable in doing so.

With your friends it can be a little bit more difficult, especially not knowing if they'll talk to others about it. Try telling your closest friends first, and letting them know that you'd prefer it if they didn't tell anyone else. And same as with your mom, it always helps to bring the topic in to discussion to get a feel for what their opinions on gays and LGBT individuals are before telling them.

As for dealing with bullying, it's something that can be very tough. But usually, when you're being picked on for something as specific as this, asking whoever picks on you the right questions at the right time will usually leave them thinking for long enough to leave you alone. If they call you names, ask them why they're making being bisexual out as a bad thing. If they say things like 'it's just wrong', or 'it's disgusting' you let them know that they don't have to be bisexual just because you are, and that your life only affects them as much as they let it. Getting into heated arguments about it isn't going to do a lot, though, and it's probably just best to leave if a situation progresses to that.

Please do respond if you have any questions about anything, or if there's something you need help with."

This isn't a sexual death sentence, so to speak.  Make a doctors appointment, obviously...and you might very well be jumping to conclusions.  But, something like 80% of sexually active people have or have had one or more types of HPV in their lives (those numbers have changed since Gardasil, that's from about ten years ago).  And...Gardasil isn't just for women!  Men can get it to, and I think you're just under the wire (they recommend not getting it if you're over 27).  

To reiterate:  Doctor's appointment.  Ask him to confirm what I'm telling you.  Don't panic.  Practice safe sex (for reasons other than HPV).  BREATHE.  "

CaptainKoala,VirtualWDCPC,1390086766.0,"Amazing race overall, fantastic wheel-to-wheel in the midfield. I was aiming for another podium but considering my terrible driving in the opening stages I'm fortunate to take 6th.

Really disappointing first few laps for me. I went from 4th to 11th courtesy of a lockup at turn 1 on the 2nd lap.

I made my way up to the midfield by the halfway point, and at that point I had a duel with jaynemesis until the end of the race. Jay had a problem on the last corner of the last lap (looked like he barely clipped the grass), if that hadn't happened I have no idea who would have finished ahead. I've had some great duels in Italy and especially USA, but this one has to take the cake.

Very clean driving from what I could see. A few bumps here and there but that's just part of racing sometimes.

Monolith had wheel troubles which couldn't see him through qualifying, which really sucks for him. Other than that things went really well I think.

Great race guys, that was a blast."

Taulon,magicTCG,1390086803.0,"Also not a lawyer, but I have taken several law classes if that counts for anything. According to my textbook,

""The term fair use has been codified in the Copyright Act with four specific (though nonexclusive) guideposts:

1. *Purpose and nature of the use*. If the use of the work is to further education and scholarship, courts are more likely to sympathetic to an assertion of fair use. This does not mean, however, that whole sections of textbooks or copied videotapes may be used with impunity. Also, if the use is for some commercially profitable purpose, this will weigh heavily against the infringer. This is not to say that commercial use is a complete bar to assertion of fair use.

2. *Nature of the work*. If the copyrighted material has not yet been made public, fair use is a difficult defense. Again, this is not to say that a complete bar to nonpublic work exists; newsworthy and factual information are still subject to fair use.

3. *Amount and substantiality used*. Courts essentially analyze the totality of the circumstances regarding the amount of copyrighted material used compared to the entire work at issue. Short phrases and limited use of the copyrighted work are often protected by the fair use defense. Use of a full chapter of a textbook, however, or the downloading of a full software program all but eliminates the fair use defense.

4. *Market effect*. When a copyright holder can demonstrate that the value of a copyrighted work will dimish, a court will be reluctant to allow a fair use defense (even if the use fits the other three categories). Fair use cannot impair the marketability or economic success of the copyrighted work.""(Cyberlaw and E-Commerce Regulation, Sean Melvin, page 127)

As far as flair on this subreddit goes, yeah, we *may* be able to get away with it under fair use. The defense isn't super solid in this situation though, a lawyer who wants to can spin the details and information of this case so badly against us, especially since reddit is a commercial site. For starters, Wizards could make the argument that their copyrighted work is being used on a commercial site without permission. From there it is not a huge leap to assert that this is profiting from wizards' copyright. Courts tend to look really unfavorably at that, often times open and shut unless there is a really spectacular defense. So if Wizards really wanted to press the issue and take a case to court, reddit could potentially end up on the losing end of a copyright infringement case, and in my opinion I think reddit probably would lose that case."

Also, taking mulligans to see those cards in opening hands shouldn't be viewed as a negative but rather an educated risk, you brought those cards in for a reason.

/u/pvddr said:

&gt; it really makes much more of a difference to draw your sideboard than to play well and I don't like that very much

I disagree. Sideboarding, to me, goes hand-in-hand with playing well and is always more potent in the hands of players with more experience. I get what he is saying about linear strategies but those decks are going to exist regardless.

Standard loses this dynamic with only a few top tier decks and no lower tier decks that can consistently give those decks at the top a run for their money. Even when Caw-Blade and Valakut/Eldrazi ramp composed most of standard you could still get there with rogue decks if you took the time to understand the decks you more than likely going to play against and sideboarding was a very big part of that."

keakealani,singing,1390087213.0,"You have every reason to worry -- psychologically. This is mostly just anecdotal, but in my experience young singers (most of whom were male) who hold themselves to a certain voice type when they are young end up hurting themselves by trying to box themselves into a voice type they think they are, rather than healthily learning how to sing with the voice they actually have. 

As others have mentioned, range is only one of many features that fluctuates with growth and maturity, and there's really no way of telling at 18 what your voice might be like at 30. In addition, voice types tend to depend much more heavily on tessitura than absolute range - most well-trained adult singers will have a range that encompasses several different voice parts, but typically have a tessitura that fits them more comfortably into one (sometimes people do have overlap of voice types, but rarely more than two adjacent types). 

Also, I'm not sure where you got the idea that a typical tenor range ends at A4 - there's a reason C5 is called ""tenor C"", and I'm fairly sure operatic literature for tenors nearly requires it. Of course, that's assuming a fully mature tenor, but it doesn't really make sense to me that A4 would be considered the upper limit of a tenor voice generically, other than perhaps in a choral setting.

keakealani,singing,1390087365.0,"Well, most of what I would have said has already been said here, and I guess I'll save future comments for the upcoming mod thread that has been promised. 

I do have one thing to say, though - I think it's absolutely important to come to a consensus about what we, as a community, want out of this subreddit. It sounds like there are competing attitudes here and I don't really think that will be helpful for a unified subreddit. I like to participate here and I do hope my comments have helped folks in the past, but if my ideas and attitudes are unwelcome, I guess I'd rather know about that and make myself scarce, rather than misbelieving that I'm contributing and continue to create posts and foster discussion that isn't what the community wants. 

Edit: As a side note, I think another issue might be the way genre affects commentary on critique. I know personally that because I have very little experience outside of classical/choral music and a little bit in musical theatre, I make it a point not to comment or critique in those threads because I don't feel I have anything to offer. I realize /r/classicalsinger exists but it isn't as active and a lot of times the discussions are outside of my scope of expertise. I also wish /r/choralmusic weren't just a youtube dump, but that's not relevant here. At any case, it would be great if discussions were broadened to include people from multiple genre backgrounds rather than very specific styles that aren't possible to discuss from a broad background. I try to post in a way that I feel is broad enough to apply to many genres, but I don't feel that many others do likewise. "

Here's how student loans work:

1. Apply to school.

2. Submit a FAFSA before the deadline (this is a document containing information about your income, school, dependents, etc).

3. If accepted to your school of choice, the financial aid office at the school sends you information about how much your tuition is going to cost, any scholarships you won, and other aid (e.g. federal loans) you can receive. 

4. You send them another form saying what forms of aid you'll accept. 

5. You get one of two things from the school: a bill for tuition, minus any aid *or* an ""excess check"" in the event that you signed up for more loans than you needed. The value of the excess check is the amount of money you got in loans, *minus the amount you owe for tuition and other school fees.* In other words, no, you won't get a check for 17k from the government.

It'd be a lot easier/smarter/cheaper to just go to a CC or a cheap state school and take classes there, especially if a college near you offers certificate programs. (A certificate isn't quite as good as a BS in CS,  but a piece of paper from *an accredited, degree-granting institution* can still help get your foot in the door.)

As far as how coding bootcamp people pay for the fees: A lot of those camps are intended for people who have careers in other fields - in other words, they have a significant amount of money saved up that they can spend on a bootcamp. The rest either take out non-student loans or get help from family."

So the idea that you're dating them both might fall flat despite your intentions.  I think a more salient factor is whether the parent that is the same gender as you (their ex) is actively involved.  For example, if a woman had younger kids and were a widower, that could create the possibility for the child(ren) to get attached and badly hurt if the relationship ended.  But if a woman's child(ren) are a little older and have a great, loving, active relationship with their father, then taking the approach that I'm dating 'the family' would feel like I'm injecting myself into their lives.

The meeting should basically be about getting feedback on your performance and discussing your development.  Understand areas (both technical and not) that you may need to work on and ways to improve them.  

Also, set goals that will help you grow in the role and that you can benchmark yourself against.  Goals can be anything from learning a new technical skill to meeting a bunch of people and learning about their various roles in the company.

Some work gets a model a few hundred, some (most, actually) gets them free clothing but no money, and some gets them absolutely nothing. Being signed to an agency doesn't give a model a paycheck. There's no guaranteed wages, no salaries, and they rarely pay for transportation or housing (there are a lot of horror stories of models having to travel to a foreign country out of their own pocket and live in completely squalid conditions). And models can go to casting calls daily for weeks and get rejected at every single one. It can take years before you can make a name for yourself, and even when you have, it's not unlikely that you'll still have to deal with all of the aforementioned situations for a few more years.

Not to mention having to constantly hear people say you need to lose X amount of weight before you can get a job with them, you're not tall enough, your (insert any and every body part here) is too big, not symmetrical, not right for this, and so on and so forth.

It helped that it could spend so much time establishing characters in the run-up to the Laboratory 5 arc, where Brotherhood had to gloss over a lot for fear of losing people who had already seen all that stuff. It could have pretty much coasted from there but instead chose to make a much more character-driven story with interesting themes, and pretty much abandoned the slapstick humour that got so aggravating in FMA:B.

I watched both within a fairly short space of time, but when I look back, the most memorable scenes are often those that were in the original but not Brotherhood."

Learn what the opportunity cost is for that, what's the next best thing they could be doing with their time instead of X task.

Once you know who you're selling to, THEN learn product knowledge.

People knowledge goes a longer way than product knowledge, though both are obviously important.

pneumon,teenagers,1390087887.0,"atheist here

a common argument bc of suffering is god gave people free will. this does not apply to suffering such as drowning, drought, natural disasters such as lighting and such - this is not anything man made

some people are not sinners and can't really ""deserve"" it - babies and cognitively impaired people. they still suffer

""people have original sin bc of eve"" - this implies knowledge is bad, free will is bad, thinking on your own is bad. i do not see why anyone would believe in a god that does by let people try to think for themselves or try to make their own ideas about the world (im talking bout adam and eve and the tree)

animals do not have original sin yet they still suffer

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1390087941.0,"No, not really.  I understand how this perspective comes to be, but I think it's inaccurate.  The default gender for most professions is male, because historically most professions have only been open to men.  This can lead to situations like the Smurfs, where every type of occupation is represented as a smurf, and made male by default, and then there is only one female playing the female role.  But it's really a matter of perspective.  Work is work, and work is masculine.

Beyond that, the claim that men are the default is a pretty meaningless statement.  It leads to people making ridiculous arguments like claiming that the fact that when you see [a stick figure in a non-gendered context](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WHsJq_dP3-E/TWEA6t_gdAI/AAAAAAAAABE/TzRyBCR-Bhc/s1600/sign+plates4.jpg) you assume its male is because male is seen as default, when in reality you assume its male because of [this](http://www.wmishops.com/magento/media/catalog/product/cache/59/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/a/p/apl_wayfinding_ada_men_1_1.png)."

Dantilli,howtonotgiveafuck,1390088332.0,"I have a few tips that have helped me both in public speaking and performing (I play guitar).

* The first is to remember that this is a college exercise. This means that you aren't doing it for the audiences benefit, it is for yours. You're doing it either to get better at public speaking or to get a decent mark on the course. So it literally doesn't matter in the slightest what the audience thinks or does as they have no impact on what you get out of the experience.

* **believe in what you are saying**. If you're presenting something, don't take the attitude of ""I HAVE to do this to pass"", ""I HATE this crap"" etc. Instead, research your topic properly, find something that you think is genuinely interesting that you want to share with people. You should be thinking ""I really want to show this to people, it's really cool"", if you aren't thinking that then try and find something that you DO think is really interesting. Show off your passion for the subject.

* **Have a plan**. Sounds obvious but it really, REALLY helps. I don't plan everything in depth, in fact I like to have a lot of leeway when I'm speaking to help it flow naturally. But I DO make sure I know what order to speak about my topics. I DO keep in mind any keywords I want/need to use whether it's through speaker notes or pp slides etc. I also plan out an opening and closing statement as I find it hard to start talking and, once i've got into it, I find it hard to STOP talking. If you find a part of the presentation especially hard, plan out that bit (write down a small section word for word if you find it necessary, but only do this for very small sections, don't start writing whole scripts) and just stick to it until you feel you can speak from your own mind again.

* **Present to the back of the room**. This helps in two ways. First, it means you don't focus on any one part of the audience, you aren't freaked out by looking at any one person or by all the eyes. It's just you and the back of the room. Second, it makes sure your voice fills the room. If you're making sure it hits the back you can be sure that everyone else in the room can hear you fine.

* **It's fine to speak a lttle slowly and with pauses**, In fact this is encouraged. So if you find you speak faster than you can think, just slow down a bit. Odds are you're speaking faster than they can understand as well. It's also fine to leave pauses at the end of your sentences, it gives people time to catch up and fully understand what you've said. 

* **Pay attention to how your lecturers present**. Lecturing is just another example of public speaking. As such they are great sources of information about how to speak in public. Next time you're in a lecture, think about whether you like how they present the material. Break it down, WHY do you like it (or why do you not like it?), what do they do that makes it easy to understand what they're saying? What habits make them harder to understand? where do they normally look when speaking? Do they pause, if so, for how long? If there's someone you REALLY like the strategy of try talking to them about it. Ask them for tips. Try and copy a few of the things you think they do well and see how it helps you. This is college remember, it's prefectly fine to go talk to your lecturer, they're just a human being like you.

* **Practice...?**. Practice is a very useful tool if you do it with a purpose. Often you can't quite decide what order to talk about your points, but if you try talking through it you can see how they link in better. Maybe you'll create a good segue that you can use during the actual thing etc. Also if you're anxious maybe it's a good idea to get used to talking in front of a few people, this also helps as they can give some good constructive criticism. I personally don't practice by speaking in front of people. But I do verbally have a quick run through things and make sure I have some decent transitions between the various subjects. Basically presenting it to myself while I work out the stuff I mentioned in the ""have a plan"" section.

That's all the things I usually think about when a public speaking/performing event is coming up. I know I've already said it but I'll say it again. The thing I find helps the most is thinking about the reason you're doing it. You're doing it for YOU. so the audience doesn't matter, what matter is what YOU get out of it. It doesn't matter if you mess up at this stage so take the opportunity to learn as much as you can. That way, when you need to do this stuff for real, you have the skills to rely on.

Hope this helps :)"

Rolten,MensRights,1390088372.0,"I kind of agree with the """"keep them in a lifestyle they're accustomed to"" stuff though. Imagine you're 28, you met an amazing woman with a successful career, and you marry. You've got an ok career in marketing, but it's not really what you love. You love writing though. You've never made any money with it, but it's your passion in life.

At the age of 35, the two of you decide that you should just take the step. You wouldn't dare doing this by yourself, but she's earning more than enough money for the both of you, so there's no real risk involved. So you become a writer. You also take on most of the housework, which makes sense since there's no real pressure for career as a writer to succeed.

Life goes on. You turned 50 last year. You had an absolutely amazing party with all your friends. Life is good. You both love your careers. You can only get a short story published now and then, but who cares, because you're happy. You've also taken to gardening and cooking, always trying to surprise your spouse with a nice meal.

That's certainly not enough though, since she's become bored with you. At her work there's all kinds of attractive and successful men that did do something with their lives. After a year of fighting, she wants a divorce. You're devastated. 

You're 52, with a few years of marketing experience and a shitty writing career. All you will have to spend the rest of your life is the bare minimum, since you signed a prenup 25 years ago and due to the choices you made together with your life you can only get a simple job doing some freelance marketing for small local stores.. You will never earn enough money to have a nice pension, or to buy a house with a nice garden that you can care for. 

--- 

In marriage, people rely on each other. My parents do it. If they had signed a prenup and still would have made the same choices in life, my mom would be very screwed if they decided to divorce.

What I find funny about these conversations is the people who make these arguments are invariably the ones who individualize women and see women as a collective whole with a collective identity.

Society was not created.  Society is a verb, it is *being created* constantly.  By people who act in their own self-interest.  Women seem, to me, to be less interested in acting in their own self-interest, and more interested in passively demanding to be active participants in the creation of society.  The inherent contradiction is quite amusing."

2.  Focus on your cadence of speaking.  Slow down.  

3.  Keep something in your hands like a pen.  It gives them something to do without thinking deeply about it.

4.  Think about what you're saying as you say it.  Also, when you go to um ,or uh, just pause and take a thought.  It makes you go from sounding dumb to sounding thoughtful and intelligent.

Lastly, be prepped physically.  If you're wearing clothes that don't look good, or aren't comfortable, forget it."

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1390088533.0,"So there's really very little reason to get an 18350 IMO, especially if you're looking for a telescoping mod.  I have an FT Astro clone and an HCigar Kylin (Pisces-T) clone, both are telescoping, affordable, and known for being small.  The Kylin won't even fit an 18350, and you have to take the kick ring off the Astro to get it small enough.  I think they both look awesome with an AW 18490 installed, and either one any smaller would almost be too small to use.  Sitting side by side with the 18490s in them they're both shorter than the Fogger V3 (including the height of the 510 connector and drip tip).

The Kylin hits a little harder and is 22mm in diameter.  The Astro is 23mm, and has a cleaner look to it.  Both have floating pins and good threading.  I'm thrilled with both of them and would recommend either wholeheartedly.  Having said that, the Nemesis clones seem to be the thing to have.  I'm sure they're well made, but they're not telescoping and they get so much attention around here that they just feel pedestrian to me...  And, from the one I've seen with a guy at work, they're definitely bigger.  He was shocked that I wasn't running with an 18350 when he first saw the Kylin.

Anyways, the 18350 sized batteries really don't offer much besides their physical size.  They're too small to support the amp draw of anything really sub-ohm and they don't last long enough.  If you want to go deep sub-ohm then the Sony VTC4 is the way to go.  I run 0.6 to 0.8 and like to keep both 18490 and 18650 batteries on hand."

keakealani,singing,1390088556.0,"Are you familiar with Robert Shaw's countsinging technique? It's actually really helpful, and as someone who struggles with rhythm, it's one of my personal lifesavers. 

The basic principle is that, rather than singing the note value, you are always counting a steady pulse (in 4/4, it's normally ""one and two and three and four and"" for exact bar). You sing those same syllables at a steady pulse (practice with a metronome) but change pitches with the song. For example, the first two measures of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" would be sung ""one and two and"" (change notes) ""three and four and"" (change notes) ""one and two and"" (change notes) ""three and four and"". In other words, even if the note would normally be held, you sing all the beats inside. This can help you solidify a pulse and make sure you are holding the note for the entire duration. (It's a bit hard to explain but [here's a PDF I found that illustrates some examples](http://www.tmea.org/assets/pdf/southwestern_musician/EssentialBuildingBlocksFeb-2013.pdf).)

Another thing that I find really helpful is knowing how your part fits with everyone else. Sometimes that means saying things like ""the piano plays a big chord and then I come in two beats later"" or knowing what word your duet partner is singing when you're supposed to come in. It's especially important to know what's going on a couple beats in advance so you have time to breathe and prepare for your entrance. So work on studying your score with special emphasis on the measure or so before each of your entrances. 

With the issue of notes sounding right in your head and wrong while singing, that may be a matter of pitch matching or tonal memory. In both cases, it's a good idea to spend some time with a piano or another instrument and just match pitches. You can try recording yourself and then playing it back, to see if you were as accurate as you think you were. In the long term, I'd also recommend learning solfège or another solmization system, as it can help you to place pitches in a tonal context and therefore sing more accurately when you are singing a tonal piece. 

With the range, it sounds like what you probably need is to develop more support. Typically, that ""screaming"" sound is a result of incorrectly ""supporting"" by putting a lot of tension on the larynx (voice box). Unfortunately, this strain is very unhealthy for the voice and can cause long-term problems, many of which are quite serious. Instead, it is healthier to create air pressure through the breath mechanism, which is primarily achieved by controlling the breath with the abdomen, pelvis, lower back, intercostal muscles (the muscles between your ribs), and others. This is a pretty tricky thing to get right, but it is essential for good, sustainable singing.

It's understandable that you can't afford lessons right now, and I won't tell you that university is a lower priority than lessons. However, you should understand that singing with unhealthy habits can lead to serious long-term problems, and if that's something you want to avoid, you may want to be careful and avoid pushing your voice while you're unable to get guidance from an instructor. It's possible to sing without an instructor, but the eventual risk of damage is much greater. If that's okay with you, then that's fine, but I think it's important to weigh the risks and the benefits. "

heartosay,Christianity,1390088699.0,"&gt; What is misogynistic about the pro-life movement is not that they hate women, but that they seem incapable of understanding why it is that some women will choose abortion. This is simply based on almost every interaction I've had with a pro-lifer. At one point in almost every conversation a remark about ""selfishness"" will come up. It honestly seems like the last thing to go through the mind of a pro-lifer is what the scared, fragile, and potentially young girl is going through in this situation.

I think that's unfair. I don't doubt you've had those experiences, and I'm sorry that that's happened, but empathy can't trump reason.

1) All games (2v2 and 1v1) are a best of 5.  With the same bans used for the first 4 games and each team gets a turn being on blue side (first and last pick goes to blue side as well).

2) If it goes to a fifth game, it is blind pick with no bans.

3) Same MMR/LP gain/loss from a 3-0 that a 3-2 would have  (since the 5 matchups technically count as 1 game)

**FOR THE BLIND PICK VERSION (FASTER)**

1) Best of 5 still, but all 5 are played with the same 2 or 4 champions.

ThatKidWithTheHat,doctorwho,1390089090.0,"But she wasn't special. What did she do to deserve so much praise? I dont care if she was the first companion of NewWho, she wasn't the first companion. She was a whiney, entitled, teenager who started her journey with the Doctor with the expressed intention of exploiting his invitation for her own gain. She even *admitted* this! She acted as if she was entitled to be on the Doctor's arm, evidenced by the fact that she acted appalled by Sarah Jane's return, and even more appalled when the Doctor was happy to see her again.
She was shallow, willing to drop her loving boyfriend like yesterday's trash after meeting not only the Doctor, but Adam and later Jack. And the truth is there may have been some romantic tension between her and the Doctor at one point, but he ultimately made the conscious decision to essentially banish her from his own dimension, and went on to have his own affairs and get married twice! And yet, the fans persist in saying that Rose was the
 quintessential companion, despite repeatedly being shown several *canonical* instances of indication that Rose was absolutely no different than any other person the Doctor has come into contact with. 

Moffat himself has laughed at the very thought that Rose was somehow more special than, say, Donna. He thought it was even funnier that people were saying the Doctor was being unfaithful to Rose.  I believe he said something along the lines of ""Susan's grandmother is going to be even more upset than Rose would be!"" 

I'm not denying the fact that the Doctor may have fancied her once. But she certainly wasn't the first, she certainly won't be the last, and she is **not** special, and the fandom needs to realize that.

keakealani,singing,1390089332.0,"You can find almost all public domain music at either IMSLP or CPDL, including many pieces for voice. Unfortunately, editing for vocal music is far behind that of instrumental music, so urtexts are quite rare outside of major works and some song cycles. Even so, a basic Schirmer or similar edition is usually okay when it comes to just learning. Musicnotes.com is another website resources for music that isn't in the public domain - music is usually only $1-2 per piece which is pretty reasonable and there are tools like transposition that can be helpful. 

Many libraries (both public and school-associated) carry sheet music! I would strongly recommend looking into your local library options especially if you're just looking for music to learn for fun. If you want to do jazz singing in particular, look into a standard Fake Book (I've heard good things about The Real Book) which has a collection of jazz standards. 

I agree with other posters that it sounds like you probably don't have a good conception of vocal technique if it takes you 45 minutes to warm up. Unfortunately, though, the answer isn't just to know about more vocalises or exercises, but to understand the mechanics behind them. This is where it isn't usually helpful to approach singing like an instrumentalist - unlike with other instruments, almost nothing in the voice can be directly felt or associated with a specific physical phenomenon. We can't adjust subtle differences in mass and position of our vocal folds the way a pianist can move his fingers slightly or a clarinetist can adjust her mouthpiece. 

I would, however, say that since you have other instrumental background, you may benefit from learning some of the technical and anatomical aspects of the voice, and especially learning about how they can be (sort of) analogous to other instruments, especially wind/brass instruments. One book I'd recommend is Barbara M. Doscher's ""The Functional Unity of the Singing Voice"" which has some really great detail about the anatomy and technical characteristics of the voice and how they are used in singing. 

Anyway, I also very much agree with other posters about potentially joining a choir or finding some other means of singing more regularly. Robert Schumann even mentions in his advice to young musicians (which is geared toward instrumentalists, as he was a pianist himself) that all musicians should sing in a choir in order to develop their ear and sense of ensemble, and I fully agree - singing is extremely helpful to developing your ear and musicianship even if your primary goals are with instruments. You don't have to be an opera star, but having a solid control of your voice can be very helpful and rewarding. "

Prices are ridiculously expensive, especially in regards to smart phones because you have to pay for the ""smart phone"" plan versus the regular plans. Before smart phones, it was the Blackberry plans which were expensive too. Ugh. I went without a cell phone for 2 years (right before my SO added me to his plan) because the plans were too expensive and I didn't use the phone that often anyways. I'm usually at home, campus, or work so I'm always near Wi-Fi for people to get a hold of me. It's a shame that you can't get put on your husband's plan. That would make all this so easy!

According to your logic a 16 year old would be able to consent to another 16/17 year old yet as soon as a person turns 18 all of a sudden the 16 year old is unable to consent... That's fucking retarded.

It's illegal because typically adults are in positions of power over minors. It's easy for them to abuse their power to coerce a minor into having sex with them. However, this is not always the case, and statutory rape is nowhere near the same as non-consensual sex."

Foliagus,playrust,1390089484.0,"Here's my comprehensive list: 

Any of this advice can be disregarded if you're ok with dying. (AKA you have a sleeping bag somewhere, and you're not carrying a tonne of resources.)

1) To get into a fire, you HOLD E and click open. This is how you cook meat.

2) Do not eat raw meat. 

3) Gather every wood pile and rock you see.

4) Run from anybody better-dressed than you, ESPECIALLY if they say stuff like ""Hey, come here man, you want some food?""

5) Build a frigging wood house with a metal door eventually, a shack with a wood door will do while you get enough wood and metal. This is because wooden doors and shelters are easy to hack through with hatchets. Metal doors and wooden houses are deterrents, they require C4 or something powerful to get through. 

6) Do not put a metal door on a wooden shelter, this is a giant bullseye.

7) Hide your real house. Don't tell people where it is. My entire happiness in Rust has come from this piece of advice, if somebody knows where you live, eventually they can raid it.

8) Try to find friends, probably near where you gather resources, but be prepared to die while you do so. (Leave all your good shit at home)

9) Learn the map. Watch the video ""getting around in Rust"", I find it quite helpful. Rad-towns are unique, learn where they are so you can find yourself. 

10) Have fun! Put on some music if you're gathering resources (I recommend any Songza or Pandora: Pink Floyd or Rush.), you'll be hacking for a while, so music helps keep away the monotony."

* Realize I have one major advantage and that's being tall. You can sculpt your body to however you want anytime with some discipline, but in the end you'll never be able to gain height.

According to Pew Internet and American Life Project, [56% of American adults have a smartphone](http://pewinternet.org/Commentary/2012/February/Pew-Internet-Mobile.aspx). Furthermore, 31% of people use a mobile device (not smart phone necessarily--91% of people have cell phones, incidentally) as their [primary device for accessing](http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Cell-Internet-Use-2012/Key-Findings.aspx) the internet. Even more [black people and Latinos use phones](http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Cell-Internet-Use-2012/Main-Findings/Cell-Internet-Use.aspx) as their primary internet device.

Like for instance a guy at a bar found out he was anglophone and said he was going to kick his ass, and my rommate was like yeah whatever, so then the bouncers come along and ask what's going on, and kick my roommate out because they don't want any trouble. They actually said ""look this guy's going to fight you if you stay, so you need to leave"" :p Oh the francophones.

bamgrinus,LifeProTips,1390089769.0,One benefit of working through a recruiter (which is pretty common if you're in a tech field) is that you can often get them to negotiate for you. And you can have more frank conversations with them about what the likely salary range is.
bsevs,Drugs,1390089770.0,"Just deny it. Sounds like they have no real proof against you. They can't prove you sent those texts even if they came from your phone. Sounds like things might get a little crazy but stick to your guns and just tell them you did not do anything. If you are as respected a student/athlete as you say you are, chances are they will believe you, or at the very least not pursue you any further. The teacher calling your mom makes this seem even more likely, as it (in my opinion at least) implies that there are probably some people in the administration who do not want to see your academic or athletic career damaged. 

If things get bad though, do not hesitate to get a lawyer. That would also probably entail coming clean to your mom if you haven't already."

ChileanIggy,Sherlock,1390089794.0,"I propose that Moriarty is dead. I mean, you don't pull the same gag twice, you know? Not to mention, what purpose would his revival serve, other than the base idea of giving Sherlock a villain to chase? But mostly, and I find this to be rather intriguing, I keep asking myself the question:

Where the hell is Sebastian Moran?

I could see Moffat pulling the character out of the shadows, to bear Moriarty's torch. I mean, it's not as if he hasn't taken liberties with other characters.

In my mind, the return of Moriarty would just be campy and unnecessary. But bringing in someone like Moran, once described by Sherlock Holmes as the most dangerous man in London, would make sense. He does attempt to kill Sherlock Holmes the moment he learns of his return...

Make sure to use your ""chest voice"" as I think it's known (I don't really know, I study physics and so did my teacher so he taught me in terms of resonation and sound waves instead). Basically when talking make sure you feel it in your chest. I also find that trying to talk as if they were half a metre (2 feet)  further away than they are helps. 

As for confidence, it's just a case of trying to talk loud and if no-one complains then you know it's fine to talk at that volume. You just need to take the leap and accept the fact that you may make a few mistakes at first."

I don't get my period very regularly, but throw it normally goes down is I get cramps for about three days which flare up and down in intensity, and then nothing. It will all go back to normal for a fortnight and then suddenly I'll notice I feel super nauseous. This goes on for a day or two and then I get my period and the cramping flares back up again, but much worse and with the added nausea.

Friends maybe, but that kinds of behavior is unacceptable to me in a romantic partner.  I do not intend on spending the rest of my life as an unpaid maid, and I wouldn't date someone who didn't pull their fair share, simple as that.  This is one of those things that you think is just a small issue but will destroy a marriage because you will end up feeling unappreciated and overworked.

redqueentopawnfour,MakeupAddiction,1390090054.0,"That's how I'd been feeling for the last few months, and I spent hours and hours reading brush guides and reviews, but still, my shopping cart kept changing.... After Christmas break back in my home town, I went back to the hunt and this one just kind of... jumped out at me. I really needed a new powder brush, I had also really wanted the Meteorites and Temptalia said she uses this brush with them, so that kind of sealed the deal for me. 

The brush guide in the sidebar actually lists this one as one of the best powder brushes, and does list out Hakus under mostly each category, so that might help in deciding (do I need a new blush brush, contour, powder, etc) and also they have brushes ranging in price from about $19 to around $150 (rough estimates) so there are a LOT of options. 

So I guess I would say, don't shop by looking around the Hakuhodo site, because you WILL get overwhelmed. Start by looking up ""guides to Hakuohodo"" and ""Hakuhodo reviews"" and stuff like that and see if anything jumps out at you. At least, that's what worked for me! Sorry if I told you anything you already knew!

Erisari,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1390090508.0,"Yes that makes sense. I think that Straight Talk does that or something similar to be able to have their phone on Verizon or whoever's network. Or similar companies like that. 

Exactly! That guy just wanted to give you the run around to make you feel like you were getting a deal, he didn't want to lose your business. It's like if you try to negotiate or anything they just stop listening to you. When I had T-Mobile back in 2008 or so, their customer service was remarkable. I loved it. Never had any issues with anything and if I did they handled it with grace. But when my contract ended it was hell. I didn't renew because I wanted to go to a pre-paid plan. They kept sending me bills anyway even though I cancelled the service. It was so aggravating. 

And that Sprint guy is definitely pulling your leg about the $110 price tag, what was he thinking? Companies advertise the $45 unlimited everything plan on the TV all the time! My SO and I have Verizon and we pay ~$140 for 2 phones. He has the iPhone 5s or whatever and I have the Galaxy S4. I think he is paying monthly on my phone, as his was a gift that was fully paid for. We do get unlimited minutes/texts, but our data is limited. I think we get like 4gb at 4G or something. But we *never* come close to using it all. I think my SO may have lowered our data to save money because we only ever use about 10% of it. We are mostly at work, home, or I'm on campus, so we are usually on Wi-Fi over data. We don't ever ""stream"" videos or music, which typically eats up your data. I only ever use the data to Google something really quick, check Google maps, or get on Facebook or something silly like that. 

Ah, I'm always leery about buying stuff on Ebay, just for that reason. Do they have a return policy on stuff like that? I know it's not like Amazon. 

If it is going to be a lot of stress and trouble to change your phone over, I would definitely just go that route with getting a cheaper phone with the pre-paid plan. You don't need to be stressing out about switching the phone over when it's becoming too complicated and customer service people are being a-holes!"

Finally went to the doctor and I have several herniated discs and a pinched nerve, which is why I can't feel my foot and my leg hurts so much. According to the back specialist surgery is pretty much the only option, even when my back heals I still won't be able to feel my foot and my leg will still hurt.

You are lucky he doesn't use a cane to throttle you! Holy shit arthritis is an emotion killer! Activity is the LAST thing you can do you are in so much pain and I won't even go in to how it makes you feel 200 years old and scared for your future!

Instead of activity tell him about the joint meds over the counter that can give him his life back. BY them for him and leave at his house. If you want to nag him nag about taking those as it will give him at least that part of his life back.

Of course you are rebounding quicker than he is, he's lost his life partner and feels old, out of his element...you don't bounce back from anything fast when you age like you do when you are young.

The real problem is that you feel worthless and horrible about yourself. Whether you dumped your emotional baggage on her early or not wouldn't have mattered because your low self-esteem would've sabotaged any relationship/dating process anyway.

***Article 1:*** 

&gt;Dorian J. Graham, 19, of Bedford Heights, near Cleveland, was indicted on Nov. 25 on one count each of sexual battery, attempted sexual battery, extortion and attempted extortion.

* *No mention of rape in first article. I was never implying that blackmail or extortion is legal. My point is that it does not amount to ""rape"".* 


***Article 2***

&gt;“But the threat Brooks made did not involve any present or future application of force and, in turn, the response it provoked in J.P., however disquieting or upsetting, **did not constitute fear of the sort that supports a rape charge** under the Kansas law. As a result, the jury’s verdict rests on insufficient evidence to demonstrate the statutory elements of rape.”

* *The Court of Appeal overturned the original conviction. It determined that the sex by extortion did not amount to rape.*



##Also for some background knowledge the 2nd article had it's headline as a **question**.  

According to [**Betteridge's law of headlines:**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines)

However, that was before the replacement of the coaching staff and the impending move to a 3-4, where he has been successful before as an OLB. His contract is still a bit inflated (he's due $6 million in 2014), but now that we'll be using a scheme that suits him better, it'll be interesting to see what the coaches and front office want to do with him.  

McCarthy's an exciting playmaker at times, but he sometimes struggles with tackling and taking poor angles, and has also dealt with injury issues in the past. He's a fine backup but I'm not sure we can rely on him to be a starter. Zach Brown didn't quite take the step forward this year that the end of his rookie 2012 campaign seemed to hint at, but he didn't regress either. I'd still say he's a fairly promising young player, though I'm not sure he's an ILB type.

So ask her what she wants you to do and how specifically you can help her.

I do know that, for me, I would want the emphasis to be put on being *healthy*, not on losing weight. Losing extra weight, if one is overweight, is simply a pleasant side effect of being healthy. Focusing only on weight loss at the expense can lead to unhealthy behavior like crash dieting, eating processed but low calorie foods, or at the worst, an eating disorder.

ShamelesslyPlugged,scifi,1390090797.0,"Well. Jeez. Here goes.  

So, we'll start with Ringo. Hymn Before Battle is probably my favorite of everything he's done. Watch on the Rhine is a cowritten spinoff, and there's metric butt-ton of Legacy of the Aldenata books. There's another series that he started based off of it, although you can tell he got bored and started yet a new series about selling maple syrup to aliens that isn't on these CDs.  

You have the Voyage of the Vorpal Bubble, with names taken from Jabberwocky. Basically, aliens come to Earth in portals, most bad and at least one good. From there it evolves into retrofitting a submarine into a spaceship and exploring the galaxy. It's enjoyable, pulpy stuff.  

Paladin of Shadows, which starts with Ghost, is Ringo's by far most controversial series. It has a lot of the ""weird sex stuff"" that turn off some people from it. Basically, ex-Navy Seal stops terrorists and bags girls, and then it morphs into him running a small town/mercenary outfit out of Georgia. It's not SciFi, though, and set in the modern world.  

Princess of Wands is kind of his urban fantasy. Soccer Mom turned powerful ninja fights the supernatural.  

Empire of Man series is about an Imperial princeling and his marine bodyguards getting marooned onto an alien world, and their efforts to get home. It's cowritten with David Weber, and there's a lot of recycled ideas from other books there. Still, fun if you like his other stuff. This series also has my other nagging thing about Ringo, in that he likes pop culture shout outs. There's at least one in this series that felt very forced and out of place that I didn't like.  

Finally, you have his SciFi turned Fantasy series. In a world where automation takes care of everything, a civil war erupts and shit turns into fantasy with the help of SciFi. Elves are genetically engineered warriors, dragons fly off of wind-powered carriers, et cetera. The books get a little weirder, the main character is a Mary Sue, there's again ""weird sex stuff,"" and frankly he moves quickly from idea to idea (IE turning forces into Roman Legions to Dragon carriers to Fantasy Spaceflight) where I would have preferred he stay in one place for a bit.  

There's some other stuff, but it's largely just him waxing political. I can go into detail if you want. Keep in mind I haven't read a lot of these books in years, so I might be subtlely wrong on things.  

Okay. So. David Weber. We have the aforementioned Honor Harrington and spinoffs (Shadow of Saganami, Crown of Slaves, Torch of Freedom, etc) as well as the cowritten stuff with Ringo.  

Bahzell series is a fantasy series that I can't say is very memorable involving a tweaked take on Paladins as holy warriors. I do remember enjoying it, just not thinking it was exemplary fantasy.  

His Starfire series with Steven White happens to be some of my ""gateway scifi,"" or some of the stuff I got to early over 10 years ago (after Mechwarrior). Super nostalgic about it, and it has a lot of the space battles that people love about Harrington, and less (although some) of the politicking. Basically involves cold war with some aliens, and hot wars with others, and eventually civil war.  

The Dahak Series is about a dude getting picked up by a relic of another human civilization that got wiped out many moons ago by an alien species, and he then proceeds to rebuild that human civilization. There's some fun ideas there, and I really enjoyed Heirs of the Emperor, which is about his children being marooned on a regressed human world. There's another book series that is too new to be on these disks where Weber recycles a lot of the ideas here.  

One of my big gripes with Weber, I think he ran out of creative juices and then kind of has begun to rewrite the same stuff over and over again. Some of his stand alones you can see again in the Dahak series. He recycles an alien race from the series with John Ringo in the Starfire series.  

Ring of Fire with Eric Flint is entertaining. West Virginia town goes to 17th century Germany, shenanigans ensue.  

Hell Hath No Fury is about two civilizations, one modernish with psionics the other full on fantasy magic, meeting with tragic consequences. Not sure if it went past the two books presented, it didn't grab me enough to pursue beyond what was freely available.  

The BOLO stuff is about superpowered tanks. I didn't think it was anything special, but didn't hate it. Not a priority to read, but if you have free time it's worth reading.  

David Drake is a standout on the CD. I love the Leary series, which starts with With the Lightnings. It's kind of a swashbuckling tale made SciFi. While there's combat, it's light on it. Most of the stories are inspired by actual historical events, with a very British Imperial feel.  

Hammer's Slammers I haven't read in probably 15 years, and I got to it before I got to the Baen CDs (I ripped through the SciFi section in my public library) Basically futuristic mercs, mostly involving tanks. I enjoyed it, but it's not strikingly memorable besides having alien prostitute slaves.  

The Belisarius saga takes some historical figures and the late Roman Empire in the setting of a proxy war between some supernatural entities. I blew through it, and it was entertaining.  

The Tyrant series has to do with time travel and ancient battles. I don't remember it too well.  

I just read Drake's Sea Hag and Northworld recently. They're okay.  

The one book that took me a little bit to get into, but that I really enjoyed, was Eric Flint's Mother of Demons. Humans get marooned on an alien world and have to scrape by to survive.  

The Heirs of Alexandria series wasn't terribly memorable, and didn't do much for me.  

Rats, Bats, and Vats is about genetically engineered creatures in a war. I remember it being entertaining.  

As for the individual books, besides Mother of Demons I don't really have any recommendations. You'll have to make your way through them yourself."

PinkiePai,MtF,1390090872.0,"Anxiety. I've struggled with crippling anxiety for most of my life. I've spent half of my life actively battling it. 

I tried placing myself in situations to shock myself out of it. I became active in performance art; singing, school wind ensemble, rock bands, electronic music stuffs. Even tried theater for a day. It didn't work, it only highlighted my own deep subconscious insecurities. 

I tried hiding from the things that trigger it. Large groups of people, public places, friends, family, strangers, loved ones, social gatherings, school, work. All it did was drive me further into my own insecurity and dig me deeper into depression, clouding my own judgement of the world. 

I've tried trying to accept that I'm just naturally a shy, meek, and anxious person. But oh, the fires that burn within. I know deep down I wish to be bold. So not even this was true. 

What have I left to do?

You need to reverse engineer your thought processes. Make a list of all the things that make you anxious. Literally write it out on paper, as a list. After you've put down everything you can possibly think of, try circling the things that give you the most anxiety. Examine it all, and try to make conclusions from this. 

(IE: You circled a lot of social anxiety stuff? Perhaps agoraphobia?)

Identify what causes you to feel that way in those given situations. On another piece of paper perhaps, write out the thoughts that could be going through your head in any of those given scenarios that trigger your anxiety. You might be able to make some conclusions from this. 

(IE: Damn, I'm really uncomfortable with myself and my body image. I care too much about what other people think/say about me. I think too much about my flaws.)

Once you identify these things, you may find that doing a little mental gymnastics around reinventing the way you think can alleviate these triggers. For example, perhaps you have a lot of social anxiety and you fear the judgement of others. Tell yourself throughout the day, and I mean all fucking day, ""I don't give a shit what these fuckers think of me."" 

I've been doing this for about a week now and my social anxiety is about half as bad as it was before I started doing this. It helps you believe in your own self worth. 

That said, go look up a therapist in your locale. 

http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_search.php

Find one you like that takes your insurance. (If you have any.) If no insurance, look for ones that do 'sliding-scale.' Call them on Monday after you've had your coffee. Do it drunk if you have to, you need to make your anxiety your bitch so you can talk coherently on the phone. 

Don't be too self-conscious about how you sound or what the secretary thinks of you. I can guarantee she's probably had way more 'interesting' people call than you. 

Be sure to have your social security number, (Assuming you're US based), name, and insurance card ready. That's all they need, maybe some general questions. 

You can do this, it get's easier after you've got the ball rolling.

I have no idea if my prerequesites are still going to count. I'm hoping that *at least* the general education classes will transfer over since I already have an associate's degree. I wouldn't mind retaking some of the math and chemistry, though. I don't remember much of the higher level classes that I took, and I was seriously struggling with them at the time.

I'm definitely glad I took a break and got myself back together. Now things have settled down from the craziness, so I'm getting restless and bored and need a new challenge - aside from staying sane, that is :]"

Don't act like he wouldn't have taken any girl who happened to be there.

&gt;And he also made the conscious decision to send her a human clone of himself to grow old with. If that's not a sign that he cared for her, I don't know what would be.

My speculation is no better than yours, but that clone didn't look all too happy with his decision.

omegasavant,AskReddit,1390091740.0,"No, that's a terrible idea. Here's an example to explain why.
Let's say you like the Green Party. Most people who like the Green Party are going to be left-leaning, politically. You go out and campaign and get a bunch of people to go vote for a Green Party candidate. So now election day rolls around.


Normally, the vote would look something like this:

Democrats: 55

Republicans: 45

Green Party: 0, within a margin of error. Sorry, Green Party.

But because you went out on this awesome campaign of yours, a bunch of people got inspired to take a stand for the Green Party. So instead, the results look like this:

Democrats: 40

Republicans: 45

Green Party: 15

And now the Republicans won the election. But wait, you say. Most people were left of center for this election. What happened? The left-wing vote got split. Your vote, unfortunate campaigner, has actually become worse than useless for your cause. Voting in this way did nothing but help the party you least want to win. 

But what if you have *everyone* vote for a third party? That would solve the problem, right? People just need to get off their lazy asses and care about the political process. Right? Wrong. First off, quite a few people are going to like the established party more than the up-and-coming one. So come hell or high water, they are never going to back you. And those people, who might have been your allies in an election, are now your competition. Second, people don't change their minds in one election cycle. These things take time, as people slowly grow to trust that the third party candidates are electable. But people aren't going to change their minds if their pet candidate gets *crushed* again and again. And the candidate, if they're smart, will give and up and go join the Democrats.

Well, that sucks. Should we give up on political variety, then? Resign ourselves to a corrupt, ineffective government? Dig a bunker and wait for the apocalypse? No. I'd argue that the situation isn't actually as bad as it looks. Take that Green Party guy up there who just went to join the Democrats. Is he going to burn his former beliefs out of his mind, and become a loyal middle-of-the-road Democrat? No, he's probably going to keep being left-wing, except now his main battles will be in the primaries and not the main election. Also, now that guy's electable. So that's something.

The Republican party right now would probably be a coalition of several parties in somewhere like Europe. You've got the Big Military people, the Libertarian people, the Christian Values people, the Pro-Business people. It's actually kind of weird, when you think about it, that advocates for small government get shoved in the same group as advocates for a huge government. The only thing that all Republicans have in common is that they don't like Democrats very much. So I'm not sure that going ""I'm tired of the two main parties"" solves anything, or even says anything meaningful. The two main parties are alliances of convenience. You have to look at the actual people in the parties if you want to see political variety."

In a junkyard car there is a good chance the seals are no good so moisture kills it while it sits.

Otherwise if we're worried that repairing the A/C will damage the dryer we tell the customer they have to buy a new one.

That's why when you buy A/C compressors they always come with hoses, O-rings, and a new dryer.

Omega037,cscareerquestions,1390091953.0,"The two places I have worked within the field were 100,000+ and 10,000+ employee companies respectively, and they both had well defined systems for goal setting, monthly progress meetings/reports, quarterly or mid-year corrections to goals, and reviewing how the goals were met.

The systems required goals directly related to the business (deliverables), goals related to your development at the company, and goals focused on personal development.  The latter two might involve things like taking the Coursera Machine Learning course, attending a conference, getting Six Sigma certified, learning Hadoop, meeting customers directly, meeting the CEO or CTO for lunch, organizing a Hack-a-thon, or any number of other things.

Every single employee has to do these and submit the goals to a central system.  Beyond regular feedback, our bonuses are actually based in large part on this process.  Setting and meeting ""stretch"" goals will put more cash in your pocket at the end of the year than having weak goals and/or missing them.  Employees are expected to meet at least 80% of their goals, or there is a problem.

Anyways, you don't need anything this structured.  Just set a meeting and start a process.  There may even be a chance to get resources (money or time) to help you achieve these goals.  It could easily be in the company's best interest to spend a few hundred and have you out of the office for three days in order to do a workshop on a valuable new skill."

1) slide a loop of the string down the limb, so that the loop is stretched narrow. This is side A

2) Put the other end of the bowstring on the other nock. This is side B. Then slide the first end toward the nock until string is tight.

3) Hold bow horizontally, so that the string doesn't slip down. Place the small end of stringer (side 1) over the nock of side A.

4) Place large side of stringer (Side 2) over the nock with the string already nocked, side B.

A1, B2.

B2 is good to go, and the stringer should now look like a bowstring that's too long. 

5) Still holding the bow horizontally, grab the handle and step on the middle of the stringer. Be careful to only step on the stringer, and not the bowstring. 

6) Pull up on the handle. Essentially, you're drawing the bow. The limbs should bend, and the bowstring should become a bit more slack. 

7) Slide the loop on side A until it's on the nock. You'll notice that the stringer on that end is smaller, and doesn't enclose the nock. This is why it's important. You can slide the loop onto the nock easily if you're pulling the bow enough. 

8) Slowly release the tension until the string sets in at the brace height.

9) Remove stringer.

10) Check to make sure the loops are on properly."

Columbus sailed the ocean blue.

He sailed through sunshine, wind and rain.

He sailed by night; he sailed by day;
He used the stars to find his way.

A compass also helped him know
How to find the way to go.

Ninety sailors were on board;
Some men worked while others snored.

Then the workers went to sleep;
And others watched the ocean deep.

Day after day they looked for land;
They dreamed of trees and rocks and sand.

October 12 their dream came true,
You never saw a happier crew!

""Indians!  Indians!""  Columbus cried;
His heart was filled with joyful pride.

But ""India"" the land was not;
It was the Bahamas, and it was hot.

The Arakawa natives were very nice;
They gave the sailors food and spice.

Columbus sailed on to find some gold
To bring back home, as he'd been told.

He made the trip again and again,
Trading gold to bring to Spain.

The first American?  No, not quite.
But Columbus was brave, and he was bright.

citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1390092071.0,"&gt;&gt;What you are describing is a belief only

&gt;Well that's all I've talked about, because that was the aspect under discussion (certainty is about the *belief* aspect, not ontological truth or justificiation) - that doesn't make it the only aspect.  But obviously I believe these things to also be justified and true (indeed, it'd be very odd to consider ones *own* beliefs otherwise).  It's really only when we start to consider different perspectives that the JT aspects come in.

But surely you can put the idea that some higher, malicious power is tricking you into thinking that you are you into the same ""believe false"" category as the existence of God. After all, neither is open to falsification, and both require accepting supernatural beings as a possibility. I'm not sure you're going to convince me that extreme skepticism and gnostic atheism are not mutually  exclusive beliefs, but you've given me a lot of food for thought and a desire to dive back into epistemology.

&gt;&gt;then I find it hard to reconcileentities,entification as an extreme skeptic who denies the ability to even know

&gt;I don't deny the ability to know, I deny the ability to be *certain*, in the cartesian sense (ie it is possible to sensibly doubt these things) and thus that the meaning of ""knowledge"" requires this.  

I think I need to brush up on this. Intuitively, I think knowledge requires certainty, but there are different levels of such and I'm not very fresh with it.

&gt;As I said, I don't think it's at all sensible to characterise knowledge this way.  

I hope you can understand that from my perspective this could appear to be simply for your convenience. I respect your reasoning, though, and will try to spend a bit more time contemplating what you have said.

&gt;&gt;without equivocating on the definition of knowledge

&gt;I'd say the opposite.  Attempting to characterise knowledge as requiring certainty, rather than a more normal definition of ""belief"" is the equivocation.  We never normally use the term like this - indeed the ""belief"" criteria *cannot* require absolute certainty or else the term would be inapplicable to anything (including IMHO the cogito). 

Well, certainty can be described, among other ways, as incorrigibility. You seem pretty incorrigible in your belief that God does not exist. I believe we are having trouble coming to an understanding because we haven't defined how key concepts like knowledge, belief, and certainty are being used in this discussion.


&gt;Redefining it to this useless and restrictive term purely in the domain of theism seems rampant equivoction to me.

But it's my contention that you are applying extreme skepticism to *everything but theism*. The skepticism you are describing requires skepticism across the board. It also doesn't make sense to me that your extreme skepticism is justified with appeals to supernatural entities. 

My brain is starting to hurt, lol. Thanks for engaging in this discussion, it gives me a bit of hope for this sub.

As you build a resume, however, you become more and more of a unique quantity and get a lot more leverage in the negotiations.  Just graduated college with a CS degree?  Pretty run of the mill.  5 years experience as a developer?  Much better.  5 years experience as a developer in a specific industry that's highly specialized?  That could potentially make you very valuable.

Also the reality is that most people hiring basically have a range that they can work in depending on the job title and your experience.  If you ask for something within that range, then they'll usually just give it to you.  If you're slightly above that range, then they'll probably counter with the top of the range.  If you're way above, then they'll probably just let you walk since they figure they can't afford you.  In really rare circumstances, if you're a perfect fit, they may try to fight to get you something more, like a little bit above the range they were thinking, or perhaps inclusion in the bonus pool.  It's also worth noting that they're generally going to know your pay at your last job (it's usually part of the application process), so if you're overplaying your hand it probably won't work."

AFormidableContender,PurplePillDebate,1390092201.0,"&gt;Based on what? Because if were just pulling anecdotal data out of our asses I'd say women are more diverse on their assesment of ""value"" than men, who trend towards liking overall the same kinds of things on women (certain hip ratio, facial features, smaller window of youth).

Then make that counter-argument and support it with a argument. If we're going to get into source-whoring this entire subreddit might as well close down...

&gt;I'm asking how you demonstrate this from an example of a platonic male friendship.

I'm not sure how I can make it any simpler; a man of high value chose to associate heavily with a man of low value because he wasn't low value *to him*. Men are more likely to choose social interactions like this because their value system is more robust. A very attractive woman would not associate with a highly unattractive woman because one has nothing to offer the other; women pretty generally engage in hypergamous social interactions. Men are not hypergamous to the same degree. 

&gt;Stereotypically, which gender is more likely to take a ""fixer upper"" as a partner?

Women, in romantic comedies staring Jennifer Aniston. This does not reflect real life...

&gt;Wait, didn't you just say that women are less virtuous because they only recognise a few types of value in men? Now you're saying that men rank womens value exclusively on physical appearance? Which is it?

Men's tastes in physical appearance vary wildly. The only uniform thing mend tend to demand of women is being physically able-bodied. 

Demanding a car with a fresh paint job is a lot less demanding than a demanding a car with anti lock brakes, 20 inch rims, and a forward tire pressire at least 5% higher than the rear.  

&gt;I mean you're saying women care about looks or career success or social success while men care mainly about looks, then trying to spin that somehow into saying men are more virtuous, it makes no sense.

Yes it does, you're just making non-sequitors. I'm not saying women care about looks, OR, money, OR Career, I'm saying women care about looks AND money, AND career, in an exponential fashion. 

The other issue is also minimum standard of attractive, of which men's is far lower than women's. 

&gt;So your argument is that men are more virtuous than women because they recognise womens value in a less shallow way.

Basically. 

&gt;But even an unattractive man would date a 9 with an awful personality over a 6 with a nice personality.

Yes, because you're comparing someone who's sex-starved to someone who can have sex with anyone she pleases at any time. An attractive man is more likely to investigate whether a woman of lower sexual market value might interest him romantically than an equally attractive woman would. 

If you millions of highly attractive men and women, and tell them to go find a partner they'd want to date, I can almost guarantee there will be a wider negative variance of social value between the men and their partners than the women and their partners. "

maowsers93,self,1390092302.0,"The post was a Ukrainian informing people that his country is going down the path of North Korea. The list OP provided is easy enough for you to see so I won't rabble on about what they're going through. You can see that for yourself. 

As for the North Koreans they've suffered unfathomable horrors at the hands of their demented Communist Dynasty including [famines](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1737780,00.html) that have killed millions and permanently [stunted the growth](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/10/world/in-north-korean-hunger-legacy-is-stunted-children.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm) of their millennials causing permanent physical harm to their young people. 

[Hundreds of thousands](http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-prison-camps-2013-9?op=1) have disappeared into N. Korea's prison camps and hundreds of thousands have died there. The country refuses to let anyone leave and has put up miles of barbed wire, traps, and mines as well as military check points along the boarder to keep people from sneaking out. Those that do [risk the lives](http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/24/us/north-korean-refugees/) of their family who make it out. The ones that get out do so knowing their families will be killed or imprisoned. 

People in N. Korea are forced to play out their lives in a false roll of supporting actors to the ""Dear leader"". This includes [staged public mourning](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16262027), staged [public activities](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHnmAOgChik), staged public [frolic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL10943F1A08C72A17&amp;v=24R8JObNNQ4#t=1004), staged studying, staged everything and if you don't participate or are seen as not doing it passionately [you are executed](http://rt.com/news/north-korea-kim-grief-575/) along with those close to you. 

So, when you try and compare your own 1st world relatively free country to countries like this you are both immature and extremely narcissistic. Spying on citizens and sporadic police brutality does not materialize into total domination to the point of citizens playing a role their entire lives for fear of being brutally murdered along with their families. The fact that you even have access to a computer and the internet to be able to type this should be the first clue that comparing yourself to the unfortunate souls who reside in these places is absurd and insulting. 

Furthermore, your claim that this will be North America exudes not only your total lack of understanding for foreign affairs but also the history of your country. If you reside in America you are sitting on top of hundreds of years of racial oppression, genocide, slavery, misogyny, systematic abuse, legislated control over anyone who wasn't white, a president who suspended Habeas Corpus, the incarceration of journalists who spoke against him, parents who were hung for their children's crimes, etc. etc. etc. 

Not only is North America not in anyway facing what these people are facing but it has a history of systematically treating certain groups just like this in it's past. Do you see that anymore? Do you see homosexuals being institutionalized and lobotomized? Do you see black men being sent to prison for marrying white women? Do you see the systematic genocide of Native Americans anymore? Do you see the public hangings of eastern Europeans for fear of the spread of communism? No? Then kindly quit pretending that your life even remotely resembles these people's because it is not only petulance but it is totally insulting and degrades those who still do. "

Ninja edit: Forgot Cydia now exists for Android, I personally haven't used it, but I imagine some of the below remains true, where Cydia simply exists as an app store/repo and permissions gatekeeper - It does have the permissions gatekeeper part to its advantage though.

When you install something from Cydia it's installing your app, and the dependencies for it.

Xposed is simply a framework that distributes access to what is more than SuperUser, in a predictable way - XPosed does the dirty work of modifying a system file and sahring out the abilities modifying this file does so you don't end up with conflicting mods that modify those files.

I think that's meant as a restriction on decks, not on the people shuffling them (so people don't come with 1000 card gimmick decks or something). Maybe I'm wrong, but I doubt a judge at any level of play would mind someone getting help shuffling if they have some kind of injury or disability that makes it hard for them."

The issue now is nationality, the problem is those nationality allegiances were born and created out of the religious issue 100 years ago when people were religious (In a modern context it's  most obvious in the switching of allegiances of Presbyterians who historically started every rebellion on the island). 

To claim it's a conflict in no way related to religion is to not see the entire picture. Popularity does not make something correct. In much the same way as the result of WW1 leads directly to WW2 the result of what went before in Ireland (mostly based on religious oppression) leads directly to the troubles.

The comment I responded to says ""As if being shipped out of your home and being treated like a 2nd class citizen would be easily stomached if the perpetrators were the same religion."" but the reason they were stripped of that was all down to religion and the UUP trying maintaining a protestant ascendancy to protect the union.

It's really not as bad as you would think.   I was terrified about it too.  I tore and had an episiotomy and the recovery wasn't bad at all. They give you lots of good drugs after giving birth (I had vicodin and ibuprofen 800s) and the truth was, I only hurt when I peed and when I sat on something hard.  So I grabbed a pillow to sit on and sprayed the crap out of my junk with a peri bottle every time I peed.  No more issues! 

And if you were curious, I birthed a 10lb 4oz boy, so it definitely wasn't a small baby so easy vaginal passing scenario.  And no, I promise I don't have a gaping flesh hole where my vagina used to be.  sorry if TMI! 

My sister had two c-sections, one with a single baby and one with twins, and her recovery seemed to be much worse than mine.  She gave birth 5 months before I did and it seemed to take her a good three months before she was back to 100%, and I was basically at 100% other than sleep deprivation after about three weeks.

AFormidableContender,OutreachHPG,1390092588.0,"yea, I'm very aware of how the streaming dynamic works. The same thing happened with SC2 and their streamers of which I used to be a member of that community. 

The biggest problem with MWO streaming is not necessarily personality, but the fact that no one REALLY knows how good anyone is because PGI won't tell us our ELO or classify us in leagues. Someone can tune into my YouTube channel, watch a 1 kill, 1 death, 2min life game and conclude I suck, when most of my games are 5 kills, 0 death, 10min life. 

Ironically NGNG actually kills the streaming audience IMO. Firstly because they're an organization and people appeal to authority, and 2) because they're production quality is a lot higher than what 1 person can do alone. This is the same reason why in the SC2 community, Day[9] has the market cornered for SC2 education no one else has bothered trying."

Roughly half the OSs to date have been free upgrades, including the last one, so I'm not sure where you are going with that.

Yes, that's right. They sell systems, not operating systems. And this makes them evil?

How?

Any time I tried to be a part of her family (i.e. be more than just another person present in their home) they would rudely remind me that I was *not* their father.  Of course that was because they had a very strong father figure in their life and they didn't see me as a valuable addition to their lives.  If anything they saw me as a threat to the fun day once a week they spent with their mother.  And her kids didn't particularly care for my kids either.

Besides that, if you are a farmer, you can't exactly say no when Monsanto offers you a deal. It's pretty much ""if you don't work with us, we'll force you out of business"".

Monsanto mostly just produces seed for corn, soybeans, and cotton.  Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of Monsanto corn is not human grade (used for cattle feed or industrial uses).  In other words, almost all the fruits and vegetables you eat aren't related to Monsanto.

Additionally, there is plenty of competition.  Farmers can and do easily buy from companies like DuPont Pioneer if they want."

Call to get teeth capped and my dentist tells me they have too many patients and they have to drop me. Mother drops the ball, 2nd root canal falls apart and 6 years later shit hits the fan.

Sunfried,scifi,1390093200.0,"Characters from ""Use of Weapons"" show up in later works, so you should read that before ""The State of the Art"" (a novella that shares a name with the story collection in which it appears, but it's the only Culture story in that volume) and ""Surface Detail.""  Also, the books are roughly in a chronological order, but I note that ""Consider Phlebas,"" the first book, takes place about 7 centuries before the following book, while the rest of the books cover a smaller span of perhaps 150-300 years.  It's not exact, but ""Look to Windward"" is set around a memorial event of the war 800 years prior, the war that was taking place during Consider Phlebas.  The rest of the books can be judged somewhat by the lifespans of some of the characters...but Culture humans live over 400 years."

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1390093212.0,"Hah, if men gave women the respect to treat them as equals, it would be a dark day for womankind.

But that doesn't really address the point I raised.  When people claim that men are the default, the implication is generally not that this is a recent development.  Your original argument implies that men have only recently become the default as a result of changing attitudes towards women.  So it seems as if you are blaming women's lib for the masculinity default."

attakburr,AskWomen,1390093348.0,"It's never been a deliberate seeking out of older guys for me. But in general my best relationships, including the one I'm in now are with older guys.

For me it ultimately comes down to maturity. I am *often* mistaken for being older than I am. And I'm fine with that, it's helped me out professionally. But it also calls out a part of my personality (responsible) that I need to find a complement to in my relationships.

Current bf is most days a great deal more mature than I am. He's also 3 years older. And the  there are times that I have more worldly experience and knowledge than he does ... and this just has to do with very different life experiences. He isn't taking care of me, I'm not taking care of him. We're partners and equals with different strengths that complement each other.

And although I've mentioned maturity and responsibility, I still want to (and am) dating someone who is FUN.

Each person is different in what they need out of a partner. Maturity is a big one for me, age can be a factor of acquiring this but isn't always. An ex was two years older than me but way less mature. I've also been interested in guys my own age or younger in the past who have been able to demonstrate they have their shit together."

BlackLeatherRain,xxfitness,1390093416.0,"I've never worn makeup specifically to attend the gym, however...

I don't work out because it's good for my heart or because lifting is awesome (although it is) or because losing weight makes me a healthier person.  I work out because I am **vain.**  I know I look better when I'm thinner and healthier, so I commit to going to the gym - as a result, whenever I'm in front of a mirror while working out, I'm staring into the eyes of the person I want to be.  I concentrate on my eyes, which honestly are stunning when made up.  If I can see in those eyes a window to the fit, slimmer, desirable woman I want to be, I work out harder and with more joy in my heart.  If all I can see when I work out is pale skin, dingy hair, and my all-too-round middle, I become discouraged.  Seeing myself beautiful is inspiring.  Seeing myself plain or - worse - ""ugly"" just makes me self-hating and depressed... and the gym isn't a place for either.

I almost gather from your original post that you and I may share a degree of this inspiration from seeing ourselves at what we think is our best.  Perhaps you share my vanity - I personally don't think there's anything shameful in being vain, honestly.  We all have our priorities and values, and for some people their self-perception is strongly linked to their appearance."

2pnt0,OkCupid,1390093449.0,"You have every right to live at home if you think it is best in the long-term.

They have every right to not want to date you for doing so, even if it is a short-term thing. It can be a total drag. There are exceptions, and there are ways to make it work, but it really puts constraints on dating.

They have different priorities than you–take it with a grain of salt and move on with your life.

I personally don't think anyone should be living at home past 25 unless there are very strong reasons.
