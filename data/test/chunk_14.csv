drewiepoodle,ainbow,1389052959.0,"i've known since i was 7, i just spent the next 33 years after that trying to convince myself that i was just a crossdresser. and then i woke up one day, i was gonna hit 40 and i realized that the desire to BE a girl was more than just a crossdressing fetish. so i threw on the frilliest, girliest costume i could find, went walkabout on Halloween in west hollywood aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand then came out the next day. said goodbye to my parents as a boy for thanksgiving/christmas, got my therapist in Jan, got my hormones in July, went fulltime in Sept and i havent looked back.


how do i know i'm a girl? because a boy on estrogen would go stark raving bonkers.

therapists dont usually tell you that you are or you arent trans, only YOU can decide for yourself. they're only there to help you work it out for yourself"

SirJefferE,Showerthoughts,1389052984.0,"I had a casual acquaintance I met online. We were parts of opposing factions in a game so we killed each other a lot, but we were also quite friendly with each other so we got along alright.

I got to know him slightly outside of the game, and we eventually met up in Vancouver. I was visiting a friend, he was visiting a friend, and the mutual friends of ours were also friends with each other, so I met him through a friends friend. As a side note I just typed the word friend so much that it got [semantically satiated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation) and looks like nonsense to me.

So anyways, I met this guy I knew in a place I don't go often and it was weird, but that isn't the coincidence.

A month later I had moved to Australia, and was out with my then girlfriend meeting some of her friends. They knew another guy that they decided to invite over, and he brought his friend who was visiting from overseas.

We look at each other after having met in Vancouver 5 weeks prior to the event. ""What the hell are you doing here!?""

Haven't bumped into him since, though. Maybe I need to take a trip to Asia or something."
DuckyFreeman,flightsim,1389052985.0,"&gt; Payware planes can be worth it, depending on what you're looking for. There are many planes that run in excess of $40, but represent a labor of love and a huge amount of work. I would be more than happy to provide specific recommendations if you'd like.

I'll take you up on that offer. 

Lately, I have been focusing more and more on long(er) distance flights with ATC, (I am trying to get into VATSIM right now, but my confirmation email isn't showing up), weather, and failures. But the cockpits in for the big airliners are terrible. I have found a lot of pretty basic stuff missing. Altimeter setting readouts, APU and engine starters, fuel cutoffs, engine gauges, etc. Besides taking away from the sim feeling of the game, it also makes practicing EP's impossible. I had a bus failure in a 777 on approach into LAX, and I had no way to troubleshoot or remedy the failure. I just had to hand-fly the next 15 minutes with only an altimeter and airspeed indicator (not even a backup attitude indicator), and no radios or transponder. 

**In short**: I want a big plane with an accurate enough cockpit to effectively fly chock to chock, and practice EP's with. I don't totally care if the plane is commercial or military (I had high hopes for the KC-10, since I am currently a boom on it), I just want big weights and multiple jet engines. Also, preferably something with good documentation since all I (kind of) know is the KC-10."
Gluestick05,AskWomen,1389052985.0,"Look, I hear what you're saying.  Some people are very inexperienced and/or lack basic social skills, and PUA contains some basic social advice, and a powerful motivator for self-improvement.  That's great, but the kind of advice you're talking about could just as easily be interview advice.  

I don't think that ""pickup"" advice is 100% bad, and I actually know a few guys who consumed the material and actually came out with better outlooks about women and dating (i.e. being attractive is not just about being a super nice friend and waiting for the sex).  I just think that game-ifying interactions with women is not the best way to encourage healthy development of interpersonal skills."

So they should've won the series. Easily. They'll easily be somewhat successful in the LCS. But what's happening here kinda defeats the purpose of the qualifiers. I wanted my (former) favorite team to win, to make it into the LCS on their own. Like how EG qualified for the NA LCS, and how LMQ is going to qualify for the next split. Honest and fair.

ainsley27,TwoXChromosomes,1389053556.0,"**Trigger warning**

You can cut off contact.  You can and you should.  And you should consider reporting him.

Back in college, I had a close call with a guy friend who I trusted to walk me home safely when I was drunk - you know the old advice.  Don't walk alone, get a friend to walk you home so nothing like this happens.  That advice totally turned on me.

I told all our mutual friends.  And I won't lie, I lost some of them.  I also reported him to campus security.  And the whole thing kind of ruined my whole year, because I lost friends and because security didn't do shit about it, since I was the only one to report him and ""nothing really happened"" - it was just a close call.  Had other girls reported him with even close calls, he would have been expelled.  So I get the gravity of the situation, and I was angry enough at the time to want that to happen to him.

But after I did report him, and people found out I did, the stories other women told me he did to them...  anally raping his girlfriend, sleeping in a bed with a friend and using her hand to masturbate *while she was unconscious* (she woke up while it was happening), and a whole host of close calls like mine.

Regardless of my university's inaction, once these stories got out a *lot* of girls stopped trusting him.

I don't even give a shit about any sort of reputation he got ruining his senior year.  Because I went to a POS school that encouraged me not to go to the police, none of that reputation followed him after graduation (though it should have).  He was a predator, I wasn't his only intended victim (and he had many victims), and at the *very* least he got the idea beat into him that **this is not okay**.

Whether you go down the path I did or not, cut off contact.  He is a predator, and he needs to learn that what he did to you is in no way okay.  And you don't need him in your life.

(Five years later and I still get *so angry* about him, and about what he tried to do to me.)"

Anonivixen,MakeupAddiction,1389053809.0,"Hello there! I have worn a prosthetic eye since infancy and most of my makeup challenges are quite similar to yours. As the muscles in my right lid are not attached to any eyeball, the muscles on that side are weaker. As a result, [my right lid hangs slightly lower and the left lid is more hooded](https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/5452_146241858985_572431_n.jpg).  

I erase this discrepancy by lining the ridge of my brow bone with my crease color and blending it to the crease instead of coloring the crease itself, essentially redrawing it. You are using the principles of contouring for one to mimic the shape of the other by tweaking the shape of both. The lower left lid gets slightly more eyeliner than the right to mimic the shadow made by my prosthesis resting on my lid. Then the top right lid gets a slightly thicker line from the outer corner while the wing on the left is a smidgen more shallow. Since I also have a problem with drainage, I do not connect lines at the outer crease. Instead, I fill in my lash line and gently extend outward into a wing or subtle double wing. Sometimes I even sub the lower liner for a little more shadow, and I'll usually wrap that around the outer corner. You can sidestep the complicated contouring and still draw attention away from the crease by layering and blending horizontally. I use cream or yellow in the inner corner and either green and blue or pink and purple for the outer. Applying a thick but neat coat of mascara on top and bottom lashes will also distract the eye.  

After tiring of cream liners that wipe off as easily as they scribble on and runny liquids that always dry out and flake up waaaaay too fast, I am teaching myself how to apply gel liner with a brush. Mine is from Bobbi Brown in Ink Black, it swipes on dry and does not smudge as easily but it's layerable, which makes it nicer to work with! I really only reserve primer for heavy color applications, especially if it's cheaper quality eyeshadow. There's some of those brands, like Kleancolor (FUCK YEAH TWO DOLLAR PALETTES), that I actually like but in your case just make your life that much easier, skip the primers and the fuss and just select a well saturated and easy to blend formula. I recommend the True Romance palette line from Kat Von D. I have the True Love set, and I am truly in love with the entire kit! This year's [Poetica set](http://www.sephora.com/true-romance-eyeshadow-palette-poetica-P293011?icid2=Kat_Von_D_EyePalettes_Carousel_P293011_image) is the most identical to the one I own, and features some universally flattering browns and purples beautifully blended with gold shimmer that will draw out your eyes and help hide the plate all the same time. And KVD's colors are beautiful no matter how little or how much you pack on your lid. 

Earlier this morning, before I passed out (and lost my even longer original post to firefox crashing), I took some [quick snaps](https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1521993_10152534337943986_877753529_n.jpg) of a [2 minute face](https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1545789_10152534338553986_1273139072_n.jpg). Just one brown shade from the true love palette, the bobbi brown gel liner, Big Fatty mascara by Urban Decay (very buildable volume!) and some tinted burts bees on the lips. Once again, I don't even actually color in every little crease in the corner of my eye because it always just makes a mess, but just blending into your lash line will still look as if you wrapped it around unless you open your eyes wide. But if you really need to, you can line the top, wing out parallel to the upturned corner of your lower lid, then gently fill in from the bottom lid only grazing the corner to connect back. Then if you're really dexterous and love the wide eyed look, you can fill in the waterline with a nude or white pencil, then very carefully set the corner with a little powder, but good luck not scratching or wiping that shit off, which is why it's reserved in my arsenal for more elaborate evening looks. At the end of the day, all my best faces are the simplest ones to execute."

You mentioned that it all started when you got on the pill which makes me wonder if you don't have hormonal acne. Have you tried other BCs? Some BCs are horrid for acne-prones because some are more androgenic (oil stimulating, male hormones such as testosterone) and others are more anti-androgenic (counteract male hormones, less oil). More info [here](http://www.dermnetnz.org/treatments/antiandrogens.html). 

As for treating any existing acne, be as gentle as possible while still being aggressive. Gentle cleansers without tons of fragrances and clogging ingredients ([CosDNA](http://cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php) is a lifesaver!) will be your best friend.

dhc2beaver,nottheonion,1389053838.0,"Even if you take a larger USB stick, that is still a very small amount of explosive.  I'm sure it would blow your hand off if you are holding it, but I doubt it would kill you holding it at an arms length (you would be seriously injured obviously).  

I'm not even 100% sure it would break the skin of an aircraft if taped to the sidewall in the cabin.  There is a gap between the skin and the sidewall and (I'm assuming) it isn't any sort of shaped charge.  I totally believe that if you taped it to the skin it would puncture, but who cares? it would make a small hole, maybe enough to cause explosive decompression or maybe not.  

Hit a vital hydraulic line and yea you may shut down one or even two of the three hydraulic systems modern airliners have.  The one place where it may be possible to cut all three is the Rudder, where it uses all of them.  I don't know if they are routed side by side in close enough proximity or not in most aircraft.  

A 767 wing bolt would most definitely not be destroyed by a USB sized bit of explosive, nor would its mounts. A shaped charge I'm guessing would fatally damage it but I'm going off the assumption it is just a stick of C4 or equivalent.  You may want to do some NDT after it lands but that is a lot of strong steel and serious aluminum.  

You could probably cut a pretty serious wire bundle with it, and it would possibly cause arcing, which may cause a fire.  I'll give you that one, that could turn serious fast, but that is in no way guaranteed.  

Jet fuel does burn, but unless this is done within maybe forty five minutes of takeoff the fuel will be quite cool without a whole lot of vapours.  The center tanks of large jets have the Nitrogen inerting systems installed so there wouldn't be oxygen to fuel a fire in them for that very reason, fuel tank arcing.

You could definitely set it up so that the plane would have to make an emergency landing, possibly quite quickly, but it wouldn't just fall from the sky. Planes are built to fly and last, especially commercial jet liners.

Hawkonthehill,atheism,1389053904.0,"I appreciate the input.  I just asked my fiancee how important a CATHOLIC wedding is to her and she said it's ""25% important"". Don't really know what that means, but she does seem to prefer a Catholic wedding (even though her ideologies and beliefs don't 100% mesh with the Catholic doctrine)... I think it's mostly because she was raised Catholic, she wants to have a Catholic ceremony. She said ""If I'm going to have a religious ceremony, it might as well be Catholic"".  As for the children, we've already talked about that. My understanding is that we are supposed to TEACH them about the Catholic Church... and I expect at some point I'll have to do just that. Explain to my children why some other children go to church, pray, nativity scenes at Christmas, etc... I think it all comes down to terminology. Both of us agreed that we refuse to force our children to be catholic.  

As for $$ for catholic school, I have no problem with that either.  I went to catholic/jesuit schools, and I was perfectly happy.  My parents allowed me to make my own decisions. They encouraged me to make my own decisions and question everything.  I was always that annoying kid in religion class... The one who questioned doctrine all the time.  I expect my kids would be the same.  

I'm at home now, and I just asked her ""what if the church asks us to promise to MAKE our kids be catholic?"" and she said ""we won't be getting married in the Catholic Church."".  We're on the same page, and I think it all comes down to phrasing. I appreciate you bringing up these potential issues though. I guess we'll see how this weekend goes. "

Copyright infringement is generally when you either

2. Claim something someone else made was made by you.

At least, that's my interpretation of it. And Project M does neither of those things. I really don't think editing a product you purchased is illegal, and since they aren't selling what they edited either there's nothing to make it illegal.

Histones are proteins that DNA is wrapped around. The materials chromosomes are made of (DNA wrapped around proteins) are floppy. 

DNA is not in the form of neat little X shapes or lines (the X shapes are actually replicated chromosomes, so each side is identical). Normally, if the cell isn't preparing to divide, the DNA is more like a pile of loose spaghetti. There is no reason for DNA to be arranged any neater, because what there is now suffices.

I looked into this extensively as a layperson prior to converting to ensure that I could fully promise to raise any future children as Jews. (The idea of infant circumcision still somewhat bothers me, but I realize it's one of many decisions parents will make for their children...) But, that disclaimer is there upfront. Sorry if I wasn't clearly stating it before.

[Traditional brit milah](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/932327/jewish/Chapter-Two.htm) removes the foreskin (step 1, known as milah) with a knife; then the epithelium layer, revealing the glans (step 2, known as priah); and then presses far back on the penile shaft to encourage bleeding deep from within, and suctions away the blood (step 3, known as metzitzah) either with a glass tube or by mouth. 

I don't think the Plastibell meets (traditional) Judaism's requirements for these reasons.  If you want to be sure, he can have hatafat dam brit in the future. Or you can consult with your rabbi about your concerns with it fulfilling (traditional) Judaism's understanding of brit milah.

I want to make sure that you understand that I'm not judging the decision that you made as a father. Judaism doesn't (always) change because our modern sensibilities disagree with it. This means that no matter what kind of Jew we are, as a parent we all will have to consider many factors and go forward with the knowledge that we did the best we could, based on our knowledge and values.

ShesGotSauce,NoStupidQuestions,1389054501.0,"Diamonds can be cut with other tools like steel.  But in any case, a diamond blade isn't, as you probably imagine in your head as I once did, a blade made out of a single diamond.  Rather, it is a steel blade with tiny bits of diamond embedded into it.  So, a diamond doesn't need to be cut to create the blade; it needs to be crushed.

I'm a silversmith, and although I do no stone cutting, I use many types of cutting and grinding tools with embedded diamond bits in them for shaping metal.

All I *was* saying, was that it seemed idiotic for someone in America to name their store something like that without expecting or thinking there to be some easily offended softies trying to speak up about it. It just doesn't seem like a wise thing to do knowing the stigma that the word ""fuck"" holds in our society. Why plaster it on your business?



Meh, fuck it. Maybe their whole game was just to create some buzz so that local media will cover it and get their name out there much faster than simple advertising. ""No such thing as bad publicity"" and all that, right? Touche if that be the case. Maybe I'll go check out their selection soon."

System age when compared to newer things like Wii U/PS4 absolutely does impact the graphic capacity, better parts allow the newer systems to excel. 

Now, yes, I do think the Wii port was rushed. They're basically just trying to snag the few people who still haven't upgraded because the Wii was such a hugely popular console. Unfortunately I don't think that entitles you to a refund. As a consumer it's your responsibility to research the titles you're interested in and compare the different versions.

circledot,teaching,1389054648.0,"I think my two major tips as far as establishing authority are: 

1. Be clear with your expectations and why those expectations are important. For example, when a student is talking when I am talking, I make a point to say to them privately, ""When you are talking, you can't hear my instructions, and you distract others who are trying to listen as well. I need you to listen.""

2. Be clear with consequences if your expectations are not met. For example, I might say to that same kid, ""I know you want to sit by Trevor. But if you want to sit by him, I need you to stay quiet when I am talking. If you don't, I will move you away from Trevor.""

I've had kids fight in my class before, but not nearly as often as I've had kids *almost* fight. I can almost always stop a fight before it happens because I know the warning signs (escalating voice, someone clearly becoming agitated). The most important thing is to be able to recognize conflict before it becomes a problem. Most of the time if you catch it before it gets loud or physical, you can keep it from ever getting to that point. I move the kids away from each other and talk to them one-on-one out in the hallway/in an area away from, everyone else. I let the kid talk first so that they can get their feelings out in the open. Often just venting and getting a break lessens the problem. Then I explain that they can either have a break to cool down or they can join the rest of the group if they feel like they can handle it.

Hopefully this was helpful!"

You've had a lot of great advice about talking with your MIL and SIL but I would use that point. That sometimes you NEED alone time for your sanity. 

If that's that you go outside, or you go read in your bedroom...whatever works for you...set up a system where they can teach the little ones. 

For instance, when aunt Mary's door is closed we can't go in there. 

What you did at bedtime was perfect. Little one is 3 and impulsive and wants what she wants right now. She was disappointed but she followed your gentle boundary. 

And it's ok to talk to the little ones about whatever system you set up. Tell them that you love them but you need some alone time right now and you'll play later. When you talk through your feelings you're modeling coping strategies. If they ask why you can be honest and day you've been at work all day with people and you need a little time to yourself. 

As they get older you may be able to have shared alone time. They stay quiet doing something while you do something. With my cousins my grandma had us all do projects/crafts that she'd taught us. We could ask for help if we needed it, but in that time we all worked near each other quietly.

One distinction I've noticed among INTPs is the purely rational versus more mystical types, e.g. atheists versus religious or ""spiritual"" INTPs, where the former would take the more traditional Ti approach (""there's no hard evidence, so let's assume it's not true""), whereas the latter is more willing to accept that, hard evidence or not, it seems to produce results, so it's worth exploring.

FWIW, a friend and I were in very similar crashes. I was on my motorcycle in full gear. She was in her car (a 2010 model, a sedan, a reasonably safe car). We're about the same size, about the same weight (same sex), we're both skilled drivers (we race cars together).

BrooksConrad,SCP,1389055100.0,"**TL:DR;** Could do with wringing out.

Right, let's go for some C&amp;C. Look at this sentence:

&gt;When SCP-XXXX comes into contact with a living being, it experiences this process: unconciousness, skin transforms into sea sponge, all interal organs turn into sea sponge, vital signs stop without loss of life, [REDACTED], then death. 

This is a bit tricky.

The very first section, from ""When"" to ""process:"", needs a more properly-defined set of articles - does the SCP or the living being under go the process?

""Skin transforms into sea sponge"" ought to sound a lot more formal. I suggest you research sponges a bit to find more scientific terminology: [Here's the wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge), to get you started. Try to be more clinical about the scene: mention how the skin changes texture, shape, colour, composition, etc.

""All internal organs turn into sea sponge"": Same as above. You could even cut down on the amount of concepts involved in the process by saying ""All bodily tissues gradually metamorphose into a sponge-like material, genetically identical to samples taken from SCP-XXXX"". That way you don't need to differentiate between skin and organs.

""Vital signs stop without loss of life"" is far too vague for the concept you're trying to communicate (or at least, the concept I *think* you're trying to communicate - you wrote this, not me.) It's also redundant - if your cardiovascular system has transmuted into spongy tissue, it's not gonna be able to do any of the pulsing and flexing that a heart and blood vessels do, so life signs would be absent anyway. 

The obligatory [REDACTED] is also probably unnecessary, since if we're dealing with a creature that turns anything it touches into sponge, it's pretty obvious that all that's happening during the process is that the subject of the process is after turning into a giant sea sponge.

Simply put, I could make that many corrections and inquiries about any sentence in this article. That's not good.

A few other queries: How come its robotic bodysuit hasn't turned into sponge? How can it continue to consume all the corpses it eats if it doesn't produce waste? If SCP-XXXX-2 is basically a pile of dead sponge and can't move, how come it's forbidden to leave the chamber? What is the reason for The Plague Doctor being mentioned in this article, unless it's just a pointless reference to a fan-favourite SCP? How can it have gills, a third lung, and a second pancreas, if its entire body is made out of sea sponge? Why does it require 05 authorisation for D-class personnel to enter the containment area when we already know what the SCP does?

Sponges are widely regarded as being the most simple animals on the planet. This one is needlessly complicated and full of inconsistencies. It's a cool photo, and a neat idea (Self-propagating sponge monster!), but this article's gonna need a *LOT* of work if you want it to take off. 

From a writing viewpoint, it's in dire need of a grammar- and spell-check, and from a thematic viewpoint, it's far too informal and disjointed for a proper SCP report. It's lacking a recovery log, staff opinions, and any additional information like attempted experiments, results of D-Class accidents, or addenda.

IF you do give this another going-over, please post the next edition, I'd love to see this refined a bit!"

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1389055169.0,"It doesn't scare me. It's actually quite comforting to me. Real life interactions go much more smoothly when people don't have bullshit protecting them. It's a lot easier to call people out face-to-face. 

I also get a lot less criticism in person. I've been called rape apologist, racist, misogynist, virgin, every fucking name under the sun when I'm online. It's a lot harder for people to say that to me in person, as my appearance, demeanor, and deeds IRL speak for themselves. Most people I know like me, and are quick to forgive transgressions.

What little optimism left in me believes that most people around me have an innate distaste for hypocrisy. That works in my favour, as appeal to authority may be a logical fallacy, but it's a powerful one and shuts people up fast. No one *wants* to look like a hypocrite. 

Besides that, I think it actually makes day-to-day life nicer. As much as I agree with some of what is discussed in this sub, it would be a real downer at parties or get-togethers if some guy wanted to preach ""RP truths"" and upset everyone there (""Bitches be nothing by hoes and tricks!""). I do have female friends, and I do know ""unicorns"". Even Heartiste explicitly talks about his female friends whom he often confides in and gets advice from.

Similarly, imagine SRS or BPers IRL if they took their attitudes with them. All that shrill squawking, and overall mean/vindictive mocking even against some of the self-admitted depressed guys in this sub. They focus so much on whom they perceive to be the very worst people in this sub (some of them obviously trolling), and then go ahead and amplify even that. They keep doing that, and it makes me wonder if it wouldn't do them good to take their own advice. They often say that TRP corrupts people, as though people don't have their own individual thoughts and filters. I wonder if it's more a reflection of themselves. Their hate is literally just coming from an internet forum, even though they supposedly have happy/healthy offline lives. How absurd would that be if I had to tolerate that behaviour IRL. 

I go online to vent and sympathize, and to entertain myself. I have a choice whether to get upset or not visiting controversial sites. I don't have that option offline if too many people expressed their online personas. 

Thank God most people don't bother.

Edit: in case it needs to be said, I'm obviously including myself.

Blemish,AdviceAnimals,1389055171.0,"###Feminists consider eating meat, akin to oppressing women. 

&gt;Many cultures equate meat-eating with virility, and in some societies women offer men the ""best"" (i.e., bloodiest) food at the expense of their own nutritional needs. Building upon these observations, feminist activist Adams detects intimate links between the slaughter of animals and violence directed against women. She ties the prevalence of a carnivorous diet to patriarchal attitudes, such as the idea that the end justifies the means, and the objectification of others.

cavemancolton,KingdomHearts,1389055633.0,"Monsters Inc.

Monsters Inc was such a brilliant movie and if Square worked hard at it, the mechanics of using doors to transport around the world and around the factory could be used really well and become the best world in the game. In my opinion, the final boss should be a multi-staged escort boss against Randall and the Waternoose (Sullys boss) where you initially are protecting sully (who's holding boo) from Randall as you jump from door to door (by using reaction commands) and keep Sullys health bar high as you travel through different doors to different settings (Maybe a Disney world that didn't make it into the game as a little Easter egg) as you battle a Randall (who sometimes camouflages into his environment). The Randall section ends with a cinematic reaction command sequence where sully opens a door and you knock back Randal with the Keyblade and he goes flying through the door. Sully slams it shut and together you and sully push the door over the edge and watch it smash into the ground, mirroring the movie. We get a brief cinematic break during which we see mike sneak off with boos costume and distracting the cdc people and then Sora, Sully, and boo sneak off in the other direction but Mr. Waternoose catches them and you begin phase 2 of the boss battle during which you fight sections of heartless (or what ever is the main enemy in KH3) as you run through the hallways of Monsters Inc. to the place where sully removes the door that's already is plugged in and puts in boos door and we walk through it but Waternoose is right behind us and has us cornered which brings us to our final stage of the boss fight which is just a straight up classic kingdom hearts boss fight against Waternoose that is reasonably difficult but not so difficult that it ruins the pacing that has been building up to this moment and when you beat him you get a short cinematic during which Mike Wazowski turns on the lights and reveals to the cdc that waternoose is evil.


I know that this seems like a bit grand scale for just a run of the mill Kingdom Hearts world, but we need to remember that this game will be on the PS4/XBone and so they will have much larger capabilities that the previous games had, and considering how much they were able to do with the PS2, I expect them to also fully utilize the capabilities of these new consoles, and the size that games can be these days. I want Kingdom Hearts 3 to be so good that the world can't ignore it."

It's already been said that if their wage doesn't meet minimum with the tips then the employer makes up the difference (I've seen it says it's law), now if the employer doesn't follow that, that then becomes illegal - it is not up to me to subsidise someone else's ~~misfortune~~ employer problems. I go to a service industry establishment to receive service - I don't go to gratuitously tip because they don't trust their employers.

If that makes me an asshole then such is life.

What you're feeling is *convection*.   Your body has heated the air near the surface of your skin to 98 degrees, the fan displaces that air with the ambient 80some degree air and you feel cooler.

If you are sweating the greater rate of air exchange also helps sweat evaporate and cool you more efficiently."

I don't know if he'd do *better* within the Heat system, but I can't imagine him doing much worse. The team was built with LeBron in mind, so it's not really a fair comparison. I think LeBron would do slightly worse if he went to the Thunder because they don't have the 3 point shooting that Miami does.

Meteos can be the strongest player in the game all he wants, and he likely will be.  But we can crush down on the other players and win anyway.

That's why Vulcun was able to split with C9 but TSM was 4-0ed.  Vulcun crushed Hai and Balls because Mancloud is/was better and Benny actually might be better.

I know this isn't what you want to hear, but it doesn't really seem like you have any shot at being the 'bigger person' here. If you care to patch things up, you should reach out to him. Then you can have a reasonable discussion about what's actually bothering him. 

And for what it's worth, I know that a lot of people don't think this way in relationships, but your SO is allowed to talk to whoever they want (and so are you). I would actually say you getting mad about him talking to another girl is more of a red flag than his behavior that you described."

Cautiously_Curious,AskWomen,1389056400.0,"I doubt this'll be a great explanation since I have no experience dating for numerous reasons, but I have read a few of these kinds of threads and am sorta bored at the moment. Generally what happens is this:

* Guy gets frustrated by the seeming necessity and expectation for him to always be the proactive one in his dating life. He compares his experiences his perceived or received notions of what dating is like for women - because what other group is he going to make a comparison with? - and concludes that women have it easier because they don't always have to be proactive like men, like himself. Why should he be pigeonholed into this gender role while women aren't?
* Some women comment about their experiences, saying that the non-proactive role aint all sunshine and kittens and that some women aint pursued much at all. This, while true, tends to spark an argument because it isn't really what the guy is getting at, which is usually the ease of dating *in terms* of pursuing/being pursued.
* Some more women comment, saying that women pursue men too and about their experiences. This, while again true, causes more confusion because it misses another component of the guy's conclusion, which is its generality. It is true, for whatever reasons you want to assign to the issue, that most dates - to whatever extent depending on where you live, subculture, etc - are initiated by men.

It is entirely reasonable for the guy to be frustrated by this, just as it is entirely reasonable for women to be frustrated by similar stuff. He'll express it in a hyperbolic fashion because that's what frustrated people do and then some women will take it as if he's denying their own experiences of being the pursuer, which is again entirely reasonable, but will also be hyperbolic or dismissive in their reaction. Then, the guy feels that they are denying his experience and it all circles around again.

Laozen,taoism,1389056609.0,"Basically, it's not something which is actively *done* as such, it's a metaphor for attaining a state where things are done spontaneously and without internal strife, confusion, or excessive effort.  It's a metaphor for wu wei.  Once you give up ego and attachments and begin to simply go with and appreciate the Tao, once you become receptive, as an empty vessel, you'll basically be in this state without even having to think about it.

In fact, one does not *actively* be an uncarved block, just as an uncarved block doesn't require any work to be uncarved, hence the 'uncarved' part.  It's a state of mind where things come and go with ease and without involving force or attachment.  In practice this can be easy or difficult to attain depending on your circumstances but in either case, if done right, it will be very easy to slip into this state.

You could compare it to being in a meditative mindset no matter what you're doing or where you are.  The illusory difference between you and the rest of the Tao blurs, then fades entirely until you're just an extension of the Tao itself (not that you weren't before, but it becomes crystal clear, *felt* rather than just intellectually groped at, to put it one way).

PsychFreak,AskMen,1389056616.0,"&gt; Using debates as ego or status boosts is the feminine way.

This is one of the more mysoginistic things I've heard said.  That aside, I'm going to go ahead and agree with this part of what you said: that I see feelings as truth, and reality as changeable.  Absolutely do I believe this.  I tailored my schooling towards the post-modern theories of psychology, which see ""truth"" as unknowable, and ""reality"" as co-created through shared language and meaning-making.  Her feelings are valid merely because they exist; to tell someone that their feelings aren't valid is to deny their point of view, their experiences, maybe even their humanity.  The reason she's having those feelings may be born out of a misperception of the situation or of a meaning she's made that isn't useful to both people, but the feelings she's experiencing because of that meaning or perception are valid.

A competent relational therapist will help a couple co-create a shared meaning about a situation, about their relationship, about their lives together - and he/she will address conflict (i.e. hurt feelings) along the way.  What I hear you suggesting is that these feelings should be dismissed, swept aside, discounted as real, because the goal is to ""soothe conflict.""  The goal should be to *resolve* conflict, to get at the root of what is causing it, and come to an understanding - a new meaning - so that feelings will resolve on their own."

This particular passage really struck me:

**On colleagues describing him as calm**

Some people say that in stressful situations I can seem unflappable, and I think that's partly because I'm always kind of internally flapped. And so ... when there's actually something real to be concerned about, it's actually less anxiety-provoking than these irrational things. It's also fairly typical ... of certain kinds of anxiety disorder sufferers, particularly people with panic disorder, [they] are exceptionally good at hiding it. They're able to convey an impression of competence, calmness and confidence, which is maybe substantially real ... but there's an internal fear. ... The gap between that and this façade where people see you as competent and effective — you're always afraid of being exposed, which is in itself anxiety producing.

One of my more recent therapists calls this phenomenon Impression Management. Impression Management is not only a symptom of anxiety, because you're worried about being exposed, but it's also a cause because you're constantly worried that the house of cards that is your outward image ... is going to come crashing down."

I have said that there's something inherently icky about a guy telling a girl he knows that she ""wants it"". This entire song is a guy saying to a girl, you want it, c'mon do something, can't let the opportunity past me. I don't think he's raping her, I think it's guy persuading, convincing a girl to be sexual. 

As I've said, to me it's consistent with dudes who have put pressure on me when I indeed didn't want it. And it's entirely inconsistent with guys who I was into and did want. They didn't need to convince or pressure me. 

As for context, here is Robin Thicke discussing the song: ""I wrote it about my wife. She's my good girl. And I know she wants it because we've been together for 20 years so I can vouch for that"". I don't know, I find that condescending. Here's the thing, as a bit of a kinky sub-dom thing, I have no problem with that at all. Yeah it's kinda hot. But as a reflection of contemporary sexuality, it's a little condescending to refer to a grown woman as a ""good girl"" who ""wants it"".

And here's Robin Thicke discussing the video: “We tried to do everything that was taboo. Bestiality, drug injections, and *everything that is completely derogatory towards women*. Because all three of us are happily married with children, we were like, ‘We’re the perfect guys to make fun of this.’ People say, ‘Hey, do you think this is degrading to women?’ I’m like, ‘Of course it is. *What a pleasure it is to degrade a woman.* I’ve never gotten to do that before. I’ve always respected women.' So we just wanted to turn it over on its head and make people go, ‘Women and their bodies are beautiful. Men are always gonna want to follow them around.’”

Something folks just don't consider - that if they wake up with a bat flying around your room, they may have been exposed to rabies. 
[info here](http://www.cdc.gov/features/bats/) 

Relevant paragraph: 

Bats have small teeth that may leave marks not easily seen. Although many people know if they have been bitten by a bat, there are certain circumstances when a person might not be aware or able to tell if a bite has occurred. 

For example:

* If a person *awakes to find a bat in the room*

* If you find a bat in a room with an unattended child

* If you see a bat near a person with a disability


If the above occurs, *get immediate medical attention.* 

In all circumstances, contact local or state health departments for assistance with medical advice and testing bats for rabies. When it cannot be ruled out that the bat is free from rabies and an exposure has occurred, (PEP) may need to be considered."

pathein_mathein,badhistory,1389056868.0,"&gt;I'm not going to go through the rest of the book right now but based on your mis-understanding of this chapter I rather think that you've mis-understood the other chapters too.

No, really, please do.

I mean, I've since chucked aside my copy with wild abandon, so I can't go quote for quote with you, but that's the main point. This book is yet another AnCap screed. It's not the economics of piracy in any serious manner, but trying to make Chicago-style hip by recasting your favorite adventurers from page and screen. I strongly doubt it to make much of a contribution to either discipline, other than the yaks value.

So, really, that point - that's the important point, and I say this as someone who is (or has been called at least) both a historian and a libertarian, that it really fails to turn my head on either account. But hey, it's been a lot of martinis and shots since I read it, so go on and tell me it's not /r/badhistory.

But, yes, what you seem to dismiss as self-obvious:

&gt;It's not weird that Leeson would talk about homosexuality when talking about pirates, because the homosexuality of pirates is something that comes up in other histories. 

I don't. Putting aside that we've somewhat slipped into finance, his logic seems to be that ""since there is an economically rational explanation for matelotage (as a sort of estate planning), it does not follow that pirates were all gay."" Doesn't that strike you as weird? That, suddenly, using the secret tools of economists, we're able to make a decisive point on historical sexuality. Or not, because none of the examples you use have much to do with economic thought, in which case, it's unclear why we're making the point in the first place and why facile history is passing for interdisciplinary by virtue of the author's affiliations. 

Okay, he's out to take on whatever position holds that you had a majority or significant minority homosexual. Sure, that's a somewhat far position. But his argument really doesn't touch it one way or the other. It's been a while, but I don't remember him covering any points of actual sociology in this context relative to historical sexuality, which really ought to matter a lot. That's what you'd need to get into to answer the question. I mean, actual marriage is financial and sexual. I'm not saying matelotage is obviously homosexual in nature, but that he's really done little to answer the question other than note that pirates did have sex with women and were occasionally married, while writing as if he has the secret weapon to its understanding.

Particularly in the context of the story he's just been telling about the Pirates as the First AnCaps, and particularly the somewhat hostile language that he uses, the situation really starts to stink. It's the classic ""no, these people represent *my* idealized world, not yours."" It's yet another author trying to retcon a better world before. Whatever value the argument might have, it's trapped in a lot of subtext.

But maybe you're right, and I totally misread all of it. But now that you remind me of the book, I remember the racism chapter being probably worse - basically, pirates weren't racists because their superior economic rationality made them colorblind. "

Reality:

The politicians raise money by soliciting big business and tell them they will make sure that they will pass laws favoring the big business.

40s, well, there are still great women out there but the ones I meet seem far less willing to acquiesce, to forgive, to roll with troubles.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with having standards but the standard is ridiculously high and completely unyielding.  As a man and not being perfect and therefore completely underserving of her attention, my only chance is that they feel like slumming it.  At least that's the general feeling I get when I meet single women my age.

Oddly enough, it starts to turn back around a bit with women in their late 40s and early 50s:  they seem much more forgiving and accepting.

i don't mean any disrespect or rudeness... my opinion is just the way I see it. Dating in my 40s has been freaking terrible with women my age.  I've had much more success with women 10+ years younger and 10+ years older.  YMMV."

Now, learn how to be looking at something with your naked eye and bring the binox up to your eye without stopping looking at that thing.  Orion's belt and sword are both magnificent targets for this kind of thing: the former a dramatic open cluster of OB type stars, the latter containing the brightest and most dramatic emission nebula (M42) that you would ever want to see.

Look at other things on the sky map.  If you get to feeling cold or necksore, come inside.  If you want to do it the next night, go out and do it.

I'm fairly sure ice and field hockey were developed semi-independently but I may be wrong.

&gt;And how is my fighting comment completely wrong?

Well fighting wasn't introduced for the fans' sake, it was for the players' sake. Refs couldn't see everything on the ice, so fighting was the way for players to police themselves and avoid cheapshots.

&gt;When did I say that Gaelic Football and/or Hurling are Not older than football (and which football are you referring to)?

RagingSpartan,airsoft,1389057374.0,"It's been very reliable up until its recent disassembly for a new spring. The fps was hovering 390-410 on my chrono, but I wanted 430 minimum. 

I ran every voltage battery from 8.4v to 10.8v NiMH's, to 7.4v and 11.1v LiPO's with no hiccups in the gun, and that was after 3 years of consistent 9.6v usage. 

Accuracy was pretty decent, with 6"" groupings at 65 yards with the stock barrel, though I had teflon-taped the barrel beforehand, which may have skewed the results just a tad.

The external quality could be better, as the charging handle did come loose and eventually came to just slide back whenever the gun was tilted vertically on the stock. The stock and upper receiver also came loose from each other, but it was only noticeable after partial reassembly, and it may be due to my error. The metal also feels a bit cheap in comparison to my VFC and G&amp;P, but you can't expect high quality when you pay $180 for the gun. 

Overall, it's very worth the price. It's quite accurate, especially for it's likely CQB role, with a decent rps of 14-20 depending on if you're using an 8.4 or 9.6, though with a high fps (390-410 stock after break-in) for CQB if your field has rules that are actually enforced. I say this because my field is a public paintball field with no specific rules for airsoft, and the group I play with sets the limit at what cracks the worst eye-pro (some people have Home Depot glasses :/) or what you can willingly withstand yourself."

Basically, there was a time when everyone built warmogs late game - EVERYONE. It was a really efficient item and so tanks actually stacked warmogs. Riot got tired of the warmogs meta, and made the item less desirable by increasing it's cost and making it's build path require more items (4! There's only one or two items that require more!). To help balance out this loss of health, they made new items with health AND resistances or other things like AP (think spirit visage and brutalizer).

Because of this, tanks now build resistances and *some* health, rather than just HP. Gone are the days of the 5k HP Cho'gath."

Such a system would, however, be efficient, which our current system is not, one of its many shortcomings. The lack of access is another of its shortcomings. I'm no free market hawk, but I do believe that an efficient competitive healthcare market could exist. Whether such a system would be morally tenable is another question. The problem with your comment was that you said this:

&gt;Healthcare is unique in that the consumer posesses literally no leverage and thus has no market power.

Which is not necessarily true. In a completely different healthcare system which was a purely competitive capitalist system, this would not  be true. It's true in our current system, but when we're talking about alternative to our current system, we have to take into account all possibilities when we make absolute statements like that. You've got to separate what is possible from what is morally tenable."

ixAp0c,skateboarding,1389057860.0,"If you don't bend your knees on impact when you ollie, this will transfer to kickflips, pop-shuvits, etc., and it won't make your tricks as clean.  Also, you go through boards a LOT faster if you don't brace impact, and you will think that the skateboards you are riding are shitty quality when it's just technique. 

Even if you are just doing basic ollies, you should be able to do a lot of ollies (more than 500) on a 30$ - 50$ board, with the right technique. 

Check out your local skateshop (not Zumiez or mall chain stores, they don't hold down the scene really) and if you don't have one you could build a custom complete from a site like www.skatewarehouse.com or CCS.

And check out Braille Skateboarding's tutorials, he has a really great number of them and goes through them very methodically, one of my friends watched his how-to Ollie and was getting it down the next few days we skated.

There ate 2 things I can suggest that helped me tremendously: Find things you LIKE eating, and make sure you're exercising every day.

If you like eating something you can eat more of it. Chicken breast for example, i love and is ridiculously easy AND fast to cook. I never ate at school so I would get home, eat a sandwich then workout as hard as I could which eventually built up a bigger and bigger appetite.

Once you find yourself expecting those meals, you get hungry during the day. For snacks I recommend peanuts or cashews. Huge protein boost, plus they're delicious. You're probably a ways off from morning shakes &amp; building a diet so just focus on finding a food you can devour &amp; work your ass off! Good luck!"

Instead, their mature souls are given new, mature bodies in which to dwell, keeping all their memories and experiences. Generally, reborn Elves are more contemplative and passive. One Elf has come back from the Halls of Mandos and returned to Middle-earth -- Glorfindel, who rescued Frodo at the Ford of Bruinen. Glorfindel died during the First Age, killing what might have been a Balrog and might've been a lesser demon, during the Fall of Gondolin. He returned with the Istari to help fight Sauron."

A few years ago there was this circlejerk that he should basically never shoot first and always look to pass first. I never agreed with it, but I did think he should stop taking certain shots. Now the pendulum has swung back the other way and there is a reverse circlejerk defending his horrible shot selection and efficiency, because people see it as a binary between pass first or shoot first.

His shooting is just indefensible. No other player could chuck like that and be considered a top 5 position player. Yes he has Derrick Rose like stats, but Rose never played with another scorer half as talented as Durant. If you teamed up other elite point guards with Durant, their assist percentages would be through the roof AND their shooting would go up because they would get so many more open looks. 

He also gets a ton of credit for his defense, but in reality OKC has still managed an elite defense while giving his minutes to Jackson and fucking *Derek Fisher*. I feel like all his life he was able to gamble on defense because his supreme athleticism was so much higher than everyone else. Now in the NBA, he's constantly ball hawking but you can't scare NBA caliber point guards into turning the ball over. 

When he gets back, watch how many times Westbrook will let his man blow past so he can try the playground reach around steal. Or completely ignores Durant on the fast break so he can try and get his own contact lay up. Durant is 7 fucking feet tall, if he runs the floor you HAVE to give him the ball because no one is going to block his dunk in transition. That's like basketball 101: you reward the bigs for running the floor. 

If you watch Miami, they ALWAYS give LeBron the ball in transition. If Chalmers tried a lay up instead of passing to the trailing LeBron, he'd probably be insta-benched. "

The PTO initially rejected it due to prior art, but eventually issued the patent. However, all claims of the patent were subsequently canceled by the PTO upon reexamination.

ARRO-gant,AskMen,1389058385.0,"Several people on here have judged their fathers in a positive manner. If I had to judge my father overall, I'd say he's a loser. Just man enough to get married, but not man enough to marry someone right for him, not man enough to divorce when they were obviously wrong for each other. Just man enough to have children, but not man enough to not have children when he didn't want them, not man enough to walk out on his children. Just cowardly enough to stick around where he's not wanted or needed, nothing more than a human wallet.

Seeing him, and my contempt for him has made me pretty independent minded. I'm very non-traditional because I've seen how blindly following the traditional path can make you miserable, and it's not what I want out of life. I have no desire to have or raise children. I have no particular attachment to the idea of marriage, but our society is set up where it has very concrete benefits, so I accept that it might be in the future for me, but I certainly don't romanticize it as an eternal bond of romantic love. I don't particularly value family in the sense of genetic relationship(I do highly value the people I care about, but I don't worry about their genetics).


I'm not going to say that I'm a better person than him, we've similar flaws actually. We both have tempers, we both use/abuse substances(me more towards use, he just abuses them), emotionally closed off. I will say I struggle with these things, but presumably he does too."

I mentioned Damon Waynes and son because they are both very likable and there is an obvious apple-tree connection there. Damon Waynes isn't an A-lister like Will Smith but Waynes Jr has the same likability that his father has. Jaden Smith just seems to lack the charm, which can't be taught.

I'm very glad the UK does not routinely add Paracetamol to painkillers the way it seems to be in the US - I'd much rather have the choice to take it rather than having it forced on me. We really do need much more awareness of how dangerous paracetamol is, and I'm amazed it's so easily available.

Tolerance happens even without abuse, albeit slower. I started taking 5mg every 3 hours (instant release) and over two years increased that to 30mg, less wasn't killing the pain enough, but that dose was leaving me tired all the time. I explained it to my doctor who switched  me to extended release and now I just take 20mg every 12 hours. I do have a bit more pain than before, but better quality of life overall.

As for the last issue, it's pretty much just cancelled out my IBS so I'm actually normal for the first time in my life."

Gluestick05,MakeupAddicts,1389058670.0,"I recently got MAC prolongwear concealer for under-eye, and I'm pretty happy with it.  Nothing is ever totally crease-free, but it's decent.

Pros: it's really runny, which makes it apply very smoothly.  You can build layers without it looking gross.  Good color range.  Reasonable price.  Great coverage.  So much coverage.

Cons: so much coverage.  Hard to blend with sheer foundation.  Pumps out way more than you need. A little too ""matte"" to look natural. 

I prefer this product to: 

Benefit erase paste (too creasy, never sets)

Lancome effacernes (great product, not enough coverage)

Tarte creaseless concealer (so thick--forget it on this area)

Hourglass corrective concealer (separates on my skin, not yellow enough to color correct)"

Do you even know how definitions work?

Seriously, no sarcasm or ill-intent. Do you?

Words can have multiple meanings, depending on context. 

In the context of capitalism, goods, and services, the two definitions I listed are the ones that apply. There is no arguing that.

Let's go back to your snickers example, which by the way is a poor example for your argument.

You said that you consume a candy bar. Ironically, both my definition and your definition for consume can be applied in this case.

""I consumed a candy bar."" = I purchased the merchandise known as a candy bar, engaging in the free marketplace.

""I consumed a candy bar."" = I ate a candy bar.

Both meanings apply here. That's how words work: they can have multiple meanings."

lynxz,deaf,1389058754.0,"&gt;When our baby passed his first hearing test, my dad actually said, ""Great! I don't have to learn sign language!""

Right then and there I would have slammed my father for being an insensitive asshole. A true father would give a shit about his kid and communication while dropping any sort of stupid male pride. Parents should emphasize on what is best for their children, and that sort of a mentality is what causes many deaf to grow up unprepared for life. If you guide a child and truly push them to be all they can be, they will have much higher odds of success - hearing or deaf. 

If I was you, I would tell your father to learn sign language or he will be spending a LOT less time around his grandchild, as you are planning to teach the kid sign and he would hinder your success.

If you don't wanna cause any sort of friction and just bow out, and allow them to push you around with insensitive comments.. how can you ever expect your child to grow up fully respecting you? You need to stand up for yourself and your family, but do so in a wise way. I'm not saying fight anyone or instigate drama, but you really should get that whole ""we shouldn't learn sign because (insert excuse here)"" mentality nuked. That mindset is the same mindset that forced oral on deaf people and put them through the 'dark ages' from the early 1900's to the 1980's.

To be clear, I never said anything about a hierarchy. I am not at all uncomfortable with the notion that I could be considered an animal. I think we're different because it makes sense.

&gt; Your example is just a differentiation of actions, which is not predicated on our perception of ourselves as being inherently different from animals. 

I'm implying that our unique actions demononstrate our unique ability to execute them.

&gt; We consider the list of things that are uniquely-gorilla qualities without separating them from all the other animals, why ""must"" we separate ourselves.

Why do we have the ""animal"" category? Why do we have any category at all? Humans exhibit unique properties which are not at all like anything else we know, so I categorize them accordingly."

incogito_ergo,leangains,1389058995.0,"Edit: TL;DR: Yes, EC still helps when you are not fasted.  Even if it does not help with weight loss specifically (which is may), it will definitely still help with partitioning (i.e. you will lose more fat and less muscle).  There's a reason EC has been, and remains, a staple in the bodybuilding world for years.

(stole this from elitefitness.com forums, as I couldn't quickly find the original study):

The Research Looking at Ephedrine / Caffeine / Aspirin and Weight Loss

In a double blind, placebo controlled study, caffeine alone was found to produce thermogenic and lipolytic effects in humans in a dose dependent manner.13 These researchers found that the thermic effect was significantly correlated to plasma triglyceride levels, plasma lactate concentrations and vascular tone. The authors attribute the increase in lactate, triglycerides and enhanced vascular tone to the increased metabolic rate. In a study using caffeine and ephedrine researchers found no difference in the total amount of body weight that was lost over 8 weeks.14 However, they did find significant differences in the source of the weight that was lost. Fourteen obese women were treated with a ~1000 kcal diet and either E + C (20mg E + 200mg C) or placebo three times per day for 8 weeks in a double-blind study. The total weight-lost was not different between groups, but the E + C group lost ~10 lbs. more body fat and ~6 pounds less fat-free mass. This is encouraging news for any bodybuilder. You must bear in mind, however, that these were obese women. Studies have shown that nutrient partitioning is determined in part by your % fat before you diet or before you over eat.15,16 Nevertheless, that is a tremendous effect on fat loss and muscle retention.

Some research has shown that the anti obesity effects of ephedrine are not significant unless caffeine is used in conjunction with ephedrine.17 In fact, most studies exploring the thermogenic effects of ephedrine also look at caffeine as a synergist. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study, 180 obese patients were treated by a calorie restricted diet and either an ephedrine/caffeine combination (20mg/200mg), ephedrine (20 mg), caffeine (200 mg) or placebo three times a day for 24 weeks. Average weight loss was significantly greater with the combination than with placebo from week 8 to week 24. Weight loss in both the ephedrine only and the caffeine only groups was similar to that of the placebo group. The authors conclude that the effect of either caffeine or ephedrine alone is ineffective in inducing significant weight loss.18,19 Not only is it necessary to combine ephedrine and caffeine to elicit a significant fat burning effect, the two compounds exhibit synergistic effects in certain ratios. By comparing different ratios of ephedrine and caffeine, it was found that 20 mg of ephedrine and 200 mg of caffeine exhibited a supra additive or synergistic effect while no other ratio did.20 This means that ephedrine and caffeine taken in a 1:10 ratio (20 mg ephedrine : 200 mg caffeine) creates effects greater than the sum of the two drugs added together. In other words, 2 + 2 = 5 in this ratio!

So what about aspirin? There has not been as much research done on aspirin in this ""stack"". Looking first at animals, chronic administration of aspirin to obese mice had no effect on weight loss. Ephedrine given to these mice increased energy expenditure by 9% and reduced body weight and body fat by 18% and 50%, respectively: obesity however, was reduced but the mice still were not comparable to normal controls. When given both ephedrine and aspirin, increase in energy expenditure found during treatment with ephedrine alone was doubled, and the obese group lost greater than 75% of body fat, and obesity essentially was reversed.21 The research done on humans has also been somewhat promising. The effect of ephedrine (30 mg) and aspirin (300 mg) on the acute thermogenic response to a liquid meal (250 kcal) was investigated in lean and obese women (n = 10 each group). Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured prior to each of the following treatments: meal only (M), meal plus ephedrine (ME) or meal plus ephedrine and aspirin (MEA). The postprandial rise in metabolic rate, following the MEA treatment compared to the ME, was significantly greater for the obese group but not the lean. It was concluded that aspirin potentiates the stimulatory effect of ephedrine on the thermogenic response to a meal in obese but not lean women.22 One weakness of this study was the small number of subjects. Nevertheless, these findings are not all that surprising considering the fact that decreased thermic effect of food is often seen in the obese.23 In another study24, a mixture of ephedrine (75-150mg), caffeine (150mg) and aspirin (330mg), in divided premeal doses, were investigated in 24 obese partints in a randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial. Energy intake was not restricted. Overall weight loss over 8 weeks was 2.2kg for eca - ephedrine - caffeine - aspirin - ephedrine - caffeine - aspirin - ephedrine - caffeine - aspirin vs. 0.7 kg for placebo. Eight of 13 placebo subjects returned 5 months later and received eca - ephedrine - caffeine - aspirin in an unblinded crossover. After 8 weeks, mean weight loss with eca - ephedrine - caffeine - aspirin was 3.2 kg vs 1.3 kg for placebo. Six subjects continued on eca - ephedrine - caffeine - aspirin for 7 to 26 months. Notice that there is no concern about receptor down regulation or trying useless dosing schedules like ""2 weeks on and 2 weeks off"". Anyway, after 5 months on eca - ephedrine - caffeine - aspirin, average weight loss in five of these was 5.2 kg compared to 0.03 kg gained during 5 months between studies with no intervention. The sixth subject lost 66 kg over 13 months by self-imposed caloric restriction. This sixth subject lost an amazing 150 lbs. By exercising and cutting calories! Can you believe they didn’t encourage the other subjects to diet and exercise? In all studies, no significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin, and cholesterol levels, and no differences in the frequency of side effects were found. eca - ephedrine - caffeine - aspirin in these partints caused significant weight loss even without caloric restriction. The authors of this study go on to comment that the eca - ephedrine - caffeine - aspirin combination might be more effective with caloric restriction. That kind of conservatism cracks me up!

In one study that really got my attention they compared the effects of ephedrine against the por prescription drug dexfenfluramine that goes under the brand name Redux.25 In order to compare the efficacy and safety of these two anorectic drugs, 103 patients with 20-80% overweight were included in a 15-week double-blind study in general practice. Patients were randomized to either 15 mg DF twice daily (n = 53), or 20 mg/200 mg ephedrine/caffeine three times a day (n = 50). Subjects went on a 1200 kcal/day diet during the treatment period. After 15 weeks of treatment, the DF group (n = 43) had lost ~15 +/- 9.46 lbs. and the EC group (n = 38) had lost ~18.3 +/- 11.5 lbs. In the subgroup of patients with BMI &gt; or = 30 kg/m2 (n = 59), the mean weight loss was 7.0 +/- 4.2 kg in the DF group (n = 29) and 9.0 +/- 5.3 kg in the EC group (n = 30), P &lt; 0.05. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced similarly during both treatments. Central nervous system side-effects, especially agitation, were more pronounced in the EC group, whereas gastro-intestinal symptoms were more frequent in the DF group. The side-effects declined markedly during the first month of treatment in both groups. Not only was the weight loss with ephedrine and caffeine comparable to Redux, it was probably greater! This study did not look at body composition but I bet it would have shown the E/C combination as superior in retaining lean mass.

You may have noticed that most of the studies I have cited have used obese subjects. This is understandable considering it is the obese potion that are targeted for drug therapy. It should be noted however, that the thermogenic properties of an ephedrine/caffeine mixture are also demonstrated in lean subjects as well.26 You should expect increased effectiveness in obese people because of underlying problems with metabolic rate. Anytime you increase the metabolic rate in obese individuals you will see large changes in energy expenditure because the relative increase in metabolic rate is greater than in lean individuals.

It all depends on the specific drugs and the specific doses. Resistance could make the dosage needed too impractical for use. Either because it becomes toxic in larger doses or so much volume is needed and the effect is so minuscule. Some drugs also have a cumulative affect where they don't leave the system so a few doses might be ok, but then they compound so much in the system that you'd effectively overdose by even adding a tiny bit more.

Those are just a couple reasons some drugs can't be continuously used."

This picture was the first time I wore my monk straps out, I wore them for about 4 hours on first wear. They fit comfortably enough, I can't give a solid answer until I've broken them in more. 

[From a price-to-quality standpoint](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/cole-haan-air-madison-monk-strap-shoe/3558674) the monkstraps were originally 248$ and were marked down to 159, they go for below 150 on amazon. The general consensus was that cole haan shoes are expensive for the quality so the mark down probably puts them to where quality meets price. I needed some lighter brown, almost walnut colored shoes and I also wanted a pair of monk straps, so I jumped on this sale when I saw it.

&gt;I suppose you're right: the subreddit definitely ground to a halt for the last two weeks. We haven't had any content whatsoever, no threads, no comments, no discussions. None at all. The several thousand posts that I've seen are just my imagination.  

Ask anyone, and they'll tell you that the subreddit has been significantly less interesting for the past two weeks.  Post count doesn't matter, it's the *popularity* of the posts.

&gt;the fact that we can remove all of your posts and completely censor you, or arbitrarily ban you for no reason at all.
Sure, we don't do it that much, but we could do it.

This is true for every subreddit.  If the mods here banned people left and right, people would just go form another subreddit.  What I'm trying to say is that I'm using the selfie megathread as an example, that maybe the community should be consulted, or a vote be called, etc. before something as major as removing all selfie threads for 2 weeks is done."

Laozen,taoism,1389059468.0,"The path of least resistance is not always the path of least effort.  One of the three jewels of Taoism is moderation; you want to avoid being both working yourself to death and slacking yourself to death.

Besides, ultimately the path of least effort can be one which leads you into deeper resistance, it's probably the biggest personal issue I face in my own life, and it's definitely hindered me in some ways.  If it would be easier to simply do the work rather than to face the consequences of doing nothing, then the way which requires the least amount of needless, avoidable effort is the one which involves getting things done.  Just because it is unwise to try and *force* something doesn't mean that doing work must be forceful or out of place.

From Chapter 64:
&gt; Things are easier to control while things are quiet.
Things are easier to plan far in advance.
Things break easier while they are still brittle.
Things are easier hid while they are still small.

&gt;Prevent problems before they arise.
Take action before things get out of hand.

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1389059584.0,"MY father won $40,000 on a scratch ticket courtesy of the California State Lottery

WE got around $32,000 after taxes, but what we did was we poured all the money into moving the family to New Hampshire, so we could be closer to my mother's family (really for her father). 

My brother had a chance to go to Phillips Exeter Academy, my grandfather flew him and my mother out here to take a look at the school and they both greatly enjoyed New England. (MY brother later decided not to go to Phillip's but that is another story for another time.) 

A few months after they got back from their vacation dad bought a ticket and won. Without hesitation my parents decided to put every last dime into moving us to New Hampshire because the education was leaving me and my siblings behind in Cali, and my parents had better job opportunities (well back then they did) in NH. 

We bought a van, packed our crap, my parents flew out for a week to find a house, then we left and never looked back and it was probably the one thing I will always be thankful they did. My sister is dyslexic and due to budget cuts the schools in Cali couldn't help my sister, labelled her as ""mentally retarded"" because she couldn't read, it was so they could stick her a classroom *somewhere*. My sister was ultimately thrown into a classroom for the behavioral needs students and given coloring books to pour through for 6 hours. She was in the 4th grade. I will never forget her coming home in tears crying, ""Mom, am I bad girl?!"" 

I was constantly being put into classes for people who spoke English as a second language (English is my first tyvm) and was failing everything, and my brother was getting damned near a 4.0 GPA because he wasn't being challenged enough. 

We moved to New Hampshire, my grades improved, my brother ultimately got a VERY nice career with the Navy, and after a year of the help my sister deserved, she was reading at grade level. A few years later my sister was scaring her high school's freshman English teacher because she was well read in Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde and Victorian poetry. 

IT's been 7 years since then. My family is ultimately from Oregon and we hope to move back this June. Thank you New Hampshire.

Too much attention is smothering; too little attention is apathetic.  Don't try and be anything other than who you are, don't try and change something fundamental about yourself unless you're ready to change that thing, and if you're trying to date someone by being someone else then it's going to blow up in your face one way or another.

zataks,Boxing,1389059860.0,"From the sound of your responses, you've been at it 3 or so months?  Given the manner that most boxing clubs train people, you're probably just starting to get to a point where you are ""getting in shape"".  Boxing shape is different than many other sports and images.

Also realize, you're training on fewer than half the days every week.  If you want better results, train more/harder.  

And if you can't get to the gym or if they are charging your per day, pull your jump rope out at home.  Make your first goal jumping 5 minutes straight.  That's no rounds, no breaks, no stops.  If you mess up, immediately start jumping again.  I make a habit of, upon accidentally stopping the rope, continuing to jump with the foot that jut the rope until I start spinning it again.  You don't have to go fast, just don't stop.  After a week or 2 of 5 minutes, jump for 10 continuously.  Or go straight for 20.  Make your ultimate goal 30 minutes.  It's mind-numbing but you can use the time to visualize your form and technique.  Do this every day.

As the skipping becomes easier you will get better balance, and can vary your method of skipping (single foot, both feet, can-can, etc) as well as incorporating interval stuff.  I love it in the gym when I'm going for 20-30 minutes of jumping and when the 30second warning comes, I burn fast with doubles or high-knees for 30 and then, when everyone else stops at the bell, I keep on going at the regular pace.  It's 30 seconds of rest I'm not giving myself that they are taking but I'll take any little bit of an edge I can when it comes to training.

What are you doing in the time you're not in the gym?  How is your diet?  These things are of great significance concerning your progression.

Comma20,ffxiv,1389059904.0,"Just quick math shows;

Casting Adlo is ~160mana/second, or 9576/minute if you chain cast. MP Regen for a 4500 MP SCH (which should be about right for an iLvl90 SCH) is a maximum of 4719 in the first minute and 3822 in every minute there after, but generally 2925 (since you don't really use energy drain) (65% MaxMana + 199*Energy Drain). So you can easily see it's not mana efficient.

Cost per mana efficiency though, non crit weighted Physick is 3 potency/mana vs Adloquim 1.5 potency/mana. However due to the nature of Adloquim, a crit is worth 225% more potency, so weighting with 10% crit, you get 1.69 potency/mana, 15% crit, 1.79 potency/mana, 20% crit, 1.88 potency/mana. To meet a 'raw' mana efficiency of physick (based on 100% throughput) you need a crit rate of 80%.

But what about overhealing you say, since adloquium's shield is 100% efficient! Raw wise, you need to be overhealing at a rate of 67.5% for them to become equivalent in Healing/MP.

This is all just some simple math, it's definitely plausible to compare them and find the overhealing % breakpoint with a scaling for crit rate, but it can be seen that ""Any reasonable healer"" within the current limitations of ""Reasonable Crit Rate acquirable"" will NOT be healing mana efficiently by purely using Adloquium.

I believe Adloquium is a situational skill on appropriately geared content as on overgeared content, you can just use your Faerie for 90% of the healing. Furthermore with accuracy caps your DPS that you can 'squeeze' in between 'big crits' can often be limited. I spend all 4-man content in Cleric Stance bar Pharos Sirius, and can solo heal all HM Primals (Given competent DPS) for example."

We agreed on marriage when we started dating, and I feel that it's even more important now that we have our son (who, admittedly, has been a *huge* factor in why I want it now.) Knowing that he changed his mind without telling me would feel like a betrayal, and if he doesn't want it when I do, then there's no point in going forward if we're headed in opposite directions. I'm not going to sit around hoping he changes his mind: if he says it's never going to happen, or it'll be ten years down the line, then I'm not investing more time in a relationship that's only going to nuke itself from resentment (on my part.)

The problem is that I don't know. I don't know what he wants. He seems happy in the relationship, and he's great with our son. The longer we go, the happier he seems, and the closer we get. But I haven't heard a peep from him on marriage when it comes to *us*. I heard plenty about his brother's engagement and impending marriage, but nothing about us. I don't know where he's at right now, and he won't tell me. 

He's giving me what I want out of the relationship *except* for the marriage part. Everything else is great. Like I said; I'm not going to walk away if he doesn't hand me a ring right now. I just want some kind of timeline or agreement that it *is* happening in the near future.

Wyrmnax,atheism,1389060071.0,"St. Thomas Aquinas actually had the right idea about having to prove God as the first part of his argumentation. You are telling me that unicorns exist. You should be the one providing proof.

He was a very well educated man that had access to 13th century knowledge. While his argumentation might have been irrefutable 700 years ago, today some of it can be refuted by someone with even a minute knowledge of science, like me.

For starters:

The first argument is pretty easy to disprove today. Isolate two objects from the rest of the universe. They will start moving towards each other because of gravity. It is obviously more complex than that, and we will end up in anything that has mass has potential energy because at the very least it has potential gravitational energy towards anything else that has mass.

The second is much more phylosofical, and i am ill equiped to handle it right now. Like i said, only cursory science knowledge here.

The third (""contingency"") actually opens up a very nice question. What if all the contingencies actually exist? What if, for each thing that ""might have happened"" there is a universe where that thing happened? 

The fourth (""gradation"") only works if those 'levels' work in the first place. Most of the arguments there are subjective. Beauty in particular is *very* subjective, being completely dependend on the culture you were raised on. Just take a look at the 'models of beauty' of today and of the Renaicense, and see the diferences. Intelect is also very subjective, today we understand that there are intelects that are better at certain tasks than at others. It is very common for autists to have genius level of intelect on certain tasks, but how can you grade it against a 'normal' person? What is better, being able to instantly solve any mathematical equations or being able to work inside a society? If you need to solve the equations then i will take the mathematical genius, thank you.

The fifth, again, i am ill equiped to handle. I will have to defer to someone with more knowledge.

If you are going to prove God, i have a question to you:
I am assuming that you believe in a christian God as you cited St Thomas Aquinas. So i will be citing the bible to make my question:
Matthew 19:26 and Luke 1:37 ( among others ) say that with God, everything is possible ( Omnipotence ) 
John 3:20 and Jeremiah 23:24 among others say that God knows everything ( Omniscience )

Can there be free will in a universe where there is a being that is omnipotent and omniscient at the same time? How?"

RandianHero,dating_advice,1389060073.0,"I'm what you would call good with pickup. Since the age of fourteen (I'm 35 now), I've been with about 350 women, give or take. I lived and dated through the era before cell phones, and texting, and even e-mail. So I've got some experience with these things. And I have to say: texting is by far the best way to go.

1. People are busy. Few people have time to commit to a phone conversation. Texts, on the other hand, can be sent throughout the day without intruding in regular life.

2. Because nobody calls anymore, nobody expects anything good to come of it. I know I associate phone calls with work or bad news, so I'm immediately on edge when my phone rings. A lot of people have the same mindset.

3. There's nothing special about phone conversations that you can't convey better in person. Phone conversations are an awkward middle point that serve no real benefit.

4. Most people answer texts. Phone calls are answered maybe half the time.

5. Calling doesn't make you stand out or look cool. At best, people will think you're weird or lack priorities. You'll probably make people more annoyed that you interrupted them instead of valuing their time and being patient with their responses.

In short, unless it's an emergency or they specifically request it, don't call."

* Don't be mad at your SO demanding personal space. Some people just need some time alone, no matter how mad they are in love. Everybody deserves time for himself (if wanted).

* TALK. Just, whatever it is, talking will not make it worse and you will feel better. Also, in case of problems, two minds can think better than one. 

* If you plan on moving in together and you are not sure jet, I suggest staying at your/his/her place together for at least 3 weeks without a pause. If you feel stressed after that time, then you should wait with moving together.

Rossegut,worldbuilding,1389060214.0,"Mine is Zatter Kanzet.

In 1230 his race made first contact with an extraterrestrial alliance, and he was a diplomat spearheading peace talks. He eventually earned his race a position in the alliance.

Afterwards he became a war hero, commanding a starship throughout his campagin against spaceborn kaiju.

In 1236 when he returned to his homeworld after the campaign, he unfortunately found his fiancee had grown lonely and cheated on him. This sent him into an inescapable depression and ended with him paying to be cryogenically frozen, requesting to be awakened once every twenty years to see how the times have changed.

I really like Zatter Kanzet because he's a cultural icon--diplomat, Supreme Commander, daikaiju ass-kicker. Kids look up to him, his face is plastered on military recruitment posters, and books have been written about him. But deep down he suffers from intense loneliness and depression, all because the woman he loved moved on."

sockalicious,personalfinance,1389060308.0,"Taxes are used in the USA as a form of incentive for behavior change.  Incentives are extraordinarily powerful.

Incentivizing the wealthy to put all their money in tax-avoidant vehicles could be done.  It would work.  They would do it.

It is not permitted.  Now the wealthy guy has a lot of money.  He could invest it, but there would be high taxes on his gains.  He could buy yachts or other hobbies, and often he does, but eventually finds that these don't make him happy because they make him lose a lot of money and he gets bored with them.

I have known a lot of rich guys who said, ""well, I'll just find a hobby that's a business, and then deduct all the business expenses from my income taxes.""  The IRS lets you do this for 3 years before you have to reclassify the business as a hobby and stop deducting its expenses.

I've known more than a few rich guys who've done this and very often their business starts making money and generating jobs, almost despite their efforts.  The whole system is set up to make this kind of thing happen as frequently as possible."

And I think being a ""slut"" is a bad thing, for women especially. For a man to become a ""slut"" it takes work. The type of man that can be a slut, is valued. He's the 20% having 80% of the sex. So society doesn't really ""shame"" them. In fact, most guys applaud him for being the type of guy that can do such a thing. It's not easy.

But for the most part, men aren't applauding the slut side of a male slut, but the alpha side of it. Only alphas can get to that level.

Women on the other hand, it's easy being a slut. Literally she just needs to open her legs and there will be a line of men lining up. Go check out OkCupid if you want some scary truth about this. So when a man becomes a slut it's entirely different. Women don't have to try and work for it.

And yes, women are the biggest slut shamers. They slame sluts because other women are devaluing the sexual value. They are the keepers of sex, and when other women are going around fucking guys that aren't investing much, it devalues their sex as a whole. Women want other women to less slutty, that's why they shame it. They know it's wrong. Men on the other hand would love it if more women were slutty, because it means more for us. "

&gt; Since it has to be ordered I'm sure I'll be paying more

Not really. True, they might try to tempt you with taking something else on the lot right now for a slightly ""lower price,"" but if you do your homework and come in knowing what you want you'll basically pay the same for it as if it was sitting right there on the lot.

&gt; How do I make sure I don't end up with the wrong vehicle?

The dealership will print out a build sheet for the truck once you've finished telling them what you want. Many places will offer you a copy. Ask for one if they don't. We'd rather the customer have a copy because it protects everyone- we can't pull a fast one on the customer and furnish them with the wrong car, and they can't come back after taking delivery and accuse us of ordering the wrong thing (this happens- customer changes their mind a month into it, but won't be up front about it). We have both the customer and a manager sign the build sheet, and keep one copy on file and send the other home with the customer.

&gt; salesman says that the 0% rate won't be available on the 2015 when it first comes out

0% financing and/or big cash back offers are used as a tool to move out inventory that's getting stale. Your salesman is correct.

&gt; 3-4 months for the vehicle to arrive

I'll have to defer this one to a Nissan expert.

&gt; Any other things I should be keeping in mind?

Loan approvals are typically only good for 30 days, so the dealer may do a credit check at the time you order and then submit the deal for financing right before you pick it up- so don't be surprised if soon before delivery you get a call concerning the financing."

So... the FCC, while it's passed net neutrality rules before, probably won't be an ally going forward.

What's more, the FCC's current foundation for its net neutrality rules is shaky, and about to die in court (people are speculating that the decision will go: they won't be allowed to block content outright, but they will be allowed to favor some content over other).

Instead, the reason women don't ask out men as often is because there are a lot of misogynistic guys who label women who pursue as ""desperate"" or say they feel ""emasculated"" when a woman pursues them.

That's kind of the thing. When women have a problem with men, the root cause is misogyny. When men have a problem with women...the root cause is STILL misogyny. Pretty much any time men as a group are getting screwed over, it's happening because of other men who are misogynists.

lonelychaser,nottheonion,1389060552.0,"I used to work the graveyard shift and there was this crazy show I listened to called Coast to Coast AM which included lots of crazy conspiracies. The last night of my graveyard shift I listened to the entire episode which told the whole story of this which I'm sure included these two guys.

The whole story involved some top secret program where they took an elevator which traveled down and somehow went to Mars. The story continued of how Mars had oxygen but not as much as Earth and a blue sky but Mars was a deadly place with dangerous beasts so most people that went to Mars (and they sent a lot) died. They were trying to establish a colony or something.

Now this was already interesting but they started talking about Ed Dames on the show, who is mentioned in the article of having trained him. They talked about how Ed Dames trained them and what not but what made this more interesting is that he was a regular on the show and called in to say these guys were talking shit and he never trained them but was instead driving tanks elsewhere. But he left it vague like it could have been an alternate version of him or something. They then proceed to fight on the air until the host disconnected Ed Dames.

Andrew D. Basiago or William Stillings talked about how Obama was groomed to be president and that one of them (don't remember which) would become president as well and that he planned to run in the next election and how he would win cause it was all planned out years in advance. The show concluded with some former president's daughter, can't remember which president it was just that it was pre-Bush Sr. and how she knew all about it as well and was part of it."

ElderKingpin,NoStupidQuestions,1389060555.0,"Both pieces, and generally any of sherlock holme's styled themes are very ""discombobulated."" They're simulating sherlock holme's thinking style of rapid fire calculations and general unease with harsh violins and a very strong and involved accompaniment. You still have a melody but the melody is almost drowned out by the ""left hand"" of the piece (left hand as in the left hand when you're playing piano, the left hand is usually accompaniment and the right hand is melody).

The modern sherlock holmes has been interpreted to be a constantly thinking machine that never stops moving so the composers convey that with similar musical themes.

If you look at the LOTR soundtrack and The Hobbit soundtracks. The music of the shire instantly gives you a picture of the shire and the misty mountains piece gives you a vision of the lonely mountain of the dwarves. The music gives you a mental picture of what the composer is going for."

The issue I see with your argument that it's much like illegally downloading content is that this is a video game and thus the repercussions for duplicating items is much less than downloading tons of movies and reselling them. That's an actual legal issue as opposed to people just wanting to trade and make their houses look nice on Animal Crossing.

I don't mean for my rebuttal to sound sort of like a cop out by using the ""it's just a video game"" argument-- and I completely understand being engrossed in a video game personally. It's just that it's true; Animal Crossing is a video game, with a fabricated economy based completely around people trading rare and non-orderable items that most likely were duped.

And I'm not trying to say that illegally downloading things in real life is particularly right either, in fact, I'm not trying to condone for duping at all. All I'm trying to say is that people play the game how they want to, and it shouldn't be anyone's right to tell someone otherwise."

He was never at any family functions and nobody ever talked about him. When I asked my mom who he was she explained that he was her cousin and they were pretty close and that one winter when I was a baby he went out late at night to get me proper pajamas because my parents couldn't afford them. So he seemed like a nice guy and couldn't understand why he was never around or even mentioned. I wondered if he was some kind of criminal or in jail or if he had died some tragic death. 

A couple of years ago i saw another picture of him and brought up the subject with my mom. Turns out her cousin is gay. That's all there is to it. He's gay and open about it and so the family sort of disowned him. The recent picture i saw was of him and his boyfriend at my awsome great aunts wedding. But is the only family function he has attended in decades and he hasn't been to another one since.  This makes me more ashamed of my family.

maowsers93,Austin,1389060694.0,"&gt; Too many organizations like SOS stopping new developments because of ""the aquifer"" or whatever.

The aquifer ""or whatever"" is quite important considering our water problems. Development of lands to the detriment of our water infrastructure isn't an option. It also feeds into [Barton Springs](http://www.edwardsaquifer.net/intro.html) which is a city landmark. Destroying water sources and city treasures for increased housing is not a sustainable model.

That said the reason why they have expanded 35 is because there is a cemetery on one side and the UT practice field on the other. If you drive up 35 through downtown and take note of the things that would have to be destroyed to widen the highway it is an eye opener. To add to that list St. Davids would have to be torn down and rebuilt. I totally agree that it has to be expanded and I'd personally start digging up the cemetery if that is what it took but doing it is a lot easier said than done. "

Noumenology,occult,1389060934.0,"Lots of people are answering the question ""How pervasive is christian mysticism,"" and they're giving really good answers. In influence and scope, Christian mysticism is a very powerful yet loose set of ideas with good synergy to the occult (particularly since so much occult thought is rooted in mysticism and Judeo-Christian concents, as has been noted). But the question you asked is [paraphrased] how **big** is ""the Christian Mysticism movement""? And that's really difficult to say because of a few things.

First thing: It's really difficult to pin down a definition of mysticism that everybody likes. I just started reading Regardie's ""The Tree of Life"" which identifies magic (in the hermetic sense) as being encompased within mysticism (along with Yoga). This is how we might be happy understanding it in /r/occult - but we know that there are ""magickians"" and wiccans and all sorts of other folks calling on Bael and Asmodeus and Solomon's 50 other demons for serious and invoking succubi (and the occasional incubus) for serious. Not to offend the more open-minded of you, but I was really pleased when Regardie wrote

&gt;Magic is not that popularly conceived practice which is the child of hallucination begotten by savage ignorance, and which panders to the lusts of a depraved mankind. Because of the ignorant duplicity of charlatans and the reticence of its own scribes and authorities, Magic for centuries has been unduly confused with Witchcraft and Demonolatry... This work does not pretend to deal in any way with love-charms, philtres and potions, nor with amulets preventing one's neighbour's cow from giving milk, robbing him of his wife, or to ascertain the whereabouts of gold and hidden treasure. Such vile and stupid practices rightly deserve that much-abused term ""Black Magic."" 

I like ""magic"" in the sense that we might understand ""mysticism"" but the two have this in common - it's hard to get a bead on what you mean when you say it. Wouter J. Hanegraaff (who studies western esotericism) [wrote about](http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/Hanegraaff.html) what a grab bag mess of terms we have today with people confusing some of the related concepts and words. Back in 1902 in *The Varieties of Religious Experience* William James described religious experiences as mystical, with 4 qualities (transient/ineffable/""Noetic""/Passive) - all very hum drum. Historically orthodox christianity has been very amenable to some mystics (St. John of the Cross, Teresa of Ávila, the author of the ""Cloud of Unknowing,"" eastern orthodox saints, the ""desert fathers"" ps /r/DesertFathers), and history has destroyed others (The Essenes, the Cathars, and most gnostic groups). 

That said, identifying *who* is a mystic is difficult as well. If you take it to mean someone who seeks a personal relationship with the divine and is willing to not be bound by traditional theology or doctrine, then there are probably lots of mystics out there. If you mean actual *groups* of people who promote independent or collective work on radically new conceptions of what it is to be a Christian, then they will be hard to find and most likely short lived - and here's my theory on that:

Christianity (by and large) is an institution. Clergy, churches and other groups of people work in tandem to transform the revolutionary and radical concepts of a (prophet/messiah/original mystic visionary) into something that people can digest in small doses once a week and pay tithes to purchase salvation. This makes a government's job easier (or any secular method of rule, whether that's an economic system ala capitalism or some cultural force of illusions ala hyperreality via Baudrillard). The Church first controls the message of the messiah, by becoming the only people who can read, revise, interpret and preach the message, and then by controlling how people experience the message, by instituting structured services, establishing rites for initiation, rituals for purification, and roles for the saved as deacons, youth leaders, pastors and so on.

Now, believers need rites, rituals and roles to some extent, but churches act from a strong authority (presumably on behalf of god). One of the clearest examples is the Church of Scientology - i'm NOT saying that LRH was a mystic visionary (I think he was a charismatic schizophrenic with an axe to grind against his fellow humans), but it's clear how orthodoxy works in the COS, with trained auditors and levels on the Bridge of whatever, and all the heretics work out in the ""freezone,"" gnashing their teeth in darkness. 

Who are the mystics in christianity? Are they fruitcakes and flakes who accept every personal experience as something from the divine? Are they the most devout seekers who change their life and try to change their world, ala Shane Claiborne and the New Monastics? And how ""big"" is their movement? I think that's impossible to say. I'm also uncomfortable with calling it a movement. Some say it's the ""true church"" all along. But I do know it will always be smaller, quieter, and in the background of things, much like those who work in the occult. 

I was really interested in your question because I consider myself a Christian mystic. I was raised Christian and I see where I am now (in this subreddit, thinking about these things) as a direct result of where I started, but certainly very far from where I came from. If you'd like feel free to PM me, I'd be happy to share resources or talk about those ideas, we could probably relate."

A comment on the UI: if I have a drug selected in a given row and then try to change that drug, hitting enter or tab does not seem to update the output, I have to actually click the drug name from the autocomplete drop-down.

Our programs in those areas are far from universal, and don't do nearly enough.

Ingenium21,AskMen,1389060959.0,"I was in a 6+ year relationship and I'm still trying to get over it.  Sadly, as much as I wish I was done with her, these things take time.  Every day and every night she creeps into my thoughts.  However, I've noticed that the thoughts hurt less and less now.  To the point that I now just feel numb.  I still miss her constantly, but what she did to me was pretty unforgivable, that and she is pretty unrepentant about it so I don't see us ever really patching things up.  These days I'm mostly focusing on myself.  Since we split I've accomplished things I never thought possible and I'm very proud of that fact, and I know, that one day, someone will come along that appreciates me for me. 

To answer your question, there is no set time span where one wakes up one day and goes ""woo hoo! I'm over her!"".  We all handle our grief differently, and it is going to take time. The possibility that your bf isn't over his last ex does exist.  But that shouldn't be a total dealbreaker.  If he is still pining over his ex and contantly checks her facebook, then yeah, that's a dealbreaker, ladies. But if he appreciates what he has in front of him and is slowly realizing that he is better without her, then I wouldn't call that a dealbreaker."

There really only were a couple of ways to defeat the UK: starve them of resources (battle of the Atlantic), or get air supremacy (and  then use that to also get naval supremacy) over the English Channel (Battle of Britain) and invade (Operation Sea Lion).

You've never been in American coal country, have you? We are completely devoid of culture.

&gt; The adoption of Christianity was hardly immediately and or voluntary

The modern evidence suggests otherwise. Mexican religion has far fewer native relics than you would expect for a culture that was struggling with identity. 

&gt; It was precisely the unusualness of European warfare that drove many to support the Spanish - scorched earth policies and siege warfare were largely alien to Mesoamerica. 

European power never seemed to impress other native peoples elsewhere in the world. Somehow the North American Indians managed a better fight. The Zulus, too. Hell, by the time the Ethiopians ran into the Europeans they were facing machine guns. For that matter, lots of people resisted the Mongols when they invaded Europe employing a different approach to war.

There's no way the Spanish win that war without a ready willingness but at least some of their local allies. European warfare might have been advanced, but it wasn't magical. An organizational view better explains the Spanish conquest of Mexico."

I lived in Michigan with my mom for a while and I've seen how long it takes bodies of water to freeze over. 

The water at the bottom of the lake will stay at a warm temperature even when the air above it drops to below freezing.

Mephrael,AskReddit,1389061327.0,"All modern (read aircraft made in the last 30+ years) have built in fire detection and extinguishing kit. Basically, if the engine pops a gasket and bursts into flame, a numbered indicator for the engine lights up right next to a button that deploys the fire retardant material. 

I've just looked at the article in question, and in 1989, a 737-400 should still have had the flight engineer present in the cockpit, along with pilot and first officer, so there should have been almost no guesswork in knowing which engine had failed. Even if the pilot and first officer were unfamiliar with specific quirks of the variant, the flight engineer should have been fully trained and rated for the flight. 

You've spiked my curiosity though, I'm currently hunting for a copy of the actual crash report to verify details. Please stand by.

Edit: The crash report is available here: http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/4-1990%20G-OBME.pdf and only mentions a fire indicator seconds before crash on the number 1 (ie. left side) engine while requesting more power at around 3000ft. I may also need to retract my comment above in relation to flight engineers. It seems the 400 variant may have been one of the first to no longer have a flight engineer on-board as standard.

Edit part Deux: It's actually a fascinating read for those that are inclined. It seems that they never actually activated the fire suppression gear on either engine, and the cause seems to be constant interruptions from ATC and/or crew during attempts to complete the engine fail/engine fire process.

It was just consistent volume that got me down near 1:30, and a psychological switch that got me under. Since you already run 19:42, I think your best bet is to keep the volume consistent. 60-70k might be a little low. I think 80k would probably be adequate but not excessive, although I am not you.

If you're going to do a workout and you're not currently doing one, I'd introduce exactly one per week: A half-marathon pace tempo run. My favorite way to do this is to start around HMP (you can start a little slower at the beginning of the season if you're out of shape) for 4-6 miles (er, sorry, 6.5-10 kilometers) and then pick it up for a mile or two at the end. Alternatively, you can go for 4-6 miles and then end at a track and do 2 x 1600 or 4 x 800 or even just some strides. Something to go fast at the end.

They both have their pros and cons.

Battle Royale is much bloodier, action packed and just gets straight down to the point, but sadly the attempt at creating backstories (or any kind of character plot) is somewhat poor.

The Hunger Games creates the characters well, spends more times going into backstories and plots, sets up the premise, and actually really has the story reflect on how society is/where it's heading. But sadly it's not as appealing for gore fans out there.

I'm referring to the films and the films only here, as I haven't read any of the books, but they're both good in their own right, and people need to stop being up on the high horse with 'oh Hunger games is shit because it copied Battle Royale'."

Every room reeked of pot, spilled beer, and rotting food, and I was so miserable. Our house was so notorious that my naïve, straight-laced boss once tried to buy weed off me; he could actually smell it biking by on the way to work. Don’t get me wrong: My housemates were sweet, good-natured people for the most part; it just wasn’t a good fit and I should have known better.

There is a second sticker for giving my a blowjob without being told to, so she could potentially get two at once that way.

I suppose this is not the same as having a requirement. Making it a requirement would be far too difficult since I don't usually stop after the first time I cum during sex. The second or third is more common, the sixth is probably my record. After a while it just seems to vanish on it's own...

ARUKET,truegaming,1389061692.0,"I wholeheartedly agree with everything OP said.

Yeah there are a few odd sheep who don't like to play Mario games for whatever reason and that's cool, but the main Mario franchise is one of those few places where game design really shines and puts everything else in the backseat. It's not like the AC games where they really are all extremely similar except for Black Flag, and new elements in each game are anomalies unique to the game in which they appear. They're not seamlessly integrated like in Mario. Revelations is that game with the weird bombs that no one uses. 3 is the game with all kinds of weird economy shit put into it that no one uses. I hate using this word, but they're gimmicks. Mario doesn't really have gimmicks. New elements feel natural, like they belong.

It doesn't feel weird to put the Mario franchise in new scenarios like in space or in a haunted mansion. And that's due to 30 years of brand recognition and sort of numbing us to the idea that Mario can have karting games and party games and RPGs. There are a lot of reasons that Mario can get away with all this weird shit but that's a whole different topic entirely."

ProffieThrowaway,AskReddit,1389061915.0,"My mom and grandma required my hair to be that long (no, they weren't religious) until I was 18. It was awful. It got in the way, I never learned to style it because it was too long for most styles, and people constantly tried to cut it, light it on fire, and put stuff in it. 

Very few people have hair this long of their own choice--it's usually a religious thing. You cannot easily wear it in a bun onto a plane, because it will get your head searched at the security point (I was told recently to thin my hair by the TSA because it is thick and I had it pulled back, wtf. It's shortish now.) Yes I suppose you could put it in a bun at the gate but that is time consuming--far more so than for a normal haired person. 

For all your people saying that you should have cut it or put stuff in it--you people were the bane of my childhood. I didn't want to be a freak, I just had to be. When people did shit like that *I* got punished for it. My parents constantly told me I should take better care of my hair and marveled and how I couldn't tell if somebody was screwing with the end of it--well I couldn't. It was 4 feet away from my head, what did they expect? I grew up to be terrified of fire because of how many times classmates and people I played with in our neighborhood would light my hair on fire and think it was hilarious. I got to walk around with uneven hair if any of the little assholes cut a piece off because my mom and grandma would not let me even it out. 

Even as an adult if I see one of those jerks they will still tell other people, as if it is funny, that I used to wipe my ass with my hair as a kid. It was always clean, unless they had put shit (literally) in it. 

tl;dr--having hair this long is awful, nobody should be forced into it."

I'd say that if they don't want to visit because of the reputation, that's a negative thing.

I think a great compromise for yourself would be taking a semester off. If you took this semester off, would you still be able to graduate the following semester?

My parents said they'd never cloth diaper, became no big deal when I told them to buy their own disposables and they didn't want to. they smell less when pooped in and cost me barely anything because I bought them used

There is one single con I can think of. Sometimes I forget to finish washing my diapers and my son has to wait an hour or so for a clean diaper. He doesn't care.

A friends ex girlfriend got done dealing speed and somehow ended up with no conviction(because she paid lots for a lawyer to represent her) and got a visa to work in Japan(with less time between offence and visa) so I guess if this keeps me from working in the UK it shows a severe failure in the legal system!

chilichickify,Aquariums,1389062291.0,"Thanks so much for your input. 

We've got lilies and some other aquatic plants growing in the upper pond so I think we may be covered in terms of plants. I'll need to figure out what type the other plants are, but it appears to me that the fish use it's roots as a sort of hiding spot now that it's a bit colder. I was considering getting some pond snails and possibly tadpoles to assist in cleaning the algae from the lower pond, but I still need to research that aspect.

I think considering we only have two small fish (just under 1ft each) they won't need to be fed as much as if we had several full grown Koi. I still need to figure out what type they are exactly.

Our first steps will be testing the water and cleaning the larger debris and gunk. I'm not sure what's in our water, but we pull our water from a well and there aren't fields around us so I'm not sure how much chemicals will be present. 

I definitely don't want crystal clear water, I at least recall that from my marine science studies. We've got about a foot of algae in the lower pond right now and that's the main thing I want cleaned out, not so much the floating particles and a bit on the bottom."

orangejake,Magicdeckbuilding,1389062328.0,"Before even looking at your deck in-depth, I notice you have a lot of 2 ofs, and almost no playsets.  On the sidebar there's a link to an article called [The Rule of 9](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/magic-the-classroom-the-rule-of-nine/).  The TL;DR of it is to try to pick 9 non-land cards that work really well together, and have 4 of each as the core of your deck.  Looking at your list, you have 22 different non-land cards, and no playsets of any of them.  This doesn't mean you'll lose all your matches or anything, but by focusing on 9 cards, and running 4 of each, you improve your deck's consistency by a lot, which is good.

Next, it seems like your deck focuses on enchanting creatures.  In the current standard, this isn't a super competitive deck because of how easy it is for you to get 2 for one'd (if they destroy/bounce an enchanted creature, they destroy 2 permanents for the price of 1 spell).   All this means is you're not going to play a tier 1 deck, which is fine.

Finally, you're running an enchantment deck.  Run ethereal armor as a 4 of.  It's easily the best available card for enchantment aura decks in current standard.  You can also look into things like fabled hero, but just make sure you run ethereal armor.

Specific cards I think may be of iffy quality:

TofuRobber,Foodforthought,1389062480.0,"I don't think anybody is really arguing that MIT openly siding with Aaron's case would have stopped Aaron from his suicide. What they are arguing is that MIT should feel bad for what they did or not do. It may have or may not have stopped the suicide but they could have done something, could have not gone against their stance of neutrality and actively supported the prosecution (anything that is for one side is already against neutrality, no matter how small).

With MIT's support in Swartz case it is possible that many others, people with less power would come to his side. MIT students and faculty were hesitant to even voice their opinion because they didn't feel safe. MIT wasn't going to help Swartz and he was a genius, a proponent of open access, somebody who shared the same ideal on which MIT stands for. Sure he wasn't a student but that doesn't mean that they couldn't or shouldn't lend support. So, if MIT wasn't willing to stand up for somebody of significance what kind of person of normal standing was going to criticize the government when it could easily be them who stood in Swartz position. Would MIT stand up for them, just because they're a student? 

Possible scenario: MIT openly supports Swartz -&gt; public outcry about Swartz treatment -&gt; Swartz understands that he's not alone and there are many people on his side -&gt; Swartz does not feel helpless -&gt; Swartz does not kill himself

Of course that's all hypothetical and nobody can say what would have happen if MIT did lend him open support but the truth remains that MIT could have done something but they didn't. They can't claim ignorant because they were actively involved in the case. Are they responsible for his death? No, but they should feel bad that they could have done something and didn't. Did they do the wrong thing? Not necessarily because right and wrong are subjective but someone died and they can't say that they didn't try to help him when they could have and knew about his case."

To supplement my wife's income, I took a part-time job at Auto Zone delivering parts (I work the commercial and retail counters when not on deliveries). I've been there two years, and there are now only four people that were there when I was hired.

New hires require training. Product knowledge, company computer system knowledge, customer service in line with company policy. New hires are a drag because they require assistance and slow everyone else down, but it's part of the entry-level world.

I've managed shops, I've swept the floors, I've mopped up the puke from kids who's moms let them have too much candy in the car.

I've worked in pizza joints.

Not_a_ZED,pcmasterrace,1389062650.0,"DRM can become annoying for people who pay for games, and can't access them sometimes because they can't access the internet during a storm, or are using a laptop somewhere without an internet connection, or other reasons. However, if you pirate the game, you never will run into those problems because you install a crack once, and you're good. It's easier to get away with stealing some games than it is to buy one and play it without an internet connection.

I've bought a lot of games on steam, but didn't originally set it up for offline mode. The first time I lost my internet connection (due to a issue the isp was having) I couldn't play anything without first logging into steam, even though I had 50+ games on my PC, and my computer was is only source of entertainment. With no internet, and no games, the most fun thing I have to do is folding my laundry.

What I did was consume all guides and tutorials I could from the official forums, and watch my replays after some matches. Also, I practiced on skirmishing against the easy AI, and I only went to the multiplayer after I could at least beat it at Highway to Oslo consistently. 

The secret to enjoying Wargame is unfortunately to play it with friends. I didn't have any friend that played it, so I eventually met people in the game. Once in a while I would meet a decent, friendly or helpful person, and would ask to add them ingame. I have maybe 30-50 people in there, and around 4 or 5 actually became buddies, which I talk to regularly, in and out of the game. We have a blast playing it everytime, winning or losing.

Me and my group ALWAYS try to help beginners, saying they can ask questions and giving tips if they show interest. Unfortunately it seems this behavior is not very common and many beginners actually assume a stance of ""I don't need you to tell me what to do, shut up"". But we still provide all help we can. We lost several matches while we got a beginner to play with us.

It wasn't immediately stimulating in the way porn is, but it sure stimulated the imagination.

To that end, you cannot get more efficient than satisfying arbitrarily meaningless goals with zero effort.

I would hope that one axiom we could agree to is that any health care system worth discussing would address a meaningful goal.

&gt;Otherwise, do you disagree that altering health care goals until health care is no longer optimized for moots the measure of relevant efficiency?

I don't know what you mean by this exactly, but ""optimize"" can mean different things. For example, if one were to truly optimize health care from a strict utilitarian philosophical perspective, one would favor killing people to harvest their organs for the use of terminally ill people in need of transplants, something which I would hope we could both agree to be morally undesirable. What definition would you express as the optimal set of goals of a healthcare system? Mine would depend on the society in question, but obviously a society that enacted a strictly free-market capitalist healthcare system is very different from ours. Given the values of most neoliberal western societies, I would say the optimal set of goals would be to provide the best possible standard of health care that could be made available to absolutely everyone, and then allowing people who want a better standard of care to pay their own way for it."

&gt; I've been in a cave every since I witnessed the most heart breaking loss in my life time! I was 9 years old when the Chiefs loss to the Bills in the AFC championship game I remember jumping on my bike riding down the street just crying uncontrollably until I found a bench in a park to sit on and sulk. Now I sulked on a bar stool drowning my pain in Jack Daniels and Budweiser thinking about how this happened. 
&gt; 
&gt; Alex Smith is exactly who we thought he was! Give Alex an o-line and a few weapons and he will win you games while not making many mistakes. Alex is worth every bit of two 2nd round picks and for the first time in almost 20 years I will be buying a Chiefs quarterback's jersey and wearing it proudly (from a Chinese website of course at a discounted price)!!
&gt; 
&gt; This loss falls on the defense and not just the secondary it falls on the entire defense. The same defense with 5 pro bowlers and the same defense that ranked number 1 for half of the season. ROBERT ""Bob"" SUTTON the leader of the defense and the mind behind the horrible schemes deserves 100% of the blame for this loss! 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't care that Andy Ried only ran the ball 10times in the second half or that the offense didn't put up as many points Andy &amp; Alex gave Bob 41 points he deserved to give them and us a win!!! Bob Sutton as a Defensive Coordinator was an experiment he has been a great positions coach in this league for many years but he showed this year that he doesn't have the ability to make adjustments. The chiefs players weren't exposed the scheme was! Those players when put in the right position are the best at what they do and that secondary is still littered with talent however when you have a coach who refuses to adjust his scheme even after it's being raped on national tv he must go!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Yes before you guys start making the comments Kendrick Lewis needs to leave town ASAP take Robinson and Demps with you but if they aren't on the same plane as Sutton what's the point? Bob will come back next year running the same weak man coverage and using the same telegraphed blitzing. Get used to it folks we are back to the early 2000's good offense and bad defense (not because of the players!). "

LukeVTruth,changemyview,1389062972.0,"One thing to consider is the reason a lot of people find stereotypes to be mostly true is that they specifically look for people to fit them and when they find those people its what sticks out in their mind. For example, i remember going into a kfc a few days ago and there was one black guy in there and my friend was like ""haha of course a black guy is at kfc"". Well, if you think about it, 13% of the U.S. population is black, and everyone else in the kfc at the time wasn't black. Even though proportionately blacks were underrepresented based on population my friend still made this comment because seeing a black guy enjoy fried chicken fits a stereotype and sticks out. 

If I were you, I'd keep this in mind. I'll admit I used to kind of believe most stereotypes were true until I started to look for those who didn't fit the stereotype. Once you start doing this, you may not believe every stereotype is mostly true."
ZippityZoppity,DebateReligion,1389062979.0,"&gt;Babies who are born deaf 'babble' and show all the stages of learning sign-language as hearing babies do spoken language. People like Helen Keller become incredibly productive and creative writers despite a severe poverty of stimulus. There is a huge amount of evidence language for one is very innate.

Notice I said ""language"" - not audible communication. *Language*, as in the arbitrary assignment and agreement of symbols as a form of communication, *would not exist in a social vacuum*. There would be no need for it. Who are you going to communicate with?

&gt;This is highly disputed.

Let's tie this in with my previous response. Imagine that there is a conscious being, but all of their sensory faculties are muted. Somehow, they're still aware that they exist even though they have nothing to reference themselves to. How would they discover mathematics? How could they refer to concepts if they have no way of communicating things? What would they consider, if they couldn't see, hear, nor touch? Would the concept of ""2"" have any meaning to them? I don't think so. All of these are framed around real world things. Even if you raise the abstraction to levels that disconnect from reality, you the thinker are still grounded in reality.

&gt;And most or I dares all all of our scientific theories directly contradict what we observe in real life e.g a lighter object thrown off a height falls slower than a heavier object. Quantum Mechanics, Relativity, even evolution in a large sense are not framed around things we observe. Observations can trigger ideas but we seek explanations for things using our imagination and these ideas, not observations.

No, we've empirically proven that the acceleration of gravity is the same. Objects don't start off the same, but the initial velocity of objects is different from the *acceleration*. We've observed quantum mechanics - and in fact we can't accurately calculate things at the quantum level *without* observing it.

Lastly, evolution is most definitely dependent on things we observe. Darwin saw with his own eyes that finches had differently shaped beaks to serve the organism for different purposes - that was the *groundwork* for building up the theory of evolution. From there, we were able to make the connect with genetic substrates as the framework for evolution so that we could understand and *observe* how it changes. We extrapolate how animals acquired specific traits, and we can't say with 100% certainty that we know that's how it came about, but we can be fairly sure given the current standard of evidence of roughly how it came to be."

What I would suggest is you start to expose her to the harsh reality of life, that people are sexual beings and not everyone is made equally. You're a guy, and you have needs. If she cannot 100% satisfy those needs then you're more then entitled to satisfy them yourself. You control your life and your destiny, nobody else. Anyone that tells you how to live your life (and isn't a parent) can go elsewhere. 

I realize this may be your first gf, but consider it a learning experience. Many of us (including myself) have experienced something similar to this many years ago. I recall one time an ex gf of mine in COLLEGE actually said she felt bad about having sex and wanted to wait till marriage (after had been having sex for well over two years). Suffice to say, that relationship did not last. You will learn as you go along, but do not become too emotionally taxed into someone who is irrational no matter how much you think you love them.

Two lanes going up on the right, one coming down on the left. We were behind a Prius and my friend's mom pulled out into the middle lane to pass. Decided not to and pulled back behind the car. About ten seconds later a semi comes around the mountain in the far left lane and there's a Ford F-250 going the wrong way down the mountain in that middle lane.

I'm not looking for help on how to dress *extremely* well. I'm not looking for help on how to immerse myself in male fashion culture. I'm looking for the bare-bones basics. I'm looking for a guide to not making a fool of myself in front of people who know how I'm supposed to be dressed.

I don't have hours upon hours to sit staring in front of my screen studying clothing. I don't want to browse MFA until I'm used to it.

I do that with a few subs already... and it's enough of a time sink on the subreddits I actually enjoy browsing for long stretches of time, naturally.

I'll give you an analogy. I spend a lot of time looking at smartphones, and shit. Not because a guide told me, but because I like doing it.

You like figuring out what clothes look good. Good on you. Let's hypothetically say you don't really know much about phones. But you want to hear the basics. You come to me for advice.

How would you feel if my advice was, ""start browsing /r/android, stick around for hours at a time, and keep going until you have a good idea what you're looking at."" And how would you feel if I told you that was step one of eight?

You might want to know a little more than what phone you should buy. So I'll give you the general distinction between the different OSses, manufacturers, features... Actually explain the basics to you, rather than tell you to get a taste for yourself.

That's what I want. I'm slowly trying to gain a taste for gaining a taste, but short of that... give me an actual crash course."

iLoveMuse,xxfitness,1389063263.0,"For reference: I'm 5'2.5"", and for most of my life floated between 120 and 135. The periods when I weighed 128+ could usually be attributed to snacking and extra meals, and even though I did cardio regularly, it couldn't offset those calories. When I finally got serious about fitness (instead of doodling around doing home exercise DVDs until burning out from boredom), I weighed 130 and was about 23% body fat. My goal % is ""when I'm happy with the way I look,"" which could mean as low as 14%, but hopefully not.

To answer your question, all it took for me was consistent calorie tracking and exercise. I got down to 21% from doing that and Insanity 6 days a week, but I wasn't making the progress I wanted because it was making me too hungry and I would end up erasing the calorie deficit I wanted to create. So I switched to SS, then moved on to the Texas Method, and have been alternating between cutting and recomping. I'm much more pleased with my aesthetic results, and feel strong and capable instead of tired all the time. I'm around 19% BF now. 

So yes, I have needed to stay on top of my nutrition and exercise. If I didn't count calories, I would be doing silly things like eating when I'm not hungry (I used to be a serial snacker). Honestly, though, using MFP daily has become such a habit that I don't mind anymore. I'd even say I find it refreshing to know how much I'm eating; it gives me a sense of control. I would also consistently fail to meet my protein goals if I didn't keep track. Sticking to my lifting plan isn't hard anymore either, because it allows me to justify overeating on occasion (one-day bulks, anyone?), and a variety of other reasons (sense of progress, aesthetics, functional strength, bragging rights, etc).

Case in point: what if I believe God chooses people conditionally, but that people's faith (or lack thereof) actually comes about because of a number of factors, many of which are outside that individual's choice/control, but also not directly determined by God?

That is neither hyper-individualistic Arminianism (our own individual choice is the be-all-and-end-all) or the unconditional-election Calvinism (God uses no priorities in his election that we are able to influence at all). Rather, it says many factors converge to bring about our faith, and God elects is accordingly because of how His character &amp; priorities work. But we alone do not ""cause"" ourselves to believe, strictly, in this view.

Such a Christian would be neither Calvinist nor Arminian.

As such, a Christian can be Calvinist, Arminian, or neither -- all of which without being aware of the terms."

But the size makes a great multi-purpose brush for all sorts of other things like contouring, applying concealer, etc. I read reviews from people who say they now own a 217 for everything under the sun. Now I want to know, would it be a good idea to use the 217 for detailed eye stuff and buy some E25's for other, messier jobs to save money? Would the E25 be worth it?"

VoxMeretricis,AskReddit,1389063561.0,"A very common misconception, but actually witchcraft persecution came much, much later - the 11th and 12th centuries did not see witchcraft persecution. You only begin to see persecution of heretics around the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, with the foundation of the Inquisition (which was more or less unconcerned with witchcraft) in 1231 - it takes a few centuries for witchcraft to become a concern. Also, it was much more difficult to be burned as a witch than most people believe. In fact, it commonly took years - sometimes a lifetime - of accusations and conflict within the community for someone to be tried as a witch, and not every trial resulted in an execution. Witch ""crazes"" like what happened at Salem were exceptional and are not representative of the actual phenomena. "

Rossegut,halo,1389063582.0,"Read the script, here are my thoughts:

* The script makes it sound like there's a lot of gore and gruesome death scenes. Good--Alex Garland hit the nail right on the head with that one. Every time someone was killed, they were killed in a way that it showed Covenant superiority. Plasma grenades blowing people apart, energy swords slicing unsuspecting soldiers in half, charged plasma pistols melting marines--Garland captured humanity's disadvantage perfectly with the violence.

* The dream sequences were unecessary. They were shallow and tried way too hard to build MC up as this war hero filled with remorse. I think the opening scene with the buildings and his later line ""Why? I do."" where he blames himself for the Fall of Reach are perfect for establishing character, everything else was forced and emotionless.

* Movie totally fucks up everything about the Flood. In the movie, Chief and the marines encounter the Flood for the first time inside the Silent Cartographer--this is an absolute step down from the suspenseful, eerie atmosphere of the swamp in the game's *343 Guilty Spark.*

* The Flood emerge from facilities underneath the Pillar of Autumn's crash site. Compared to the game this is sounds out of place and just feels weird to envision. Again, they should have stuck with the swamp.

* The movie merges the Library and Halo's control room into one facility. I could understand this, but if they removed the shitty dream sequences they might not have had to make this move. Not a big deal but I think it could have been avoided.

* Cortana disappears. The fuck? In the game she notes how much information she absorbs through the control room, but in the movie she literally goes crazy with it and bails on the Chief for what felt like a half hour of screen time.

* Captain Keyes is no longer a proto-gravemind, he's a tentacle-wielding zombie who tries to sway chief to join the Flood. This is lame. I would have preferred to see Chief find Keyes's infected body, reach inside and pull the dogtags/transponder out. Instead he found Keyes on the Autumn's bridge with tendrils whipping around. Sounds more like Doc Ock than the horrifying proto-gravemind from the game.

* Apart from that, I was very impressed with the rest of the screenplay. Everything pre-Flood had me thinking, ""holy shit, this is amazing."" Garland worked in some dialogue from the game, material from the game's novelization, and painted great scenes. Ignoring all the things I mentioned as cons, the movie was an *excellent* adaptation of Halo."

I agree entirely.

Chill with the rest of that shit. 99.9% of people love their kids and don't try to actively hurt them. Anywhere in the world. Lots of kids get hurt though. Separate point entirely because I'm not saying denying your kid a hair style is akin to cutting off their arms or some grand emotional trauma. Just that my original understanding of the concept is something I consider a larger problem than just controlling a child's hair color, because I didn't consider one might place that much value on the hair itself - rather that they'd be using it as a means for control, indicative of that larger problem I talked about. Because... as you said, hair is trivial."

Obviously I didn't get to talk to the CEO himself, but the people in that office who field those emails *for* the CEO are interested in retaining business and mitigating bad PR, and they're actually empowered to make things happen (unlike a lot of customer service reps).

In psychology, you'd learn that men describe themselves as lonely far more than women.  Even as a married man, we can feel like there's nowhere we can go with certain feelings or thoughts, due to our role.  Being a man can be a very lonely existence."

Because he uses the same actors for multiple characters/generations, the elements of plot in the film can be very difficult to follow, but that doesn't really seem to be the point. It's a great film to just let yourself become totally immersed in, reacting naturally to each shot. I think some of my favorite moments are the times when Terekhova is looking into the camera. Her sadness and exhaustion is so wonderfully tangible! Also, [this fucking poem](http://mhsteger.tumblr.com/post/734803555/the-poem-first-dates-by-arseny-tarkovsky-born) is used perfectly!

It's really a flawed theory though, as the most typical reaction to stressors from outside your social sphere is to retreat into the sphere, especially when the stress is from a threatening source, such as an unfamiliar 'Alpha male' or someone aggressively 'peacocking'."

This starts out a conversation based on the persons interests. They'll feel more at ease/eager to talk  discussing something they like instead of something that comes out of nowhere. Also you have a better chance at prolonging the conversation that way!

As a feral worlder, you probably have no thoughts of life ever changing. Most DH players that dont know the universe make the mistake of unintentionally metagaming by trying to -improve- the Imperium of man.

You truly believe that technology is controlled by the Machine spirits and the divine will of the emperor. You know that each life you take is destined, because Your God has deemed them unworthy. 

Your art is sacred, and what you do is more holy than any arbiter, maybe even some clerics! (That is a borderline heretical inner thought.)

If it's just in passing, I'd go through the site. Just a nice hello, mention that your profiles seem to have a lot in common (Hopefully they do? Please do read her profile - it's just courteous), that kind of thing. Then ask about grabbing a coffee/drinks depending on what her profile preferences indicated, if at all. Don't mention seeing her around, because that could sound a bit strange with improper phrasing.

If you frequent the same areas or something like that, try smiling at her one day (an easy, friendly smile), or comment on something innocuous. If she smiles back or says something back, then you could try for a hello, or an approach/strike up a conversation if you feel brave enough. If you're both at that coffee shop, try to get behind her in line. If you're both at the gym, it's a bit more difficult to start a conversation, but definitely not impossible (usually on the way in or out at first).

I wouldn't do both at the same time as that might also be misinterpreted. Just go with whichever approach makes the most sense and allows you to show that you might have more in common.

My credit score tells no one anything about the charities I like to support, the friends I help out, and the way I save money up for big item purchases rather than spending 10-20% more by using a credit card. My life is cheaper, cleaner, and less-cluttered because honestly, in the end, I give fuck-all about credit, but serious all, about how people show their generosity (or lack thereof) to the people around them.

FTR, my credit score is fine, but I've literally been through the ringer twice due to account(s) being hacked (1997) and then by a scam system set up by a bogus collections agency (2001). The amount of bogus information, the amount of cost and time needed to fix something I continue to find I rarely need or use, turned me off to the whole system.

phx-au,battlefield_4,1389064168.0,"&gt; Your dealing with the difference between your industrial contracts and actual consumer law.

My point is that even with objective measurements for defects, it is extremely rare that developers are sued (the majority of large scale software implementations are delivered with known defects).

With a consumer product, we have to show that the issues that BF4 has been having are actually defects. Then we have to demonstrate the defects prevent the game being ""fit for purpose"" or whatever your local wording is. Then, maybe, 5 years down the track, EA will cut you a cheque for $15.

Whinging that the tickrate that isn't as high as CS, or that the network sync isn't as perfect as theoretically possible, doesn't help, when in general it works fine and is fun. Consumer law doesn't guarantee perfection. I'm pretty much over this discussion - every time I get on this sub, its another bunch of entitled gamers demanding perfection.

foxesforsale,magicTCG,1389064192.0,"Start with a very short, but entertaining anecdote about the game. I suggest a story-fied version of the end of a match, finished with something like ""...and all this happened in a small game store last friday night. Welcome to the world of Magic the Gathering"". Hook them in with something.

Don't explain the game's rules so much. someone who doesn't know it won't take the effort to really focus on technical details of a game. All you really need is something like ""Magic is a competitive, tactical card game, based around the idea that the players are powerful wizards duelling. Your deck of cards represents the plethora of spells you can cast, from summoning creatures to casting fireballs to mind controlling magic, which are your tools to help you defeat your opponent.""

Then I think focus on what Magic forces you to use, and what skills you develop to become a better player. Opportunity cost is a big one - your deck can only have 60 cards with a limit of 4 each, but there are thousands of cards in existence. Some cards work really well together, but it may be too hard to draw them all in one hand, so it's all about balancing what tools you bring. It's a bit about resource management - when you can only spend 5 mana, and you have 7 different options for spending that in your hand, what's the choice that will bring you closest to victory? Almost just as importantly, how well can you learn to predict what your opponent will do, and use that to your advantage? Problem solving - everyone at your local store is using a particular playstyle, can you build a deck that can take advantage of that and emerge victorious? There's so much to talk about.

I'd leave out fussing about mana colours. Again, the focus of your talk shouldn't be about the rules of the game, but why playing it is fun, why is it challenging, how does it make people who play it better.

Good luck!"

VoxMeretricis,AskReddit,1389064327.0,"Based on a subject near and dear to my heart: the accepted necessity of using physical violence to reinforce social hierarchies. Basically the idea that there is rightful and divine structure to society in which superiors are expected to reinforce the boundaries and teach lessons to their subordinates, and that at times that means violence must be used. What's most interesting to me is not necessarily that those in power thought that it was legitimate to use violence to maintain their power, but that those who had violence inflicted on them thought it was legitimate as well. You can see Guibert of Nogent's fascinating autobiography, written in 1115, for his understanding of the violence his tutor inflicted on him when he was a young student. Hannah Skoda's work on domestic violence in the Middle Ages is another great resource for how violence worked in the household. 

It's basically a totally different understanding of how society ought to be structured that would be anathema to people today - that not only is inequality totally acceptable, but that maintaining that inequality even violently is both a necessary and righteous work. "

There was a comic where Xavier theorizes that the only way to kill Wolverine is decapitation, but even then if you bring the head back to the body he says that it would probably heal back up.

As /u/DiogenesKuon said, he has regenerated from a single cell (in Civil War). I believe they said it was a cell of his brain, so going by that his head would grow a new body and his old body wouldn't regenerate.

Going out for dinner somewhere that's even just $15 a plate could be the difference between eating well and ramen for a week in a lot of budgets. I will always offer to pay my way, but and I do like to be the one to leave the tip (but that's just because I know I tend to tip better than most people!).

Edit: I realize that I tend to treat it exactly the way I do with my two best female friends that I've known for 20 years: sometimes I let them treat, sometimes I treat.

Outcast is a linear story where each level is connected. It's a playable novel to Academy's choose-your-own-adventure.

Gameplay-wise: Single saber only, so main choice is between stances. Aside from that, guns play a much bigger part. Force powers are automatically improved at that start of each new level, rather than deciding which powers to put points into.

Multiplayer is still very similar, Academy just has more variance with having single/dual/staff sabers. Academy has Siege mode, Outcast has Holocron (ie Juggernaut from Halo). IMO, Outcast's maps were better. Of course, Academy looks prettier though."

JustinJamm,askashittydoctor,1389064596.0,"While someone can perhaps give you general advice on cough-drop-inhalation, keep in mind that it's actually different for every person. Nobody can make ""inhalation-dietary"" decisions for you: it's your body, and you have unique needs &amp; tolerances, just like everybody else does.

Gradual experimentation can tell you what works for your body. Just don't inhale every kind of cough drop at once -- if something went wrong, you won't know which drop-type was the culprit. So only snort one at a time -- or, at least one one *type* of cough drop at a time. But you can inhale more types at once as you verify which ones are definitely okay for you.

Eventually, you may discover you can inhale far more types at once than you ever expected. But keep pacing yourself and only try new kinds one at a time. (It's easy to forget this principle at later stages.)"

Hoppriori,AskHistorians,1389064622.0,"Thanks, that was great!

I wasn't aware that Hoplites were basically middle class yeomanry. I wasn't even aware Greece had a middle class (compared to other empires). That answers my question about the degree of Greece's economic development (so apparently not everyone in Greece was grovelling in mud huts... this is kind of the image one gets from a lot of historical textbooks that deal with older societies cynically).

I guess, to clarify my question, I'm also wondering how Greece compared to its contemporary, eastern rivals at the time. So, modern, popular portrayals in films depict the big bad Persian Empire invading Greece (which is basically a couple of temples and a few hundred hoplites, and nothing else), and the Persians are always pretty confident they can brush the Greeks aside, because Persia is a lion, Greece is a fly, etc.

Even if Greece's cultural contributions continue to be significant (and its venerated reputation is justified), how did the Greek states fare during their heyday? Was Greece perceived by other major empires as some sideshow backwater? Greece has been influential on western civilization historically, but what I am asking is more like, how influential was Greece in the world at its time? Even without military expansion, were Greek diplomacy, Greek culture, Greek trade, Greek statecraft, philosophy, etc. all respected and influential in the ancient world? Greece deserves recognition for its historical contributions, but was Greece a minnow in its time (just a collection of weird, little cities other nations generally ignored) or was it an active, influential player in the Mediterranean?"

Point is, WSU doesn't hit a ton of ranked teams, if any, but the Valley isn't a cakewalk.

Of course both of those lose to what we do today, which is harvest organs from the recently deceased or from volunteers with redundancies leading to, in the cases where transplant is possible, much closer to 2/2 results and bumping up the average for all cases irrespective of transplant availability.

This only makes sense if you think a person has only one organ that you could harvest. But you could easily save 6 people (2 who need partial liver transplants, one that needs a heart, one that needs lungs, two that need a kidney) for every person you killed for their organs.

We believe (or reject) based on a host of factors (life experiences, level of exposure to love, whether we hear &amp; understand the gospel, timing, etc), and God responds to that.

This is simply a third view -- neither Calvinist nor Arminian. I am not advocating this as doctrine, but merely trying to show a Christian can be ""neither one,"" and giving an example. That is all."

Instead, it's that he was convinced I would be perfect for his roommate - that the second we met, we would start dating and then end up together happily ever after.

tendorphin,schizophrenia,1389065041.0,"Not to my knowledge. Schizophrenia has a pretty high comorbidity rate (that is, you have schizophrenia along with other things, such as depression (which is the highest at about 50%) but as far as I know, there are no links between ADD/ADHD and schizophrenia as far as likelihood of getting it. There are, however, genetic links between them, and a single study showed that people with schizophrenia were likely to have been diagnosed as having ADHD when they were younger. This study has a problem with directionality, though, as they have no way of knowing if they actually had ADHD and then later were also diagnosed schizophrenic, or if the ADHD was a misdiagnosis of early symptoms of the schizophrenia (as scattered thoughts, lack of attention, and sometimes hyperactivity are all positive symptoms of schizophrenia). Also, left handed people are actually more likely to get ADHD as well as schizophrenia (by a pretty small percentage chance). This is probably due to the genetic link between schizophrenia and ADHD as the links may be carried on the same allele as left-handedness. 

Another thing to keep in mind, however, is that a certain doctor, Dr. Richard Saul, says that ADHD doesn't even exist as its own thing. He has a small following, and they claim that ADHD is just a set of symptoms of something bigger going on within the brain. The fact that ADHD has been linked with an undersized reticular formation (associated with focus, attention, and the ability to wake from sleep) and no other major symptoms appear in most people with ADHD. This is mostly due to the large number of kids being diagnosed with it. I agree that many, if not most, of the kids diagnosed with it don't actually have it, they just have lazy or overwhelmed, well-meaning parents, but I disagree that it isn't an actual disorder. I understand where he's coming from, but I don't think it's true. Sorry to assault you with a wall of text for such a simple question, haha, but I want you to be as informed as possible. If you have any other questions let me know. :)"
Just_Observational,AskReddit,1389065043.0,"You have to be careful, don't only hang out with your ex. It looks bad and and is hurting one of your feelings most likely, not always but usually.

But, she can't say what you can and cannot do. You cannot let her control you and if there is legitimately no feelings left between you two then you should be trasparent and hang out in at least a group of 3, or maybe more, maybe share your texts for a while until she's comfortable.

Another thing is do something as a group with both of them, if she has no feelings for you and you none for her, then your girlfriend will look, and likely feel quite silly. That is if there really is no feelings, if the ex cares for you then she may very well subtly try to make your gf look bad.

She can't make you stop, but if you respect her and put yourself in her position maybe you should work on a comprimise with her. She sounds jealous, a little bit is healthy but be careful and don't approach her on that. She is justified to be questioning you hanging out with your ex.

You sound reasonable, but make sure you're true to your word on the honesty and transparency.

Best of luck!

Also, this is completely my personal opinion. But a girl or partner or whatever TELLING someone what they can and cannot do is completely a selfish attempt at controlling the situation. You can ask someone not to do something, and let them know how important it is but don't try and control them. You'll both only end up unhappy."

If you don't purchase an item you have only helped someone else buy it. The sites that host these types of sales also WANT you to know this. The bidding wars on penny auction sites yield substantial profits for a seller. 

I followed a penny auction sited dedicated to firearms for a month as a point of interest. I collected their final sale price on every item, extrapolated an actual cost based upon average cost of each bid, and compared it to the actual retail price. I took the profits over retail (sometimes as high as 300%) and averaged them. The final figure was 160% final sale price based on retail. This one month saw a profit of roughly 250k USD ABOVE retail sales. That figure does not include profit from wholesale to retail.

What I think you should do, keeping in mind that you have this problem, is to make a dossier of your characters. Keep a record of their backstory, interests, even basic personality traits. Then give them common words and phrases. Then build up on that. Consider how they think, how they feel, how they speak, and how they physically behave and describe it in their dossier.

Next create a table of certain things happening. Write a line or two of dialogue for each character and how they would personally respond to each event or behavior. Refer back to the dossiers written. Eventually, you can develop a ""dialogue fingerprint"" of sorts that you can refer back to when trying to write and edit the dialogue for your characters.

Well, one time a few months ago, just as i was right about to fall asleep... it all just became far too real. Life ends. I have to be dead eventually. And suddenly... nothing mattered anymore. Everything became meaningless. Do achievements matter when you're dead? Nope. Things you've collected? nope. Money? nope. Good memories? nope. 

Even months later, i'm still trying to convince myself that anything matters, but all i can think is how shitty it is that we have to end up dead in the end... which negates everything you do. It doesn't matter how you live or how long if it's all to the same end, does it?

The problem with that is that a lot of African governments are corrupt and have failed to properly allocate foreign aid money in the past. It's hard to find a single sub-Saharan African government that has actually used its wealth to improve the fortunes of the poor and lift them out of poverty.

&gt;Where's the money for those welfare programs going to come from?

I decided to conduct a short survey, which displayed that people mostly browse /new/.   It's simply because /r/teenagers is such a fast-moving subreddit that posts on /hot/ aren't likely to have anyone active in the comments, despite a large number of upvotes.  This is why I think stickied threads aren't effective here.

&gt;Based on a continuous stream of posts to the megathreads that we've had over christmas and new years, along with the 50K celebration... no, they don't. We get far more responses when we sticky something as compared to when it's in /new/.

Just_Observational,AskReddit,1389065914.0,"Nothing. You have a long road ahead of you, but desperation is a good sign. It means at least you care enough that you want things to change.

Search yourself as to why you have no confidence. What is the easiest way to change what's bugging you most about yourself? Small steps and patience.

I suggest starting with yourself if you want a good relationship, finding out what you enjoy doing and if it's nothing then you're not trying enough new things, and probably not giving things much of a chance. Try some new things even if you have one or two hobbies. And if you've done everything on earth and are still unhappy I'd probably see a professional. You should learn to be at least content with who you are before you try to start any kind of relationship.

But most of us aren't so depressed that we can't enjoy anything, don't start something to be good at it, start it to learn it, and to practice it and see where it can take you.

You're probably awesome inside there, just take it slow and learn to work that desperate energy into postive energy. People admire those who overcome hardships.

Plus then you'll have an idea of what kind of girl you like most likely and will be able to start working towards actually dating someone.

Then just start striking up converasations. People are more interesting than most give credit for."

lavender-fields,againstmensrights,1389065935.0,"How can the misters be so wrong even when they're so close to being right?

Yes, abortion and birth control were initially part of a population control movement, and wealthy white people backed it with the hopes of encouraging poor brown people to have fewer children.  BUT when promoted as part of a population control narrative it wasn't about reproductive rights or women's choice at all.  It was still men telling them how and when to have children, just with a focus on keeping them not pregnant instead of telling them to have lots of babies.  It really wasn't until the Cairo Conference that the narrative of reproductive rights emerged, and birth control and abortion on the global stage stopped being about coercive population control and started being about women's choice.

So yes, the early birth control and abortion movements were backed by wealthy white people as part of what one could call a eugenics movement, although population control is a much more accurate name.  But that doesn't have any relation to the contemporary reproductive rights movement, and any feminist worth their salt is staunchly opposed to coercive population control because it denies women agency.  Obviously.

**tl;dr abortion and BC as population control definitely existed, but it is completely different from both reproductive rights and feminism**"

So many people still mistakenly think that German beer or Belgian beer (God help you if you say ""Belgium beer"") is the end-all.  Not true.  Germany has a small handful of styles, all lager and wheat.  Belgium has a few styles as well, typically focusing on ridiculously tasty yeast - Saison, Tripel, sours.

But the amount of breweries that produce *good* beer?  Small.  Most of what people buy in Europe comes down to mass produced lagers, just like in the US.  Now, granted, your standard Euro lager is more drinkable than your standard American lager.  But neither one is worth any money.

Instead, the US produces all the German styles, all the Belgian styles, all the UK styles, and then invented more styles, more varieties of hops, and cultured new yeasts.  The US is at the top of the beer world and you don't even need to look that far.  There's over 2000 breweries producing quality beer in the US.  You simply won't find that in Europe.  You simply can't try a new beer every day for years in Europe, but you can in the US."

To start with, the lore of the ME universe is so vast that I'm not sure how they'll be able to tell a coherent story without either dumbing it down into a generic space thriller or loading it with detail to the point where it's inaccessable to those unfamilar with the ME universe. Also as a practical matter there are a lot of elements (mass relays, husks, salarians, biotic powers) that could look horribly cheesy if done poorly. Don't get me wrong, it would be incredible if they could pull this off - I just have this sinking feeling that we may be looking down the barrel of a future episode of *How Did This Get Made?*

Here's what could happen: She fools around with that bum until she gets bored, or realizes that he can't and won't provide the stability she wants. Then she decides she wants you back. You make plenty of money and generally seem like a reasonable human being. 

You can't let her disrespect you like that! You deserve to be with a woman who wants to be with you and respects you, not one who uses you. And by the way, it is not your responsibility to 'protect' her from her ex. The fact that her parents have contacted you and are trying to get you to steal her back from him means that they are trying to use you too. In any relationship you want to be in, she is as concerned with your needs as you are with hers. That's not happening here. If you're always there to pick up the pieces for her no matter how she acts towards you, she won't respect and value you. You are a grown man, and you should accept nothing less than the utmost respect from any woman you are with, especially one you were considering marrying. You don't have to take this shit!

I think I can imagine how you feel, but you aren't beyond moving on and finding happiness. There's a whole world of women out there. You have to realize that most of them would be as damn lucky to be with you are you would be to be with them. Godspeed."

I respect the fact that you're being proactive about rehoming your dog, and I find your post to be very informative and address most main details. (You might want to add info about his activity/energy level, btw.)  

How familiar are you with the BSL in the area where you're moving? It's often limited to specific municipalities or counties. Are you sure there isn't a neighboring community that doesn't have BSL where you could live and still have a reasonable commute to work? 

Please understand that when you contact the rescues, they're going to want to know about your efforts and your willingness to continue to participate in the process of rehoming Steve. They will ask you lots of questions and they will offer numerous other suggestions that you may or may not have thought of. Hopefully you're willing to take their advice instead of just trying to pawn Steve off onto the rescue group.

Again, best of luck. "

masterheavyarms,teenagers,1389066211.0,Not taking it because of those damn faces. Only reason.
mundabit,birthcontrol,1389066212.0,"Some brands do what your brand does and just excludes the placebo pills. What you are doing is exactly the same in that for 7 days you don't take a pill containing hormones. Some people can get forgetful about how many of those 7 days have past, or after 7 days break from taking pills they forget to start taking pills again. To avoid this some brands have what is literally 7 tic-tacs in the packet so you can keep in the habit of taking a daily pill.

The problem I find is that now you have 7 extra, and unique pills in the packet that you can get mixed up and confused with. My brand contained placebo's but I never took them, I just took 7 days break from pills and then started a new pack.

the instructions on many brands say ""when you get your period, start taking pills from the [colour] section"" and on my brand (nordete) that meant taking an active pill on day 1 of my period. I thought this was the *only* way to do a period start. But I have seen brands that tell women to take a placebo pill on the first day of their period, so they don't actually start taking the birth control pills untill 7 days after their period has ended. I find this silly and questionable, and have checked with several doctors who all say its getting more common as it reduces side effects in the first few months, but it can be hella confusing for girls who are new to the pill to be taking a pill for 7 days, then be told its not the *real* pill.

Basicaly you can be taking monophasic pills two ways. a) when you open a new packet of pills, you start taking placebo's, then actives, then you open a new packet, take the placebo's (get a period) then move onto actives. b) You open a packet, take the active pills, then take the placebo's (get a period) then open a new packet and take the actives. 

I found option b to just be so much easier regardless of what brand I was on. My girlfriend is on a brand that uses option a, and its crazy confusing for her as she has never taken a pill and doesn't understand fertility and the pills mechanism of action, and she keeps falling asleep when I explain it because I'm boring."

Then, set a number of times that this is allowed to happen (say, ten) before the entity loses its privilege to submit new patents in perpetuity.

That way, the patent office can refuse vague patents, and if the patent seeker wants to challenge that, they need to be damn sure that they have their ducks in a row and the patent deserves to be granted."

The situation I proposed seemed the most logical to me because it seems the easiest to occur, many of the other ways I could interpret the events made the wife seem *really* forgetful as opposed to just mildly forgetful.

Here is my logic; In most multi-phasics the low dose pills are at the start of the month, which would mean the order is ""Placebo-Low dose-Medium-High-Placebo"" so in order to miss a low dose then realise ""2 weeks after the fact"" it must be toward the start of medium-dose week, But I get confused given OP also said that placebo week was ""last week"".

Dookiet,Libertarian,1389066925.0,"I was simplifying to make an easier point. But, if your interested, the problem is not cooperation, and respect it's more the faceless masses. Studies save recently shown that we as people have a hard time maintaining  social groups much larger than 30. Now this leads to problems in political structures such as socialism that require equality, egalitarianism, cooperation, and individual respect. It small social human circles, typical throughout most of human history this kind of socially enforced equality of status and means was easy to maintain, in many cases becoming wealthier or not sharing with community members resulted in social pressure that changed the offenders into a social pariah. The problem verbally arrises in larger political systems when the community is too large for us to understand or comprehend, people become faceless masses or worse simplistic caricatures of views they may hold in common (ex dirty hippies, tea partiers, religious fundies, or naive college students). It becomes easy for the few in power to dehumanizes dissenters or those who aren't as selfless as they should be and then use state sanctioned violence against them, and in most cases while ignoring their own lack of cooperation and involvement in the social system. It's the old push this button get a millions dollars and someone you've never met dies story. And this doesn't even just apply to those in power, this is the same mentality for person exploiting social systems like welfare, or even healthcare. They aren't stealing from friends and neighbors by exploiting the system they are taking from the faceless other people. It's easy to say socialism just requires cooperation and respect, but in large groups we forget that easily, and if you doubt that talk to anyone with a hardcore addict in the family. These are family members and loved ones who behave far worse to their close social group than most people think  unfortunately that capacity for selfishness and greed is in all of us, whether we succumb to it or not. Which is the point, ultimately socialism requires us, all of us to be the best of ourselves all the time, not a likely scenario. I like to think of it this way socialism is expecting the best of everyone all the time, and being disappointed when people don't measure up, while capitalism is expecting the worst of people and getting to be pleasantly surprised at how wonderful people can be."

Geoff is trying to play a dick character. It isn't as if player characters can't be assholes, and JP has played three separate troll characters (though I do love Bubba). This decision was sudden and mid-show.

It isn't the end of Rollplay or anything, but this is a big, sudden change that puts a monkey wrench in at least two shows. It also limits the personalities of future characters. Is JP the only one that's allowed to be a smartass? 

Ninja edit: that being said, if it's specifically because Geof was overly-targetting Gen, then I can understand the sentiment while I disagree with the decision.

Another thing to remember is that she's probably not the girl you want to spend the rest of your life with if you broke up with her, and while it might **feel** like you made a mistake, if you **think** about it, I'm guessing you'll realize you didn't. (source: been there, done that)

FurryButt,relationships,1389067060.0,"I never understood why the symbolic gesture of constant sexual availability was more important than the individual sleeping needs of each partner of a relationship. The bed is used primarily for sleeping, and less often for actual sexy-affectionate time. It makes more sense to have sleeping arrangements that are tailored to the needs of each person, assuming you live in the same house, while simply making time and allowances for sexy-affectionate time whenever desired. But it seems like it's a social custom to not only have that sexy-affectionate time whenever desired, but to have the symbolic gesture of constant sexual availability by forcing yourselves to sleep in the same bed or else something is deemed to be wrong with your relationship.

In other words, no I don't think it's weird, nor do I think you should even care if I thought it was weird as long as you're both happy with it."

Doesn't matter why, the fact that you didn't have matching sex drives is going to cause problems

Life-in-Death,AskMen,1389067390.0,"That is such a good point about being given the ""right"" to be upset.  

About four years ago, my boyfriend was killed.  Well, we had JUST broken up.  This is someone whom I had lived with for years and who had wanted to get married.  But because we had just broken up, everybody was literally ""why are you so upset, you didn't want to be with him anyway.""  It was so hard because I felt like I had to be fine right away.  The absolute disregard for my feeling from everyone around me was probably just as hard as dealing with the death.

I totally reread my response to you and it sounds like I was ""get over it already!""  So sorry about that.  I actually think we should all go back to wearing a black arm band after a tragedy and everyone has to be super nice to that person.  ""They"" just did some ""study"" saying it takes about two years to start to get over a significant tragedy.  Most people will give you about a month or two before they are done hearing about it.

You ARE amazingly strong that you were able to deal with children and pets and with the work you do.  I could barely feed myself.

**Height**

In terms of height, it's approx **182 cm** (approx 6 ft) at *peak*.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height

The charts on the wiki page are shit (it's hard to tell what P80 height is). So here is a chart dated from 2008: 

http://www.halls.md/chart/men-height-w.htm

Check the P75 mark, which is close to 6 ft.

**Weight**

From the following, it looks like the 80th percentile would be approx **BMI 22** for men aged over 20 years:

http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_bmi/about_childrens_bmi.html#What%20is%20BMI%20percentile

**Income**

The P80 marker for *personal income* (not household) is approx **57k** USD to **58k** USD.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States#Income_distribution

**Wealth / Net Worth**

The stats for these appear less reliable than income, as it's easier for people to hide or miscalculate their net worth, and it fluctuates a lot more. Never the less, wiki and other sources have the stats, and the number vary from approx **250k** to **500k** range for the 80th percentile.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States#Statistics

(Your own due diligence needed for other sources.)

(EDIT: P.S. Don't fret over the wiki page. A majority of this net worth is from home equity. Also, the numbers are for *family* net worth, not individual. Again, it's variable, so do your own work and draw your own conclusions.)

**Social Prowess**

Most statistics on this matter are absolute bullshit because they are too subjective. To give you an idea, 18-24 year olds boast an average of over **500 friends** (mostly due to Facebook).

**Sexual Activity**

This varies by multiple factors. Your own due diligence will be required. The CDC (Center for Disease Control - National Center for Health Statistics) may have what you need. 

One source I've found from superficial Googling analyzes from published CDC stats on promiscuity of teenagers, with which you can compare your own history. (Adult statistics weren't as in depth for the study.) It might seem stupid, because people change, but it's one of the better and more comprehensive analyses I've found. Besides that, with teenagers, you eliminate various other factors such as income and career.

Check Table 2 of Page 17 onwards:
http://paa2008.princeton.edu/papers/81662

You can get 80th percentile for any set of stats by multiplying 0.84 by the standard deviation and applying that to the mean. You get the standard dev from dividing the CV (coefficient of variation) by 100 and multiplying that by the mean. 

As an example, suppose you wanted stats for non-hispanic white. That is mean 1.4, CV 246.

2.46 * 1.4 = 3.444

Multiply that by 0.84 standard devs =  2.89296

Add that to the mean to get 4.29296... approx **4.3** sexual partners.

Yeah, either American teens are good at lying, or they are pretty promiscuous.

...

Now, all that being said, that should purely be for your own curiousity. It's not very useful.

1. Where you rank in the entire USA (not even the entire world) is worthless because it matters more to compare yourself to others around you. Municipal stats are more sporadic than national ones. Imagine if we increased the scope of this question to the entire world. Just by being in the USA, you'd already be in the top 80th percentile globally for multiple metrics, easily (except for healthy weight).

2. From my own experience, these numbers don't help much at all. As with other things discussed, your personal self-esteem should come not from comparing yourself to others, but yourself (you now, vs your past self). I've experienced this from childhood onwards. Always within the top 1% academically, and yet my mother still managed to make me feel like shit. There will always be some other people down the block who make you feel average at best. Suppose you move into a higher tax bracket. Your wife pressures you to move to a better neighbourhood. Great. Now there are new Jones's to compare yourself to. 

Just get yourself moving and be proud of having moved forward from a past, inferior version of yourself."

There was no legal entity that  had any power to force the TV Station to remove the guy and the TV Station didn't do anything illegal. You can't walk into your work place and piss out racist and homophobic comments and be free from the risk of being fired so why would a TV Station allow the same behavior from their employees?

It's not uncommon for young people who are above average intelligence to have depression problems. You're smart enough to see past a lot of the bullshit and you know that the future isn't as bright and sunny as everyone else makes it sound. Congrats. I see it as a gift. You're not naive and you know that shit is going to be tough. 

I know exactly where you're coming from. I'm 21 and the idea of continuing to work 40 hours a week every week day in and day out until I'm old enough to retire scares the shit out of me and I have no idea how anyone carries on doing it and is cool with it.. But I guess that's life. I hate to sound like a hallmark card, but you need to enjoy the little things along the way. Sometimes they're the only thing that keep us going. Little lights at the end of our day to day tunnels. 

You're too young to give up all hope now. Things will change. I hated high school. I dropped out junior year and got my GED and I still see it as the best decision I ever made because I hated those assholes and I hated the ""YOU CAN DO AAAANYTHING"" bullshit they spewed at me in counseling. I started feeling better after I got out of that hellhole. As for you though, keep going. Don't drop out unless you really can't take it any more. I'm just trying to say things will change and get better eventually. It just takes time. 

Edit:: on top of that, my grades were shit too. That's another downside of being smart. Everything comes easy, but once you get to something where  you actually have to TRY to learn it, you shut down and give up.. And as a result, shit grades and people think you're stupid for it. You're not stupid and a grade is absolutely NO reflection of your intelligence or worth. "

The comparison with how many mg caffeine per fl oz of *brewed* coffee is ridiculous.

Anyway, the deal I had to deal with mostly was the time out/room discipline strategy. I knew within a week that locking him in the room wasn't going to do anything so I brought him to the bottom stair on the staircase, looked him in the eye, told him that this was the new time out spot and how he would be in time out for the number of minutes his age is plus three (7 minutes) and that he could leave after I personally came and told him that time was up, told him why he was there ""You are in time out because you bit me and it is not okay to bite me. Understand?"", I would get a nod and walk away.

 As I started to walk away I would hear him get up and RUN, so I would quickly walk after him, grab him, put him back on the stairs, tell him that his time was being reset, and walked away. I didn't give him anything other than those words: ""Your time is being reset"". He would stop running and end up sitting for a minute or two thinking that I would give in because he stayed for a second. I was forced to take him back to the stairs say ""Your time is being reset"" and walk away. We spend 2 hours doing this back and forth, and I didn't make it a game- I tried to be as stone cold and emotionless as I could about it. It eventually sank in and when his time ended I told him that his time was up, it would have gone by faster if he listened to me in the first place, but since it took so long for him to behave he missed out on the activity I had planned for the afternoon so he had to go do his chores and homework now. 

 didn't discipline for chores and homework whining because I would end up being there for 9 hours in and out of time out, so what I came up with was a tally system- every time he did a chore without complaining he would get a sticker on a chart. I told him that when he gets enough stickers his mom approved that I could take him out to get an ice cream cone. Every time he whined, he would get a sticker taken away from  his savings, which I told him would definitely go into the negatives, and after negative 5 stickers he would not have his game boy for the rest of the day. He didn't believe me, and you can bet my ass that that gameboy was gone.

In the end I realized that these children did not have a stable discipline schedule. I had to talk with the parents and get their cooperation, and we ended up working together once the mother saw that if she stuck to her guns he would eventually learn and pay attention. I had to be the stone cold bitch and I didn't care if the kid hated me. I had to get my job done and I was not about to take nonsense. It took about 3 weeks of exhausting work with his baby sister tied to my hip (literally- moby wraps are the shit) but he did it and I expressed how proud of him I was. It took discipline for the bad stuff, and exceptional amounts of praise (""Thank you for taking your dish to the sink like I asked on the first time. It makes me feel like I've been heard and it makes me happy when you do what you are asked the first time."") but oh my god it happened. I never thought it would. 

If it doesn't work out, remember that you don't have to be this family's saving grace. You need to be firm with the children and the mother, though, if this is going to work out. Set guidelines and be prepared to walk. Good luck. I don't know if any of this novel was worth the read, but I just want you to know that you are not the only one who has ever nannied a terror. Seriously-- good luck and stick to your guns."

This isn't someone dismissively trying to put you down by calling your mental health into question. This is someone who has had mental health issues telling you that you sound like your life might be improved by getting some caring help from an experienced professional.

If you're an adult, it sounds likely that your your upbringing did not model respect for personal boundaries well. If you think back, maybe you can think of times where you tried to establish an expectation of privacy or control over your affairs, and then had that ignored by someone with the ability to overpower you in that way.

It's also possible you're just a child or teenager - this kind of immaturity would be completely normal, then. You should know, however, that this is very transgressive, inappropriate behavior, and you will alienate people by doing it."

I can dig the idea of wanting to make sure someone is trustworthy, but there's no one size fits all way to figure that out. That kind of transactional view of a relationship is immature and ultimately often (but not always) belies a high-maintenance attitude or the idea that you are somehow lucky just to kiss the ground she walks on. In reality, girls should feel just as lucky to get some as we do. It also creates a lot of complication around sex when it just doesn't need to be there. Just let that happen when it feels right, and if it never does, well that's okay too.

1. It would tie the Halo fans over until the next Halo game

2. It would bring in new sales to the Xbox One (old fans and new ones) AND increase the small game list the One currently has

3. It would allow more time for 343 to focus on the new Halo, while still showing what Halo could be like on the One (enhanced graphics, larger servers, etc.)

4. It would please the die hard Halo-ers that consider Halo 4 to be a failure, and might make them trust 343 again

5. It would also let 343 see what fans want more as far as a game goes, depending on the sales and user feedback

6. It would be a good way to give the users access to a Halo 5 beta (think like ODST and the Reach beta)

7. It'd be badass

scorch62,DCcomics,1389068002.0,"Just an enquiry and clarification about the Earth One titles and Multiversity.

Isn't Earth One ~~considered one of the universes in DC's multiverse?  But is~~ mostly contained and has it's **own continuity** (just not part of the **mainstream**) and not to be disturbed by outside forces?  So, technically an ""Elseworld"" in meaning but not title.

Isn't Multiversity part of continuity that explains the state of the DC multiverse?  I haven't read (New 52) Action Comics Vol. 1 yet but aren't there references to the Multiverse?

I may have read a fan's interpretation of Earth One being part of the Multiverse but I get an impression that it's an ""Elseworlds"" title with it's own continuity, just not under the imprint ""Elseworlds.""

Elseworlds was meant to be like ""One Shot"" books free from continuity but just the essence of the characters, which Earth One books are but are forming their own continuity.

After typing all of this, I think it's your ""non-continuity books"" that prompt me for a clarification and enquiry.

What, out of a life of 50+ years?  Just one awesome thing?  They had full lives, doing tedious shit day to day, hanging with buds, drinking or working or building or destroying.  We'll never know about much of that stuff.

Nothing will matter.  You've got a life, enjoy it.  When it's done, it's done.  You'll either go to heaven, or not.  You'll go to hell, or not.  Maybe you'll just cease to exist (by far the most likely of those three, IMHO).  

Nobody in 200 years will give a fuck one way or the other.  Enjoy!"

Death_Urthrese,summonerschool,1389068737.0,"awesome!  i can tell you right now that the consensus around Leblanc (from people like hotshotgg and reginald) currently is that she is extremely powerful and amazingly fun but the amount of time it would take you to master her would be the same amount of time it would take to master about 3-4 other champions in mid.  so you should only really dedicate the time if you truly have fun playing this champ.  i'm a leblanc main and although i'm only gold my mmr is that of low plats (i didn't start playing ranked till near the end of the season), i've made quite a few friends in diamond as well from beating them with Leblanc.  my skills with her are up there but it's the only champ and lane i can do that with.  i'm a one trick pony with her.  

that being said i run scaling health yellows, magic pen reds, ap scaling blues, and flat ap quints.  i also run 21/0/9  with none of the 21 being in that does more damage to minions mastery.  in lane is pretty easy since she is a lane bully and excels at 1v1 fights because her burst is so much faster and stronger.  Q&gt;W is your basic combo and after the W you can always get one auto attack off before you recall.  i personally max W first instead of Q because the higher elo the get the more farm is more important than kills.  in lane i'll try to Q&gt;W them while they are around minions in order to harass and push the lane or if i have to just a basic W when they are around minions.  the shorter cooldown on W helps with avoiding ganks as well.  you need to keep constant pressure on them in lane.  after you Q&gt;W your Q will be back after 4 seconds to do it again and just keep up the harass. this will blow through their pots early however leblanc has mana problems and you should be careful to not run too low.  if you do just tone down the abilities and focus on last hitting.  you can cheese kill your opponent sometimes though, if you get them low with just that Q&gt;W work and you feel you could kill them again if you had one more combo just flash in for another Q&gt;W&gt; and possibly ignite.  easy first blood.  if you ever have to go up against a tanky mid you can't kill like cho or galio just focus on farming till and don't bother to try and kill them until you get the items you need to burst them.  i don't usually go in for a kill until a jungler shows up anyways and then as Leblanc you should initiate first since you can silence them and chain them so they can't escape.  you can't flash a out of a chain's distance.

quick side note for laning, unless you know where the enemy jungler is, don't use W to harass past the midway point in lane as it's your only escape without flash or mimick.

as for the items start with either dorans ring or flask.  on your first back you should get either one you didn't get.  so if you started dorans ring then get a flask and always buy at least one ward.  i like to buy pinks since they really make their money worth.  you can place them in safe places behind you or in my own jungle to help my team.  remember that pinks are permanent so if you spend 100 gold on a pink ward and it stays in dragon pit for 15 minutes you've made your money's worth.  after you get those first items stay in lane as long as you can.  preferrably till you get to 1600 to rush the needlessly large rod.  that ap item alone will give her the burst to completely kill almost anyone with a full combo.  fiendish codex is nice but of course just isn't the same in terms of damage so i try not to buy it early.  after you have that rod get the other items for your DFG and possibly boots if you find yourself roaming early or needing to dodge skill shots.  stay in lane as long as you can to rush exp and farm for DFG though.  once you get that DFG you are a much greater asset to your team than you are without it.  if your mid lane roams just punish them by farming hard and forcing them to miss exp.  call mia's best you can and just focus on objectives.  if your mid lane roams and gets nothing for it while you soak up gold, exp, and damage to their turret it's totally worth not roaming.  you should follow your mid when you know where they went but if you don't see them leave and they pop up somewhere else that's your queue to push mid hard.  after you have dfg your combo is if you can get the jump on them dfg&gt;Q&gt;R&gt;W&gt;E.  this will blow up anyone on the map if you get it fast enough.  try to hide in bushes and catch someone out.  thanks to season 4 less areas are warded now.  if you can't get the jump on them try W to close the distance and then &gt;dfg&gt;R(mimicked distorion on them)&gt;Q&gt;E.  this is for closing the gap to do a lot of damage and then recalling back to your original spot safely.  this is great when they can see you and have no CC to really stop you and i highly suggest you do it a lot if you have blue buff because of the cdr and mana regen.  you need to know where the enemy will go though.  is it 7:45 in the game?  did the enemy jungler start blue? maybe they'll be at their red.  is top or bottom lane getting pushed to tower?  what way can you take to gank them?  who has low health on the map?  does the enemy top laner have low health and little to no MR?  maybe you can hop over a wall and turret dive with your combo and recall back before taking any damage.  these are all questions i'm asking myself in game.  Leblanc puts out fires, she is a terror especially in lower elo games if you know how to play her because the enemy will never feel safe.  when you build her right all game even tanks can't survive a full combo if caught out.  that being said your second item should almost always be void staff because if you are doing your job right they'll start stacking MR against you and if you are already rushing void staff then it will do more than rabadons will.  if they do rush MR and you do get void then get haunting guise second.  no need to upgrade it to liandry's unless you have to though because you only want it for the magic pen.  the more they stack MR the less effective they'll be in team fights cause you'll blow through it.  

if you can just focus on catching people out all game and  getting away.  Leblanc is not a great team fighter but that doesn't mean she can't be helpful.  when going up against a turret and trying to siege it with your team.  focus on harassing with spamming spells from a safe range and poking heavy damage on those out of position.  for instance if an adc gets too close to try and poke your team but is away from their team with no CC around him.  it's a safe dive to burst him down.  it may not kill him but it will force him to leave which is still helpful.  when a team fight breaks out try to avoid clumped up areas as AOE abilities are not friendly to her.  in open areas try and figure out who the biggest threat is as you are the one who can neutralize anyone instantly.  if they enemy adc is fed and they are the only one fed then aim for him but only after the team fight has broken out.  if the enemy has any CC and you engage at the same time as your team you'll just get blown up and you won't be able to recall.  you need to have patience and watch to make sure that any CC ability is used before you go in.  if you can't get into a good position try and peel for your adc by blowing up whoever attacks him.  an E&gt;DFG&gt;R(mimicked chain)&gt;Q&gt;W will hold down a tank or bruiser and still do the same damage as if you mimicked Q.  Q and E both will do the same damage if mimicked and both get their second proc.  so if you set off the sigil it does double damage and if you lock them down with the chain it will do double damage.  Q does more than E on it's own but when mimicked it's the same damage.  the reason you can also cast Q after two chains is because when the chain locks them down that also counts as a spell cast setting off the mark on the Q.  this will let you do double damage and is extremely helpful when fighting bruisers 1v1 as you will start by chaining them down first to make sure they can't get to you and then holding them down with a second chain to deal more damage and keep them still.  remember that if you can't kill the enemy but your teammates are there to help two chains allows them to be held down longer so they can do damage and you can't flash a chain.  at different times a W&gt;E&gt;R&gt;Q might be better.  if anyone ever catches you off guard and ganks you just all in them immediately as a full combo with smart casting can be done easily in 1.6 seconds.  if you built right they should die and regret fighting you alone.  

use your mobility to your advantage.  you can dive over walls and recall into areas they can't.  practice by going into SR alone and seeing which walls you can jump over and which ones you can't.  you'll be able to learn how to use that to your advantage later in games.  it also allows you to chase better as most champs will have to walk around areas you can take shortcuts and kill them when you get the jump on them and recall back to safety.   every champion you face will be different and you'll have to do different things in order to fight each one.  but because her cool downs are so short and she is so strong her kit allows her to outplay a lot of people.  you are very squishy but with really fast reactions you can outplay every champion you fight.  try to avoid grouped up scenarios and just focus on setting everyone on the enemy team back so far they can't come back from it.

I can't remember exactly what we did except to say we followed the steps of the recipe very closely. I do not have the book here now to refer back to what we did exactly. It spent many days completely buried in salt and we flipped it every 2-3 days, then washed it, dried it, and covered the exposed meat in a fat and flour mixture before hanging.

Getting the blood out of that artery was a real struggle. It actually dripped very thick (thicker than molasses) blood for 6-8 weeks after hanging. A very small amount, mind you- Probably only 1 drop per week at most. Maybe that's where we went the most wrong."

clone control, super important for Leblanc players!  here is where we separate the boys from the men.  a good Leblanc player can switch directions of both himself and the clone as soon as it goes off.  this will leave the enemy guessing which one is the real one.  my suggestion is send the clone someplace smart like a turret or allies and have the real you walk someplace really random like the river or their jungle.  you have so much mobility that as soon as you close the gap they can't catch you.  remember the clone can't use abilities so you need to wait on those.  a great way to use your clone as well is to bring it out of the fog of war and try and fool the enemy to using an ult or summoner on it.  you have the clone for 8 seconds so you might as well use it.  the last method you can do is flash over a wall as soon as your clone procs.  this is really hard and takes perfect timing but it's so rewarding when you see it done intentionally.  i found it out by accident one day but because you go invisible for a brief second you can flash in that time to safely if you are close enough to a wall or bush and then send your clone someplace else to distract them.  

i know this is a wall of text but Leblanc is actually far more complicated then people think.  let me know if you have any questions at all!

Information is the ultimate power, and government is interested in power - the power to influence vote counts.  Everything else to them is second."

pomjuice,personalfinance,1389068939.0,"Hey y'all.

So, I have a credit score of about 680.... I've been told this is good by some, and bad by others.

I'm a college student, and through college had a very high debt on my one credit card. Since then things have gotten better - but I wanted some questions answered (even though they probably have been before).

Since college I've opened up 2 more lines of credit for a total of three.

* BoA Visa Credit Card - Limit: $1000 currently owe $280 which will be down to 0 at the end of the month.

* one for Kohls, because that's where I get most of my clothes and the deals were worth it - I always pay it off straight away. Limit $1000 Currently owe $0

* one for Best Buy, because I wanted the 18 months free financing for a television. Limit $2000, currently owe $460

So, will keeping these lines open improve my credit? Will they bring it down? One of the reasons my credit is apparently low is due to my having very low limit lines."

The simple answer is that sex is actually nothing like helping people move house, or convincing your parents to take care of themselves in old age. It's not transactional, nor is it logical. Sex is about mutual desire, it's about wanting and being wanted, it's about passion and intensity. 

If you have to talk someone into it, that's an instant ladyboner-killer and frankly, would create a little dint in my self-esteem.

Another friend of mine was going and we ran into him so when my ex went to the car he said, ""Why don't you go talk to your friend.""

He then texted me basically saying he was going to leave and abandon me on campus [we both commute] because I talked to my friend.

We had broken up so many times at this point and this was just my breaking point because this was the fourth time he had managed to make me cry that day.  

So I lost it, and I punched him with the side of my fist in his back while he was rooting through his truck.  He didn't even react, I barely put any force behind it.  I just didn't know what else to do at that point, I was so helpless and he had made it so clear to me that I couldn't leave him.

BinghamL,snakes,1389069184.0,"Are you getting your rabbits locally? If so, how did you find them? So far I've googled and searched kingsnake/fauna and I found one reptile show (Seattle), it will be on May 3rd. However, they are doing one in Portland, which is about 3 hours away, on the 18th this month. I may go down there and make a day of it, but I need to be sure that it will resolve my feeding issue, otherwise I might as well just wait for the Seattle one. At these shows do they set you up with a mail-order deal or something? Or is it just more likely to find a local seller with a wide range of feeders? If it's the latter I will have to wait since finding a supplier in a different state won't help much. 

There is one place that sells the feeders I need, and it is the same one I mentioned above in my original post. The problem I have with it is that they do not care for their animals at all. Many of the mammals are in their own filth, snakes strike at the glass when you walk by their cage and have patchy shedding, the list goes on. I can't bring myself to support their business. It's annoying that they happen to have what I need. 

I also facebooked about it, and have a couple of possible leads. I may be getting a few friends to join in on a group buy from an online supplier to help ease the shipping costs."

cunctatrix,AskWomen,1389069264.0,"First - about the comment about women in the media - sure, it's not like the media completely ignores any political statement Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin makes, but they still spend way too much time talking about their hair, makeup, clothing etc. Not worth the precious airspace. And there definitely are people who will never look past women's looks (e.g. the people who obsess about how Palin's ""such a MILF"" and don't give a shit about her political career, or vice versa, people who talk about how disgusting and fat famous women are without paying a moment's attention to their incredible life accomplishments). It's not like they're looking at these women on a dating site or something - they're reading about them in the news or something. As an intelligent, ambitious, and high-achieving woman, that sort of shit is really frustrating to hear. I don't expect everyone to be attracted to me; I do expect to be able to get respect and (when appropriate) recognition for my accomplishments from my male friends and colleagues.

Anyway, to the main point, what really kind of turns me off about the whole PUA thing, even if in a ""nicer"" package like you say, is that it tends to focus heavily on making a woman want something she doesn't already want rather than trying to make sure she and her male partner are both getting something they want and having their needs met. It's a subtle difference but an important one. Trying to change someone's desires - ""how do I make her like me?"" - is inherently paternalistic. It's saying that your view of what she should want is more important or more correct than what she actually wants, which devalues and disrespects the woman. Seeking to provide her what she actually wants aims towards a mutually beneficial exchange that respects both parties as equals who both have equally valid and worthy desires and needs.

I think a lot of stuff that has been mentioned (like eye contact, not approaching from behind, etc) can be easily rephrased to fit in a framework of fulfilling women's needs and desires. Generally, women want to feel safe (thus don't approach them from behind), they want to be able to trust someone they're talking to (see id), they want to have a good time (thus smile and joke with them), they want to feel like you're actually listening to them and being engaged in the conversation (thus eye contact) and so on and so forth. Insofar as PUA offers this advice, it can fit within the framework.

However, it seems like PUA pretty much just gives advice to how to get and maintain women's attention, how to get them in bed - basically how to make them happy enough for your own ends. It's not about actually making women happy - their happiness is a means to your ends. Particularly with respect to the pursuit of casual encounters, that PUA seems to ignore the importance of teaching men how to please women in bed suggests to me that the focus is really making women change their desires rather than fulfilling women's existing desires. The main reason, imho, that women do not engage in casual sex or seek it out as much as men do is because of the [orgasm gap](http://www.alternet.org/sex-amp-relationships/orgasm-gap-real-reason-women-get-less-often-men-and-how-fix-it). Women are far less likely to experience an orgasm in a heterosexual encounter than men are, and the gap is particularly large with ONSs and casual sex. As the article above explains, women who have sex with women have orgasms at much higher rates than women who have sex with men. Women also average the same amount of time to orgasm through masturbation as men do through intercourse. So, basically, it's not that it's 'naturally difficult' for women to orgasm; it's sex with men that is the problem. Which is understandable to an extent - if you (men generally) come easily, then you don't need as much effort from the other person, so you have less of an incentive to make sure they come so they do the same for you. Understandable doesn't mean excusable though.

Thus, we have a situation in which women's expected outcome from a heterosexual encounter is much lower than men's, and that's especially true for casual sex. (At least with longer term things, there's some possibility of teaching.) So of course women are going to seek out casual sex less than men. It's not that women don't want good sex - it's that they know they're not going to get it, so they don't even bother. (In my experience, about 90% of hookups are ""meh"" to godawful. I can do a lot better than that just by staying at home and taking care of myself. Most of my girlfriends have described similar experiences.)

If men want more casual sex, or even more sex in general, they have to work on their skill. Even if you're *just* looking for a ONS, women talk, and that will impact your chances. I've had women I don't even know warn me about a guy's actions in the sack; I've also heard dirty details and gotten 'recommendations', which I have subsequently pursued (for hookups, a lot of my friends and I are fine with sharing - this isn't the case with a lot of friend groups, but you'd be surprised how much gets around. Also, Lulu's a thing now.) Plus, it's always nice to have the option of repeat business when the business is good. Generally, though, the more guys work on their skill (and COMMUNICATE! ask her what she likes! if it feels good!), the more positive sexual encounters women have with them, the more women will be down for casual sex and the easier it will be for both parties to find mutually satisfying sexual encounters.

If PUA can do all this, and do it while respecting women's autonomy, wants, and needs, I don't really see a problem with that. In fact, it sounds pretty great. (Though it would be nice if it were a two-way street, and there was more good advice out there for women to find and/or approach interesting, good men!) I just feel like PUA is rarely if ever versed like this, and I feel like there's a real lack of attention to the orgasm gap, which ends up causing problems for both men and women.

(as a note - where I'm using ""you"" and associated pronouns here, I'm using the general ""you"". Obviously I don't know anything about you personally. No offence intended.)

epicblob,gaming,1389069478.0,"&gt;It absolutely baffles me why it's not more commonly talked about when the conversation is Playstation exclusives.

Have you seen the other exclusives?

 *The Last of Us* was, IMO, the best video game I've ever experienced. The story was captivating, the gameplay felt perfect, and graphically it looked about as good as things get on PS3. 

 *Uncharted: Drake's Fortune* was amazing albeit a little clunky, and *Among Thieves* and *Drake's Deception* improved and were close to perfection, with amazing setpieces, fun shoot-outs, and dizzying climbing.  

*LittleBigPlanet* was the best co-op game I've played, with it's cute characters, entertaining puzzles, and challenging platforming. The sequel improved on the first one and made everything slightly better. 

*inFamous* and the second are both amazing games, but in comparison to the other exclusives?

Hey FutonSpecOps. I am responding to an old thread of yours I stumbled upon. You should check out an old PSP game called Work Time Fun. It's a collection of repetitive-ish, super quirky and whimsical mini games. There's one...where you work at a pen factory. You look at a pen, put a cap on, turn it around if it's upside down, put the cap on, and get a next pen. There's another one where you have a yard full of baby chicks that you sort into Male, Female and Heaven, for 15 minutes. And you get paid pennies! with which you buy trinkets and potentially more mini games with! Its setting is presumably hell, but it can also be a slice of heaven for those interested. 

check it out. =)"

tashibum,beermoney,1389069550.0,"What I don't understand about this whole thing, is that is seems like a really simple concept. There are even youtube videos that explain it really simply. I don't understand what kind of ""training"" you would need to figure out how to do this. 

As long as you start out small, it looks like it's something you can do on your time via trial and error. 

From what I've gathered from doing a little research the last couple of hours:

- pick an item that is on Amazon, then put it on Ebay for less than what other people are selling it, but more than what Amazon is selling it for. 

- person on Ebay buys said product, you place the order on Amazon and ship it to the person that bought the product on Ebay with the ""this is a gift"" option so they don't know how much you bought it for.

- as far as returns go, make your own rule on Ebay that says something like ""no returns after 3 days."" That way, person has a chance to return it, but it doesn't give them so long that they may change their mind and create this huge hassle. But if it comes to that, you can just have the buyer ship it back to you, and you can sell it as ""inventory""

It seems as simple as that, and I am sure there is a learning curve in there somewhere. I'm thinking about giving it a try on a few items just to see what happens, see if I can't make $20 or something.


The only questions I can't seem to find an answer for:
What is the general reaction when the person who bought the item from you gets the package with Amazon written all over it? Do they really care or are they like ""yeah whatevs cool deal bro""? How would that give you positive feedback?"

I wouldn't expect them to draft an offensive player in the first 3 rounds or sign any big FAs on offense. Remember, they had incredibly good injury luck this year (Maclin aside). But, I would argue that Maclin was the mos replaceable player on the offense (except for Vick, of course). I really don't get this obsession with Maclin. He's started almost every game for offenses that threw a ton, yet he's never had more than 70 catches or 1,000yds in a season. He's not especially big or fast. He's good, but not great.

The one thing that could really make this offense get even better than they were this year is a big ""2nd year leap"" by Ertz."

TotallyNotSuperman,DCcomics,1389069623.0,"According to the creator, it was because there was a difference in how he got his speed.

Earth-16 Jay Garrick got his powers from a freak lab accident (of course). Barry Allen, on the other hand, got his powers from an experiment that went totally right. He tried to imitate Jay's powers, and boy did he get it right. His controlled experiment was more effective than Jay's accident, so he became *much* faster.

Just as Barry was a fan of Jay, Wally was a fan of Barry. He tried to recreate the experiment that Barry did, but it didn't work as well as he hoped. He was still fast, but nowhere near as swift as Allen. Faster than Earth-16 Superman (who is more locomotive than speeding bullet), but orders of magnitude slower than Flash.

Bart gets his speed from his parentage. The grandson of Barry, he's just as fast as Flash. 

A big difference might be genetics. Wally doesn't share his genes with Barry; they're related by marriage. Bart does share his genes with Barry. It's quite possible that there's something in the Allen genes that is predisposed toward superspeed."

Who knows how many broken hearts we leave in our wake- people who would have cared for us but we never saw them or gave them a chance.  My best advice for you is to live your life, doing what you enjoy.  This will bring you into contact with people who share your interests and values.

GracietheSwan,raisedbynarcissists,1389069828.0,"I think it depends on what you plan to do with this list.  I see 2 options: journaling or ""evidence"" per say.  There could definitely be more!

I could definitely see how it would be useful to journal, but for me personally, sitting down and writing hundreds of pages of hurt doesn't make it go away, now I just have it sitting there, waiting for me to read it and rehash and think ""If only I said this..."" No.  My life with her is over.  I am done and moved on.  I am lucky that I am able to support myself in college.  But that is just me!

As for evidence: the people that will believe her will believe her, no matter what and same with the people that believe you.  Being more evidence to the table doesn't change the situation.  Hopefully, people will start to realize for themselves what she REALLY is!   

I do sometimes think of making a list, but I realize my NM does the same thing about me.  She used to write me longgggg letters of complainants about me and how great she was.  I think it would hurt me more to spend the time thinking about it and mulling over past events.  As you indicated, your mom doesn't like to say sorry.  Making a list isn't likely to make her ""wake up"" and realize how wrong and awful she is; nor is it likely to ""convert"" anyone to your side of thinking."
JustinJamm,Reformed,1389069829.0,"Ah, I see. You're thinking single-factor about this. Let me illustrate.

A **king** sees a **child** fall into a river. Nearby is a **farmer** who cannot swim and has nothing to save the **child**.

The **king** throws a powerful rope to the **farmer** saying ""Here, use this!""""

The **farmer** throws the rope in a lasso around the **child** and pulls them ashore.

---

Let's say in this story, the **king** is God and the **child** is an elect believer. I have suggested some believe there can also be a **farmer** involved, as a third option.

Your response sounds to me like, ""No, either the king does it and the child doesn't, or the reverse. There can be no farmer.""

God can decide based on whatever factors He wants to. He might favor *factors we ourselves cannot impact,* but because He embraces such priorities, the election is conditional. But we ourselves do not determine whether the conditions are met.

Do you see yet how this is in fact a third view?"

I've been subscribed to /r/psychology pretty much since the day I joined reddit, and an important thing to remember about that sub is that it's essentially the /r/gaming of all the psych-related subreddits. Which is to say that it may be the largest or among the largest subreddit on the topic, but most of the people are there just because they have a passing interest in the subject and not because they have any kind of actual accreditation or license in the field. And even for those who have professional experience, online therapy isn't really a thing for a *reason*. It's very hard to read people accurately over a written medium devoid of tone or body language.

So don't let them get to you, because they're definitely not qualified to diagnose you over the internet.

That said, it seems to me that the guy initially meant well but really stuck his foot in his mouth pretty badly, and then it was all kinda downhill from there.

I have a hard time trusting mental health professionals as well (which is funny, because I'm on the road to becoming one &lt;_&lt;). They're just human beings, with their own problems and their own biases, and as much as they are educated to try to minimize the negatives and maximize the positives, they are still far from perfect at best and downright take advantage of their position at worst.

tangerinelion,AskReddit,1389069978.0,"My guess is at least one of your (male) friends would have or did tell you that she's annoying.  What your friends see is different than what you see, and while you need to make up your own mind it's good to get an outsider's perspective on your relationship.  You should prefer the view of people of your gender who are in their own relationship.

My buddy asked once in college, ""Hey man, my girlfriend said she slept with another guy and so I broke up with her.  She says she's really sorry, and it was a mistake.  I'm thinking of taking her back.  What do you think?""  I told him ""No, that's stupid and she sucks.""  He took her back.  She didn't cheat on him, but he realized how much she sucked once he took the rose-tinted glasses off.  Ended up fucking her on his birthday then dumped her after he finished then we got pizza and beer."

john_donnie,leagueoflegends,1389069995.0,"If you're jungling here are some very basic tips and tricks.

-When you gank lanes, before you gank make sure you're actually going to get something out of the gank. (eg: does your laner have strong cc, are you a strong ganker, is he overextended, is the lane warded)

-If the answer is no then instead of trying to gank, just farm your jungle , theres nothing worse than a jungler who has 0 successful ganks and is useless mid-late game due to a lack of cs.

-ALWAYS use your pots while you are clearing, this applies especially pre 6 when you loose alot of hp and you become very vulnerable to counter jungling.

-Never attempt to counter jungle with no vision, if you see the jungler at 7 minutes 20 ganking bot odds are his red/blue is back up and he's not going to be able to stop you from taking it so go for it!
Some things you should aim to do every game as a jungler.

Try and get your core jungle item before the 10 minute mark, the faster you get it the better.

Try and hit lvl 6 before the 8 minute mark.

mmp31,politics,1389070049.0,"&gt;Locking minimum wage to the inflation rate would solve all these problems. Having minimum wage adjusted say, every year, would drastically reduce how much their wages are devalued, to almost negligible amounts.

Not if we have 14% inflation per year like we did in the early 80s.  Even if it's the target rate of 2-3% per year, I disagree that constitutes ""negligible"".  Any decrease in the poor's wages due to monetary policy at any point is completely unacceptable.

&gt;Inflation is a wonderful thing, a big reason why we switched off the gold standard to fiat is so that we could print money and make it risky to hold onto it, but unfortunately inflation is very low right now - there's no further the interest rate can be cut and we've adopted an austerity policy during economic hardship, so the fed is doing all it can via quantitative easing. 

Inflation is not a wonderful thing at all, it damages the economy.  Higher prices are always bad for everyone.

&gt;Inflation devalues people debt, of which the poor have much (although much debt is pegged to interest rates which messes that up), and discourages hoarding.

Inflation also causes poor people to have to go into more debt in the first place. You can devalue it, but they still have to pay the banks interest on the debt regardless. Also, zero percent inflation doesn't encourage hoarding at all.

&gt;If the rate of inflation increased our economy would benefit greatly. 

Only at first.  Then when prices go up, it harms the economy.  Inflation destabilizes the economy, but it's less noticeable at lower rates.

&gt;If we had flat or negative inflation it would have a serious depressive effect on the economy.

A steady zero inflation wouldn't have a negative effect on the economy at all."

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1389070054.0,"Well LBJ's worst playoff series was not the Finals, it was against the Bulls where he shot ~43%. I know what you're saying, but we're not comparing LBJ to just anyone (and that includes Durant). We're comparing him to MJ (at least in the scope of this particular thread). And in fact, all of his series sans the Bucks one (and seriously, does that count as playoff basketball? The team didn't even win 40 games IIRC.) saw him shoot worse from the field than in the playoffs, substantially so: 43%, 45%, and 51%. 

That said I'm not really sure what my point is so I'll just end by saying that it may be true LBJ coasts in the regular season (against shitty teams) but even while coasting his numbers are better than his full-effort numbers in the playoffs."

Until everything is out, it'll be impossible to say which one is the best.  Quality and value will probably be all over the map for the initial units.  Driver development on Linux has been shaken up by SteamOS, and might change the relative quality of various graphics cards considerably in the next six+ months.  I'd wait for reviews by Anandtech and similar before buying anything.

Life-in-Death,AskReddit,1389070353.0,"ONE relationship did this to me.  One.  I have always been the super rational, never say anything mean, never jealous, always understanding, yet speaks-her-mind girlfriend.  It is not like nothing ever upset me, but if it could be discussed, etc. no big deal.  

One of the last guys I dated screwed me up so badly regarding ""arguments"".  Everything was a trap.  If I disagreed with anything I was ""arguing.""  If I had a view point ""I always had to be right.""  So he would lure me into saying if something was wrong, then, I was ""arguing"" again.  If I said I wasn't, then I was, of course, arguing, if I said I was, then I was agreeing to arguing.  It was like a witch hunt.  

I finally got so scared to say anything because crazy-time would start.  Just last night I went through a bunch of IMs from a couple of years ago and it was just me saying ""sorry"" and ""let's drop it"" and him saying ""you never let anything go"" and ""you never apologize.""  Of course if I pointed out I apologized all of or was trying to end the argument, then I was again, ""arguing"" and ""always right.""  At the end I would burst into tears whenever he asked me a question because I knew that there was no answer that would keep me safe.

I am getting panic attacks thinking about it.  My next relationship was destroyed be I literally COULD NOT SPEAK if a problem came up.  No words could come out of my mouth because I could just hear the accusatory responses to everything I said.  

I am really worried that I have been ruined.  I have found myself watching crappy reality TV and actually thinking ""maybe I should see how that girl answers questions"", because I have lost all basis for what is normal.

Yep, he constantly would say I was ""crazy"" and that everything he did was justified because I gave him ""reasons"" to do so.

And he will always feel that he was in the right, and that is what really pisses me off. "

She used his emotions against him because she knows he cares so much about those he loves.

In a completely different situation, I've found it similar to people's reactions to people in movies.

On the last quote,  That, I do find boneheaded. Had he admitted to acting emotionally and being unnecessarily violent.  I'd be *more* sympathetic.

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1389070526.0,"Well first, how do you quantify ""best""? Most people would claim Kobe was better than CP3 in 2008 but by most advanced stats he wasn't. So is ""best player"" something transcendent that has to pass the eye test, or is it really ""best stats""? I just don't think we have the stats to affirmatively say one player is better than another, especially on defense, so it has to be some combination of the eye test and the stats I guess.

So with that in mind, how do you justify Shaq having one MVP? Shouldn't Jordan have about 8-10? Does anyone think Nash was better than Kobe in 2006? Or Dirk in 2007 (who put up better numbers, partly due to situation, but most agree Kobe was the better player)? How about Wade in 2009? I'd argue his numbers were better than LeBron's but his team was shitty. Why isn't K-Love in the conversation right now? By most advanced stats he's right there with KD and LBJ. How do you compare Dwight Howard in 2011 to LBJ (won't bother putting the actual MVP in the conversation)? Different roles, different skills. Can you really tell me LBJ was better than DH12, or vice-versa? Same deal with 2003 Kobe or T-Mac (you can pick), and 2003 Duncan. 

So on and so forth. I don't have a better definition for MVP, but ""best player"" doesn't work on a number of levels."

reyrey1492,AskReddit,1389070532.0,"I was 18. I was driving back to college after working a three day, rainy, cold, looong weekend at a renaissance festival two and half hours away from my school. I started out around 10 at night so this was close to midnight or so. I was maybe half an hour from being home safe when I woke up. 

Just in time to see the semi trailer getting really close to the front of my truck. Well I didn't want to hit it so I swerved left into the passing lane. I didn't want to go off the road either so I cut it back to the right hard. Too hard. I made contact with the front right of my dear Hellga and the back corner of the trailer just behind the tandems.

Like something out of a movie, everything was silent and almost painstakingly slow in that moment. I got spun around a couple times and wound up in the grass between the north and south bound lanes. 

Once I realized I was stopped and had somehow *NOT* pissed myself I took stock of the situation. Truck bashed up, me fine physically if not a bit shaky. The semi had stopped about a quarter mile up the road. I wedge open the door and start making my way toward the big rig when I see the driver poke his head out. I thought it was fairly obvious that something went down as there was my beautiful Hellga smashed up and waiting for help, but the driver hopped back in his rig and took off. I only managed to make a couple hundred feet toward him.

The rest is pretty mundane, called my mom, tow-truck, etc. Got it taken to a shop and my mom got me back to school. It was a couple days before I told my roommates what happened because I could barely believe it had happened.

That night was the only time I actually thought my life was over. I was hospitalized with blood clots this time last year and was nowhere near as freaked out as I was the night I broke Hellga at milemarker 101.8."

If you're not familiar, Lifetime is like a luxury MEGA-gym - they're super nice and as far as gym prices go, somewhat pricey.  However, the price (usually $50-80/month) includes unlimited yoga and fitness classes, pool, sauna, steam, hot tub, 24/7 access, climbing gym and a bunch of other stuff.  As a gym, it would be considered overpriced.  However, considering that a typical yoga studio will charge you $75-200/month for unlimited classes, Lifetime is a damn good deal if you plan on taking advantage of the classes.

In my experience as a Lifetime member, the classes have always been wonderful and taught by certified Yogis, and the facilities are gorgeous.  If you're willing to drive to Canton, it would be worth looking into.  If you're a student, you can often get a student discount too.  I personally just emailed their membership people to get some pricing, so depending on what they shoot back to me, I'm looking into it, despite the 20-minute drive from Ypsi."

Nolanoscopy,WTF,1389070672.0,"His name is ~~Albert Einstein~~ John Alexander.

I used to work with the guy. Never brought a plastic fork for lunch, always asked to borrow mine. I would always get it back with disgusting food bits between the prongs. Eventually, I got so sick of it that one night I dipped and swirled the fork around in my toilet for a good minute, pissed on it, then packed it up and stored it for the morning.

Next day, good ol' John comes up around lunchtime: ""Hey man, forgot my fork at home today; mind if I borrow yours?""

""*Suuuuure thing buddy!*""

With the most evil of intentions, I handed him the fork, making sure to grip it only by the sides so as to limit skin-piss contact. He left and I hurried to finish my project so I could enjoy my lunch break. 20 minutes later, I'm moments away from devouring a salad at my desk with another fork I had brought from home, and John walks over again.

""Hey man, I don't know what was in his coffee, but Tim [our manager at the time] is flipping the fuck out! Come check it out.""

So I did.  
I enter the break room where a small group has formed, all observing Tim raging about something in his coffee. On the table inches from the styrofoam coffee cup sat the plastic fork. And it was wet. With coffee.

My heart was racing. I began sweating but tried to keep my cool. *There's no way he'd make the connection between the fork and odd taste of his coffee... right?*  
Right.


Turns out, he had accidentally swallowed some coffee grounds and thought it was dead bugs. I allowed myself a minute to relax and control my breathing before heading back to my cubicle and sitting down to eat.

*What a bunch of idiots* I mumbled as I bit down into my first bite of salad and instantly realized I had given John the wrong fork.

To this day, I have never forgiven John Alexander for making me taste the piss fork.

Gluestick05,TwoXChromosomes,1389070927.0,"A couple of thoughts...

1. I don't think ""leggings are not pants"" is the same as saying that it is socially inappropriate to wear leggings.  T-shirts are not sweaters, skirts are not shorts...saying that ""leggings are not the same things as pants"" seems accurate to me, but doesn't mean that you can't wear them if you want to.

2. Situational appropriateness.  If you are lounging around the house or going to the grocery store, just wear clothes that cover your genitals.  Leggings are fine.  If you are in an office where you wouldn't wear sweatpants, I am going to wonder what on earth you were thinking when you wore leggings to work today.  Leggings (and many other non-scandalous items of clothing) are just not appropriate for every situation.

3. Yoga pants are really not that different from leggings.  Neither belongs in an office unless you're a yoga teacher."

If she insists that she'd be equally mad in both cases, then she's playing games and you should just end the relationship. She's immature and a toxic person to be around.

If she admits that she'd be more mad to find you with another girl, then you say: ""Okay, so then masturbating isn't the same as cheating. They're totally different. All guys masturbate, so do most girls, and I'm also going to. And so is any other guy you're going to be with, if you decide to break up with me over it.""

Of course Steam Machines won't be able to compete with the prices of the XBO or the PS4. Sony and Microsoft don't expect to make a profit of the console itself but from the games sold on their platform. 

So unless Valve is willing to share the profits of the steam store, which they will never do, the hardware partners will want to generate their own profit on the hardware.

Gentleman_Viking,fatpeoplestories,1389071129.0,"Firstly, Thank you for your reply, I don't anyone would argue that differing viewpoints do not make more sound and accurate theories.

I also agree that there is a right, and more importantly, a wrong way to go about making playfully disparaging remarks (or negging, if you prefer).

However, this is where our views split, you see, one of the basis of my theory is that this behavior comes about primarily when you have someone who is uncomfortable or inexperienced with being the proactive agent in the social ritual, in terms of PUAs, it seems that they need (or feel that they need) that extra little edge in social equity before they are confident making more overt moves. And in terms of hams, I think it's the same discomfort, stemming from taking on the more aggressive role of initiating amorous relations, a role typically reserved for 'Alpha males'.

That being said, a primary hallmark of a hamplanet, is their dizzying lack of moderation in most aspects of life, so it's no surprise that their attempts at playful banter are ludicrously heavy-handed (Tee^-Hee)."

1. Gives you an added break when needed (I recommend around miles 16-22, when most hit the wall.) and better service and nutrition than you'd get a race aid-station.

2. It keeps you on pace. If your race starts at 7 am and you ask a friend to meet you at the 20 mile marker at 10:10 am, you'll be more likely to stick to that 9:30 pace or to completing the race in general, as you don't want your friend waiting around for you all day, but never showing up.

Also, be sure to cool down a little bit (10 minute jog, stretch, and use a foam roller) after your race or you will cramp up so badly the next day that you will literally be bed-ridden for a week.

Get out and exercise regularly and eat a healthier diet, that will probably deal with most of the depression symptoms and you can focus on what's really bugging you.

I have borderline personality disorder and I strongly believe it is due in large part to my n-mom and childhood.

Even if you don't, it doesn't hurt to stay on it and it will help you cope with your mom and other situations. 

Clearly your mother is not reacting appropriately to the situations at hand. All I can suggest is avoid conflict, don't say anything that could be even possibly stretch misconstrued as argumentative. Work on yourself and your own happiness, find a job that you're comfortable in and then get away from your mom, under the right circumstances.

I got away from my n mom the same way, by living with the guy I was sleeping with. I just lucked the fuck out and he was the love of my life. It doesn't usually end that way and will just cause more stress for you.

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389071299.0,"Definitely, same sort of thing going on in Peru. There were a lot of specific things that were found at Chavín de Huantar, the central temple of the Chavín cult, such as a u-shaped central temple and sunken circular court, and a lot of Chavín-like artifacts were found all over the place with some very distinctive iconography and styling, like [thin incised lines](http://www.go2peru.com/destinos/large/huaraz_feb12-452.jpg) that aren't seen on later styles, plus just the motifs themselves. Those major Initial Period sites were known on the coast and highlands, but it was just kind of assumed that they were contemporary with or post-dated Chavín. Then with radiocarbon dating everyone realized 'oh hey, these places are *earlier* than Chavín. Huh.'

And I don't think we've really solidified an opinion after that. I'd say the current idea is that some Chavín elements developed at these earlier Initial Period sites, then Chavín successfully brought them all together and from there they spread to the entire Andean region, far wider than the range of those Initial Period sites. There's been a lot of recent work at the site of Chavín de Huantar itself, and those early time periods are a hotbed of research now, but I still don't think anyone's really come up with a grand explanation for Chavín, at least not one that is widely accepted."

We had some discouraging news at the egg donor session in which they strongly encouraged me to ""be flexible"" and not worry about matching my ethnicity when it comes to egg donors (possibly because they only have 37 donors right now and none of them are a match).

We're currently looking into two different clinics, one that's in the area and has a West Coast egg bank (so it has more Asian donors), and one which is not local, but has a doctor who suggests a different protocol than the flare/microdose Lupron protocol (which is what I was on for both failed cycles) for women with diminished ovarian reserve.  We have appointments for consultations with both, but not until February.

So it looks like we've got two more natural cycles coming up... no idea how fast either clinic can work us in if one of them is even good for us."

Okay...

More likely you're a 4channer under 18 yourself.  In case you are actually feeling this way, you should define yourself by what you do.  You don't HAVE to act on temptations.  If you have done this, go get help, possibly castration.  I'm not even joking.  Don't live like that dude.

    &gt;I want /u/BigMacIsNotABurger to propose to me but I don't think he's ready for that kind of a commitment.

Not my problem...

    &gt;I'm pretty sure I'm probably bisexual.

Read up on Dr. Kinsey and the degrees of orientation.  Remember, you don't HAVE to act a certain way if you're not 100% comfortable with it or define yourself by your feelings.  You should define yourself by what you do.

    &gt;I stole a car then sold it to a chop shop in high school. I don't know why I did it. I didn't need the money.

kempff,gaybros,1389071724.0,"From http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2012/01/city-fighting-for-a-downsized-neighbours/ dated January 26, 2012:

&gt; Three nights before its biggest party of the year, Capitol Hill’s largest dance club received a troubling letter. The Seattle Fire Marshal was threatening to shut Neighbours down by New Year’s if the club didn’t cut its capacity by 70% to less than 400 people before the event, a requirement the club’s management said would cause irreparable damage to its business. 

&gt; [...]

&gt; Meanwhile, the City says the club’s basement space, Neighbours Underground, is a goner:

&gt; * Neighbours has until Feb.3 to resolve building egress, sprinkler system modifications, low-voltage fire-safety requirements, and seismic retrofits;
&gt; * If Neighbours does not meet the 2/3/12 deadline, occupancy goes from 950 to 340 or 499 depending on what is not done and stays at that level until everything is done; and
&gt; * The basement cannot be occupied because Neighbours can’t readily install a 4th exit, and can only be occupied if building and fire code standards are met and permits obtained.

&gt; [...]

&gt; But the city says a routine fire department inspection last spring of emergency exits and the fire sprinkler system revealed that Neighbours can not be permitted as a nightclub even though people have been dancing there for decades. Instead, records show, Neighbours was zoned as a restaurant and the space doesn’t meet the legal requirements for a nightclub. That spring battle dragged out through the summer. According to DPD records, Neighbours has since failed a series of inspections to review changes required for the club to continue its operations.

Also, from http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/09/the-neighbours-restaurant-in-addition-to-the-tax-man-club-faces-problems-with-permits/ dated September 26, 2011:

&gt; [...] According to court documents obtained by CHS, Neighbours has more on its hands than a fight with the tax man. The club’s lawyers spent the summer in a legal battle with the City of Seattle over the business conducted at the Broadway club. According to the documents, Neighbours has operated as a restaurant since it opened in 1983. But a fire department inspection last spring of emergency exits and the fire sprinkler system — routine, the City tells us — revealed the discrepancy. Neighbours is not permitted as a nightclub even though people have been dancing there for decades.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The permit issue is more than a formality. Requirements for crowded nightclubs call for important structural elements that aren’t necessarily needed for lower occupancy restaurants. Paramount — and potentially most expensive for a building that needs to change to comply — are more stringent requirements for exiting.

&gt; [...]

&gt; It turns out, Neighbours is not alone. The city has also set its sights on the HG Lodge as that club has also operated with a restaurant permit since its days as the War Room, according to DPD. Issues with hosting the BadWill flea market this summer brought the permit issues to the city’s attention as a fire inspection revealed the club’s sprinklers were not “operable” and the club lacked the official drinking establishment permit necessary to operate a club, according to DPD’s Stevens. Stevens says HG Lodge has already begun the process of working with DPD to bring the space into compliance and obtain the correct permit for the business.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The permitting issues have come to light as Capitol Hill clubs also face scrutiny from state auditors over the so-called “dance tax” issue reported by the Stranger earlier this summer. A spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Revenue tells us there is no connection between the City of Seattle’s violation notices and the revelation that some clubs have not been paying taxes the state says they owe on cover charges — and that audits, not DPD inspections, triggered the findings regarding back taxes the state says Neighbours owes."

In that case, make sure that your tacks are long enough to heat the base material enough to allow sufficient penetration or make sure you scrub the oxide off prior to welding. (aluminum oxide melts at a MUCH higher temperature than the aluminum alloy.)

The problem is that you can create uneven annealed areas in the material which can be up to 40% weaker than the rest of the work piece. if you have a series of small, weak areas you're significantly increasing that flexing may create cracks that could propagate into serious problems.

The shitty thing of course, is that you're likely no better off knowing any of this if your company is unwilling to improve their processes to minimize the potential for problems.

Are you aware why they want the pieces welded if they're already riveted and bolted? Mechanical fasteners allow slightly more flex in a structure, but they can also limit the potential for cracking due to increased stress."

cleoola,AskReddit,1389071904.0,"When I graduated from eighth grade, my grandmother bought me this really beautiful gold ring. It was really delicate and unique, and I was so in love with it. A month later, my family and I went on a road trip out east... and in the car on the second day, I realized I'd left the ring on the nightstand in our motel the night before.

I PANICKED. I told my mom and wound up crying, feeling so terribly guilty over it all, and we called the motel to see if anyone had found anything when they were cleaning the rooms. No dice. I had to call my grandma and explain what happened, and though she was understanding, I felt like I let her down in a huge way.

About three weeks after returning home from our trip, a package showed up in the mail. My mom ripped it open and brought it to me - inside was my ring. The motel had found it, had kept a record of my lost ring phone call, and had sent it back!!! I was ecstatic, my grandma was thrilled, and I still have that ring and wear it every day, eleven years later. It was a miracle.

...Two years ago I found out that when we returned from our trip, my mom went back to the jewelry store, bought the same ring again, and ""mailed"" it to our house. I never handled the package myself, so I never saw the return address. She said that she did it because she knew it was an honest mistake, but that I was destroying myself over losing the first piece of valuable jewelry I'd ever owned. And she did it for my grandma, who'd spent a decent amount of money on it and who had been so upset about the loss, even though she'd never shown it to me. To this day, my grandma doesn't know that the ring I wear isn't the original.

My mom is amazing."

I always tried to study a lot about ""communication"" so I would know what I was missing, but that whole relationship threw me for a loop.  The thing is, maybe it *was* me.  Maybe I was super argumentative and horrible.  But yeah, I am sure talking to someone is always a good solution.

I was looking through the old IMs because I was thinking about reaching out again, ""as friends"", but now I see that was a bad idea.  Ugh, it was one of those things where everything was PERFECTION for 6 months, like I have never had before in my life, then went to shit for 3 years.  But those 6 months keep breathing crazy hope.

Give it a try, within a week you'll start to find more ""real"" women attractive.  If you're masturbating to porn regularly then you often develop very high, unrealistic, standards.  

EDIT: The reason I say this is because I was annoyed at how few ""real"" women I found attractive.  It was depressing because it made me feel like the odds of me and a woman finding each other mutually attractive was super slim.  So I stopped watching porn and I quickly readjusted to a realistic/normal sense of attractive. 

So by all means keep watching porn if you want to, but if you are in a situation like I was.  It's worth a shot.

austex_mike,bestof,1389072416.0,"Here is my original comment if anyone is wondering:

[Take a look at this pic.](http://michaelgphotos.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/img_1346.jpg) It is a picture of the wake of a large ship. Notice how turbulent the water is behind a huge ship. Anything caught in that wake is going to be thrown around. It is chaos back there, you don't want to be in that wake. That wake you see in the picture, that is your past life. The ex-gf, the death of your step father, the lost job, all of that is past. There is nothing that will change that. It is what it is, turbulent.

[Now look at this](http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/02/01/11/528966/3/628x471.jpg). That is the front of a giant ship. See those dolphins playing? They are having a great fucking time. They are enjoying the water, the ship is giving them reason for joy. 

Behind that very ship is the turbulent wake, but the wake of the ship does not control the ship. You can move ahead of all this. You can move forward. Your own personal wake is turbulent, all kinds of chaos, but you don't have to stay in the wake. Be the dolphins, look ahead. 

You can do this, but it will take practice. First of all you need to learn that if you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. You say you live in a place with no living energy. I know it can feel that way, but there is something there, you just need to learn how to find it. I was once stuck in Anniston, AL. That town on the outside sucks, but through the internet and Yelp I found cool places to hang out. You need to find the places where people who are nothing like your ex hang out. Your mission is to explore your world. You want that energy? Then go find it. It's there I promise you. Hell, if you tell me the city you are in I bet I can have three cool places for you to go and feel life before you can downvote this comment.

Yeah, your background is shitty, but that does not mean your future has to be shitty too. You can do this, you will make it through this buddy. Hang in there.

The user who likely reported my comment said ""'changing the way you look at things'. That's a very dangerous thing to say."" Also, someone on /r/bestof said ""Shit like this is why so many young people kill themselfs.""  I appreciate both of their comments because they are perfect examples of the kinds of [false dichotomies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma) that we are trained to fall into. I find it fascinating that in some people's minds that just because you choose to think positively about a situation, that it is then axiomatic that you are foregoing any professional help. In their minds it is one or the other. It is a sad way to look at the world really, but I see it a lot. You and I will never be able to change how they view such things, so I am not even going to bother to respond to them. 

There is no reason whatsoever to assume my advice meant not getting the help you need. In fact, I would hope it would HELP you to get everything you need, including professional help, so here is how it would work in the case of someone who is suffering from depression:

""If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change."" Often times people who suffer from depression feel ashamed for having to seek help. They think they are weak or something similar for needing help. For whatever reason as a society we far too often perpetuate this idea that it is weakness to seek help. I changed the way I looked at this years ago. For me, I see strength in being able to recognize your weakness, then doing what you need to do to get yourself healthy. In sports we would never question an athlete who sought every avenue they could to heal their body if they were injured. If you hurt your knee, then seek the help of Doctors and physical therapists to rehab it, no one would question you. The way I see it, we should look at getting our mental health together the same way. 

So you were mentally injured from a bad relationship, a family illness and loss of a job. Well, now it is time to for you to do what you need to get healthy. I don't know your situation, so I can't definitively say what you need to do. Could be as simple as buying a book such as the [Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns](http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Handbook-David-Burns/dp/0452281326) which in my opinion is one of the better cognitive therapy books out there and working through it, or it could mean going to Google and searching for ""sliding scale therapy"" to locate a therapist who you can afford in your area. That is all up to you to figure out, but if you are able to change the way you look at things to see that finding the help you need is strength, then you will be much more likely to succeed.

From my perspective you left a relationship with a lying, cheating woman and moved back home to start fresh. I don't see your moving back home as sad or pathetic, I see it as a step in the right direction. What is worse, living with a woman who doesn't respect you or living with your mom when you can take care of her in her time of need? You are not regressing in my eyes, you have actually made some decent progress. Again, it is all about changing the way you look at things. 

I think the notion that the wake of a ship does not control the ship is key for many of us to get the help we need. We let our past far too often decide our future, and it does not need to be that way. Ironically some of the people criticizing my original comment are guilty of letting the wake of the ship control the ship. Somewhere in the past someone put the idea in their head that advice that has a ""positive thinking"" tone to it means not getting professional help. Even though nowhere in my comment did I even suggest that you avoid seeking help or just show a ""little gumption and some elbow grease"" these people projected their past experiences onto my advice to try and turn it into a negative thing. There is no reason so believe that positive thinking messages preclude professional help just because that idea has arisen in the past. Just as there is no reason to believe that you will not find a new, healthy relationship, just because you had a bad one in the past.

I still encourage you to try and find the positive energy you are seeking. I know you said your town has no energy, and I totally understand, I have been to many towns like that. But when I find myself in a place like that I now take it as a challenge to find the gems, and I always do find them eventually. You and I are old enough to remember prior to the internet when you basically had to discover new places by accident. But you can use sites like Yelp (as flawed as it is) to find great things, including free things. I use it to find parks, places to run, etc. in addition to coffee shops with good vibes and other such things. If you find something new and exciting drop me a PM and tell me what you found, I always like hearing about these things.

Once again good luck my friend!"

Reyalla508,poledancing,1389072611.0,"If possible, find a pole dance studio in your area and take and introductory class. Studios typically list important information for new students on their websites. Some typical suggestions: Wear the shortest shorts you own, and a tank top or t-shirt will do. Do not wear and lotion or oils the day of your pole class, especially on your hands. Come to the studio with an open mind and have fun!

If there are no studios in your area and you'd like to try learning pole in your home, you need to start by investing in a quality pole. Many poles you can buy are actually novelty poles and will not hold up to the spins and tricks pole dancers do. The best brands to consider are X-Pole, Lil' Mynx, and Platinum Stages. X-Pole tends to be a favorite for home pole dancers because they are tension-mounted and therefore do not need to be bolted into your ceiling or floor.

Once you have invested in a pole, you'll need some instruction or direction. It is not advisable to begin just trying something you find on youtube. Pole dance is a challenging sport and a solid understanding of the mechanics are required to remain safe and unharmed.

In reality, Satan is depicted in scripture as fundamentally anti-relationship (in general), whereas Christ is pro-relational.

Satan favors kingship over equality, power over love, and distrust over vulnerability. Christ does the opposite.

Satan says everyone is the enemy, and only the self is god -- whereas Christ says God is love, not self.

The depiction of Satan as an icon of ""selfless revolt against tyranny, free &amp; rational inquiry, and the responsible pursuit of happiness"" is quite uninformed and misguided. The principles they believe Satan represents might be good, but they've certainly got the symbolism all wrong."

Outside of reality, anything is possible and so we can use this to create impossible things and bring them in to being in reality:

* The Tardis
* A new shape-shifting body whose cellular mass as a whole does not die
* The Master sword
* Pastel colored ponies that talk

I actually had a similar ""cheating"" scenario, although it was a stupid high school relationship.  My girlfriend at the time went on some religious retreat, and a mutual friend saw her holding hands at night (separate sleeping bags) with someone who we all knew was interested in her.  He let me know, said it might be nothing, but thought I'd want to know.  I asked her calmly about it - all I wanted to know was if it was anything to worry about, and she lied for a week straight about it, so that was the end of that.

It's just very annoying when I'm being very honest and claiming my afternoon height while almost everyone around me adds an inch or two.

That playoff run was pretty great. But what he followed it with was absymal. Those numbers are about bad enough to warrant him getting fired from that OC position.

Regarding equipment, the only additional equipment you will have to buy is a stronger Resistance Tube than the one provided ($10 -$20 at Dick's Sporting Goods).  There are alternatives to the pull up bar, and unless you can bang out at least 5 Pull Ups, you're better off avoiding it.

The ladder, jump rope, and strength bands are provided with your purchase.  You will have to replace your strength bands every month or so though (Dick's has them also, but you can order them individually cheaper at TBB if you have time to wait).

Reyalla508,poledancing,1389073281.0,"I wrote this out as advice for a new competitor regarding preparation: 

Everyone likes to prepare for competitions differently so a lot of this will be personal preference, but I'll give you some insight based off of my experience. I've done three competitions and I'm likely going to do Central Pole Championships in May 2014.

During the choreography process... only choreograph tricks and transitions and you feel 100% confident in, or that you know you'll have 100% at least a month before the show. You do not want to be nervous about any one particular trick going into the competition. Your nerves should only be a little bit of performance anxiety in general (because let's face it, everyone's watching you) and the desire to give your best performance. You should not be worrying about whether or not you're going to complete a trick or, at worst, fall out of something.

Try to have a nice balanced mix of beginner to advanced tricks, transitions, dancing on the floor, and floorwork. Judges like well-rounded routines. Try not to choreograph anything that doesn't look as perfect as you can get it. For example, perhaps you can hold a jade split, but don't choreograph it unless it is a flat split. Toes need to be pointed through transitions as well as in the tricks, legs should be completely engaged and straight (when they're supposed to be). Judges look for things like micro-bends in the legs. Judges also like to see audience engagement, so try to look at the audience and express the feeling of your music as much as possible in your facial expressions.

I prefer to have my routine choreographed in its entirety about a month away from the performance. From that point on I'm practicing my warm-up to run-through routine. Find out what works best for you in terms of a thorough warm-up and stretch-out that will give you your best performance. For example, I like to start with some calming yoga, followed by some range-of-motion exercises, followed by some climbing and inverting to thoroughly warm up. Then I'd stretch out for my flexy moves (splits and light backbending), and do a couple of tricks from my routine to check my stickiness and flexibility levels. If all is good (this took roughly 45 minutes - hour to accomplish) then I'd run the routine. I tried getting into a groove of doing the same warm-up and stretch routine every time, so I knew it was my tried and true method. I would also try to run my routine at least twice if not three times to help boost my endurance. Also, as soon as your costume is ready, beginning running your routine in costume so as to make sure nothing about the costume will be an issue.

Try to arrive at the competition destination at least the day before if not two days before. It'll be nice to get used to the new bed and shake off the traveling fatigue. Try to get as much sleep as you can and stay extremely hydrated. The organization will typically have a competitors' meeting scheduled for additional information regarding the event. On the day of the competition you must remember to eat! You may be nervous and have no appetite, but eating and fueling your body for what you're about to do is crucial. You'll feel lighter if you eat in small quantities fairly often. Having a snack (don't forget the carbs!) every couple of hours should do nicely. And you've practiced your warm-up and stretch-out routine so much by that point that you'll head into that warm-up room, go right into it, and get down to business. Before you go on stage, remember to breathe... big breathes. One of the first things to go when performance anxiety hits is breathing, so continue to breathe fully throughout your performance, as your muscles and brain need oxygen to function properly. Muscle memory will kick in, adrenaline will give you a fantastic boost, and you'll rock it! :D

###The answer: It depends on the question(s)! 

A *lot* of questions are simple ones requiring simply yes/no answers, a short explanation of a current game feature, or requests for recommendations on builds and new items to obtain. These questions can be answered via the many resources we have, which include:

* The subreddit itself! The searchbar can reveal many complex questions that have been asked already
* Our own subreddit [FAQ](http://reddit.com/r/warframe/wiki/FAQ), which is always being updated
* [The Warframe Wiki](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki)
* [Metadragon's Beginner's Guide](http://metadragon.de/warframe-beginners-guide/), which greatly details Fusion
* [Aldershot's Beginner's Guide series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3c8ympwHJlyfTEkw0XpNbWhTouCDisW), which actually shows in-game actions alongside his tutorial
* [This Steam guide on Resource Farming](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=181630751#150807) that I always link to

Because of these many information sources, there is a plentiful number of questions that, with simple searches or careful reading of pages, can reveal much. There are other topics which are more interesting to discuss, and new threads which ask simpler questions don't engender the same kinds of discussion. However, don't confuse the thread removal as ""bad."" It's simply a tool for organization, and not of disdain. 

When I recommend that you ""post in the Monday Megathread,"" it really is because I (and others!) will take the time to link you the correct information, and find the answers for you. It's the one place users will go out of our way to help answer your questions. Otherwise, by making a thread for simple queries, other users may get annoyed and make downvotes or rude comments telling you to ""look it up yourself"" and ""why can't you be an intelligent independent person?"" And yes, people have said those things, and it detracts from this community.

-------------

All in all, we do it to: 

* Keep the subreddit organized
* Maintain a positive community, and 
* **Provide a safe place where any question will be answered, no matter how mundane or simple, without judgement and prejudice.**

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1389073478.0,"There's a difference. Harden shoots 10 2 pointers per game and averages 9 free throws per game (not sure where you got 8 from). Durant shoots 14.1 2 pointers per game and averages 9.4 free throws. I actually agree that Durant gets a lot of bogus calls, but Harden is *worse*.

Here are some numbers. Say that Harden got as many calls as Durant. Let's assume all 9.4 free throws of Durant's are shooting fouls (2), then 9.4 / 2 = 4.7 is the amount of shots he gets shooting fouls on per game. 4.7 + 14.1 = 18.8 (not taking into consideration 3FGA) is the number of opportunities, then, where he can get fouled. Durant gets 9.4/18.8 = 50% free throws on opportunities. Harden is 10.0 + 9.1/2 = 14.55; he should be shooting 7.22 free throws if he had that 50% rate. He shoots 9.1. 

That means that basically per game, he gets an extra 2 free throws (i.e. one foul call^1) than he ""should"" be getting compared to Durant. How big of a difference does this make? Well add that extra (missed) FGA he didn't get a call on, and subtract 2 * FT% (85.2) = 1.7. He's now averaging 22.7 instead of 24.4, on 7.22 FTs and 17.4 FGA. (versus 16.4 before). 

His TS% drops from **59.8%** to **55.1%**. Remember, this is if he gets Durant's rate of FT/2FGA, which we both agree is inflated. He's at 50%. In contrast, Kobe's career is 39.2% and LeBron's is 45%. In both cases, if Harden got the same amount of calls to match Kobe or LeBron's FT/2FGA ratio, his TS% would drop further. So the question becomes, is he an elite player without the amount of calls he gets? 55.1% is a pretty solid ratio nonetheless, but if it drops further (which it would, if we moved his FT/2FGA to LBJ's) then it's lower than most superstars' numbers. With his defense in mind, it'd be fair to say he's no longer a superstar.

^1 This approximation hurts Harden's numbers (i.e. if I were less lazy his actual TS% would be a little higher). The 55.1% that I arrived at would probably be close to an estimated 55.5%, which is incidentally Kobe's career TS%."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389073528.0,"Drunk driving - not piss yourself drunk, but definitely over the legal limit.  I was furious.  I told her I couldn't talk to her, and I didn't for maybe a couple days.  I just told her that I was upset and that I wasn't okay with what she did at all.  No yelling, no name calling, just plain disapproval, and that it wasn't acceptable.

Honestly, it took me a while to get over it.  There was almost a second time, but luckily, I was there to stop her (this time, she was blackout drunk).  She realized that when she drinks hard alcohol, she drinks more than she can handle since she can't gauge it as easily, so she cut it out.

Sometimes, I still think about it - it's hard not to.  I don't pester her about it, but it's still aggravating.  Especially since that first night, I wanted to tell her to be careful, make sure she had a ride, etc., but I didn't want to seem like I didn't trust her, and then look what happened.  

We stayed together, I suppose, because it was something that could be fixed, she realized that what she did was incredibly wrong, and took action to make sure it never happened again.  Although honestly, if there's even a close call like the second time, I'm not sure it's something I could deal with any longer."

Two hours before I'm supposed to perform I begin my regimen. I will apply Tite Grip (I LOVE TITE GRIP) every 15 minutes. In the last half hour I'll start alternating Tite Grip and Dry Hands. Every time I feel a bit of moisture, more Tite Grip and Dry Hands in that last half hour. By the end of it I think my hands have completely lost their ability to sweat. For my competition routine a couple months ago I think I counted 15 layers of Tite Grip. This may seem excessive but, hey, I felt dry, secure, and safe. I consider that more important than people looking at me weird while I apply 15 layers of Tite Grip, lol.

Now for practice purposes, when I'm far less nervous because I have no audience in front of me, probably 3 layers of Tite Grip and several applications of Dry Hands will do the trick enough for me to complete my routine.

Just for clarification, Tite Grip is basically an intense antiperspirant. It doesn't actually add any stickiness or grip for your hands, but it will stop them from sweating. Dry Hands feels like alcohol mixed with a drying powder. As the alcohol evaporates it leaves the drying powder on the hands. I think it adds a little bit of tackiness which is a nice grip aid. This is why I like to use these two in tandem.

Then you have to navigate your way to that shop - the road is cars-only, because the bikes have their own street now - it just doesn't seem appealing to me.

But on the other hand, his death isn't something I ever bring up (most of my friends that I've met since then have no idea), and I can't think about it for more than a couple of seconds, nor can I look at pictures of him, because I get really upset. A lot of it is to do with guilt, but also because I miss him and the experiences and conversations we'll never have. So when I do start thinking about it, I mentally push those thoughts away and focus on something else. That sounds healthy :/"

drewgriz,CFB,1389073940.0,"This is exactly what I'm afraid of losing with a playoff. College football has never ever been about a fairly or tidily decided national champion. It has been about 12 weeks of the best regular season in all of sports, and an amazing slate of random fantasy exhibition games for a postseason, resulting in messy but memorable stories and bragging rights that fanbases remember forever. Also, it gives 35 teams a chance to end their season with a meaningful win, even if it is in the Advocare V100 Bowl. 

I don't think a 4-team playoff necessarily takes that away, but I'm absolutely terrified of it expanding to the kind of thing that we have in college basketball, which is its own kind of awesome, but is not what I ever want college football to be. I'll take a random bowl win over ""making it to the Elite Eight"" any day of the week. I really hope people remember what makes college football the best sport on earth when the powers that be inevitably try to expand the playoff."

I am not the arbitrator of what is cool and what is not cool.  I'm not interested in telling the world how to be and what to do.  Also, I wouldn't even know how to answer that except to say ""Depends on the joke, doesn't it?""  

Just before Christmas there was a post in AdviceAnimals where someone was expressing the opinion that people who don't think people should work on Christmas should not shop on Christmas.  I expressed the opinion ""Only Chinese restaurants should be open on Christmas, so Jews can celebrate the holiday.""

That's not even black humor, that just a straight up joke about Jews.  Someone replied ""I know your joke is getting down votes because it is racist but come on guys. It is a little funny.""  

I found that funny, because if you don't get the joke about Jews ""celebrating Christmas"" by going out for Chinese, then you don't really know much about American Jewish culture.  If you go to Judaism101, which is a website dedicated to dispelling misconceptions about Judaism and combating anti-semetism, and look for the question ""What do Jews do on Christmas?"" the answer is ""Go for Chinese.""

You know, that's humor on the internet for you.  One guy makes a quip, riffing off the customs and habits of his Jewish friends, all out of love and respect, another person sees it as racist.  *C'est la vie.*

&gt; But this website as a whole really brings out the whole thirteen year old CoD kid mentality in a lot of people and the 'black comedy' defense can totally wear thin when you start to realize that every single comment string on the front page has rape jokes in it.

If the internet teaches us one thing, and one thing only, it is to value the skill, talent and effort of professional comedians and humorists.  Because it only takes a few hours of being on the web to realize most people are very bad at being funny.  Painfully bad."

And that's a tough situation - I haven't been in your current predicament, but I have been in a sort of similar situation with my best friends from college.  John had a girlfriend, although he was supposedly always hitting on Jane, trying to get her to come/stay over his place, etc.  He was the flirtatious type, but I never saw him cross the line, and I never thought he would.  But also, I trusted Jane as much as anyone could - she was one of my very best friends (well, still is!), and I had no reason not to trust her - plus, she is most definitely not the type of person to make things up.

Well...he admitted to nothing, and she stands by what she said.  In the end, I removed myself from it entirely.  I can't have an opinion when two people that I care *very* much about are telling different stories.  Plus, it doesn't matter who I know better or longer, because it's a shitty situation either way.  

Having said that, given your situation, I bet she chose what she wanted to believe.  There's really no good solution because all you have to go on is someone's word, and both people are very close to you.  She'd probably rather deny it ever happened.  

So are you not friends with her now?"

I bet Valve will make a push for ports of Civ5, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Borderlands 2, Bioshock: Infinite, and The Witcher series (all big, popular games available on OSX through Steam).  Skyrim and a hypothetical Fallout 4 and their corresponding modding communities would be a huge grab, but Bethesda has never ventured away from Windows to my knowledge.  But anyway, the point is don't count on anything that hasn't been announced to run on SteamOS.

I suspect a big use of SteamBoxes will be users installing Windows and setting Steam to run on bootup and start in Big Picture mode.  This is probably along the lines of what you want, regardless of whether you buy something prebuilt or not."

To add insult to injury, there are times when he has health of single digits where one more bullet would have killed him.  I very commonly get the ""You suck at aiming"" suppression assist.

However, I play different than most and can often score the highest with the fewest kills. Playing the objectives, capturing (in conquest) and dropping ammo like its your job (it is) can give you tons of points. 

A few stats on me-  
Just over 46 hours playtime  
242 Conquest matches (my favorite)    
Average accuracy is about 11%  
Overall Accuracy is 5.14% (86k fired, 4k hit)   
K/D is 0.68  
KPM is 0.26  
SPM is 327  
550 Flags Captured  
343 Resupplies

It should not be too difficult to find jobs as CNAs. Medical care is Spokane's largest industry (don't ask my how that works, but it does. My leading theory is some kind of black magic and devil-worship).

You can definitely afford to live in Spokane as two nurses. Spokane has some of the lowest cost of living in the entire nation and housing is not expensive at all. The only people that will tell you otherwise have never lived anywhere other than Spokane and have no frame of reference.

Being nurses your best bet for what neighborhoods/area to live in would be what we call the Lower South Hill, Browne's Addition, South Perry etc. This would put really close to our so called 'medical district' where our major hospitals and a bunch of clinics are where there's a good chance one or both of you might end up working. It would also give you close access to the freeway in the event one of you ended up taking a job out in Spokane Valley or Medical Lake.

These neighborhoods are very safe and kid friendly.

Reyalla508,poledancing,1389074379.0,"Just to clarify, the titanium gold is NOT a coating. The outer pole is literally made out of titanium, which is one of the hardest metals available. To change the natural gray color of titanium they use a process called anodizing. They heat the titanium using an electrical current and the gold color that forms is an oxidized state of titanium. Different electrical currents produce different colors (as you see in titanium body jewelry) so X-Pole could conceivably make titanium poles in all colors of the rainbow. Three factors will wear away the oxidation: heat, humidity, and skin acidity. Each situation will be different so some people may see the gold fade quickly while others may not see a difference for years. When the gold fades (and yes it'll fade mostly where your skin touches it most) the only thing that is fading is the color. It is not wearing off a coating on the pole, the titanium is going nowhere, it's just changing back to its original color. I don't know why they don't just leave it original titanium color because it would look similar to a stainless pole but have a grip similar to brass. I have worked on all finishes of poles and I must say that the titanium is my favorite. It is grippier than stainless steel or chrome, but not quite as grippy as brass or powder-coated. This means that I'll stick securely, but not so much that I can't slide down the pole when I want to."

Most go to a top college on scholarship (even tho their academics won't aren't on to par, their athleticism is), meaning free room and board, free meal plan, and free tuition (tuition not free for every college athlete). So that's still a fuck ton of free shit that's really fucking expensive. So what would an athlete have, receive money but take away scholarships, or have what they have now? College athletes don't go to school for degrees, they go to school to play their respective sport (I'm targeting Basketball and Football here). This is shown by many athletes completing 1-3 years of college to go to the draft.

Also, college athletes DO get paid ... under the table and which is not reported. These athletes dress like millionaires when it comes to draft day, in their nice designer suits with nice jewelery. 

edit: and to say that they cannot maintain a job once season kicks in. Well, isn't that expected? Besides which, they are suppose to be STUDENT-athletes. University is for higher education, and it shouldn't be where prospective professional athletes train with no regards for education."

cunctatrix,AskWomen,1389074708.0,"I don't think you're quite hearing what I'm saying and I think we agree more than you realize. If the point is in fact to give women what they want - well, really, to give both parties what they want - then I'm fine with it, whatever it may be titled. There may be things - books, communities, whatever - that fall under PUA that do that. That's great. Then there are plenty of men (including on reddit, see theredpill where they openly discuss strategies for driving down the 'value of pussy' like women are commodities) who claim the title PUA who talk about women like we're objects, conquests, etc. The latter is a problem. The former is fine. Both fall under or are called PUA by people who practice them so it's hard to differentiate between them by name alone.

Wanting a relationship with another human being is not paternalistic. Trying to make someone want something when they wouldn't otherwise want it is. Like I said, it's a fine-grained distinction, but it's important. There is a difference between trying to make yourself more attractive to people by changing yourself and trying to make people attracted to you by trying to alter their preferences or deceive them. The former, in moderation, is positive. The latter is not.

The reason so many women are so adamant about this is that so often men do not respect our boundaries and our desires to be left alone (see, e.g., sexual harassment, assault, etc). The logic that underlies ""I can make her want [fill in the blank]"" is the same logic that props up ""no really means yes"" and ""she really actually wants it"" (contrary to body language etc). And as a woman, that sort of reasoning is pretty terrifying. Again, it's a matter of fine (not blurred, yuk yuk) lines. Dressing and cleaning up better, being polite, being more talkative isn't paternalistic because it's not trying to change her preferences about what she wants in guys, it's changing you to meet her preferences. She still may not want you and as long as you respect a 'no' she gives you, that's fine. It's when people use aggressive, presumptuous, and manipulative techniques to delude or pressure someone into changing their ""no"" that I have a problem. It doesn't sound like that's what you're doing. Unfortunately, some people do pull that sort of stuff.

I'd also say that while it's not bad to want a relationship, sex, or whatever, it's important not to just let that be the 'end goal'. It's not about getting the girl, it's about making both of you happy. It's not adversarial, it's collaborative. And I feel like while there's a lot of focus on enabling men to make 'first contact' or whatever, there's not much beyond that (and I really doubt that men couldn't use some advice beyond that point).

Again, I'm not saying the sort of stuff you seem to have read in books is necessarily bad. I think it would be better, maybe, if men had more access to resources about how to maintain relationships/interest/etc, but the advice *you specifically are describing* isn't inherently bad. Nonetheless there are plenty of people who claim to be PUAs and such who have held the exact sorts of attitudes that I've described earlier. It's not necessarily the term I care about, but using that term will necessarily draw associations with the actual people who write, talk, and think that way and tend to predominate in certain areas of the internet. If/when it refers to something else, that's all well and good. Unfortunately you nor anyone else can solely define what ""PUA"" means because anyone's free to use it as they desire.

But what I'm saying is that women getting less out of sex contributes heavily to one of the main problems that the techniques you're describing tries to address. At the very least, I imagine it could only be helpful for men who are trying to ""get their foot in the door"" for casual sex with women to have that background and to understand the context women are coming from. And even if men start getting their foot in the door, if they don't work on things like sex, communication, maintaining relationships, whatever, they're going to get thrown out the door pretty quickly. Sure, you can learn by trial and error, but isn't it a lot easier to start off well on the first go-round?"

I think the best way to look at this is from a professional and personal perspective.

Reaching out and having a relationship with your step brother is the correct thing to do (IMHO) morally and personally.

I would not divulge any of the information about his ex because as far as I am concerned, that is privileged information. I would not enable his destructive behavior however (coming home drunk, crashing at your place, driving while intoxicated, etc...) and make sure you set clear boundaries that you enforce and adhere to.

Switch your deadlifts to Monday is my recommendation because the 4 sets of 9 is the ""easiest"" day.

I'm not sure if I'm built for sumo. I think my legs have developed a lot more than my back and sumo amplifies that and removes the failure from my back during conventional. I added about 120-140 in about a month from switching to sumo which leads me to believe it suits me better.

By removing slavery as the issue and replacing it with a different context, it may be easier to see the difference.  

Let's say that two people are married.  The wife has some activity she likes (let's say, riding a motorcycle), while the husband thinks she shouldn't do that activity.  

After countless arguments and attempts by the husband to get rid of her motorcycle, she decides she has had enough and wants to leave.  So she files for divorce.  

The husband then says ""I forbid you to divorce me!"" and physically assaults her to prevent her from leaving.

In this situation, where does the blame lie?  The motorcycle or the husband?"

akatokuro,philosophy,1389075348.0,"Perhaps I was unclear and ambiguous in my statements. I was saying two things in my statements:
1) In general, many philosophers have done a good job at presenting philosophy in a bad light. The very practice is annoying to many people, as we tend to ask questions that are more specific or seemingly offbase. There are those that have fun analyzing precisely what was said, not what the questioner intended to say (which they do understand). It gives philosophy a reputation of people that are hard to deal with, so why not just ask someone that will give you a straight answer. I hear geologists, political scientists, to physicists and sociologists on the radio all the time, giving 'expert' analysis, but never the philosopher, despite having much insight on a given subject. It's a systemic problem that goes back thousands of years of philosophers pissing the masses off.

2)While academic philosophy is wonderful, when people argue about a subject just to argue about it, nothing changes and no progress is made. There are philosophers that want to do just that, which also gives a bad rap to the practice. We need to be willing to practice what we preach, implement reform when one looks at philosophy of law, look at new ways of approaching theism that avoid the traditional atheistic objections. Instead what we have is two sides that just spout the same rhetoric without doing what Hegel posited with synthesis. The following sums up these feeling perfectly:

&gt;Most of us, however, prefer to keep a lower profile. We lament teaching the same old courses year after year, hoping for a reduction in our ""load"" so that we might get back to our ""own work,"" turning out obscure essays that may be read by 10 other scholars with whom we are already on a first-name basis. Meanwhile the world burns. - Lee McIntyre, Boston University, Simmons College

As you your final point, while that may be philosophical in nature, that isn't something most people will recognize as being such. To the casual observer, philosophy is metaphysics, analyzing the mind, looking at religion. And it is less about rational discourse to find a newer better approach to the problem, and more soapboxing preconceptions. It's about making the other person believe your point of view, not about understanding each other and coming to a more informed consensus. So I guess I disagree that it is normal for there to be philosophical discussion (in most circles)--the topics are there for the discussion, it just isn't practiced in a why I would call philosophy."

Welcome to the United States of Smeg!  

* Pragmatic on most issues.  More conservative on issues like abortion (although clearly some medical exceptions must be made or it wouldn't be very pro-life toward the mother, would it?) but more liberal on issues such as /r/trees and providing welfare for those who REALLY need it.  Because honestly, nobody in my country really WANTS to work hard.  That is why we will lean on technology to do most of the work for us.  Robots will paid wages that will be given to human beings that can't or shouldn't be working, like new single mothers.

* Cailfornia-like

* I like the system of checks and balances, but with a few tweaks:

1. No politician is paid.  Instead, they must live off the welfare programs that the poorest people in the land use themselves.  They cannot accept donations or gifts during their time in office.  Anything that puts them in the top 50% of wealthiest people must be donated away before they can even run.

2. All laws must focus on one coherent issue at a time.  For example:

 a) Guns are legal
 b) All gun owners must pass a safety course
 c) $1000 of the budget will go to build a road named ""Derp Street"" in Smegamazoo

Line C has nothing to do with supporting the original law and will be dropped.  Politicians will be forced to vote on issues on their own merits.

3) Pure Democracy!  Non of the electoral college bs.

4) Paper ballots only because until the Internet gains sentience and befriends us, computers remain slaves to their corrupt masters and cannot be trusted.

* We shall have a contest to design the flag.  Submit your entries here and we'll vote on them in another thread.

We've never had a Superhero movie outside the realm of reality (superpowers) this dark. Logically, I found all of the plot points to be spot-on. 

I do think that the editing could have shed some minutes. It is fairly long. That's less of an issue for me than some of the structuring. I would have liked the film to have started out with Clark's miscellaneous travels rather than Krypton. This would have made a huge impact on the film. Where I feel less connected to Clark as it stands now, starting out with him would have given me a a greater connection to his POV. Really, the only problem I had with the film was the inconsistent POV. 

Sidenote: Can you imagine if the only POVs were Clark and Zod? And they were portrayed in a way that made both of their stances seem legitimate and understandable. There would be so much depth to Zod and especially Clark because we would see why he struggles to stick to his philosophy."

This contributes to the wide range of symptoms we typically see when someone has, say, influenza.

TheHolyFool,AskWomen,1389075798.0,"Yep -- I chose to love the man I'm now married to. 

Honestly I'd been in love with him for about a decade in the back of my mind, but never acted on it. We were just great friends in high school, hooked up a few times, and mutually agreed that we both had a lot of fucking up to do before we would deserve the best of each other. Then, he went in and out of the country, and ended up living across the country from me. He came back to visit his family for a month, and we ended up hooking up on a ... molecular level, or some shit... and before he went back home, he told me he was ready to start building a life with me, and he'd be back soon.

So I did my best not to trudge around ""waiting"" for him, because that's just not how I operate, but I didn't get serious with anyone, purposely. About 6 months later, he told me he wasn't coming back, that he'd found a girl up there, and he needed to see that through, but that if they ever ""ended up [in the state I lived], she told me I shouldn't hold back my feelings for you."" 

So I'm then doing my best to get over this guy I'd basically loved for a decade, and I do a better job than I thought I could, but I was still pretty damaged by it. 

Fast forward 6 more months: He shows up on my doorstep, basically unannounced. I'm livid, but it was a block party situation, and all my friends are happy to see him, so I couldn't exactly bash his head in with a frying pan the way I wanted to. He ends up asking to stay on my couch, so I let him (it was cold and his only other option was to sleep in his truck or drive 1.5 hours to his mom's house while drunk). 

We're talking as he's laying on one couch and I'm on the other. He starts to fall asleep, and I started to work myself up in an effort to remember why I have every reason in the world to be angry at this motherfucker. Why I should, by all means, wake his ass up and tell him that he can't just show up here after breaking my heart so badly. And then I thought, Why do I have to work myself up to be angry at him? I was happier than I've ever been only 5 minutes before that, solely because I was in the same room with him. Five minutes ago, none of that shit mattered to me, at all. Why am I spending energy trying to make myself unhappy at him right now, when all he did that night was make me blissfully happy?

That's the night I decided -- yes, it was a decision -- that I needed to take ""happy"" whenever and wherever it's presented to me in this chaotic universe, instead of trying to make sure the source of it knows the pain he put me through in the past. There was no way I could've ever explain it to him in a way that he would understand, nor was I capable of hating him as long as we were in the same room... so I decided to take his love instead. 

We had a long road of apology and forgiveness ahead of us, but he won with flying colors, and we made it. Two years later, we got married and I've never been happier. Best decision I've ever made -- sometimes, choosing to love someone is choosing to leave your own pain in the past, so you can accept the love you're being given in the present.  "

Maybe start with animism or ancestor worship when he's around 4, the idea that people think there are spirits attached to certain things, then pantheons, probably starting with Egyptian, since its gods are simple, upgraded versions of animist spirits when he's 5 or so. Then Greek and Norse, since they're all about inter-personal relationships between the characters, kind of like literature or comic books.

After he's got a handle on all of that, I think I may be comfortable explaining the Abrahamist religions. The reason they're last is because they command awful things of people, and their holy texts are still around. I'm not sure when he'll be old enough to handle that. I'll have to get to know him better first."

Your view is that the war itself was caused by slavery.  However, this only works if you believe that the North's reaction to the South's secession was necessary; a fait accompli.

However, if you assume that the North did not *have* to attack the South, then their decision to attack over secession was the more direct cause.  Thus, the cause of the war would be the belief that states could not secede, not slavery itself.

This is similar to my analogy, where obviously the blame for the assault would be placed on the husband (the North) for being unwilling to let his wife (the South) divorce him (secede) rather than what the argument itself was about (slavery). "

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389076643.0,"1. There's a good article on Machu Picchu in [Palaces of the Ancient New World](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.doaks.org%2Fresources%2Fpublications%2Fdoaks-online-publications%2Fpalaces-of-the-ancient-new-world%2Fisbn-0-88402-300-1.pdf&amp;ei=B53LUu-IFs2vqQHJ6oHIAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE_ZC33N-H7n7jMsgvT5wp-vICHqQ&amp;sig2=7MZrOW5gTp2rEbio6I_xgA&amp;bvm=bv.58187178,d.aWM), edited by Joanne Pilsbury (that link should be a pdf download. If it doesn't work, google the book and it should be the first hit, at the website for Dumbarton Oaks who published it). I like it because it is a recent article, based on solid archaeology (unlike a lot of books that you see about places like Machu Picchu, which are not really based on science at all), and it is short and easy to read. And the book is free to download. The article gives you a good quick overview of Machu Picchu and its context.

2. The six places where states developed are: (1) Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), (2) Egypt, (3) the Indus Valley region (India and Pakistan), (4) China, (5) highland Mexico, (6) coastal Peru. The first states and proto-states were probably quite small, maybe just city states at first, but became powerful and spread everywhere, such that everyone in the world today lives in a state. 

States are a political science term that refer to a specific governing structure and organization, of a type that we don't see in non-state societies. Now this is an old definition of increasing hierarchy from Band -&gt; Tribe -&gt; Chiefdom -&gt; State, and this is really problematic and not well accepted anymore, but the state and statecraft (the process of developing a state) is still a well-accepted idea, perhaps because states are just so powerful and tend to spread and encompass all the non-states around them (though states do break down and people go back to living in smaller non-state communities, too). If we include chiefdoms as a sort of proto-state, there are many places where chiefdoms developed, but their structure is somewhat different. And I don't really want to call a chiefdom a proto-state, either, because many were stable as-is and were not simply a stepping stone on the way to becoming a state. 

So state-creation is about the process of becoming a state, just what has to change to give a leader that kind of power, what the leader can and cannot do with that power, how those states spread their influence and hold power over neighbouring states, etc. How does someone build power to the point where we can call them a state, basically. And remember that the people doing this probably would not have had any clear idea of just what the state would become, but rather this was a process that unfolded over a few generations until suddenly someone whose grandfather could only command his own village becomes able to lead a vast society with a lot of power.

I'm not really clear on the last part of your question for #2. What do you mean?"

And I think the reason us DGD fans want more bands like DGD is because they have a unique sound, and we wanted more like it. I guess with all these bands with similar styles popping up (ALLB, Stolas, HTS etc) it seems like its becoming oversaturated or something.

We didn't need me going insane on her and ruining her life, but I didn't exactly forgive and forget either. Trust is a hard thing to recover. She broke it off soon after, and started dating her best friend. Devastating, but honestly, probably for the best. 

I'm not condoning cheating or saying that cheaters should be forgiven. But, I realized I was at fault for not paying her much attention due to family problems. Again, that's not an excuse for her, but just a realization that there are usually reasons someone would do that to another person.

whoseworldisit,nba,1389076822.0,"&gt; And one reason Westbrook is less efficient is he is generally the one to bail the thunder out at the end of a shot clock or in situations where play breaks down

That's not even true. Even if it were, those situations should be rare enough to have a negligible impact on his efficiency if he were a good point guard. 

He's less efficient because he takes bad shots. That's it. 

&gt; Westbrook also plays better defense

Hell no. Westbrook is **NOT** a good defender. 

OKC has maintained an elite defense even after giving his minutes to Jackson and the cryptkeeper Derek Fisher. 

He has the tools to be, but his basketball IQ is incredibly low and he'd rather go for the steal every single time instead of playing fundamental defense. Just because he's always ballhawking, people think he's a good defender.

Not to mention he can only guard the PG position whereas I'd let Wade guard 1-3. "

I don't feel that the Megathreads need to be indexed, since most of the questions boil down to either opinion-based answers (what build or item?) or easily answerable ones (if you see this Wiki page). Granted, there are some interesting questions that get asked which get buried in the pile, but it's mainly just about frontpage clutter. If we can keep the NEW and FRONT pages a little cleaner, no harm in having a place for people to ask questions.

Also, the FAQ is one of the primary things I cite in the Megathread; it pretty much is an index of common questions and answers, unless you're looking for more or mean a more specific method.

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389077360.0,"I'm not sure where the current evidence stands for the earliest people in South America, but the early (ca. 18,000 B.C.) dates for Monte Verde are fairly well-accepted now, as far as I know. 

It's pretty much all but proven that people did come into the Americas through Beringia (the name for the land-bridge across the Bering Strait), so that part is well-accepted. The current popular theory is that people coast-hopped, or moved along the Pacific coast in small boats living off of marine resources, and this means that people could have gone from Beringia right down to Tierra del Fuego in very little time. But where the people came from in Asia isn't entirely clear. It is likely that there were multiple waves of migration and some people may have come from farther south in Asia, through Beringia, and down into the Americas. This is plausible even if people were also living in Siberia; populations would have been small and sparse and even if a region was ""inhabited"" there could be vast amounts of empty land (and there still is in the north), so other groups could have just moved through, not knowing that there was anyone else in the area.

I'm not sure about any connections between Japan and the Andes in terms of pottery. Pottery developed long after the Americas had been inhabited and were fairly populous, and there's no solid evidence of any kind of trans-Pacific trade or interaction. Some vague similarities in style could be a result of deep time or deep shared cultural traits, as a result of two widely separate societies sharing a common ancestor millennia before. This idea isn't really widely accepted anymore, but I think that it holds some merit, in that certain worldviews and ways of thinking can be stable for a very long time, and it is plausible that two widely different places developed broadly similar things because they shared some deep sense of meaning. But with considerable subsequent change and variation. "

nlc89,MMFB,1389077733.0,"Just remember, as awkward as you feel right now, there's probably some girl at your school who everyone has written off as a loser and ugly who feels the exact same way. 

I know because that girl was me back in the day. Every guy I asked out laughed in my face. All my friends coupled up with each other, and the only dance I ever got at prom was a pity dance the last 30 measures of the last song because my best friend promised to go out with him if he did.

The good news is, college isn't too far away for you, and that's when the real game begins. You can get an edge by working on the things you want to improve now instead of spending all your time focusing on a girl and her needs. Feel ugly? Go to the gym / dojo / pool / something and start working out and getting exercise. Not only does it help improve your physique, but it helps release endorphins, which will literally make you feel happier. Focus on being a good student so you can get into a good college. Good colleges (not ivy league, mind you, but even a prestigious party school) typically have a plethora of smoking hot girls, and a few ugly and nerdy ones, too. It's your choice at that point.

I know right now sucks big fat hairy donkey balls, but if you can see it as an incubation period instead of the end of the world, you'll be sooooo much better for it in a year or so!

I know you get platitudes all the time when you talk about this stuff with others, and I really want to avoid doing that because I know how shitty they are and how much they don't work. All I know is that I believe in you, and you will succeed!

Montuckian,LifeProTips,1389077967.0,"&gt; Also, try to avoid keeping bottled water/drinks in the car especially in subzero weather because they can explode. If you're stuck in the snow, then just use that for liquids. Bonus: use a cup to put the snow in for easier consumption.

Are you just making shit up?  Don't fucking eat snow if you want to survive.  That's like dumbass way to die number one.

And you absolutely want to bring fluids that your body doesn't have to heat.  The rest of your advice is fine, but that statement is just dumb.

Go put some water bottles in your freezer and call me when your kitchen looks like Chernobyl okay?

You know what the most important thing you can do to make yourself safe for winter driving is?  Keep your tank at least half full.  Keep it as full as possible, in fact.  Do it all winter if you live in a cold climate.  Al Gore won't hate you, I promise.

If you have a rear wheel drive vehicle, bring extra weight for the back (sandbags, etc.; this shouldn't be a surprise). Kitty litter can help you out of the snow, but you should always have spade if you're going into heavy snow.

If you really want to prep, keep a set of extra clothes in the car with your blankets.  If you get stuck, you'll get out and try to free yourself which will get you wet and sweaty (oh yeah).  Make sure you don't have to sit in damp clothes and keep them warm as well as yourself.

Lastly, if you're wet, sweaty and don't have an extra set of clothes but do have a buddy that's been riding along with you, the best way to stay warm is to wrap yourself in insulating blankets and to spoon up to the person you're with.  And be as naked as you're comfortable with.  Making two bodies heat the same space is more efficient than one for some reason that has to do with math and square roots and stuff, especially if you're not heating the clothes you're in.  The Inuit do it, so just trust me on this.

So let me get this straight. You work your ass off, day in and day out, spending time away from your kids so that you can make enough money to provide for 'em. 

And the first thing you do with that money is piss it away a casino - AND you stow your kids away *again* while you piss away the money you made for them.

These are advised for women over a certain age, but I won't go to them, because a false positive is much higher than a true positive and I'd rather just check myself.

THEN try black mesa, then follow that up with HL2 and it's episodes.

I think they are both very useful languages (obviously), and not really comparable. 

The thing is, I have to pick something to start with. I specifically want to learn a language with a steeper learning curve. I am not racing towards any one goal like a job in this field or a deadline on a project, I'm just exploring a thing I always wanted to do but never did. I like that Java seems to have more inherent rules and is more verbose. I feel like I will learn more of the fundamentals of programming that will give me more basic skills that will translate to some other languages (if I just can't get enough and want to delve into a lower class C language the syntax will be comforting, and the higher level languages should come a bit easier with this sort of base). I feel like I'll learn more about programming if I learn Java first, and knowing the deeper why's and how's and rules of certain things will help me to learn other things better, moreso than learning Python quickly to create cool things and solve problems quickly and easily.

Dantilli,introvert,1389079403.0,"You have no idea how nice it is to finally ""meet"" another observant person. I've never been able to accept that nobody cares or nobody notices because *I* notice. *I* care about them things no-one else claims to care about. *I* can see that slightly chipped nail that she caught on a brick a little while ago that she's now really self conscious about. I can see that blankness in her eyes that tells me she's only talking to me out of ""politeness"". BAH!!! don't you try and tell ME nobody notices.

But I have stopped caring about what other people think, to a reasonable degree. 

It has nothing to do with what they see, it's to do with how you identify yourself. If you have no definition of self then it makes sense that you resort to labels or define yourself by your ""reputation"". Both of which are completely dependant on other peoples opinions, therefore you are terrified of what they might think of you because that changes who you are. Well... it doesn't, it  just changes your perception of yourself, but it feels like you're changing.

The way to get out of this is to define yourself by something else, something personal and core to you. Define yourself by the values and principles that you live by. Work out what is most important to you, what things you would never sacrifice, lines you would never cross and define yourself by that. Once you do that you'll find that you don't mind what other people see you do because you know that you're acting according to your own values. Of course this isn't an instant transition, but it takes much less time than you think. 

If any of that made sense to you, I got this concept from the book [The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People](http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389077749&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people). This book is damned amazing and I'd recommend anyone to read it, It has SO many valuable concepts in it. It's the kind of book I wish I'd found a few years ago, Which I'm guessing would be around your age.

Sorry if this is just out of the blue but with the way and depth that you've thought about these things I really wanted to share this with you. I think it could help you quite a lot."

candydaze,science,1389079413.0,"The only gifted programme that I've seen work is acceleration. My school had some maths acceleration classes, where you covered the basics of a year and a semester of work in a single semester (at around age 14). You then went on to do classes with the year above you. And we had similar programs for pretty much all the main subject lines. 

This meant that when you got towards the end of high school (~18 years old in my state), you had two choices. Either graduate a year early, or get really good marks to get you into whatever university you wanted with a scholarship. I chose to do the Australian equivalent of AP courses a year early, and then went into IB for two years, doing pretty similar subjects. This meant I had a great grounding for all my classes, and did pretty well in my overall score because of that. 

It's good in that it's pretty much self-selected - you don't have to do it if you don't want to, but if you want to, they'll let you do it. But the kids who accelerated heavily dealt with the whole ""uncool"" label, which discouraged some from doing it. And of course you end up with extreme cases of 12 year olds sitting in a class full of 18 year olds, which benefited neither the 12 year old, the 18 year olds or the teacher. "

CoobyBooby,smashbros,1389079455.0,"Ah, a fellow Luigi. I only play brawl and melee (mostly melee) so I can really only help you in melee: Luigi is a ""floaty"" character and his A button attack moves are very good in the air. His side-B (the farting torpedo) is great for getting back onto the platform but you are left vulnerable after landing. His down-B is a very fast spin move that has priority over most other moves, so it is a good go-to attack if you're getting hammered, or if you just want to start a combo. If the enemy is standing on the ground, and if you are so close to them that you're touching, you can up-B and it will do severe damage to them if you do it just right. If they have over 100% damage it will usually make 'em fly off the map.

Bottom line is that if you want to become a good Luigi player, use his air attack moves to your advantage. He is very good in the air. If you can grab the enemy, move the left stick the opposite way of where the enemy is, and you will do a powerful spin-throw. Good luck my friend!"

A few months later, he was pretty much living with me, and I had to tell him to leave for a few weeks so I could make sure I was ready for wherever we were headed.  I simply left a 2-sentence-long note  on the counter before I went to work for the night, saying that I needed him to be gone when I came back, and that I didn't want to talk about it for a few days. As a professional writer, I couldn't have come up with any combination of words that would've done what those few weeks did to him -- poor thing had never had his heart broken, and that's as close as he'll get to it.

I'm far from teaching the class... but I am pretty grateful that I examined my thoughts in real-time that night. I don't do it nearly as much as I should."

kempff,Catholicism,1389079664.0,"Ignatius' letter to the Christian community of Smyrna (of which Polycarp was bishop) has a few gems useful for apologetics.

&gt; ""For I have observed that ye are perfected in an immoveable faith, as if ye were nailed to the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit, and are established in love through the blood of Christ, being fully persuaded with respect to our Lord, that He was truly of the seed of David according to the flesh, and the Son of God according to the will and power of God; that He was truly born of a virgin, was baptized by John, in order that all righteousness might be fulfilled by Him; and was truly, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch, nailed[to the cross] for us in His flesh. Of this fruit we are by His divinely-blessed passion, that He might set up a standard for all ages, through His resurrection, to all His holy and faithful[followers], whether among Jews or Gentiles, in the one body of His Church""

Anyone who has read the New Testament can see the verbal parallels in what Ignatius has written here. This proves that much of the NT was already written and circulated as early as the lifetime of Ignatius, and not, as some have said, forged in the names of the apostles decades later.

* ""Nailed to the cross"" proves that the details of how a crucifixion was carried out were common knowledge, and that it was not simply tying someone's wrists to a post or a crossbar with rope, as some say.
* ""Truly the seed of David according to the flesh, and the Son of God according to the will and power of God"" proves either Ignatius read Romans and therefore Romans was already published, or that the phrase was already a common-knowledge saying among Christians by then and therefore an integral part of the gospel message.
* But the existence of stereotyped sayings among Christians is the beginning of creeds, and therefore people who don't like the idea of statements of faith written by men are not in step with historic Christianity - and of course I am saying this as a Catholic for whom creeds written by men are essential and indispensable tools for giving a definite account of what I believe.
* ""That He was truly born of a virgin, was baptized by John, in order that all righteousness might be fulfilled by Him"" - the virgin birth is an essential part of the gospel message, as well as his baptism by John the Baptist where Heaven vouched for him, but also that the Gospel of Matthew was already published by Ignatius' time (because it echoes the wording of Matthew 3:15).
* ""And was truly, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch, nailed [to the cross] for us in His flesh"" - in other words, he was not crucified ""spiritually"" or ""symbolically"" but literally, with actual nails, and Pilate and Herod were both directly responsible for this, at a certain time, in a a certain place, and again these facts were common knowledge. In other words, this is something that actually happened, and happened only one generation ago.
* We are as far removed from the Great Depression and the rise of Hitler as Ignatius was from the ministry of Jesus.
* Investigating Jesus' ministry would be like interviewing a survivor of Pearl Harbor or the Holocaust.
* Investigating Paul's ministry would be like interviewing people who knew John F Kennedy.
* Investigating Timothy or Titus' ministries would be like interviewing retired Lockheed, McDonnell-Douglas, or Boeing employees about the early Space Program.
* And Ignatius is as far removed from the death of the apostle John as we are from the death of the muppetteer Jim Henson.
* ""Whether among Jews or Gentiles, in the one body of His Church"" - proof that 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians were already published, in spite of theories to the contrary.

Right after this paragraph Ignatius says, ""He truly raised up Himself, not, as certain unbelievers maintain, that He only seemed to suffer"", because even that early on, there were New Agers saying it was all a sanitized illusion. Nope. Christianity is a gritty, sweaty, bloody, fleshy religion that actually happened. From now on you will notice the places in the Bible where it says Jesus got tired!

""And as they believe, so shall it happen unto them, when they shall be divested of their bodies, and be mere evil spirits."" - Ha! What a slam. This is like saying that after they die they will become less than nothing. But it must be borne in mind that these people taught that material things are evil and spiritual things are good; Ignatius is saying that even if they are freed from the evil of material existence, they will not become good spirits, but evil spirits, because they are already evil in this life.

The paragraphs that follow confirm that Jesus was no symbolic spirit-being, and the rest of the letter is basically a catalog of proofs that the New Agers are full of bunk, while also proving that the gospel accounts were already common knowledge.

Ignatius also mentions wild animals a couple of times, and this is ironic, because he was being brought to Rome to be executed by being eaten alive.

""For what does it profit, if any one commends me, but blasphemes my Lord, not owning Him to be God incarnate? He that does not confess this, has in fact altogether denied Him, being enveloped in death."" - That last phrase ""being enveloped in death"" in Ignatius' original Greek literally says, ""but he is a necrophore"", that is, a bearer of a dead body, as in a pall-bearer. But recall the opening words of this letter, ""Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus"", where the name (nickname) Theophorus literally means God-bearer. I think Ignatius is making a subtle joke about the difference between being a God-bearer and a corpse-bearer. Because if Jesus was definitely a real live human being as Ignatius keeps insisting on all throughout this letter, but you deny that Jesus was God incarnate, you might as well preach a dead Jesus. (Trivia: If necrophore means corpse-bearer and Theophorus means God-bearer, what does the name Christopher mean?)

The rest of the letter is an important witness to the existence of the threefold hierarchy that got established in Acts (bishop-presbyter-deacon) and of the centrality of the role of the bishop in the church community."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1389079877.0,"It's easy to say, ""We won't do it again."" A lot of times people will go into threesomes with that idea, and their completely unprepared for the reality of it. You're going to be watching your boyfriend have sexual interactions with other women. You may think you're okay with that now, but thinking about it and experiencing it are on entirely different levels. 

If you realize you can't handle watching your boyfriend fuck another girl, you really thing ""not doing it again"" is going to make you feel better? You can't take that memory back. These are the situations that can destroy a relationship if not handled properly. 

When you open a relationship, intention is key. If you're just doing it to make him happy, most likely you're going to end up miserable. Maybe not, but 99% of the time that's what happens. The most successful open relationships (which is essentially what you are if you are having threesomes) work because both partners want it. 

My suggestion: Take this *slow.* First, find a girl who you're comfortable with. Hang out with the three of you and see how you feel. If you're comfortable, add some flirting. Then maybe some kissing, then heavy petty, ect. DON'T DO THIS ALL AT ONCE! This should be in weeks steps. It should take a few months going from finding girl to fucking girl. This way if you start to feel uncomfortable you can put an end to it before it gets to far. It's easier to deal with your boyfriend kissing another girl than having sex with another girl. Also, NO ALCOHOL! Do not involve that at all. It will impair all of your judgments, and instead of taking it slow you might do 0 to 60 when you're not ready. 

Seriously take this slow. It will be your best chance at having success. "

Montuckian,Foodforthought,1389080025.0,"&gt; “Gifted children are a precious human-capital resource,” said Lubinski, who has spent four decades studying talented individuals ***to correlate exceptional early SAT scores with achievement later in life.***

That's a scary sentence.  Let's go find the future leaders of the free world by who can best rub their belly and pat their head at the same time.

Simply tell her that you are somewhat aware that there is an issue and that as her partner and someone considering a future with her, you want to know about it.

Don't apologize for snooping or for asking, since you are doing this to try and help your relationship."

superjerry,depression,1389080171.0,"I don't think you're being an attention whore. I think you have a healthy thirst for human affection, just like anyone else. However, those longings come with an overpowering sense of shame -- shame of both your desires for someone to listen (which you can't control) and you feeling like shit (which you can't control). The only things that are in your control are your actions, which might be why you choose to fake grin and laugh even though you are feeling depressed. Feeling in control of a situation oftentimes feels better than not feeling in control.

You mention an addiction to your own suffering. Do you know why you feel like shit? Sometimes when our emotions are uncontrollable or unexplainable, we ruminate (because they are confusing, and we want to know why they are there) and keep drawing back to them in order to solidify their existence, in a way justifying their presence in our lives. If they exist, they have to have a reason to exist, right? Well, sometimes it's not that easy, and even if it were, it's not your fault you feel bad. *Don't feel bad for feeling bad.* You are allowed to have your own emotions.

If you want to open up to someone about it, ask yourself what might happen:  

* *that person makes fun of your problems.* Chances are, you don't want that kind of person being in your life anyway. Move on from them.
* *that person listens.* This is something you think you'd feel good about, right?

Unfortunately, there *are* some shitty people out there who will laugh at your problems no matter how close you think they are to you. However, a good portion of the population are not assholes, so it's more than likely that the person you think is a good friend of yours actually is a good friend, and good friends will listen to your problem if you ask them nicely and are considerate of their time. Therapy is always an option.

You could also try using the anonymity of the web to seek help from internet strangers, either here on reddit or on forums dealing with depression or other mood issues. You'd be surprised how much better you feel actually giving your problems substance and expressing them to someone else, and the anonymity reduces whatever social anxiety-related risk you might think there will be.

Sorry for the essay. I wish you luck!"
