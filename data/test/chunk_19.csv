Crecy333,sex,1389219182.0,"IT's a primal thing. Men see a healthy, fit woman as a suitable mate for offspring. Large breasts, good for feeding offspring.

Many taboo things can be seen back through primal urges.

For example, girls used to be married and having kids at 13 or 14 (and not in the ghetto!!) and it was seen as natural because they were physically maturing. That was the primal side. Now, laws dictate that they wait until about 17-18 (depending where you're at) when they're mentally mature.

Primitive tribes still see it as a sexual thing, defining a healthy mate, but it's not as intimate as the vagina. They're not used until reproduction, and then only by the offspring.
So it's a visual thing, not physical."

The whole system is complicated as fuck with individual districts, county lists and a national lists. Oh, and some ""fragment votes"" calculated from the lost votes in the individual districts. The balance was recently shifted towards individual districts because it favors the largest voting block (as in: fidesz, the governing party).

Also, previously there were two turns, if no individual candidate got 50%+1 votes in the first round then the voting for the individual candidates was repeated two weeks later with a first-past-the-goalpost system. In the two weeks candidates could resign, making party alliances between the two rounds possible.

Now it's only one round, first-past-the-goalpost for individual districts.

jolene_jolene_jolene,AskReddit,1389219279.0,"My dad should be my best friend. I act like him, I took after him, and I'm the only one who actually likes him. When my friends meet him, they always laugh about how we're the same person and I laugh with them but it's bittersweet. 

Because my Dad hates me, and I don't know why!

When I showed a talent for singing (like him), he never really saw me perform and after hearing me croon along to something on the radio, he clicked in disgust and said I had lost my voice. I didn't sing after that for years, because he was amazing and he said I was terrible so why bother?

When I did normal kid stuff, he would scream at me and humiliate me. Really, like, just bludgeon me for nothing while my sisters got a little warning or sometimes even a laugh. I was stupid, they were precocious.
So somehow they were just endearing and I was obnoxious, which led to a nagging feeling that people might smile at me, but they're just being polite and I'm really just terrible.

I would chatter at him about some silly dream or something and he 
would tell me to stop lying or to shut up. So, I realized that I didn't have anything to say and stopped talking.

 I tried to play the sport he did growing up but he ruined that for me, too, by picking me up from a tournament in a huff and then bullying me about how shitty we all were all the way home. So I stopped, because who cares I was shit anyway.

The bipolar I inherited from him was weakness, because it hadn't ruined HIS life -- until it did, and then he hated me for controlling it better. I tried to help him, but how could I? He wouldn't listen to me. I was shit for brains anyway, how could I help? I stopped with my meds and my therapy for way too long because my progress didn't impress him so why bother? 

When I was mutilating as a teen, he picked me up from school after I was found out and told me he knew the whole time. In retrospect he was just trying to control the situation, but as a depressed 13 year old (Actually, a 13 year old in the throes of her first depressive episode) I was stunned. I didn't stop self harming because he didn't care so why should I? It took awhile to conquer that one. 

So, my father hates me. He bullies me into things and then hates me regardless of the outcome. He loves and lavishes my daughter with attention, despite yelling at me and bullying me so badly during my pregnancy I almost went into fucking labor. 

I have no clue why he hates me so much, but It sucks that I've been so jaded and warped by it. I used to crave his approval and affection but I don't care anymore. I can't hate him because for some reason I still love him, but I can't try to make him love me anymore and I kind of hate him for being so awful.

tl;dr: My father fucking hates me."

crazyeddie123,aspergers,1389219357.0,"Are you looking for talking points to convince him to have kids?

Anyway, I didn't know about AS when I started having kids.  I thought I would be pretty good at it.  I knew what not to do (thanks mom), I knew what to do (thanks dad), I'd always gotten along with little kids, I loved math and science and was good at it and wanted to talk about it to my kids and that (plus genetics) would cause them to be the same way and the world needed more kids like that.

Turned out I was wrong on just about every one of those points (well, except for the world desperately needing more people who love and are good at math and science).  Having extra people living there and demanding constant attention fried my brain, and I couldn't really explain or justify it or even understand what was going on with me.  None of them shared my love or aptitude for math or science.  I could explain stuff when asked, but only keep it up for a little while (see ""brain fried"" above), but I couldn't remember to check on their homework and see how it was going or consistently make sure they kept doing it.  I'm crap at encouraging or motivating people.  I can't tell when they're being lazy or when they're genuinely having trouble with something, so I have no idea how much to put the screws to them or what expectations I should expect them to meet.  They ask for stuff and I don't know how much to say ""yes"" or say ""no"" and I'm pretty much just guessing.  Maybe I'm spoiling them rotten.  Maybe I'm depriving them.  I don't know.

Plus keeping up with work is hard and took up a lot more of my time than it should have, so my kids got even less attention growing up.  I grew up trying to avoid getting attention from my parents and ended up with kids that actually wanted my attention, a lot more of it than I was capable of giving them.

I was pretty good at teaching one of them to drive so far, mainly because she really really wanted to learn and kept asking to drive me places.

Accessoirement, Il ne ferait pas de mal que les médias montrent vraiment ensemble les problèmes du sexisme contre les hommes et de celui contre les femmes, qui sont clairement liès.

zaelyna,raisedbynarcissists,1389219411.0,"&gt;It does avoid the entanglement issues of having to deal with the Narcs to have a relationship with the non-Narcs.

I've never had a good relationship with anyone in the FOO. Never cared to, don't want to try now. As far as I'm concerned, they're all guilty for ignoring the abuse I endured, and I want nothing to do with it.

&gt;Wait, what?! So they just called you up, left you a message saying 'Hey Zaelyna! We've never spoken before, but I want to give you piles of cash, if you just message me back with your bank info...'
That's not a Christmas gift, that's the Nigerian Prince scam!

No, no, no. This uncle had been in my life growing up. He's calling on ""behalf"" of the grandparents who want to give me a ""Christmas gift,"" and wants to know what address they should mail the cheque to. It feels to me like an all-inclusive mind trap. Once he gets the address, maybe there will be a cheque, and maybe it'll be beneficial to my SL debts. But maybe it's barely anything at all. Either way, I'm sure he'd pass the information on to the narcs, hence my epic mistrust.

&gt;As a side note, it also means if they want the loan collectors off their backs, they can just pay them directly, and don't need to go through you, so contacting you with that in mind is unnecessary. You don't need to contact your Nparents, and they don't need to contact you.

Yeah. Except in NM's mind, she has every right to get in touch with me to ""discuss options,"" because ""we don't have this money, so you need to fix this so they'll leave us alone.""

Wouldn't it be nice if they all magically paid things off for me? Maybe their manipulative mind game should lead them to the conclusion that maybe if they paid it off, I'd ""owe them"" for essentially fixing me up with shitty expensive loans and maybe I'd feel obligated to call them up and ""thank"" them for solving a problem they led me into.

Wow, okay, I'm digging up new memories of NM telling me how much I ""owe"" her for helping out every now and then with finances while in college. I need to step away for awhile before this memories lead me somewhere bad."

When I found out about all of this I was heartbroken and left him. Now it was more the lying and deception that hurt me. He never gave me the chance to make up my mind if his lifestyle was something I could accept. He just hid it from me and lied about it which put me at risk due to his lying and cheating.

4) I think professional athletes are overpaid, but I know that College Sports kids don't get paid, but the colleges make a ton of money off the ones that make it. The ones who get too hurt? Oh well, sorry kid, not everyone can be a champ.

What makes a CEO so fantastic? What makes them worth almost a thousand other employees?

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AskReddit,1389219609.0,"Biggest one ( and kudos to you if you realise this), 

Nature doesn't care about our happiness, it only uses happiness as a way for us to do its bidding.

This is sadly very true and very sad, we all have a ""will to life"" but we exist not as a way of maximising our own happiness, but by playing the game according to the rules that have long been set out by the harsh realities of mother nature, ultimately that means we eternally chase happiness as a permanent end goal, never actually achieving it, but on the way we do what is necessary to continue the journey for the next generation.

saddest but most true one here i am afraid.

Crawl spaces, basements, attics, etc. Another area of risk is anything that runs inside an exterior wall (common with kitchen sinks). 

The big problem is then with flooding. You don't actually encounter a problem when it's coldest - when the pipe is frozen, the ice is plugging the line. When it warms back up, however, the water will be entering areas it's not supposed to with the full force of your water system. This can result in substantial (into the 10s of thousands of dollars) damage to the interior of the residence, and quite quickly - ruined flooring, walls, belongings; basements and crawls flooding; potential long term mold damage from high humidity."

Thread in question since it's IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SUB: http://www.reddit.com/r/transgender/comments/1ummc3/are_living_dolls_men_who_wear_feminine_rubber/

\*ahem*

I feel that crossdressing isn't really in the same category as the other concepts under the traditional trans umbrella. While crossdressing can be something that leads to someone realizing that they aren't cis, that alone isn't enough to be under the umbrella, particularly because many (perhaps most?) crossdressers think of themselves as cis.

Crossdressing (in the ""I am a crossdresser"" sense) strikes me as being a fetish/kink, similar to other dressing kinks (latex, diapers, etc). As such, crossdressing by itself doesn't really play into gender identity, which is central to being under the transgender umbrella.

That's not to say that you can't be a crossdresser *and* trans in some way - for example, Eddie Izzard said something along the lines of ""I'm 70% man, 30% woman"" and speaks about their crossdressing. I have no problem with Eddie being under the trans umbrella, because they aren't exactly cis. :P"

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389219895.0,"&gt;She asked, but for clarification both her family and mine insisted a lot. I did it with mixed feelings, but it was my decision.

But why does this matter from her perspective?  They all insisted, fine, you had mixed feelings, okay, but you never said that you told anyone.  If you didn't feel right, then you could have said no, or *at the very least* told her that you were comfortable with it but you'd do it for her.  It was completely understandable that she thought you were cool with everything because it seems like you didn't say otherwise.  You can't blame that on her.

&gt;You seem to put a lot of focus about ""lying"" in that conversation. But I don't see it as such.

How do you not?

&gt;Nothing special, I told her that I was okay (I wasn't) 

And I'm not even putting emphasis on it, I'm just presenting it as what happened, because it did.  You could have told her that you weren't okay, but instead, you said you were fine.  If I ask my buddy if I could date his sister, and he says it's fine, and then I do and he gets furious, who would be at fault?

&gt;before finding out that she had a boyfriend.

But again, not her fault.  Maybe she would have broken it to you a little more gently if she thought you weren't doing well, but she thought everything was okay.  

&gt;I don't see it that way. She knew that I was going about to see it, acted weird because what she was going to do and proceeded accordingly.

Acted weird?  She made sure you were okay before you found out.  I'd say that isn't weird, it's thoughtful.  She changed her status so that you'd see it without having to rub it in your face.  Either way you would find out, so what's the difference?  ""Oh, by the way, I'm seeing someone now.  It'll be on my facebook and in my picture soon.""  Is that what you need?  Because it really changes nothing, it's not much better, and you find out either way.  There's not really a whole lot she could have done to ease into it - it's a harsh truth to you, you just gotta deal with it.

It's hard now because you're emotional.  The whole thing is frustrating because despite what you've told her, you're not okay yet, you haven't been okay, and you needed more time.  And you had *so many chances*.

""I don't think we should see each other anymore, what do you think?""

""Yeah, that makes sense, things have been dying out.  I still need some time though, I agree that things aren't good between us, but I still need to get over everything.""

""Can you watch my cat?  I really need the help.""

""I don't know if that's a good idea, I'm okay, but I still need some time to deal with how I feel about things.""

""Hey, how are you, are you doing okay?  Are you sure?""

""Well, I'm...okay I guess.  I still need time.  I'm not great, but I'll be okay, it's just rough at first, ya know?""

I mean really, so many chances...

And you really *really* shouldn't feel betrayed."

I have to say, I consider the super-liberal, generally science-accepting form of Christian (or religious person in general) to be the least objectionable. But in a way, I respect them even less. They are so desperate to cling to the notion of their god while somehow shoehorning it into a reasonable and modern worldview that they cherry-pick beliefs to a truly egregious level, essentially defining their religion around what they like in order to be comfortable, rather than having the honesty to admit that their religion is full of fallacies, contradictions, and atrocities.

lobstertainment,makinghiphop,1389220058.0,"&gt; When working with vocals like this you and specially someone like Buckshot that like to emphasise words and do certain pitch drops here and there. You hit those parts sometimes but at some intervals you miss them completely and your beat don't pay respect to the vocal under it. Using vocals is more then throwing them on and I feel you understand that, or I hope you do, you just missed it a few times. The vocals also don't seem to really get the space they need in the mix, fixed with some vocal ducking or EQing.

Word, I started with just adding a few lines to cut up and throw in here and there, but I liked the way it sounded, so I just put the whole thing in. I didn't really do any eq'ing or anything for the vocals. I definitely see what you mean though, and will keep it in mind for the future.

&gt; Otherwise it all works nicely. The drums sound old school, and I guess that's what you was going for. The bass is thick and warm. Not sure if I like the combination of those two that well, put that's more personal opinion than anything else, since they come from two different styles. Good work.

Thanks man, and thanks for the really detailed feedback; I appreciate it.

Yeah definitely going for that old school feel on the drums. Regarding the bass: I'd love to have a vibe like RZA made on Tical (think Biscuits, All I Need, etc) where he had this kind of heady stoner vibe with heavy bass and classic drums, but I'm not sure how to get there. Advice?

The difference between people like those fucks and me is not that I'm some brain-dead social justice warrior, it's that I'm open-minded enough and well-educated enough to recognize their are opinions other than my own and that some things I find funny others might find offensive.

I thought the packaging was funny as hell, but part of me recognized that I probably wouldn't find it so funny if I was black and used to being mocked for my hair.

The coaches actually know what they're doing and have decent programming, we run a conjugate system and throw in 5/3/1 for extra volume. Pricey, but it's a hell of a gym.

3) You're asking the wrong guy. 

4) I use wind. Dirt cheap and service sucks on the outskirts and in my basement suite. But literally dirt fuckin' cheap + unlimited canada wide calling so I can keep in touch with folks back home.

5) Mark's sells good boots. My employer gave me a gift card for Factory Shoe Outlet on Upper James, haven't been yet but it looks decent. I recently ordered a couple pairs of Converse from Foot Locker in Lime Ridge Mall.

teekaycee,CoDCompetitive,1389220132.0,"This place has become pretty unbearable. Both sides of the coin are going about things the wrong way:

The OpTic fans catch a lot of hate (some deserved, some undeserved) and on the flip side you've got the oh-so oppressed ""omg I got down voted jus b/c of my coL flair!!!!"" kids who fall victim to second-option bias.

No one can be a fan of CoD anymore, it's always gotta be OpTic vs. coL, Nade vs. Crim, etc. 

To jump off the coL topic, I have a theory as to why more and more kids here are siding with the compLexity guys' antics:

Aches and Crim (not including Teepee because he keeps a low profile) appeal to the majority of redditors because these kids can identify with them. Upper-middle class white kids who play video games and ""troll for the lulz"" is much more easy to relate to and defend than being a humble and classy player.

Moreover, the way people here talk about Teanah is disgusting. Sure she's a terrible community manager, sure she doesn't interact with you guys the way you'd like but imagine if you had to deal with thousands of 12 year olds tweeting you 50 times a day. I'd like to attribute this to the immaturity of the community but at times it feels that it's because she's a girl you guys feel that you can talk down to her.

Just because that is how ""it works"", doesn't mean its okay. [This idea that people should be paid for their work, isn't some revolutionary, edgy idea that only I hold, either.](http://inplainsight.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/02/20262899-no-one-should-have-to-work-for-free-is-this-the-end-of-the-unpaid-internship)

&gt;“If … you want to pursue an internship with a for-profit employer, there aren’t going to be many circumstances where you can have an internship and not be paid and still be in compliance with the law,” 

   -Nancy J. Leppink, acting director of the Labor Department's wage and hour division.


&gt;The internship should be of a fixed duration, established prior to the outset of the internship.  Further, unpaid internships generally should not be used by the employer as a trial period for individuals seeking employment at the conclusion of the internship period.  If an intern is placed with the employer for a trial period with the expectation that he or she will then be hired on a permanent basis, that individual generally would be considered an employee under the FLSA.[^source](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm)

**Here are the 6 conditions that must be met to legally have someone as an unpaid intern**[^source1](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm)[^,source2](http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEGL/TEGL12-09acc.pdf) :

1. The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment

2. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern

3. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff

4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded

5. The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship

6. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.

Every one of these 6 stipulations must be met to legally work as an unpaid intern. **If you are currently an ""intern"" and your employer is not meeting all of these conditions, you should [contact your state's DOL](http://www.dol.gov/dol/location.htm) directly.** You may be entitled to compensation for the work you have done.

Its not even like you are being an ""apprentice"" these days. I'd argue strongly that most interns don't even learn actual skills. They're simply doing shit work. If you were taken and being taught one-on-one, then that may be different, and sure, there are companies that do it that way, but the vast majority do not. **If your ""employer"" directly benefits from you being an intern and you are not paid, that is illegal.** Your work legally must only serve your own interests. 

It baffles me as to why you are so against the idea of being paid for the work you did for a company. Are you really that thick? I'm trying to argue that you deserved to get paid for your work, and you're telling me that you didn't. Like what?

And another huge problem is that unpaid interns aren't protected by employment discrimination laws, but that issue is for another time..."

This is why the gameplay informs the story, and what sets it above other games even in the same vein as TLOU.  That is what it does better than previous games, and that is also what it does that a movie can not do.

silverionmox,environment,1389220358.0,"&gt; Well if you look at cumulative pollution, the US and Europe would be the biggest polluters by far.

China is catching up *very* rapidly though. Personally I favor an approach where every country is responsible for sequestration proportional to its historical emissions from the moment we started emitting more than the ecosphere could swallow. Anyone dragging their feet with reducing their emissions will just have to spend more on the cleanup afterwards.

&gt;If you sheet pollution home to the buyers of the manufactured goods that created that pollution then it is Western countries that ""own"" that pollution.

Well, they own the profits... shall we charge for the benefits of the technology we developed too? If they want to make us pay so dearly for the emissions, they're free to slap a carbon tax on their dirty products."

Both are minorities, but nigger is shortened from negro, which is specific only to African races, and has only ever been used to refer to those who have ancestry as African slaves.

Maori oppression has never been nearly as bad as Black oppression, and claiming that it has is a mockery to all the civil rights work done by blacks in America. Maori were never enslaved, Maori were never segregated in such a way similar to blacks, Maori rights are in great shape compared to other minority rights in other countries. 

Your entire post is a sad attempt at trying to make me appear a racist, bigoted villain when you don't know any facts behind the scenario at all.

So if there is more people doing well and not needing the programs then the pendulum will swing to the right, then when there are more people in poverty who need the programs the pendulum swings back left.

For example: I have a high school dropout, libertarian friend who is working minimum wage. Previously he was fully libertarian and against the government intervening in everything including minimum wage. But now that he's making minimum wage and sees that it's not near enough to support yourself on (especially if you're not able to get 40hrs/week) he's changed his mind about minimum wage but not about all the other things he hasn't personally experienced."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1389220624.0,"Are you asking when she said in the post she didn't want to go, or when she said it to him? She did say she would have turned him down if he asked, and if he's been dating her for two years he would probably know her well enough to assume correctly on this matter (which he did).

Saying that he took her choice, like I said before, indicates that he was deciding what he wanted to do without taking her feelings in consideration at all. If he knew she wouldn't want to go then that's not the case. I'm not saying he did the right thing (in fact I've said many time he didn't...). However, there's a huge difference between, ""I'm going to go regardless of your feelings,"" and making the right assumption but handling it poorly.  

&gt; And if he asked to take OP now, Its only damage control- He is asking BECAUSE OP is upset- Have OP swallowed it, he wouldn't have asked at all.

You're making a huge assumption there. His original thought was that OP wouldn't want to go. He didn't think she would care and that's why he didn't plan for her to go. While it could be damage control, it could also be him realizing that she does in fact care. Of course he wouldn't have asked her if she didn't voice her concern, because he wouldn't have known that she wanted to go. If she had voiced that she wanted to go on vacation with him before hand, and he did this, I would agree. However, this is a guy who sounds more clueless than anything. That's easier to fix then someone who just does whatever he wants despite other people's feelings."

So specifically be careful for any hoses, as we had a line that went through the top of the garage out to the hose.  That froze in a cold spell (it's supposed to be closed off for the winter, but hadn't been yet) and several days later leaked all over the garage.  Thousands of dollars of damage to everything stored there.

The water main is most likely under enough pressure and far enough under ground to avoid freezing.  Most likely.  I live in Seattle, so I'm 99.999% confident of that here, but far less so in colder climates.

As others have said, leaving water running helps for two reasons.  1) it keeps the water moving, making it less likely it freezes.  2) If it does freeze, the water has somewhere to expand to, which prevents the pipes from ~~freezing~~ bursting.

The snow in NZ can be pretty fickle and we don't have any major towns/cities where the snow hangs around for more than a few days after a snowfall. We don't get constant snow throughout the winter season - just periodic storms that precipitate as snow at higher levels when the conditions are right. At best you can get about a week's warning for a decent snow fall and they could happen anywhere between June and August (inclusive). Sometimes you get big ones outside of those months but it'll have to be a pretty big Antarctic storm.

It sounds like you'll want to base yourself in Queenstown. You can shoot up the hills to play in the snow and there's a lot to do with the family. It's a major tourist destination. 

There are some other options such as Lake Tekapo (less shopping, close to the Alps/Lakes) and such as Christchurch (much further away from the snow: 1-2 hours depending on when the snow falls).

Late July might be your best bet but it's by no means guaranteed. "

SPRX97,OldTimeHockey,1389221014.0,"&gt; I think your tinkering with goalie points will devalue them too much. As it stands, the goalie category is a roll of the dice, you typically either get around 9 points, or you get negative 2 points (Like Rask gave me last night). If you believe the category needs to be adjusted, I would at least leave the point value of saves the same, and I would raise the value of a shutout.

I'm fine with stud goalies being good like stud skaters, but the fact that esseintial EVERY starting goalie and many often-played backups are better than the best skaters is a bit silly IMO... 

and the fact that they start only 60-75% of the time is irrelevant, as a goalie who does not start gets a 0 factored into their average. The only true outliers are the goalies who have been hurt or called up.

One time (and only one time) my shoes got wet and squeaked when I walked down the hall. People commented on it to me for weeks after.

So when you're a kid in school, cumulative empirical evidence is that people are in fact paying attention to you and judging every little detail.

But in adult life, people just don't do this.  They have their own problems and, even if they are petty and picky enough to notice your minor superficial details, the vast majority are decent enough not to comment.  So the more time you have in adulthood, the more cumulative experience you have of people not nitpicking you, until eventually it only becomes a tiny insignificant sliver of your life."

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1389221145.0,"Good question. [Here] (http://stats.nba.com/playerTrackingDrives.html?pageNo=1&amp;rowsPerPage=100&amp;sortField=DVS&amp;sortOrder=DES) is the link. 

Here is the definition:

&gt;Drives: Any touch that starts at least 20 feet of the hoop and is dribbled within 10 feet of the hoop and excludes fast breaks. Measures the total number of drives as well as the points, assists and shooting percentages on drives to the basket.

I would assume catching the ball on either a **cut** and catching the ball **at the free throw line** (extended) and then driving both don't count. I'm not sure exactly why we LBJ would be better at these versus regular drives though (and if he is, other players probably are as well). It also doesn't include **post moves** which is potentially a big part of LBJ's inside scoring (though I can't imagine him shooting over 77% in the post, so it probably doesn't bring his average closer to 77%).

Also worth noting that Goldsberry's piece uses shots up to 8 feet for that 77% calculation, whereas the NBA.com's stat uses shots up to 10 feet. Perhaps LBJ has a steep drop off in percentage at that 9-10 feet mark, or perhaps it's still relatively high (e.g. ~55%) but there's a higher usage at that area. Personally, from the few Heat games I've watched, I'm more inclined to think he gets a disproportionate amount of breakaway dunks compared to other players, but I don't have the numbers to verify my intuition.

I'm finishing my third playthrough of the game right now, on survivor, and I think the gameplay still remains strong. The scarcity of equipment really makes you vary up how you are going to attack and conserve your ammo. The stealth gameplay that devolves into running, hiding, and brutal violence is tense and fun. 

The final environment is perhaps the least fun to play in, but I think that is more how it is constructed (much less open than other areas you get to be in) than the gameplay itself being bad or tiresome. The robust multiplayer that is very repayable that plays really differently than everything else out there is more proof that the gameplay itself is quite good. "

Everything before Prince, the player is given bonuses to all kinds of things.

Everything past Prince, the AI is given bonuses to all kinds of things - especially their start scenario (free techs, units, etc). 

The early advantage is what gives AI the upper hand in the higher difficulty levels more than anything else. They get some other bonuses to growth and barbarian combat and happiness, but the techs and units at the start are the key. This means they can start building wonders and found religions faster (as OP suggested).

This also means, in order to win at this difficulty, you're going to spend some time playing catch up. And until you've caught up, yeah - some stuff is going to be inaccessible. But that only *necessarily* applies to the early game. It doesn't have to apply to the entire game.

almightybob1,truetf2,1389221290.0,"&gt; Relax, we're not randomly adding in weapons without discussing it with the community first.

I just went back through the news posts on ETF2L, and before the [S17 announcement](http://etf2l.org/2014/01/05/announcing-season-17-powered-by-blackout-gaming-signups-open/) the most recent post mentioning 6s whitelists was [this one from the end of November](http://etf2l.org/2013/11/28/some-whitelist-changes-and-staff-updates/), which does not mention Season 17 changes or the newly unlocked weapons at all. So it wasn't posted to the front page of ETF2L.

Nor is there a Season 17 thread anywhere in the [feedback forum](http://etf2l.org/forum/feedback/), where I would expect to find a thread if you are seeking discussion and feedback on unlock changes.

So can I ask where and when you asked the ETF2L community or discussed the new unlocks before adding them? Because I knew nothing about it until S17 was announced, and certainly don't feel like we were consulted or presented with the proposed changes."

Fahris,asktransgender,1389221296.0,"Yeah, well, those sources also include transsexual, which a lot of trans men and women don't identify with (myself included).

The reasoning there is that the word transsexual does a couple things:

1. makes it easy to associate being trans with sexual orientation

2. implies that that person has had genital surgery of some kind

The result is that people assume we're just *really really gay*, ""freaks"", and people don't understand that it's about gender identity. Furthermore, it perpetuates people thinking of ~transsexuals~ needing ~the surgery~, and further others us, as well as excluding pre-op and non-op people.

Actually, 1 billion years is until the sun's output makes it a relatively safe assumption complex life will not be able to survive on Earth in all but the most impractically controlled environments, even at the poles. However, this assumption only takes into consideration the sun's life cycle, and its a relatively safe bet.

Somewhat less safe but still fairly certain is that in even as little as 300 million years the sun's slightly increased output's effects on the Earth's biosphere make prediction stupidly hard. But most scientists will bet you by 500 million years MAXIMUM, the Earth will be more or less uninhabitable for the vast majority of life as we know it, most certainly including humans. In fact, even many microorganisms will feel the pressure to survive. 

So if 500my is a definite no for humanity. Then even 100my later, modern civilization as it exists now cannot exist.
Hell, there will certainly be catastrophic natural events to occur in the next million years.

SonoftheMorning,alpinism,1389221324.0,"I'm in Eastern Washington.  The climb was Heart of Stone (5.10, 500 feet, 5 pitches, grade II) at Banks Lake, You can find more info in Rick Labelle's Rock Climbs of Central Washington.  It's regarded as a classic of the area.  The climb itself was great, but the approach was a nightmare.  I highly recommend approaching from the water in a canoe unless you have a capable off road vehicle to carry you along the north shore to the peninsula that holds the Orange Wall.  Even then, the foot approach from the north is hard and extremely dangerous.

It really all depends on that is meant by controversial, I suppose.

I haven't run the numbers on your scenario, but I suspect an issue with it.  The primary benefit of Golden Cookies is the ability to stack Frenzy and Lucky.  Introducing even 33% Red Cookies will lead to a rather significant drop in the frequency of that benefit, which may outweigh the bonuses your strategy introduces.  I can't be sure though, as I haven't done the calculations.

I believe the wisdom that Red Cookies are better than Golden Cookies is from the pre-Wrinkler/Reindeer era, where you would not have been able to benefit from the combination of the 6x income bonus from 10 Wrinklers, the x666 to income from E. Frenzy and the insane bonus from popping a Reindeer during E. Frenzy.

foxesforsale,ffxiv,1389221594.0,"**PUG**: A Pick-Up Group. A group where you ""pick up"" other members, generally not from your guild/free company/linkshell in order to complete content. Similarly, a person who joins a pick-up group is also called a ""Pug"". eg. ""Man we had 2 pugs join us, and we thought they were going to be terrible but they were pretty great in the end."" or ""I'm gonna join a pug for Odin."" or ""Yeah we're pugging it from here"" (probably either meaning getting PUGs to fill empty spots, or going to join a PUG themselves - context dependent).

**MT** (in chat): Mis-tell. Said after someone posted something in the wrong sort of chat (ie. stuck something in /party that was meant to go in /fc)

**Macro** -  an internal script written in FFXIV that allows you to run sequences of commands with one button click. Can be used for combat abilities, crafting, inventory management, putting notifications in chat, switching HUD settings, etc. Worth investigating once you've got the other MMO stuff down ;)

**LB** - Limit Break. If dropped in chat during a boss of a dungeon, it's usually asking one of the dps to use their Limit Break power. ""tank LB"" or ""heals LB"" are usually specified, as they require more specific situations. 

**DPS race**: A fight that requires you to kill the enemy before something automatically happens that kills everyone, as opposed to a regular boss where you fight until you die or they die. Ifrit is a good example - you have to kill the Nail that appears before he starts to cast his ulimate ability, or the party wipes. That's a DPS race.

**CD** - cooldown. variant: gcd, for global cooldown. The timer between using big abilities - eg. Shroud of Saints has a 180s cooldown. Comes up as ""wait up, need 20s before starting boss, cds"" ie. the player wants all their abilities ready to use before the next fight. Also refers to the abilities themselves that have cooldowns. eg. ""if he uses that attack and I have no MP, can you pop some of your defensive cds"" or ""Bard you gotta save your cds for the second phase"" etc."

Mom's side was definitely easier (got back to the 1500s) and found out some really cool stuff (Thomas Edison is my 1st cousin 4x removed).  I feel more 'connected' to my Slovak side, but I literally had nothing to go on because my dad didn't talk to his family in PA and he passed away when I was 14.

WinterCharm,apple,1389221688.0,"Well, it *is* a weird alloy that turns into a bulk metallic glass with optimal properties. 

In a sense, it's the height of material science, where chemical properties AS WELL as processing are what make it what it is. 

From Wikipedia: 

A range of zirconium-based alloys have been marketed under the Vitreloy™  trade name (an early Bulk Metallic Glass). Some example compositions are listed below, in molar percent:

An early alloy, Vitreloy 1:[10]
Zr: 41.2 Be: 22.5 Ti: 13.8 Cu: 12.5 Ni: 10

A variant, Vitreloy 4 (Vit4):
Zr: 46.75 Be: 27.5 Ti: 8.25 Cu: 7.5 Ni: 10

Vitreloy 105 (Vit105):[11]
Zr: 52.5 Ti: 5 Cu: 17.9 Ni: 14.6 Al:10

A more recent development (Vitreloy 106a), which forms glass under less rapid cooling:
Zr: 58.5 Cu: 15.6 Ni: 12.8 Al: 10.3 Nb: 2.8


The difference is... in Liquidmetal™ Ti is added to the vitreloy mix, and possibly some other metals, which I have no idea of - because it's completely proprietary and I don't have access to that data... 

But basically, once you form a melt of these metals, you then have to rapidly cool it so the phase change can occur. :)  If you don't cool it quickly enough, you just form a normal crystalline metallic alloy - and lose out on the rigidity and hardness. "

tamasuperstar,reddevils,1389221795.0,"It's pretty clear that there is a problem with Moyes motivating the older players.

However they need to man up to be honest. Yes it was absolutely stupid for Moyes to sack the coaching staff and completely overhaul everything so quickly but the players need to fucking get behind him.

It's one thing for the fans to get behind Moyes, but it's more important for the fucking players to.



This is the only way I see Moyes getting sacked, and I think it is a legit risk. I think players like Rio (Who I have a hunch is one of the worse for this) need to be moved on. I think they're massively making the ""Working in Fergies shadow"" issue worse.

While food is a necessity, since there are many kinds of food, competition makes more sense. This is not true with healthcare.

And the last I checked I dont need to go to an insurance company to buy a bag of rice at a decent rate. 

&gt;Not all of which are single payer. Hell, 31% of Singapore's healthcare spending is via government compared to 45-50% for the US.

Tuccker,edmproduction,1389221853.0,"Mixing is the most subjective thing in music, don't listen to what other people are telling you is law. When you mixdown your own song there is a 100% chance you already have an idea of how you want it to sound; ""I want the drums to be present, punchy and up front with the bass and everything else behind them"", ""I want the chords to be bright and in your face and only the kick should be punching through, the snare can be subdued"" etc. If you want your kick to be the loudest thing, mix it that way, but if you want your leads/pads/bass/vocals the be the loudest element, then mix it like that instead. 

Generally nothing should be peaking past -6dB when you're mixing, so your mix as a whole should have a decent amount of headroom. If you're new to music production though, just focus on making music first because the art of mixing is a whole different beast."

Look, you're preaching to the choir here.  I made the decision to not purchase a diamond.

But my stone is double refractive, and not everyone likes double refraction.  Maybe you prefer an antique cut or an antique diamond.  Maybe the physical properties of diamonds are interesting to you.  Maybe your mother or your grandmother had a diamond, and you want the same type of stone as she has.

ClearlySituational,Warthunder,1389221970.0,"&gt;The XP-50 can climb really well but...that's it.

First of all, you're not taking into account what good climbing gives you. First, it gives you an energy advantage. But more importantly, it lets you pick and choose your battles. If the nearest aircraft to your altitude is 4 klicks under you, you're under tiered. 

&gt;The plane did not do well in era 4.

I always saw this plane have at least one kill every match I saw it in when against it in my K4, or with it in my P51 or bearcat. 

&gt;has its relatively lackluster armaments

2 20 mm cannons and 2 50 cals is NOT lackluster. 

&gt;  that it climbs very well, has strong acceleration, flies very quickly

that has era 4 written all over it

&gt;  If something looks at it funny, it explodes. 0.50s chew it apart

It shouldn't be anywhere near the front of any other aircraft, so this point is irrelevant. 

If rate of climb wasn't such an important factor, I'd be inclined to agree with you. But since it is, and is nearly the end all be all of skills in this game, this aircraft would perform perfectly fine in Era 4.

librarygirl,relationships,1389222042.0,"&gt; Its good to see people actually acknowledging people can have a mature friendship with an ex and this isn't disrespectful to current partners.

People can have this, and if so, it's great for them. Unfortunately, no matter how platonic and mature those friendships are, there are always going to be people who are uncomfortable with a previous sexual partner remaining in contact, and this shouldn't be ignored. Regardless of how ""unsexually"" you now see your ex, your current partner may have no way of seeing it like that. It's more about respecting your current partner enough to ensure they're okay with it, and if they're not, appreciating how and why. It's by no means irrational to be alarmed by close relationships between exes, if anything, it's natural.

That's not what I said. LBJ is an elite finisher on drives (obviously) but he's not at the top of the pack. Therefore there has to be something special about him that allows him to be literally 11% better around the rim than other players.

I'm floating around various possibilities as to why that could be. 

So no, I didn't say dribble driving isn't different from cutting; I'm saying I can't imagine why it would be **the** reason why LBJ goes from a top 5 finisher at the rim^1 to #1 (and it's not even close).

I also didn't say he's not the best finisher, just trying to figure out where that 11% gap comes from.

I am in my 2nd semester of college and was only able to do my FAFSA last year because we were still in contact. I am 100% financially independent from her, and she is my only legal parent."

That may be true, but allow the people you meet to make that call in person. Remove these details or mask them with something clever instead. You also appeal to the audience by mentioning how you dislike how women are treated these days. Remove that bit entirely as it comes off as mildly desperate. I understand your intent, but let your personality speak for itself. Also, dude...capitalize your I's and capitalize your proper nouns. Your also missing quite a few apostrophes. In fact, I think you are missing all of your apostrophes. Poor punctuation and grammar will hurt you more than you think. 

Overall, you need to interject some humor into your profile and find a few unique details about your life to keep them reading. Find a way to tell a story without being long winded. Add an element of mystery. Give women a reason to ask you questions based on the content of your profile. As it stands, the information is dull and underwhelming."

Auburn didn't go undefeated those years or win a national championship. But they were still etched in the psyche of Auburn fans for years to come, just like this whole season will be.

These kids have given us so much this season. I have said multiple times that I believe this team is my favorite of all time, not because they won a bunch of games, but because of the sheer heart that they have all shown. Many of them were humbled last year, and I think that has made them stronger as a team and stronger as men than anything else. Yes, in 2010 we were disrespected, but that team didn't know the pain and heartbreak that this team did. This team has been to Hell and back. And I love them for it.

breezy727,AskAcademia,1389222365.0,"Luckily my department as done hiring two years in a row, each time bringing in three candidates, so I've been to six of these job candidate/grad student talks. 

In most of ours we've already seen the candidate during a formal presentation of their research, so the first few minutes we spend asking questions or follow-ups to the formal presentations that we didn't feel comfortable asking in front of the actual faculty (why did you choose this theory? How did you decide to study this region). From there we often ask what kinds of classes she would want to teach and where she saw her research going in the next couple years. We talk about how she envisioned the grad student/professor relationship to go and a little about her experiences as a grad student that might be relevant to us. Generally it starts a informal Q&amp;A and becomes a casual discussion about any number of topics. 

If you're leading the discussion then, I would just let the conversation naturally progress, but make sure to nip any other students if they start getting too wordy (ex. we had one student go on for 15 minutes about an organization she wanted to work with - boring! And distracting). Most likely though the job candidate did this themselves while they were in school, so it should be a pretty easy meeting. "

screenmagnet,relationships,1389222401.0,"1. Not taking the 5 year old child into consideration when deciding whether or not to end a marriage.
2. Believing that being in a happy romantic relationship is more important than attempting to keep a family together.
3. Thinking it's totally fine to give up on a 15 year marriage at the first sign of a problem, without even attempting to fix it (the people telling him he should have dumped her/kicked her out as soon as he found out).
4. Thinking that when someone hurts you, they no longer deserve your empathy or love. (The people ridiculing him for being angry at the way the boss treated his wife).
5. People telling him to bail despite the fact that the reconciliation effort seems to be going remarkably well, and his wife is making a good faith effort to salvage the relationship.

If your spouse cheats on you, and refuses to stop, or refuses to make an effort to change and atone for what they did -- it's not selfish to leave the marriage.

If your spouse cheats on you, and the attempt to fix the marriage fails despite a serious effort from both sides -- it's not selfish to leave the marriage.

If your spouse cheats on you, and is willing and able to do what it takes to fix the marriage, but you aren't willing to give them a second chance -- you are being self-centred.

If your spouse cheats on you, and is making a good faith effort to fix things, but after a month of trying you throw in the towel even though your spouse is doing everything right -- you are being self-centred.

Six months to a year of counselling and working to repair a 15 year relationship is hardly a big sacrifice. Especially when the marriage is otherwise strong, there is progress being made, and there is a five year old child involved. People advising him to quit trying after only *a month* (in which there has already been progress, mind you) are being ridiculous. A few months of couples' counselling and difficult conversations never killed anybody."

Best case senario is that she's adapting to all that self-discipline she wanted and who she was as an individual before the Navy has been broken down and rebuilt. This is just an adjustment period and when you two are back together things will pretty much go back to normal.

Not-Jim-Belushi,studyroomf,1389222648.0,"&gt; Buzz Hickey - I think most people, including myself, expected this character to be Woody to Pierce's Coach. A retreading of the same character more or less. While we are just introduced to him, he seems more like the father figure Jeff can look up to versus Pierce being more of a cautionary tale for him. I like his attitude, and I think they can do really good things with his character. The only problem I had was how they sort of ripped down Leonard to establish Hickey. Didn't like that, but it didn't make me like Hickey any less.

I actually think Hickey is a reimagining of Pierce. Pierce existed to show Jeff what he could become if he didn't change. Hickey as well is kind of a future Jeff: he started as a temporary teacher, he's mean to Leonard, and he knows how to beat the system. In that way, he's not the Pierce we're used to, but he's the Pierce we need now

I think you're right, though. The highschool I went to was in an old building that used to house a boys-only school and had only one locker room next to the gym. Our fist year there, everyone was shocked, and we all behaved in a stereotypical way: girls would barricade themselves in the loo and guys would do all sorts of stupid shit to get a glimpse of a bra strap (which, for some reason, the girls took as a cause to immense shame).

strangestdude,relationships,1389222751.0,"&gt;The situation began last year when my best friend/room mate who was in a failing relationship initiated intimacy with me after I had gotten out of a painful/emotionally abusive 6 year relationship.

From research and experience if you've been that long in and abusive relationship your self image and boundaries are probably in the gutter.

&gt;He tells me he wants to break up with her on her terms because he can't bare to be an asshole to him.

&gt;but he yells at me for my inability to empathize with him and his situation. Saying, 'Can't you really see that I really want you? I don't want to lose you.' SO I ask him if he will still take on the boyfriend role with her, (i.e. kissing, letting her sleep over etc.) his answer was , ""Yes, for the time being, yes""

&gt;How do I deal with this? He says he loves me deeply, got on his knees and cried. Tells me he wants me to move back with him, but that he can't end things with her just yet and doesn't know when he will be able to.

It sounds like you are in another psychologically abusive relationship.

IMO and IME abusers often alternative between aggression, and pity to get you to do be they way they want you to be.

If I was you I learn to become aware of your needs, and to learn to take care your needs. (For discovering what your needs are I highly recommend the book; Non-violent communication by Marshall Rosenberg)."

merely_observing,AskMen,1389222841.0,"I really, really do appreciate what the mods are trying to do with this, but I have to admit it does make me queasy. Looking at the 'do so many men's answers make you uncomfortable' thread on AW, I'm finding the answers are divisive, with probably half of the answers stating they do find it uncomfortable. It's pretty clear that a thread for 'men of askwomen' would never be allowed to live on that sub, for their own reasons. 
With that in mind, I feel as if it's not our place as women to have a whole thread dedicated to us in a subreddit explicitly for men. You know how women complain about men posting on questions meant for them? 'As a man, I etc. etc.' This feels a trumped up version of that. It's not like the actual men are uncomfortable with us posting at all, like over there. So do we really need one stickied thread every week all to ourselves? It makes me feel like a womansplaining invader.

But I should probably just skip the weekly thread if it bothers me so much, like a normal person. And I'm sure this will help a lot of people who want to seek answers from women who differ from the general personality found on AskWomen, so good on the mods for that. I appreciate the effort."

ShamelesslyPlugged,AskMen,1389222921.0,"This is the wrong forum to be asking these kinds of questions given the demographic.  

I'm speaking in broad strokes, which means that it's mostly right but still wrong. Most men want to be with someone and don't want to die alone. You'll see some bitter people stating otherwise, but they're bitter.  

Approaching girls is scary. A minority of guys get the majority of girls in the high school/college environment, and the rest are left wanting and somewhat embittered. It's partially their fault for not trying, but it can be hard to reconcile one's sexuality with the message society gives. How is a guy supposed to make the first move and be aggressive without being rapey or creepy? It's hard for most guys to dive in and figure it out, and some that try are burned.  

I'd preface what I'm about to say with something to soften the blow, but that always comes off as cheap to me. If you're constantly single, it may be something to do with you. Are you putting yourself in a position to meet guys? Are you giving them reasons to stay away or warning signs? Do you have a mustache or bad hygiene and people who call you gorgeous are just enabling you? Are guys making subtle attempts that you are squashing or giving mixed messages to? Do you have some dudes that are following you around like puppies and are just too scared to actually pull the trigger (that was me once)? I can't tell over the internet, but it never hurts to give yourself an objective looks.  

There's no reason to not have faith in men, just like there's no reason for us here to not have faith in women (as you may see, some don't). It's just a matter of putting yourself out there, and being reasonable about it."

So here's what's up - I've got three sisters that are all significantly older than I am. I'm twenty three, my youngest sister is 31, and my other two are in their late thirties. I feel like a terrible brother not knowing their exact age, but I think they sort of prefer that anyhow.

Youngest is Jen. She's cool, always been the most social and outgoing sister. A lot of fun to hang out with. Unfortunately I think she's still a bit preoccupied with partying and whatnot, considering she has four children and the oldest is in high school. Then again, she had him young so she didn't have the same freedom I've enjoyed to be young and reckless. She saved my ass when I hit rock bottom, I'd do anything for her.  

Next up is Amy. She's cool, always been the most motherly and compassionate of my sisters. Helped me out a ton when I was a teenager and going through some shit. Not sure I'd be alive today if it weren't for her. She has a bit of codependency to her, so sometimes she'll invent problems to fix or be a bit pushy in trying to help you out, but it's all from good intentions. I don't hang out with her as much as I should, maybe I'll chill with her sometime this weekend.

Last of all is Barbara. I'm not as close to her as I am Amy and Jen, but only because of distance (she lives in Florida, I live in Maryland). She's cool, a close rival to Jen in how much fun she is to party with. She's pretty intelligent and compassionate, so she's great to vent to when you need to vent. She's also pretty damn tough and can probably outdrink most dudes (can't touch me though).

As far as our relationships go, we're family, we're close, but not *super* close. I'm closest to Jen, but that's primarily because I lived with her the longest (all three of them left at one point in time or another because they couldn't stand living with mine and Barbara's father). I try to be a cool uncle to all their kids, I hang out with Jen fairly often, Amy once a month or so, and Barbara a few times a year. I just realized how weird it's going to be when inevitably one of us moves far enough away that we don't see each other very often.

I love my sisters."

&gt;'His arm has grown long indeed,' said Gimli, 'if he can draw snow down from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away.'

paratactical,childfree,1389223172.0,"There is a special exemption for retirement communities. There is no adult only place for people who aren't in retirement age groups. There are some municipalities where owner occupied buildings of under a certain amount of units can ban children, but in rentals, family status is a protected class in the US (eg, you can't refuse to rent to someone because they are black or because they have a baby).

Edit to add source: These rules are part of the [Fair Housing Act](http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/FHLaws/yourrights).  This act sets family status as a protected class. [These laws](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/housing_coverage.php) even prohibit landlords from having sections of buildings or communities that are for families, or limiting the number of occupants in a dwelling, as long as they are a family. 

There are four exceptions to the Fair Housing Act's familal status requirements: 1) single-family houses where the owner owns no more than three houses and does not use the services of a realtor, broker, or other sale agent and does not engage in discriminatory advertising; 2) homes with fewer than four units, where the owner resides in one of those four units; 3) homes owned by a religious organization or a religious non-profit that does not discriminate on the basis of race, color or national origin; and 4) dwellings owned/operated by a private club where the dwelling is not a commercial nor primary purose of the club where access is limited or preferential to members, so long as the organization does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, or national origin. These exceptions are set out in [42 USC § 3603](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3603) &amp; [42 USC § 3604](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3604).

&gt;But, due to the nature of her career, she could easily find herself in this situation again.

Hydrogen (or more specifically, the isotope deuterium) is the weapon of choice because it is relatively easy to fuse.  Heavier nuclei can fuse under even more intense pressure, but those conditions only exist in the cores of colossal stars.

Less players is going to mean smaller maps, less game modes, less choice. The obvious decision would have been to let people decide on max/min player count, like pretty much every single other FPS MP ever invented, rather than forcing people in to a design choice that makes no sense.

librarygirl,relationships,1389223443.0,"This thread seems to have become a debate about whether or not it's appropriate for people to remain in touch with exes during new relationships. OP, this is not the point here. Everyone feels differently and neither opinion is invalid. Somebody commenting here with 'dude, it's all good, I'm friends with my exes, it's nothing to worry about!' means nothing because it's **you and your fiancees wedding**.

What's more important to your fiancee? That some old friends of hers are there (who also happen to have slept with her), or that her future husband feels happy and comfortable on his wedding day?? The fact that I would never disrespect my partner enough to put him in this position aside (because that's my personal opinion), ex-FWBs of mine wouldn't even get a look in when compared to the happiness of the man I love. ON OUR WEDDING DAY! 

Honestly, I think there's nothing wrong with exes being friends, but it is insane to make this an issue on a day of celebration of your love. It shouldn't even factor in. You don't want to have to look at guys that have bedded your bride all day? The most rational thing in the world, and I'm really concerned about her priorities. If it's her birthday/hanging out/any other event, compromise as a couple, work out a way for her to do what she wants. Wedding day? Put each other first. She needs to respect your wishes as the most important guest (except her) in attendance.

edit: just brought this up with my [29m] partner - he made a this point: do you know these guys? If her exes are so close and important to her, surely they would be part of both of your lives, too? Surely she'd see them on a regular enough basis for you to know them well and be comfortable around them?"

breezy727,AskAcademia,1389223504.0,"This isn't a lot of information, but I'm going to assume you're looking at a graduate program, and a MA/MS rather than a PhD program. 

If that is actually the case, you should actively consider looking somewhere else. In my field, international politics (and any related fields: political science, international development, non-proliferation, etc. etc.), any of the DC schools are considered to have the most well-connected programs in terms of being able to network and prepare you to drop right into a related job at the end of the program. 

While the location and networking benefits are undisputed, you'll look at spending 100K for a two-year program by the time you factor in all school expenses, rent, food, misc. living expenses. These programs often only offer one or two students per class substantial financial aid (enough to pay tuition or live on). Considering a class in many these programs is 100 students per year which is *enormous* for the field, your chances of getting any financial aid is very, very small. 

In this case you need to decide whether it's worth 100K to get a two-year degree that literally *hundreds* of other students are getting to get into a field that routinely pays low wages. 

If you are in my same field in general, this advice holds for both undergrad and grad school. If you're not in this field, then it depends and you should probably mention the field and degree so people can give you better advice. "

wordserious,AdviceAnimals,1389223530.0,"These types of threads seem to attract the kind of people who could answer my question, so sorry for the wall of text but here it goes:

I tend to drive at the speed limit, and I usually stay on the right lane unless there's good reason not to. So the other day I was traveling through Florida with my family on a rented Ford Escape. I was driving at 65 mph on the right lane of a two lane road. This was late at night so not a lot of traffic.

At some point I caught up with a truck that was driving maybe at 60. So I turned on my blinker, look back, and saw light very far away, so I started passing. Driving at 65 and trying to pass a truck driving 60 will take about ~~25~~ 15 seconds. Anyway, as I was halfway through, those lights that I had seen in the distance had caught up with us. It was a car going a hell of a lot faster than me.

It started blinking his headlights and pretty soon it was glued to my rear fender, honking and blinking lights. I could either finish passing the truck at my current speed and get out of the way, or I could accelerate and try to get out of the way faster. I opted for the first option because, frankly, I didn't want to drive extremely fast on a car that I didn't know well, on a road that I'd never been before, at night, right beside a semi. I turned on my blinker to the right, indicating that I would move to the right lane as soon as possible.

The guy behind me went berserk. He turned on his headlights, started one continuous hooooooonk on his horn, and started swaying side to side, threatening to use the shoulder to get pass me. By then I was very annoyed, but I just finished my maneuver and moved to the right lane as soon as I had cleared the truck.

Now this asshole matched my speed and spent the next several minutes glaring at me and my wife through my window. If I slowed, he slowed. If I sped up, he sped up.

So here's my question: WHY? Why do some people do this? I'm pretty sure he was not trying to deal with some life or death emergency, or he wouldn't spend all that time after trying to make me uncomfortable. What goes through the mind of someone like that that makes them think they have the right to harass someone in this manner?

IndieLady,videos,1389223583.0,"I pretty much whole-heartedly disagree about everything you have said. 

If I was dancing in a club and some guy came up to me, called me a ""bitch"" and told me ""my penis is so big that it could cause damage if I'm not careful"" well... Creepiest pick-up line ever. 

This may turn you on, but believe it or not some stranger telling me he's going to pull my hair and smack me raises a whole bunch of red flags. Here is something you need to understand, it may turn you on but for many, many people this kind of approach is very, very icky. 

And here's the crux of it:

&gt; This is a song where he asks her if she'd like to come out of her shell and have some very wild sex. He's asking her if she would like to experience this by cheating on her boyfriend with him. Rough sex is enjoyed by plenty of people. Again, he's not threatening, he's not forcing, he's offering. If she's not into that, she only has to say so and that's the end. *Isn't that enthusiastic consent in a nutshell?*

No. *At no point do we hear a woman's voice in this.* This is entirely from the man's perspective. So no, there is no demonstration of consent - enthusiastic or not - because what she wants isn't made clear in this song. All that is made clear is what the man *thinks she wants*. And even then he isn't exactly sure what she wants. Despite this, apparently he's decided she wants rough sex and is going to smack her and pull her hair.

My point from the very beginning has been this: sometimes people think they know what other people want, they think they have read certain signs, they think they ""get"" that person, they ""know"" the other person ""wants"" it. Sometimes this simply isn't the case. 

It is this kind of attitude, when you're convinced you ""know"" someone ""wants it"" and you try to convince them to do what you think they want you do, that you head into very murky - and creepy - territory.

&gt; This is literally a song about what a pain in the ass it is to try and figure out what side of the blurry line between interest and disinterest someone is on so you can ask them if they want to have sex, lest you appear too forward.

You can actually find out if someone's interested or not by treating them like a human being and not presuming anything. You can suss out of they like you without telling them about how your penis will destroy their arsehole if you're not careful, or by condescendingly referring to them as a ""good girl"", a ""proper kind of person"" who ""lives in accordance with social norms"" and needs to ""come out of that shell"" by being sexed up by a stranger. The best way to find out of someone like you is to flirt with them, maybe ask them and then take them at their word. Don't assume you can see certain ""signs"" that what they're saying is different to what they're thinking, she's saying ""no"" but mean ""yes"". Creepy."

First off, the hard part of this to swallow, is that you're *not* going to fix what you fucked up. Whatever part of his self-consciousness that spawned from your treatment of him, well that's not going away. You're not going to change the past and magically have a happy and well adjusted younger brother.

That being said, hope isn't lost. He can improve, your relationship can improve, and you can get pretty damn close to how things should have been. My first suggestion is to just spend time with him, do some shit he likes to do. That's the important part - make sure he's doing shit he wants to do and he's enjoying himself. You may be bored out your skull, but put up with it for now. Once you've been hanging out a while, start mixing it up. Introduce him to some new things, wing for him at a bar, start moving away from his personal interests and into common bro interests. The goal here is to get him to open up some more - your relationship will naturally just improve as you spend more time with each other.

There is this interesting (and cute) woman at work that I've flirted with from time to time. I recently gave her my number and told her to hit me up if she was ever free to go out for some fun. The key thing to note here is that her name is Kristen.
 
Fast forward and I got a text from a female friend (also named Kristen) who asked me if I wanted to check out a concert with her on Saturday night (also note, she posted on Facebook THE DAY BEFORE that she was getting a new phone number). We party a lot together so I had no qualms showing up to this concert a bit drunk and in a t-shirt, jeans and a hoodie (not looking clean cut).

Out of the blue I see my crush work-Kristen near the front of the concert. I went over and said hello for a bit then said I needed to grab a drink and meet a friend. I kept texting my friend-Kristen and she was replying that she was near the front. So once again I head down there. I chat for a bit with work-Kristen and keep looking for my friend. 

I mentioned to work-Kristen that I kept texting my friend who I couldn't find ... when at that moment work-Kristen says, ""Is that why do you keep asking me where I'm at?""

That's when it dawned on me that it was NOT my friend who invited me out, it was my crush! I showed up a little drunk, disorderly and probably seem per-occupied the whole evening. She seemed ticked off after that and has sort of avoided me since this past weekend. Oh well, c'est la vie."

See what folks are charging in your area and for what then take into account your own offerings, how they compare, and what you feel the price should be.

I know it's tempting to start low and move up, but people who work with computer consulting firms know that you get what you pay for.  If you charge too low, people will equate that to the value of your work and you won't get clients.

Make sure to set a reasonable price that will get you business and then be willing to alter that as new information becomes available (e.g. prices in your area rise, you get booked up, your skill set increases, you get faster at doing the work, etc.)"

slockley,AskReddit,1389223847.0,"&gt; Who is a victim of sex between consenting adults?

I don't know if there is a victim, by your definition.  I assert that there can be immoral acts without known victims.  I disagree with your claim that one can not oneself be a victim.  I believe that damaging oneself is immoral.  And disrespecting God is immoral.  Naturally I don't expect you to agree with me.  It is clear that your morality requires a victim, and you assume the homosexual act is not unhealthy.

&gt; If there is no victim in wearing blended fabrics, and no victim in homosexual sex, how can you condemn one act and commit the other so easily?

Yes they share that quality, but they are different in that the bible is clear on one issue and unclear on the other.  The bible condemns gay sex several times in multiple contexts.

On the other hand, it condemns mixed cloths in a peculiar context, but it does fit the model of symbolic purity common in ceremonial law (which does not have universal application).  It's not mentioned outside Leviticus and Deuteronomy.  So I don't defy it lightly.

Let's say that I'm wrong about mixed cloth, though.  That I'm in violation of the Law of God.  Well, I'm already in violation, a million times over, and I require the grace of God.  Those that violate the law against the homosexual act are in the same boat as I.  And if they feel justified by their interpretation of Scripture, I'll agree to disagree, and we can sit next to each other at church."

It sucks, but it ain't the end of your world, and you ain't gonna back down from no punk next time.  

- Having your heart broken. Falling in love and then falling out. The heart is a bit too sensitive at first anyways, a little bit of scar tissue will do it good.  

- This isn't for everyone, but for anyone who doesn't fear that they have a mental illness, psychedelics. Mushrooms, acid, dmt, I just think it's healthy for one's psyche to experience a broken ego for a bit. As an aside, mushrooms are a potential cure for depression, and acid is a potential cure for alcoholism.

strangestdude,sex,1389224414.0,"I'll give you my unpolitically correct conjecture...

&gt;Women around my own age are the easiest to sleep with and are much more eager to please.

Women begin to lose their sexual and romantic desirability from around 35 to 40, because men generally want women younger than 40. (Youthful looks and fertility)

Women notice the drop off of male attention.

Women in their 40's try very hard to compete to find a man to for a sexual or romantic relationship. They don't have as many options as they did from 18 to 40.

&gt;A while back she started calling me asking to check up on my new place. We start talking later end up having sex, and well my exwife became much more attentive. She will ask me if she did a good job (before I was supposed to be lucky just for having sex), what she can do to make things better. Oh and every time she comes over she is shaved (couple times waxed as well). However, she will never say she is coming over for sex even though that's pretty much all we do. She drives an hour down to my place waxed either in cute underwear or lingerie (before was only on special occasions) and cook dinner with me and then leave.

I'd bet money your 45 year old EX-wife doesn't get as much sexual or romantic attention as you do. 

She doesn't have many options, and she has to compete for male attention.

This radio show host is really harsh, but he's telling the truth IMO.

TryUsingScience,changemyview,1389224525.0,"I agree with you that modern gender roles are far too narrow. But there is a biological difference between the sexes, and 99% of people come with bodies where the chromosomes, hormones, sex organs, and brain all match up. 

Even in a perfect world free of misogyny, you'd still ask your average male friend to open a jar before you'd ask your average female friend because men would still have stronger arms. 

In addition, I have a nitpicky semantic argument / clarification question:

&gt; Women who are designated male at birth, men who are designated female at birth or a genderqueer person who identifies as neither are all valid identities without a gender binary.

If there's no such thing as a gender binary then the first two types of people listed are completely irrelevant to the discussion. In this hypothetical genderless society, a woman who is designated male at birth is a female-brained-person with a biological problem that caused the wrong genitalia to form. She would still have been treated the same way as if her genitalia were correctly formed for her sex, because there would be no difference in social treatment based on genitalia. 

The identity of trans\* is not an identity without the gender binary, because it implies transitioning from one identity to another, not merely correcting a medical problem. People don't identify as ""transitioning through cleft palate surgery"" because they didn't have a separate identity before and after the problem was fixed. It was just a problem that did not affect how society treated them and it was resolved. In a world without a gender binary, that's how trans\* people would be treated as well, and so it would cease being an identity."

If someone in say, a grocery store is loudly reciting rape jokes to their friends and someone has a flashback, it is because the aforementioned jokester is an asshole who could have easily kept their voice down or just saved it for another time.

I agree with you here, but it can be rephrased as a pretty soft point: don't tell rude jokes in public.

&gt;Now that whole thing was a bit beside the point, because the issue we're supposed to be debating here is rape jokes compared to murder jokes or Holocaust jokes. That was the issue I was discussing in my last comment, and I would love to discuss it further if you're interested.

IMO they're all just offensive jokes and rape jokes aren't unique (or if they are unique, they're only unique in an Anna Karenina kind of way - every rude joke is inappropriate in its own way). Rape jokes might reinforce negative attitudes about rape, Holocaust jokes might reinforce negative attitudes about Jews (or Germans, for that matter), murder jokes might reinforce negative attitudes about violence, etc. Which brings us back to OP's premise: rape jokes aren't *worse* unless you can make a compelling argument that they're somehow more harmful than other types of jokes, which I think is quite a stretch."

misterspaceguy,USMC,1389224578.0,"From the stories my friends from 2nd and 3rd Battalion have said, I would say yes. However, what I have come to find out while knowing guys from both coasts and all 3 battalions is that I find the 3rd BTN guys to be trouble makers or the shitbags, 2nd BTN to be messy, and the 1st BTN guys are pretty much an average boot. I was lucky enough to have all 4 of my Drill Instructors be combat vets with multiple deployments so I felt as though, even though their discipline was less than that of any other platoon in my company, or BTN for that matter, I feel they taught us how to be better Marines by allowing us to act with just a tad more free will but taking it away just as quick. During the first 4 weeks of training, we were rarely ever in the pit. Maybe a total of 5 or 6 times. The other platoons were their almost everyday.

Any Marine thinks their BTN was the best. I think 1st makes better Marines because I was never demeaned but when we messed up,  while being yelled at, it was like we lost the trust of our Drill Instructors and ruined the image of the Marine Corps. They treated us like Marines so long as we didn't act like recruits. "

blackpony04,pics,1389224598.0,"None of the Falls actually freeze, but rather a huge ice cap (for lack of a better word) can make them appear frozen. The water is still flowing underneath. Problems have been stopped by the ice boom on Lake Erie and the fact that more water is used in winter for the power plants so the flow is lower. The river above and below the Falls can freeze and does usually form an ice bridge from one side to the next.

EDIT: to answer what would happen if it was all stopped, most of the flooding would occur in all of the states/Ontario that border Lake Erie since it's so shallow. It has been said that the flow was stopped once in the 1800s but that happened in winter so it was from an ice dam that had formed up river and would have caused more ice damage than water damage to bordering land."

Find out about the rave scene in your area. These are some of the most inviting and non-judgmental people you'll ever meet. Seriously, it's difficult to be stressed out during a rave.

But, here's the main thing - raves have a lot of music and dancing. They also have a lot of drugs. What you need to do is show up at this rave and meet my friend Molly. She's a great dancer and a great teacher and I guarantee you will learn how to dance with her very quickly.

I never used to be a dancer. Then I partied with Molly one time, and ever since I've been complimented after shows on my dancing ability.

Instead, we get a mish-mash of great performances, some really odd directoral stylings (the random pans to seemingly random body-parts; feet, shoes, ass, hands...  huh?).  It almost seemed at times that DOR was making a parody film with the way some of the 70's fashion/ trends were presented.

One of the biggest tells to me was: when JLaw delivers that speech in the bathroom, and finishes it off with the ""maybe we all have poison inside of us"" bit, that should have been a home run line, and it was probably written as such, but it just felt flat to me.  And it wasn't her acting: I feel like that line was supposed to show a human side of Rosalyn, and perhaps make her a more sympathetic character, but up to that point all of her screen time is dedicated to making her a villain at worst, anti-hero at best.

Toasters, for example, and hearing aids, and radios.  I don't think most people would think, while listening to NPR and heating a bagel, 'whoa, I need to downsize and get back to nature a little more!

As technology gets more advanced, the things we think of as 'technological' now will just *be*.  We'll be used to reading books on screens because that's just where books are read.  We'll text and tweet and [insert future term here] each other because that's just how we communicate.  Translation apps will be how we manage to talk to people in other countries, and so on.

The concept of excessive technology makes us uneasy because it's new and we feel like we're losing the old way of doing things, but when the old way of doing things also involves technology... it'll just start feeling like incremental progress.  Software updates, in essence.

Most of those stores have rear entrances for celebrities, and the assistants use these entrances to pick up the items as well. Imagine if all these rich people were walking around with shopping bags full of tens of thousands of dollars worth of stuff. Robbery would be rampant, even in Beverly Hills.
  
The only exception to this is the kids of rich people, who may not be old enough to need an assistant. But even then, they don't walk around with shopping bags. Some stores have a delivery service which brings it to your door.
  
I've worked for tons of really rich people, and the first person you get to know is their assistant. There are rich people that live in Bel Air and Beverly Hills, and they do buy all those brands, tons of them. A rich woman doesn't buy one pair of Prada shoes, she buys 10 of them, for different events and dresses, for $2k a pop. She also doesn't order them online, she wants to try them on. The closest place that sells Prada shoes is Sacks 5th Ave on Wilshire, right by Rodeo.
  
Just because you don't see rich people buying stuff on Rodeo doesn't mean that those stores are operating at a loss. They are making a shit-ton of money actually, because rich people are willing to pay for quality, even with an insane mark up, and they buy a lot of it. What you really don't see on Rodeo is the thousands of really really big houses that are in the neighborhood around Rodeo, filled with rich people, who want expensive stuff."

Because a man gives up his freedom and independence to be a good husband and father, and because -- unless she's an incredible fuck-up -- children love their mothers more than their fathers.  It is far easier to separate and alienate men from their children than women.

A man is always on the outside of his family, and the mother and children on the inside. When the family is bound together with under his name, that means something.  It is a powerful symbolic gesture that binds a man and his family together.

That's why it's not unfair to ask a woman to take her husband's name, so that her children are also his children.  So that the family is his family, and not her family already laying the groundwork for his alienation and separation."

All of my honors classes in high school, the dudes in them had a problem with Asian chicks. By problem I mean they really liked them a lot. The younger they were and acted, the better. Like, I knew of a girl who was 18, and her hobbies were collecting dolls and playing the violin. Her favorite movie was Pocahontas. 50% of the dudes in my class wanted that. It was weird, because she looked and acted 12.

Not as much money as professional sports, but they're going to be making that money for their entire lives, not just when they're young and fit. So, better deal, I guess, if you're a gold digger.

Generally I've been opting for a Trinity rush, getting tier one boots, and then either a Last Whisper if their tanks are getting big/have armor/I'm on a mostly ad team, or a Bloodthirster in other situations. 

If I got LW after TF, I actually like Infinity Edge, as I get crit chance from TF and Ezreal's AS passive is a constant 50% if you can hit your skill shots. On the other hand if I got BT after TF I need the armor penetration as soon as possible as by now the tanks are guaranteed to have armor.

I upgrade boots whenever I have the gold to spare, otherwise I'm building towards my next big item. I usually get CDR boots and the green enchantment, or homeguards if I'm behind. 

After that you might need a defensive item, I usually go for a QSS. If you're the reason your team is winning/have a majority of your team's gold, a GA is the better choice as you're going to get focused hard. 

Finally to round it off, an IE is extremely strong if you don't have it yet, BotRK is good if you desperately need extra kiting power (but IE is stronger in almost every case). 

I've also seen some Statikk Shiv/Iceborn Gauntlet type cheesy builds but these often sacrifice power for mixed damage and extra kiting. You can call it the new blue build. "

And when she had the kid, she was supposed to get three weeks more, but they kept callin' and callin' so she went back when the kid was 10 days old. She was the top earner, obviously, and she'd always say she hated getting that much love but used that to try and switch shifts (They've been calling me non-stop for three days, if you work for me I can get 'em off my back) and complained constantly about not being able to have vacations (I told em I'm not working this Christmas Eve, cuz I got my son, but I think I should go for a while so their calls don't be ruinin' my son's Christmas).

crushmastac,hockeyplayers,1389225696.0,"I only started playing ice hockey 4 years ago, I'm still pretty noob and I don't score much, which means I usually remember most of my goals.  I have a few faves, but this is the most recent.

I'm playing right wing, and the puck is coming down the boards, and I'm converging on the puck about the same time as their D man.  I get to it just a split second earlier and manage to chip it past him, giving me a clear cut 2 on 1 with my center from the red line in.  

I throw it over to the center (best player on our team), and the D man goes to close on him, but he throws it right back to me.  The pass is a little behind me, and even 3-6 months ago, I would have mishandled it and the scoring chance would have been nullified.  

But I manage to pivot so I'm actually turned on my backhand (I'm a righty) and pick up the puck, but still going at the net full speed, skating backwards.  It's me and the goalie from about the top of the circle, D man has no chance of getting back to me.  I fake pulling the puck across my body to my forehand, pop it back to my backhand and ripped it (still turned sideways).

The goalie got a small piece, but it went between his blocker and his pad and into the net.  Felt so good, mostly because that's a goal I would never score until recently.  

Still got a long way to go in terms of skating and shooting with confidence, but I've been on a tear the last 10 games, during which this goal happened.  Feels good man."

Seriously!  I keep seeing posts where people ask if it's too late for them to transition, and then find out that they're like 26 or something.

I was 25 when I started T in 2003, and back then it seemed like most people were starting in their 20's.  Those who worried about being too late were in their 30's or older.

Now it seems like things have shifted, and it's quite common for people to start out in their teens... and now apparently being in your 20's is ""too late"".  It's interesting how things have changed.  In 10 years, everything has shifted by about 10 years.

There are a lot of mind games when it comes to game changing skillshots like Rocket Grab. The best advice for you is just to minimize your chance of being hooked by keeping your distance from Blitz until he burns it. 

Your support getting hooked is matchup dependent. If Leona gets hooked, you can probably focus down the Blitz quite fast in the early levels, since he likely just burned half of his mana to use his Q and thus will have a weak shield.

&gt;Had he made a less personal, or ""pretentious"" movie, it would have been lesser.

If I may, I feel that these points are counter to each other.  I am trying not to talk myself into not-liking the film, because I did, but isn't this the definition of pretentious?  Don't get me wrong, its not *Black Swan* pretentious, but the more I read people's opinions, especially if the DOR ""I don't care about plot, just the characters"" quote is true, this entire film seems self serving.

I know, I know.  Many will argue that *ALL* art is self-serving by its very nature, but that is obviously intellectually dishonest.  There are tons of examples of commercialized art, made for the masses, especially in film.

I suppose my disappointment lies mostly in the fact that, being a simple, but intelligent, film viewer there was much of the film I just don't get, but it sounds like many laud it as brilliance.  A random pan to a waist, or butt, or hand, or shoe is completely lost on me artistically, and I am sure I am not alone.  

Does this make me not a ""movie lover""?  I guess.  I'm not even sure what that means, really.  I can appreciate great directing and cinematography as much, probably more, than the garden variety viewer.  

Do I have an extensive appreciation for French Noir or Kurosawa?  I don't.

&gt; Do you have any jewelry or gifts from prior relationships? Oh my goodness you're a TERRIBLE person. How dare you not be totally devoted in unreasonable ways to someone you've known for all of 8 weeks.

Because having gifts you might actually use for non-sexual purposes and naked pictures are totally comparable. He recently viewed the pictures. I'm sure if they had been sitting there on his computer without his knowledge that would be one thing, but if he's still viewing them that's completely different. 

&gt; In regards to the conversation with his ex about having the pictures, this is a totally normal conversation to have!! ""Oh hey so I guess we're breaking up, do you plan to keep those compromising pictures of me?"" ""Yup"" ""Ok please don't put them on the internet I trust you're not a complete slimeball"" ""Nope, won't do that, we're good. It's just I'm shipping off and might need the material""

What? If you break up with your ex and are on *platonic* terms, you most likely wouldn't be comfortable with them having the pictures to use, especially if he had a girlfriend. If I was completely over my ex I would be really bothered if he still had my pictures, and most girls would agree with that. Maybe she's the exception. 

&gt; (Also, it never says when this conversation took place, in all likelihood it happened at some point in their lives outside of the 8 weeks this doomed relationship has occupied.)

If they're talking constantly there is a good likely hood they brought this up recently. Especially if she currently knows he has the pictures, since most people delete them after dating someone new. 

&gt; This goddamn sub is ridiculous with the witch hunts and holier than thou bullshit.

Did you read the damn thing? Even there mutual friends think he's still interested in his ex. 

&gt; Oh my lawd he still sees his ex in a sexual way?? What a monster! Hang him immediately!

That was totally my reaction. /s/ I told her that I *personally* would only stay with him if they stopped talking, but that's me. I even said if she was comfortable with their relationship then she doesn't have to tell him to give it up. I never said she should totally dump him or that he was bad person. 

&gt; Guess what, half the women I see I think about in a sexual way, and they're complete strangers.

Yep, complete strangers. Compared to his ex that he talks to a lot and his friends think he's still into. Huge difference. No one is saying he should never view other people sexually, but remaining super close with someone like that (to the point where other people think there is something going on) is a deal breaker for some people. Not everyone, but some. 

&gt; It doesn't mean I'm going to cheat and frankly it doesn't really mean anything except that I'm literally programmed to do that.

Just because you aren't crossing obvious lines (physically cheating) doesn't mean there aren't subtler lines you can cross. 

Also, I just want to go back to one more thing: 

&gt; they've been ""together"" for two months

When do relationships for you start? Can we just do whatever the fuck we want (even if we're suppose to be exclusive) until we've hit the 1 year mark? Or should it be the 5 year mark? If this was just random porn that's one thing. If this was just some friend of his that was 100% platonic and she had no reason to be concerned about then yeah, that's also unreasonable. However, this type of situation is a deal breaker for some people. Hell, even contacting your exes is a deal breaker for some people. You don't want to date someone who tells who you you can't be friends with your ex? Then don't. However, if you can't even see *why* his relationship is concerning with his ex in this situation then that's your problem. 

These weren't pictures he looked at months ago and forgot about. These are pictures of a girl he's has a history with and still talks to regularly. Just because *you're* okay with that, doesn't mean everyone else in the world has to be. "
librarygirl,AskWomen,1389225998.0,"This may be a totally irrelevant contribution and I hope you don't think I'm trying to promote something - I don't have a writing suggestion, but I just have wanted to share something I did when I was in a similar situation to yours. There's a website that's just called calm.com. It's a loop of rippling sea and a lovely sky (edit: there are different scenes to choose from). There's really soothing music playing and you can opt to do like 5, 10, 20 etc minute relaxation sessions.

The reason I'm suggesting it is because I came across it in a time when things were shitty and my self-esteem was super low. You don't even have to property meditate or use the sessions, I just sat and stared and this beautiful image and it made me feel grounded and connected again. I was alone at the time, and it made me feel less alone (this probably sounds crazy). I was so transfixed on it, and it made me feel so wonderful that I cried. God, I hope this doesn't sound totally irrelevant and mental. But it helped me to stop and think, and it just helped positive thoughts flow really naturally.

It might be an idea to use something like this to clear your thoughts, and then perhaps write down whatever comes to you. Hope things look up soon, OP. "

abuudabuu,summonerschool,1389226045.0,"Most of the ways I've been getting ganked is in the early levels when my support doesn't have a Sightstone yet. If you can get your botlane to communicate when and where trinkets are placed, you can simply time them, since they only last a minute, have a two minute CD, and if they switch off warding river to have an infinite ward, they're going to lose the brush war in lane. 

Another way is to have your bot lane push up and dive. Only do so if you have two members of your diving trio with lots of damage/cc. Good examples are Thresh, Vi, Draven, Sivir, Lee Sin, and Leona. 

Finally what I like to do is just do a dumb trade (I play ADC), and have the Jungle stand off in River by drag since it never gets warded early anymore. The enemy will over-commit and get baited into a 2v3. 

Bot lane is hard to gank because you have a full ward and two trinkets at level 1, but if you get a little creative it's definitely possible. "

You can go to community college for around $3,000 in tuition a year on average, so a 2 year degree is not that expensive.  Even less so when you consider that Pell grants will cover more than half of that amount.

&gt; So college should be reserved only for engineers then?

Absolutely not.  Besides the fact there are people who can afford to go to college without crippling loans, most college degrees do result in a significant increase in income over the long term.  Since repayment is income-based anyways, it tends to generally be a good deal.

That said, it isn't a bad idea to pick majors that have a higher employment rate, but the most important thing is to do well in your courses."

It's a numbers game. We know we will ultimately be rejected the vast majority of the time for any number of reasons, but we have to make the attempt. Don't assume we have been eyeing you from across the room all night and finally worked up the courage. That does happen occasionally, for the most part we are probably just throwing darts out in an increasingly random fashion as we get drunker and drunker. 

You can help this cause immensely by being honest with us right away. Any awkwardness you feel is on you. We already feel awkward, and we will be extremely relieved/refreshed by the honesty (all of us, at one point or another, have bought a drink for a girl only to have her waltz away to her friends). 

Here is my suggestion. If I start chatting you up and offer to buy you a drink, and you think I'm good-looking, charming, smart, funny, ect. throw me a freaking bone. Point out the single girl in your group of friends, the one who has been complaining about needing to get laid, and help play matchmaker. Then I can buy her a drink from across the bar. When it's delivered, I'll give her a little wave, and at that point you can lean over to her an whisper ""Nice going Val, that guys cute"" or something to that effect. If we get to talking, dancing, fooling around you will be remembered as a hero, and entitled to a lifetime of drinks from me free of guilt. 

Also, to all the girls on here who are saying ""but I've had guys buy me drinks who weren't hitting on me"" I would ask you this: Have you ever bought a 10-15 dollar present for a complete stranger on the off chance that you hit it off and become best buds? If not, why not? "

The best way to help someone else see the right way (if it's a factual thing rather than an opinion) or change their opinion is to see their way and ask them why they think that way. Make them defend themselves in a non-hostile manner and then invite them to critique your side. Your side should hold up well and you won't change their mind right there but you MAY get them thinking.

You'll also find that most sides which are strongly fought for have some merit in them, regardless of if they're right or wrong and you'll learn that they're not all idiots for feeling that way.

People who are very open minded tend to also be wishy-washy in their believes, this bit is better than that bit? I better switch to that bit right away.

&gt; The only other alternative, and one which I've been pushing for a while, is MONORAIL. It works for Vancouver and Pearson Airport, why not do it here too.

Wha? Neither of those places have monorails. Vancouver is exclusively ICTS and quasi-ICTS (the Canada Line is like ICTS but uses regular subway propulsion), and the [Pearson LINK train](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINK_Train) is a cable car. Both clearly with two rails.

Jimmy,askphilosophy,1389226439.0,"&gt;I think part of the project of those working in the area (which includes compatibilists and incompatibilists) is to 'reconstruct' the ordinary concept of free will so as to be consistent and precise, while keeping as true to the ordinary usage of the term as possible.

I'm skeptical about whether such a project can succeed in its stated goals.  If a concept is inconsistent, well... it's just inconsistent.  Won't any ""reconstruction"" of the concept just be something different altogether?  I think if you press the average person a bit on what they mean when they talk about free will, they'll say that a freely willed action must a) not be pre-determined, and b) must not be randomly chosen.  I don't think such an action is possible, and I imagine that many philosophers agree, which is why compatibilists define free will in terms of moral responsibility.

If compatibilists want to try and show how moral responsibility can coexist with determinism, cool, that could be an interesting project.  But once we realize that people's concept of free will is incoherent, we shouldn't settle for a sort-of-but-not-actually free will; we should just admit there's no free will."

Heliopteryx,explainlikeimfive,1389226501.0,"This is a very complex subject, and I am far from an expert. /r/askscience is able to give more detailed and complete answers, if you so desire them 

Larger species tend to live longer than smaller ones because of metabolism speeds (faster metabolism leads to shorter lifespan), but there are many exceptions to this. Elephants and parrots have roughly the same lifespans, for example (70-80 years in captivity). 

Some animals evolved to have long lives, like tortoises. This is because they do not experience a decrease in fertility and offspring health with age, like humans. The more breeding seasons a tortoise lives through, the more babies it has. For species whose fertility decreases with age, nothing that happens to the organisms after they pass on their genes (and, in the case of social animals, teach/raise their young) ""matters."" This is why genetic diseases that manifest long after reproductive age are not bred out of the gene pool. 

I'm just guessing about the cow and human example, but humans require more instruction as children in order to thrive as adults, so there is an evolutionary pressure for us not to die immediately after peak fertility. Calves do not require nearly as much teaching from cows. "

Ironic that you imply lack of compassion on my part, but refuse to read much of what I wrote. This badly undermines other people's willingness to take someone's input seriously, and is the height of disrespect in any discussion.

&gt;from the bit of drivel I did read, I've deduced

...undermining any input you provide.

&gt;you're on the wrong side of history

So my words aren't worth reading *because I'm just a bad guy, which proves I'm wrong.* And I'm just bad because you say so, and that settles it. Correct?

Do you realize using personal attacks merely relieves you of having to actually think -- at all -- about anything I actually said? That insisting I'm wrong by attached negative words to me only shows you to be a critical, angry person?

See, **history does not have ""sides.""** Any majority or minority can do what is right or wrong, regardless of their amount of power. Two groups can fight and *both* be in the wrong. People do not split so narrowly into two groups as you caricature.

If I believed as you do, I would have immediately written you off as a hateful person simply because of how you are addressing me. But I do not believe that. I believe you are driven by anger, yes, but I also believe your anger comes from love -- love for people who have been downtrodden repeatedly. And that SHOULD make us angry.

&gt;First of all, Some people are gay. Get over it.

Some people are gay, yes. And some people likewise claim to have once been gay but now are not. Should I say ""Get over it""? Or wait -- is it hateful and disrespectful to say that?

If it's hateful to say gay people are liars, or delusional, or twisted, or whatever -- then it is likewise hateful to say testifying-ex-gay people are liars, or delusional, or twisted, or whatever. Why not listen to both?

I prefer to listen to both. Somehow I find that more loving than splitting them into ""sides"" and vilifying one in order to ""stand up for"" the other.

&gt;you can't single out vulnerable oppressed groups and run slanderous, hateful, bigoted libelous and ignorant ad campaigns against them. Get over it.

Some ex-gay people have shared from their experience about departing from homosexuality. Are you saying  that to *believe them* is an act of hatred? That simply believing someone's story is slanderous because it conflicts with the stories of someone else we also believe?"

andjok,AdviceAnimals,1389226772.0,"&gt; I'm not sure of the point you're trying to make.. Are you suggesting that we shouldn't be voting for our representatives? Should they be appointed?

You said that the analogy of voting with your dollars (participating in the marketplace) implies a well educated society, I am saying that the supposed virtue of voting for representatives implies the same, arguably to a much greater degree.  In other words, voting for the right politicians requires much more education to be successful than does buying the right products and services, so I think the analogy stands.  Also, you later argue that we have very few choices when it comes to buying products, but we have essentially two choices for each political office we elect, and unlike the market, what we choose is very unlikely to make a difference as to what we get. 

&gt;My point is that it greatly benefits large corporations for people to remain uneducated about their internal policies such as wages, healthcare options for employees etc.

It greatly benefits the state for people to remain uneducated about its policies too.  And or the record, a lot of libertarians (including myself) are against corporate personhood, we want individuals to be held liable for their actions.  Not fully relevant here, just saying.

&gt;The bottom line is that the level of poverty in the US doesnt allow a ""vote with your dollars"" system because people are forced to simply choose the cheapest option because they literally cannot afford to shop somewhere that may be closer to their ideals.

I don't disagree, but elected representatives cannot and will not change this, because as you say later

&gt;we need to remove the influence of these corporations so that the politicians we do elect won't be beholden to the corporations thus making bad policies that will affect millions of people. The ownership of these politicians by the corporations serves to KEEP the populous uneducated.

I completely agree with you.  The question is, how will that be done without getting rid of politicians (elected or not) altogether?"

Omega037,changemyview,1389226774.0,"&gt; And how does a degree from a community college compare to those with 4 year degrees applying for similar jobs? You're basically saying that the rich should have an advantage starting their careers off based on the fact that they can afford to get a 4 year degree and not go to a community college.

A 2 year degree is often in a technical skill that is very sought after (electrician, dental hygienist, etc).  They usually can also be parlayed into a 4 year degree if you decide to continue onward.  Also, some better community colleges do offer some 4 year degree programs.

&gt; Not if the alternative is something that you have no interest in. If you pick a major based only on the potential job prospects for this major, then you are less likely to do well in school since you will be studying something that you have no interest in.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1389226795.0,"I figure you'd have to know people close to them or be a stalker. Like, figure out where they stay when they're in town. In my town, the swankiest hotels are in a specific area, and that's where the players stay. Then I'd scope out the clubs around that area, and start hitting them up, trying to get in the VIP rooms and area. Eventually, you'll hit jackpot and get a professional sports person of some variety. Of course, you need to be hot or know someone who works for the club. Or know someone who works in hospitality. This might be easier -- high turnover in that industry, and the housekeepers like to gossip."
MrSky,sex,1389226802.0,"""Top"", as opposed to ""bottom"", either in a scene or as a sexual identification. It's a catchall word for various dominant roles in kinky play.

For example, you could say that if OP were tied up and her SO was humiliating her with his fingers, he would be Topping her. You could also say he was the Top in that particular scene. 

It's related to (but slightly different from) the terms Dominant and submissive, because technically a submissive could play a Top in a scene, even if that wasn't normally to their taste."

In this tank/bruiser rampant meta, your Q is extremely valuable in taking down tanks, or at least making them back out. While you wait for an opening to take out a squishy, help peel for your other carries with your raw damage. Despite what everyone might think, Kha'zix is not completely about 100-0ing some squishies. In fact, many times you can win a team fight just by zoning the enemy back line, giving the rest of your team appropriate time to take down the enemy front line while your team takes little damage from the enemy carries. 

Of course, this doesn't mean never try to get kills/resets. Just ask yourself if you'd survive a dive on the back lines before you do so, especially if you have a majority of your team's gold and can't afford to die. "

My Girlfriend is a Nine Tailed Fox. This is hilarious! I don't know anyone who hasn't enjoy this.

I really enjoyed Pasta. It involved the relationships of a cookstaff and ultimately the love that fall between the chef and a line cook. It also featured a lot of really amazing pasta dishes that inspired a lot of pasta cooking of my own! Also, I've never worked in food service so it was neat to see the inside of a restaraunt's kitchen.

Flowerboy Ramen Shop and Boys Over Flowers are must sees for anyone really. They're probably the most popular among anyone I've ever talked to about kdramas.

Heirs released over the fall I think or early winter and just finished. I really enjoyed it. High school melodrama, yay!

Goodness the list really goes on. They really are addicting. Each episode ends with a cliffhanger that really keeps you hooked.

From here, what you do is up to you. Some girls start transitioning social and start coming out to people. Some are content staying exactly how they are now, and they are not any less of the gender they identify as (and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

A lot of people want to start on HRT. The particular rules for how you want to do will vary depending on where you live. 

Take your time and figure out what you want to do. Especially at your age, there's no reason to rush into things without research, unless, of course, you want to go as fast as light.

tomfishtheGR8,AskMen,1389227109.0,"Really depends on context. If it's after an argument, then it's totally fine. When an argument becomes heated, our testosterone kicks in and we loose the ability to think rationally for a bit. We get defensive and stop listening. At this point you really need to let us walk away. For me there is nothing more frustrating then when, as I'm leaving to try and collect myself, my SO runs after me yelling ""This is what you always do. You run away and shut down"" or whatever. 

However, if he said this more or less out of the blue then it probably has to do with him feeling obligated to hang out with you, when he'd rather be alone or with his friends. My general advice in this regard is that quantity does not equal quality when spending time with someone. I think its better to have fewer dates, phone calls, and texts, if you're making sure that when you call him or text him you really have something to say. Or with a date, you want to do something specific not just hang out so you can physically be in the same room. 

All of this depends on his personality as well. Some people are introverts and really need to have alone time. If you post more information about your relationship you will definitely get better answers on this thread."

NanoNarse,AskReddit,1389227142.0,"For me the trick was to really embrace my insecurities. 

I've pretty much done a 180 since high school. I used to be extremely arrogant and cocky. Now people describe me as downright self-deprecating.

Initially I was kind of doing it to fish for compliments. But eventually I weaned myself off the need for other people's approval. These days, I never say anything positive about myself. I put myself down, but it's not for pity. I exaggerate for comedy, or if the mood isn't right, am just straight up honest about my flaws.

I wouldn't call myself confident, because I'm not really. But people do say I'm extremely laid back. Well, I never feel like I have a reputation to lose. When I am confident about something I don't need anyone to know it. I deflect praise onto others and just do my thing. My actions will speak for my ability, not my words. And honestly, I kind of don't want people to know when I'm good at things, so I neglect to mention winning prestigious competitions to my co-workers.

People are different around me now. I think they actually perceive me as confident sometimes. I don't really have any more faith in my abilities than before. But I am more emotionally self-sufficient. I think that might just be the difference."

Omega037,changemyview,1389227219.0,"&gt; I would be interested in hearing any reasons you have for why people don't go to college, if not financial reasons.

* They don't enjoy school

* They don't know what they want to do with their lives

* They have emotional problems preventing them from going to school or work

* They aren't qualified (barely passed a bad HS or dropped out)

* They have other responsibilities (raising children, taking care of family member)

* They are afraid of failure

* They want to enlist in the military

* They have a good job lined up

* They want to travel 

&gt; The highest federal need based grant you can get is $5,500 per year; you can get about that much in student loans without getting your parents involved.  This might afford community college, if you qualify for everything and live at home, but any kind of specialized school or higher caliper school cannot be covered by this at all.

You generally can get loans to cover any public school's tuition.  You may need to work part time to pay basic living expenses if not living at home.  Also, it's ""caliber"", not ""caliper.""

&gt; My cost of attendance is around $40,000 per year. I receive the maximum amount of need-based federal and state aid available, and it covers maybe 1/3 of my costs.

You are paying way too much to school.  I went to a public university through PhD and there were able loans to cover tuition.

&gt; So yes, some higher education is available to the poor, but it is very, very limited; the federal and state funds are limited and the schools which are this cheap are also limited.

You are at a very expensive, private school.  You are paying too much.  These would not be effected by a socialized system, nor should they be.

There are many good public schools in the United States, and there are very few schools who wouldn't take needs into account for a quality candidate.  Especially if they are very low income or a minority.

&gt; it would lessen ethnic and financial differences in the educated population.

This is what affirmative action is for, not a socialized system.

I think a lot of people, unfortunately, have been through a lot of sexual problems. If no molestation it's rape or something else. It's unfortunate but it's the world we are in. Something that has helped me cope is to stop putting sex on a pedestal. It can be normalized and not made to be so important. It's just another physical act, it can be special, but it's like the way a dinner can be normal or super exciting. 

I think a lot of the issues come in when sex is thought of as something super precious and special. There's nothing wrong with looking at it like a bodily function. Then it changes it from something that someone ""took"" from you to something that just happened. If that makes sense. It's how I've worked through sexual issues and how I am able to deal with sex as a whole nowadays."

But second, Canada never really had an abrupt schism from Britain - we just kind of evolved away from it. So the further back you go, the line between ""Briton who happens to be in Canada"" and ""Canadian"" gets blurrier. Also, when we're talking post-American revolution, Canada is often referred to as ""British North America"" (in fact, our Constitution was known as the British North America Act until 1982).

So when we're learning the war of 1812, we learn that it's a conflict between Britain and the US where most of the fighting happened in (British) North America. So when we're told ""the British burned Washington"" we don't make much ado about whether those forces were Canadian, English, or Scottish, we just interpret it as ""*we* burned Washington"".

But there are places where Coal and Nat Gas make much more sense and are too expensive to mandate their use.  A one size fits all solution is draconian,  especially as electric bills continue to increase due to these mandates.  The less fortunate will find themselves priced out of the market, and have to be subsidized; even when there is a cheaper alternative available but its use is mandated against.

Personally,  I'm hoping that solar panels get cheap enough soon that they are integrated into the roof of every house and building.  So that even if they are not super efficient during say...winter; the overall amount of energy needed from fossil fuels is reduced.

There is a strategy out there I could agree with, but I haven't seen them yet.  ""Under my plan, energy prices will **necessarily skyrocket**"" just doesn't cut it for me."

I don't know. I think I lot of people get them because they get addicted to the feeling. It's very addicting.

mariesoleil,asktransgender,1389228112.0,"Personally, I prefer using ""transgender"" and ""trans"" to describe people that are transitioning or that want to, including non-binary. People that at minimum, have transgender feelings.

I don't really like the concept of the transgender umbrella. To me, it's too prescriptive. It's telling the man that likes to wear panties to work that he wants to be a woman. It's insisting to the gay male drag queen that he's not a just a man who's attracted to men who likes exaggerated depictions of femininity. Do crossdressers and drag performers really consider themselves as transgender? I suspect that most don't.

Simply put, I think there is a big difference between someone who plays with different gender presentation as a weekend hobby and someone who wants to live and be perceived as a different gender (including non-binary genders) all the time, so they can express the gender they feel inside.

I don't have any problem with drag queens and crossdressers. But they do what I do, present as a different gender than the one I lived most of my life, as something temporary. I see us as more different than similar.

I don't tell my butch lesbian friend that being a mechanic (male gender role career) means she really wants to be a man, so I don't like the idea of telling a crossdresser (female gender presentation) that he really wants to be a woman.
 
While ""transgender"" seems to be mean crossing gender boundaries, I feel it's mostly used to describe gender identity rather than simple gender presentation."

You're not a counselor or a therapist, nor are you there to ""fix"" things.

You *are* a friend; someone to talk to, someone to confide in, and a shoulder to cry on.  Sometimes it helps to have someone that will listen and to have someone that will care - it will mean a great deal to her to just have you there - you don't have to understand exactly how she feels (and you probably won't, unless you have experienced similar trauma).

I just started my FAFSA to see what the options were and it says to claim that I'm ""unaccompanied"" and not submit my parent's information, I need to submit proof and also notify my financial aid advisors. However I don't have any legal forms. I've never taken my mom to court. She's never physically abused me. I don't have any proof of interactions that may be considered abusive. The best I could do is get a letter from a school counselor, but I haven't talked to any in the past so I don't know if they would do that after one or two meetings (and I only get 2 free counseling sessions before I have to start paying for them).

I will keep trying. Worst case scenario I will just have to very formally contact my mother and cross my fingers that she will give me the info I need for my FAFSA instead of withholding it until I give her the ""love and respect"" that I ""owe"" her. Sigh."

The whole point however is the ""we will never know"" if they feel emotion is a useless assertion for so many reasons...

I wrote this in another thread about pain, but it applies to ""emotions"" also, just substitute the word when you read it: 

It looks like they feel pain, they have the same parts that we do that feel pain, so they probably feel pain. It would be scientifically ridiculous to say: they have nerves like we do, respond to pain medication like we do, respond to the same kinds of pain that we do in the same ways that we do, BUT it is most likely something different. Functioning systems are conserved in biology.

Also, the question is if we SUSPECT that they feel pain but we can't know for sure, wouldn't that lead us to the rational action of avoiding possible harm? If I think this chemical is toxic to a person, but am not positive, the only rational choice is not to give the chemical!

The only reason people fixate on the pain thing is because we can never know. I can never know if my dog feels pain, or if my baby does, or even if you do. Maybe you are having some other reaction that you just assume is what everyone else calls pain! Maybe you see yellow when I see blue! It is freshman metaphysics 101 nonsense."

tomfishtheGR8,AskMen,1389228550.0,"I will just answer the dancing part because I love dancing.

For me dancing is like sex, in that you if frame it as an attempt to make the other person feel good, you will take all the pressure and anxiety off yourself to be a ""good dancer"". Girls aren't looking to be ""impressed"" by your moves.  You are there to build a fun little bubble on the dancefloor where anything goes, and that comes from giving her your full attention. This doesn't mean sustained creepy eye contact, but it does mean not looking around constantly to see what everyone else is doing. If people laugh at your moves, who cares? Screw them. As long as she's laughing with you. 

In terms of technique, I would stay steer clear of the clishes for the first few songs (like the lawnmower, shopping cart, dice, ect). The reason is that these are not spontaneous or personal. She's definitely seen them before. I can't stress this enough, but you need pay attention to her. Imitate her moves and embellish them. Is she being ironically sexual? Go with it and add your own flare. Does she want to grind? Cool, follow her hips. Is she playing air guitar? Come in slappin da bass.  All that matters is the connection, and remember what that prositute said to the Khaleesi back in season one: ""Love comes in at the eyes"". 

All that being said, Will Smith offers a good starting point for any dance session here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bH0OXsmsbQ

I've basically gone from dubstep to house music to trance (and DnB inbetween as it was the first electronic genre I ever listened to).

&gt; can you explain, specifically, how the OP is racist?

Equating black hair to sponge cake could be seen as mockery by some people.  It's only racist in the sense that its insensitive to black people and probably entirely ignorant of actual black culture, and it seems to come out of Japanese fetishization of black culture.

On my left shoulder blade, I have the Aries symbol in red (fire sign), on my right shoulder blade I have the Pisces symbol in blue (water sign). Underneath my Pisces symbol, I have a Pisces ambigram. I will get the Aries one as well. I'm born on the cusp of both signs, hence why those symbols. 

On my left forearm is a partly-done tattoo that I'm getting for my mother. It's a yellow rose on the right (on my inner wrist) and a lilac in the left. Inbetween it says, ""The past is history, the future a mystery, this moment a gift which is why it's called the present."" That was one of my mother's favorite quotes. I don't have color in it yet so the flowers are just outlines. Lilacs and yellow roses were her favorite flowers. She passed away from cancer almost 8 years ago.

On my right forearm, I have a fairy that takes up the entirety of my inner forearm. No real meaning behind this tattoo. I think it's sort of a symbol of my femininity. I'm not super feminine or girly, but I have my moments and I think the tattoo represents that well. 

On my chest, I have the kanji symbol for 'soul' right above my left boob. This was my first tattoo when I was 18, and it was done by the owner of the shop I was at, I felt privileged! It's near my heart, so it was intended to imply 'heart and soul'. 

On my left outer ankle I have a tattoo for my eldest brother who passed away when I was 5. It's something he would always draw in his journals. It's an eye with a teardrop falling from it, and the teardrop is a peace sign. A cry for peace. :)"

JordanLeDoux,videos,1389228924.0,"That as well, but what I'm talking about is that he conveys no information to characterize ANY other person in that video. He simply lets their words speak for themselves.

But he feels it's important to characterize that she's female and then to imply that her redeeming quality is being sexy, which itself is sexist but also is unsubstantiated.

Basically, by making a point to mention it, he is suggesting that he is qualified to describe her AND that her sexiness is the only aspect of her person worthy of such description.

It was super tongue in cheek, the guy didn't think about it at all when he made the video. But that's the point, he didn't think at all, and she is reduced to a caricature of a person."

mariesoleil,asktransgender,1389229037.0,"Two very simple guidelines: Trans people are the gender we say they are. Treat us with respect.

If you follow those guidelines, you'll be far more considerate than many people.

Examples: 

If trans people are the gender we say we are, then the middle-aged person who introduces herself as Sarah should be given female pronouns and should be treated like a woman. This is true even if you think she's early on in transition, if you can see a bald spot, if her voice doesn't pass.

If trans people are the gender we say we are, then the cis man dating a trans woman is in a straight relationship. This holds true no matter what kind of genitals she has, or what kind of sex they have. A man giving a woman oral sex isn't gay if she has a cock instead of a vag.

If trans people should be treated with respect, then don't ask questions about our genitals. Most people have the respect to not ask the new mom if her vagina is healing up nicely, and when she can start having sex again. In the same manner, you shouldn't ask a trans man if he's getting bottom surgery and if so, what surgeon he's going to and what technique will be used.

If trans people should be treated with respect, don't give us unwanted beauty tips. You wouldn't tell a butch lesbian with a men's haircut and flannel shirt that she would be more feminine with longer hair and a nice blouse. So don't tell the trans woman that she needs to do her makeup differently or change her haircut in order to look ""more like a woman."" This especially goes if you don't think she she passes well. "

&gt;Also, if a man is always on the outside of his family then that is a huge problem that he needs to change, but not by slapping a last name on his family. How about actually changing his actions so that he's more a part of it?

No man is ever going to have has close a connection to his children as they have to their mother.  That's a result of biology.  That's why there are **no** societies **anywhere** in all of human history where women are not the primary caregivers."

If my SO found out how I was going to propose and then faked her surprise, that would literally be a lie. Good way to start off a marriage. The lie might set you free initially, but every time it comes up in the future it's going to just get worse-- he's just not going to realize it since you, the wife, continue to lie to him. That, and you're going to have to act like it was a surprise for the rest of your lives together. The relationship will never be as open and honest as you want it to be. 

I vote tell him, because what's a proposal anyway. Clearly you two love each other. Tell him the truth. Tell him what you found. Tell him it was perfect before it even came about. Tell him yes!!

acfrue,explainlikeIAmA,1389229231.0,"G'day viewahs! Today we're off tha coast of Cianwood City near the Whirl Islands searching for a rare and elusive creature known as Mantine. They typically love to hang around the whirlpools near the entrances to the caves on Route 41 and can often be seen leap-- **CRIKEY!! LOOK THERE TERRI!!** There's one! LET'S GET CLOSER!! 

Like I was saying, Mantines are both a watahh and flying type. If they build up enough speed they can break the surface of the watahh and glide majestically for quite a few meetahhs. Now typically these blokes are fairly docile in nature, so I'm gonna dive in and get as close as possible to this beaut!! (Steve dives into the turquoise colored sea and begins to approach the Mantine)

WOW! Look at this beast!! He is ab-soooo-lutely massive! I'd guess about 2 meetahhs across and upwards of 220 kilos! Something that not a lot of people know is that Mantines actually possess the ability to harness the power of rain which allows them to exponentially increase their speed. This is unbelievably useful in battle!! Imagine facing one of these creatures during a rain storm! *NO THANKS!!*

**OH MY GOD!** Terri you see this! I can't believe it! There is actually a Remoraid attached to this one! How lucky is that!?!?! Now these little bleedahs attach themselves to the undersides of Mantine and act like a cleaner fish. Its what we like to call a ""simm-bee-ohh-tic relationship""! The host provides food in the form of dead skin and parasoiites for the cleanahh fish, while at the same time the cleanahh fish is fed! Truly an unbelievable trait among some Pokemon!

Just so you know, if you lower your carb intake sharply like this diet would do, you may go through something known as ""no carb flu"". Your body adjusts to using fat and protein as fuel and detoxes from the excess sugars and toxins, and it basically feels like you have the flu for anywhere from a couple days to a couple weeks. It's totally normal, and to help ease it along, you'll just want to try to get more sleep than usual and make sure you are eating extra protein and fat for your body to convert into energy. Drinking dandelion root tea will help your liver with the detox :) You can also supplement with [maca root powder](http://www.naturalnews.com/027797_maca_root_hormone_balance.html) to give you an extra boost, caffeine free (I've pulled over-nighters and 12 hour shifts at work solely on maca with no coffee or tea, shit works, lol!).

If your grandfather were to cut his face shaving it will likely bleed for a long time but not gushing. Its just the same trickle as it would be to you but continuous. There are things he can put on it to stop the bleeding.

A concern that you wouldn't really think about is bruising since a bruise is bleeding under the skin. Someone as clumsy as myself would have to be monitored more closely since those internal bleeds can be just as dangerous as a bad cut.

My office has a group of nurses that deal exclusively with patients on warfarin and manages their doses. There is a goal for them where the patient still has some clotting ability. Its a balancing act for sure. I've seen some patients that see the nurses every few days while others who have found the right dose only go in once a month to have their levels checked.

Tl; dr your grandfather is pretty safe. He just needs to be a little more aware of bruising and if he gets a bad cut to see his doctor. "

Rapists don't believe their victims have dignity and the right to their bodies, otherwise they would not rape them in the first place. How can ""teaching your sons not to rape"" change this fundamental mentality that the son might have. It is a fundamentally warped view.

You seem to be describing the act of a sociopath raping a stranger or near-stranger. This is a much less controversial issue than what constructive feminists tend to concern themselves with.

These are examples of rape-related problems that constructive feminists focus on:

* A woman is repeatedly and systematically abused and raped by her boyfriend for months or years, revealing nothing because he has threatened her life if she talks. When she finally leaves him and ""goes public"", people flock to the boyfriend's side, demanding to know why she stayed for so long if it was so bad, why he did X and Y nice things for her if he was so abusive, and why she didn't say X and Y things to make her emotions clearer to him.

* A high school girl gets drunk at a party and multiple male acquaintances coerce her into group sex. Was it rape? Was it consensual? Did she agree to the sex because she wanted it or because they had already started tearing her clothes off before they asked? No one ever finds out for sure, because the guys tell everyone at school about it and the girl is ostracized for being a slut. Her friends abandon her and when she tells her parents that she thinks she might have been raped, they tell her about the porn they found on her computer, and how they know she's a pervert, and they're ashamed of her.

* A woman meets a guy at a bar. He asks her to come back to his place and she turns him down. He follows her home and confronts her at her doorstep, demanding that she just let him inside to have a cup of coffee and talk for a bit, to give him another chance. She finally agrees because she's afraid of being injured if she tries to force him away. Once inside, he forces himself on her. The next day, the police ask her why she let him inside if she didn't want to have sex with him and refuse to file a report.

I made up those anecdotes, but it only took me a minute or two to come up with because I have not only read about countless similar real-life accounts, but heard many of them first hand from friends and acquaintances. If you pay attention, you'll notice them. They happen a lot, and they happen everywhere. When constructive feminists talk about ""rape culture"", this is the kind of shit they're talking about."

With all the salt on the roads this time a year making its way into the water supply, its worth a look. 

As far as keeping it under control beyond constant water changes (not an option for me, since the issue is my tap water) -- the best option is heavily planting the tank. My plants halve the nitrates out of my tap in just under 12 hours, and by the 2nd day they're at a perfectly safe 10 ppm. Water sprite, cardinal telanthera, and duckweed are particularly good at this -- just scoop out the excess duckweed every now and then, since it grows like a weed when there is enough nitrate to feed it.

JarlesV3,AskMen,1389229653.0,"Well, as someone who has bottled up their emotions for a while, I think I can comment a little bit on this one.

First, emotions make us human. And if we want to worry about being manly, there are several historical sources that tell us that only the manliest of men freely and openly wept for their friends, families, and loved ones. So being an emotional person makes us manly. But beyond that, when we can freely express our emotions, we can become a whole person. I'm sure you've experienced that, otherwise you wouldn't want to stop repressing your emotions. So you're on the right track. Awesome!

Now, how do we act on our emotions in ways that aren't destructive? Well, that's going to be unique to you. And I hate to break it to you, but you're going to have some emotional growing up to do. Seriously, it'll feel like going through puberty again. Emotional mood swings; the most intense emotions ever; not knowing what to do with yourself; everything except the hormones. This is because you're relearning how to handle being a whole and emotional person.

Talk with someone about it.

Talking about your emotions, while experiencing them, is a great way to learn about yourself and what your feeling. When I was going though my period of emotional relearning, I had a couple of different friends that I talked with. Sometimes just a phone call saying ""This sucks, I feel like my world is crumbling down around me!"" followed up with a ""No, I'll be okay, I just needed to get that out.""

Before you know it, you'll be able to identify your emotions and decide when it's appropriate to express them, and how to express them. Read books, watch dramatic movies, and listen to music. I've personally found that Young Adult novels are best for eliciting an emotional response. And if I need a good cry ""I Am Legend"" will always get me with the dog Sam.

Hope this helps, and good luck to you.

Edit **tl;dr** : A real man expresses his emotions. You might need to take the time to ""grow up"" with your emotions again, and that's okay."

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AskReddit,1389229889.0,"some great logic there, i'm not sure what post apocalyptic future you envisage you recanting your tales to your offspring in, but allow me to actually cast some reality to you.

what will actually happen, is that every photo of a building/landmark  you have taken will exist somewhere online taken by somewhere else, and to your grandchildren and even to yourself simply viewing it as it was at the time will be enough for the effect you describe.

what you seem to be blissfully unaware of is that stationary inanimate objects don't really age and change with time, and if they do, they are so well photographed by other people that your specific photograph is meaningless both to yourself and to others.

But a snapshot of a person is unique. it captures the time frozen completely.

a picture of the Eiffel tower taken by you in 1995 and taken by Mr brown in 2005, shows no real difference, i would even bet that one could swap the photos and you couldn't tell the difference when you come to view them years from now.

if you think the time spent documenting monuments and buildings on your travels is worthwhile you are kidding yourself. the only value at all they serve is an aid to memory of the events that took place, but the same effect can be taken by simply putting someone else's photo of the place in there (or viewing it many years later online)

A second group of heifers whose access to food was provided independently of their panel presses showed no such behaviors.

This also makes me glad because I was worried about Bryant leaving with Folston coming out and playing so well. We're deep on RB with Folston and Bryant, then Carlisle, McDaniel and Mahone.

richardjohn,electronicmusic,1389229973.0,"Your clubs definition actually explains quite a lot – we were all quite shocked when we went to Matthew Dear (in SF). 

First thing we noticed that the club was really shiny. Mirrored ceiling, soft blue lighting on the bar, that kind of thing. In the UK, the clubs that look like that just play chart music. For someone like Matthew Dear, you'd generally expect a sweaty dark room with brick walls, and a bar that considers rum and coke to be a cocktail. The second thing was THE GRINDING MY GOD. People were almost having sex on the dancefloor. Here you'd never go to a proper club to try and find a one night stand. Not saying they never happen, and there are quite often a couple of creepers trying, but in general most people are there for the music and/or to get fucked up.

If you're going to see a DJ, it'll be in a club 99% of the time. There are occasional exceptions for when a DJ wants to play a bigger venue (like the Four Tet all-nighter at Brixton Academy, which is a music venue), but they're quite rare. Live electronic acts will more often play these venues though.

Are the raves you mention legal? The word's sort of fallen out of use here... it used to mean illegal outdoor parties, but now we call those free parties. There's a big scene of squat parties, which are the same deal but in squatted buildings (usually warehouses). They attract a lot of younger people because they're usually 16+ rather than 18. They also attract the 40+ people who look like they've been going to parties for 30 years, but that's mainly because you can take/sell drugs openly."

Escape92,Judaism,1389230076.0,"&gt;Some of us can ascribe who we are to specific life events. What major life events have played into making you who you are today? Is it purely divine providence?

Personally I can't, I don't believe that one single event has made me who I am today - I am who I am because of the combined experiences I have had.

&gt;Is there a major, turning a corner type event you can point to? Is it religiously significant? Why are you Jewish, or are you? Why are you the denomination of Jew you are, or why aren't you a denomination?

When I was 11 I went to a friend's Bat Mitzvah at the local reform synagogue. At the time my family were all members of the Spanish and Portuguese synagogue, because they always had been, but we barely ever attended. I think I can remember maybe 8 visits there in 11 years.   A short while after the Bat Mitzvah my mum told me my grandparents had decided to move to the reform shul, and they would pay for us to do so as well, so we did. A short while after that I began studying for my Bat Mitzvah, which was one of the most positive and precious experiences I've ever had. 

I have never felt more comfortable, more accepted or more welcome of any community than I do in my shul. I am pretty committed to my own interpretation of Judaism within the framework of the reform movement. Being a part of a community which I fundamentally agree with on so many issues has really made me develop a much stronger Jewish identity than I might otherwise have had. It took all the beliefs I was taught in Jewish Primary School and explained them so I could understand whether I accepted them or could choose to reject them based on what I feel is right.

&gt;Is there someone, or a group of someones, you should thank for who you are today? Any piece of great advice that made a difference?

I guess my mum and my grandparents, to making the decision to move us to a shul where I could become Bat Mitzvah, and also my Bat Mitzvah teacher who is still a great friend. Also my current rabbi, who is young enough to understand what it's like to be a reform Jew in your 20s but also wise enough to give great advice. He's amazing."

Edmonton had an opportunity to take the refinery lands in the 1970s and failed to do so.

You could lure the stalker into accessing or registering onto a site that you or a friend has sysadmin access to, and have them register online as your male identity. You could then track them down from their IP address they used to access the site, hopefully. Might be hard to execute successfully however. 

This fucker seems determined, reminds me of some of the sick fucks I've encountered on the net. This is a chess game, and you've got to be smart and out think your opponent. 

If Facebook wasn't such an ass, I'd recommend talking to them on the phone. Might give that a shot, and have them hand the IP addresses to you and the authorities. If that doesn't work, go into the local Police and have them talk to facebook and attain their records, because I can say you've got at least a 50/50 shot that they did this dirty and didn't hide behind a proxy properly. Especially if they've become complacent with having executed it successfully in the past numerous times. They'll get comfortable, and think they're in the clear. A lot of amateur black hats get real comfy and slip up. 

Yeah, I'm pretty positive if you get your government police to tell FB to hand over the records, you'll find your man. I don't know how the AUS works, but it should be pretty straight forward if you're serious about stopping this today. Go to the police with a friend or family member, don't go alone. 

Bring screenshots, pictures, bring a whole folder full of evidence if you can. It'll help volumes. 

If I was in the AUS I'd make the fucker disappear for you right quick. But since I'm not, all I can offer is my brain. 

Stay strong sister. You've got friends here.

For those who think science is ""all that"", it stands to reason they would also think that humans - the only conscious beings in the universe capable of practicing or even knowing science - are privileged, special beings.

It's incredibly frustrating, because her mother and her sister are both on medication for depression, but she refuses to believe that it could be a chemical issue, not a relationship issue. 

My advice, make new memories ASAP that build your relationship without you appearing apologetic. I know you are in the aftermath of this ""fight"" you just had, but as soon as possible take her to a movie/concert/show she wants to see, preferably something upbeat and kinetic. Also, if she's feeling ugly around you, compliment her subtly. Not on her physical appearance (to obvious, also something she doesn't actively have control over) but how she looks in a certain dress, shoes, earrings ect. This will give her ways to make herself feel sexy when she's around you. "

foxesforsale,ffxiv,1389230580.0,"After healing erroneously too much from mouse over heals and finding that between casts it plenty of time to change target, I stopped using mouse over heals. I'll try remember to post a pic of my UI when I get home from work, basically I use 4 horizontal hotbars, one in the middle lower screen, the other three all next to each other immediately below it.

My UI: http://i.imgur.com/JlNxm44.jpg

My first hotbar is basically stuff that I'm going to be casting alll the time. It's in rough order of most used - I used my keyboard for 1-5, pretty much everything else is clicked. I don't like clustering my Cures together as I find it hard to quickly visually distinguish them. A lot of people put Cure III on a different hotbar, but I use it all the time for healing people clustered together. I think i'm gonna swap Raise and Stoneskin, as I use stoneskin way more often and Control+4 is kind of awkward. 

Also Instant Raise is 
/macroicon Raise
/ac Swiftcast &lt;me&gt;
/wait 1
/ac Raise &lt;t&gt;

The wait 1 is to wait one second for the animation lock on Swiftcast. I'm gonna take the wait out of mine as due to lag, the 1 second wait isn't enough and Raise fails to cast, so I spam the macro anyway. Which would be fine if it wasn't for me macroing in an autotranslate raise announcement so I spam party chat a little."

So I took that to its logical conclusion and created a character known only as Backpack, who was cursed by many, myriad items of varying power and utility--and when combat broke out, I'd roll on a couple 100-entry tables to figure out what his equipment was that day. 

The rest of the items he was cursed with wouldn't fail to appear, though; they just fell in a pile around him with a massive clatter.

""This assumes things which are wrong.""  
  
*Orville looks around.*  
  
""The only thing I am slave to is myself, as all men are slaves to theirselves. In truth, we can never really choose what we believe to be right or wrong. These feelings exist within us.""  
  
*Orville walks towards the pillar where he defends his mother. He swings the shackles into it and it shatters to pieces.*  
  
""Your repeated attempts to show me images of my mother are a fool's game. I do not even know if she lives. I keep hope that she does, but I know it is possible she does not, and if I learn of her death, I will be saddened, but not devastated.""  
  
*Orville walks over to the pillar where the Broken Shackle Pirates sail away from the the World Government.*  
  
""This dream is one we gave up when we formed our crew, and we all understood that. I am beholden to my desire of freedom for all. I will one day go to the top of the world, and if my mother is there, I will rescue her. If she is dead, I will have vengeance. Either way, the so-called 'Holy Land' shall fall. This is my conviction I am beholden to.""  
  
*Orville's raises his arms and slams the shackles against this pillar, causing it to crack, but not fall apart. He walks over to the pillar showing him alone in victory.*  
  
""Indeed, this is a sad sight. I would not lose my friends if I could, but they are aware of the risks our mission holds. We would all like to live in the perfect world brought about by our actions, but it is possible we will have to sacrifice something along the way, if not fail entirely. And yet this is our course.""  
    
""Indeed, should I liberate the world, and lose my friends, I would mourn that loss greatly. But I would also take pleasure in knowing that their sacrifice was not in vain. Still... should there be a sacrifice...""  
  
*Orville stares at the pillar, imagining something different. Now instead of Orville standing alone, his friends all stand together, overlooking the perfect city. Behind them is a lone gravestone, over which his pick-hammer lies.*  
  
""This is something else that makes me a slave to my own ways. I would rather die and have others carry on the mission than see it completed at the loss of good people. I would die before my friends or any innocent had to. Ask your comrade, the mad doctor.""  
  
*Orville looks towards the broken pillar showing the sailing crew.*  
  
""Still... If I were to choose something ideal...""  
  
*Orville imagines a combination of the two images: Orville and his crew, happily sailing away from the perfect city.*  
  
""This is my ideal. This is my goal. This is what I work towards, what I have gathered a crew for, what I have chosen to do with my new life. For it is the conviction to try, even in the face of failure, forgoing safety and reason, the drive to face a seemingly-indomitable foe, and the belief that I will eventually win. That is who I am. And when you act true to who you are, you are slave to nothing, not even yourself.""  
  
*Orville looks at the shackles.*  
  
""That is my freedom. That is my power!""  
  
*Orville breaks free of the shackles, stretching out his arms. He rubs his hands together for warmth.*  
  
""However, I imagine that is not the answer you wish to hear, and I have more to teach you. So I will abide by the game's rules until there is no further purpose in doing so.""  
  
*Orville points to the pillar showing a lonely Orville overlooking the perfect city.*  
  
""It is not ideal... But the sad truth is that an ideal world simply is not possible. And as I would not go down the other two courses, this is sadly the most likely outcome, but still the most pleasant. Of the outcomes you have presented me with, this is the one I choose."""

atomicmilk,fatpeoplestories,1389230722.0,"One of the most the most important things in recovering from an eating disorder, ANY eating disorder, is to never ever skip meals. I understand how you can feel strangely proud of the ""willpower"" you had from not eating, but skipping meals is just as worse as binging them. If anything, it wasn't willpower you had last night, it was probably more of a ""the less I eat=the less I binge"" sort of mentality, and I get that. Sometimes eating anything can be scary because you're never sure when it will turn into a binge. But by restricting a meal, you're inevitably setting yourself up for a binge later. The best thing you can do for recovery is to stick to a meal plan, and stick to it 100%. When it's a meal time, you eat a meal an you eat exactly how much your meal plan dictates. It will get you into a more normalized eating schedule so eating can become natural again, and it also sets boundaries to keep you from binging. I really recommend seeing a dietician to help get you started, and if you feel comfortable, a counselor as well.

IndieLady,videos,1389230787.0,"&gt; OBviously, it would veer into creepy or harassment territory if she were to tell him that she's not into that kind of thing and he were to go on describing things in that way. But we haven't gotten that far in this song. We're still waiting to hear what she thinks of all this. 

But he doesn't know she is into it. He's just presuming. He ""knows"" she ""wants it"", he think she's a ""good girl"" who would like her arse smacked and her haired pulled. He doesn't actually know any of this. *That is what makes it creepy.* This could be awesome dirty talk, but as something said to someone you don't know, it's sleazy, icky, gross.

This is what you don't seem to understand, that going up to someone you don't know, presume you know what they want, and presuming they're into rough sex. Then telling them how you want to pull their hair, smack them, tear their ""arse in two"". Yes it's subjective. *That's the point.* Yes some people like it, some people don't. (As I have said repeatedly, I get kink, I don't think it's bad or wrong. If this is some kind of kink anthem, more power to him, but there is no frame of reference to indicate it is.). What *is* bad or wrong is going up to someone who you don't know, telling them you ""know"" they're into rough play and telling them that you want to smack them round. That's why tact and social cues are relevant. That's why you don't dive in and tell a girl she's a ""good girl"" who ""wants it"", even though you're not really sure at all. That's sleazy.

&gt;The only signs he sees on are the things that he is asking her about point-blank and waiting for her answer. That's enthusiastic consent. 

How is enthusiastic consent? She hasn't consented to anything, she hasn't said a word. Where is there any kind of demonstration of her consent? And furthermore, at what point does he ask the girl anything at all? All he says is what he thinks she wants and what he wants to do to her:

I'm gon' take a good girl / I know you want it / Can't let it get past me / The way you grab me, must wanna get nasty / Go ahead, get at me / You the hottest bitch in this place / I feel so lucky / You wanna hug me / Let me liberate you / Let me be the one you back that ass to / So hit me up when you pass through / I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two / So I just watch and wait for you to salute / But you didn't pick, not many women can refuse this pimpin' / I'm a nice guy, but don't get it if you get with me / 
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt / What you don't like work?

All of it assertion, presumption, ""knowing"" what she wants, telling her what she should do, or what he wants to do to her. The only question he asks is ""What, you don't like work?"" Yeah, sexy. Referring to sex as ""work"". And that seems more like a challenge than a question at any rate. Ugh, the more I analyse this, it's such an anthem to douchebaggery. There is no sexiness, no flirtation, no playful teasing. It's so hamfisted and awkward, so sleazy. It's pretty much a Jersey Shore-esque ""you look DTF, I know you want it"".

&gt;Your taste in flirting does not make something creepy or icky.

I have said repeatedly, this is *my* opinion. This is why *me and my friends* find it creepy. This is why *I* am uncomfortable with the song. It is beyond me why you have spent this much time to tell me I am wrong, whilst at the same time asserting that it's ok to have different opinions. I know it's ok to have different opinions, it seems that you simply can't cope with me finding this sleazy. What is it with dudes telling women how they should feel about sex?"

CalvinDehaze,Screenwriting,1389230887.0,"I understand that you're using it as a metaphor in your analogy, but you can also see it as a counter-metaphor. Yes, there's prestige that you pay for by having a shop on Rodeo drive, but there's also a different clientele there of high-end customers who do shop there. It might not be as packed as the mall in Iowa, but that shop has to sell more than the shop on Rodeo, even with the high rent, because rich people will pay more for their items. You can either sell more for less, or less for more, and end up at the same spot.
  
As a writer, your focus should be the story above all else, and you should be writing for everybody, including yourself. It's a collaborative process between the studio, director, producer, etc, and everyone is going to put their two cents into it. And at the end of the day, it is up to the audience. Look at Gravity. No studio exec thought that movie would do as good as it did. But when you break it down, it appealed to everyone on all levels. If it didn't it wouldn't have gotten made.
  
You can't discredit Rodeo drive for being fake and empty, for the same reason you can't discredit the mall in Iowa for selling cheap crap. Both are equal avenues in which a consumer can obtain a product, and as a screenwriter, you need to keep all options open."

Ajaxeler,TwoXChromosomes,1389231214.0,"As someone who just switched from the bad boy to the good guy. I can tell you my opinion.
Bad boys ... well not necessarily movie stereotype bad boys but the closest example I've got tend to win out because of confidence. I'm not sure why good guys lack confidence but most the ones i know just don't have it. Maybe they were shy as kids and women never really responded and they grew up insecure I just don't know. Confidence to me is one of the sexiest things in a guy and its what gets me interested enough to go on a date. And with confidence comes excitement.

So why did I start dating the good guy? Because im 32 and I'm way smarter now. I know bad boys are not good for me :D They were heaps of fun in my 20s because that's what I wanted. I didn't want to get married and have kids I wanted to enjoy life and have adventures. I wanted passionate love affairs and I wanted lots of them. I wanted to date someone from every country (only managed France, Canada &amp; Iran heh.) but now I don't want that anymore. Now I want to settle down, still have adventures but not the extent I used to. I want true deep lasting love. Still no marriage or kids not my style but someone who I will be with forever. 

But when you hit 30 most the good guys are all gone by the girls who wanted to settle down earlier :P Anyyyyway that's a whole other issue :P"

ctesibius,mac,1389231255.0,"TextEdit is actually pretty useful (the other build-in program which is misunderestimated is Preview, which does a lot more than the name would suggest). Pages, Microsoft Word and LibreOffice are all more powerful than TextEdit, but not in ways that make them much better for note-taking: they are better at fancy formatting or writing large documents. For note-taking, keep it simple. If you don't like TextEdit, there are specialised programs such as Evernote which will help with organising notes by project, tagging notes with keywords so that you can find them, web storage, and so on.  I'd suggest getting Evernote to start with (it's free) and see if you like it. If you don't like it, you'll have a clearer idea about what you want.

Someone mentioned Scrivener. That's not optimised for note-taking in lectures or for a full course. It's sort of word processor for writing huge documents or books, with facilities for organising notes on the *single* project that you are doing, so you might use it in a library when doing a course project. However if you end up using Evernote there is a fair amount of overlap. It's still recommended that you have something like MS Word for final formatting of the document.

Pages - not really ideal. It's more oriented towards fancy formatting.

Microsoft Word - pretty good on the whole. You can get Microsoft Office fairly cheaply with the Student and Home edition, though it will still be the most expensive option. Most of it is the state of the art for word-processing. Unfortunately the one bit which is a bit buggy is the ""notebook"" view, which would have been useful for you."

Or, if you do a market buy, you buy at what the lowest seller is asking for.  If you do a market sell, you sell at what the highest bidder is bidding at.  With each exchange that happens, the 'value' of Bitcoin changes.  Ie, if I sold you 1 BTC for $950, then the value on the exchange, in that moment, will go to $950.  If a pair after us trades at $951, then that becomes the new price.  With coinbase, there is no bid or ask, there are only market buys and sells with a spread between the two.

And is essentially true, if grossly simplified.

That the girl then goes on to say ""I don't see what's wrong with that"" is actually a positive, it means the mom isn't filling her head with fear.  If she had said something like ""My mom tells me if I eat too much, I'll be fat.  I don't want to be fat because everyone hates fat girls."" then alarms should go off.

The fact of the matter is, if you want to make League any kind of professional sport, you have to expect some kind of accountability and responsibility on the part of the teams.  The old guard teams have been around long enough to understand what they have to do.  If a new team can't figure out paperwork then they don't belong in the LCS.

I don't like throwing these in the trash since, after about two days, the smell is rancid.  Trust me, a couple of chicken bones sitting in the trash bin on a hot summer's day will result into this malodorous stench that soaks into everything.

Since I live in a high rise, I would otherwise have to physically take the bones to the dumpster the next day.  That's a trip clear across the building, down the freight elevator, and then in the rear lobby, just so I can exit into the alley, open the building's dumpster, and toss the refuse away.

mehatch,humor,1389231712.0,"I see what you mean, like for instance, man, I can't stand how Boy Scouts are portrayed in every movie or TV show ever, just zero bearing on how scouting was from my experience (i.e. i found that scouts were more just regular teenagers, closer to beavis and butthead, than the inaccurate stereotype that they're replublican-in-training puppy-eyed robots of enthusiasm.) longwinded way of saying i know that feel...but thenagain, this topic is more sensitive and challenging for the group of folks that's the subject...so in trating this with genuine thuoghtfullness then, i guess the next question wouldbe, is a comedian or comedy writer responsible to properly inform the audience. Tough question...and i'm a bit torn. On the one side, does a cultural standard which frowns on inaccurate premises in comedy put a chilling effect on comedy, and in a world where accurate information is available from non-comedic sources (wikipedia, primary sources, peer-reviwed journals, etc) so immediately, does that not further alleviate the comedian from the burden of truthiness as the real info is available elsewhere? But on theother hand, unfortunately, not everyone gets their information from reliable sources, and does that place a burden on the comedian to 'fight the good fight' and make up for the gap of those who don't do the due dilligence to find out what the reality and challenges of the transgendered community? I think with unlimited time and resources, i might lean toward the latter, but as someone who's done some comedy writing himself (far, far less than the author of the website) it's really hard work, and sometimes the joke wins out...like explosions in the non-oxygen environment of space. But even if i take all of that aside, at the end of the day, moral culpability IMHO launders at the last causal entity in the chain who can make a choice; in this case, the lazy bigot, and even though that person may continue to not find out what the reality is, I guess i come out leaning toward the conclusion that since the final bigoted choice is in the hands of another, the burden can't be placed on the writer per se, if we are to accept the premise that people are responsible for their own behavior. It's nto at all lost on me that good can be done with more dilligence toward truthiness, but in this case, given the laundering of culpability, the writer's bad/good score here comes out at neutral or zero. I dunno, that's just my initial thoughts, but I shoudl also add that I'm personally add that I know the writer has personally done a great deal of work with non-profits that support LGBT causes, so he's got that going for him.

Bluefastakan,cardsagainsthumanity,1389231714.0,"Ah, I love this. Making custom cards is one of my favorite things about this game. Though I personally just make the shitty little standard card stock cards that you can't really integrated into the real set as I am of the plebs. This method should get you where you need:

For formatting you can go [here](http://mdsc.info/dropbox/cah/) and get the blank copies of the full-sized cards. With these you can then just edit the PDFs and type in whatever crazy shit you'd like. If you don't know how to edit PDFs you can use this [free online program](http://www.pdfescape.com/account/?expired) that I like to use. 

For actually getting cards the same consistency as the standard stuff your best bet would be shopping around to a few copying places. The CAH guys recommend Staples but I'm not terribly sure if they have the glossy card stock you would be needing. I have heard that [Fedex Kinkos](http://www.fedex.com/us/office/) carries them and you'd be able to get ones like that. With this method you would be able upload the cards online and have them shipped directly to you (Surprise! Fedex ships stuff too!) For the actual print options you can pick full color and then glossy cover. This should give you the best quality look of the cards and should match quite well with the existing sets. I will warn you that it's a tad more expensive going this route, but you said money was no option so we're going expensive. Just be aware that it's going to be about .75 per page with about six cards per page making a fully printed-out version of the full game cost somewhere around $75 to personally print (not including shipping/cutting/extra fancies).

If you're planning on going this route I would definitely print out a single page of the cards first just to make sure that they look all right before you commit to a mega fuck-huge order.

ALSO. If you're looking for ideas for new cards we have the lovely subreddit /r/cahideas that you can dig through. Or you can go to the heart of the matter. The online version of the game ""Pretend You're Xyzzy"" has all of the cards released so far in a list format along with some of the internet's more famous home-brewed batches. [Giant-ass list here](http://pyx-1.socialgamer.net/viewcards.jsp). 

This is not by any means the end-all solution. There is probably a much easier way to do it, but this is the best way I can think of. Hope it was helpful."

&gt;As a young women who's gone clubbing in Auckland many a time (only once in Wellington so I can't comment on that), I have always noticed packs of Indian guys on the prowl. This is not to say that guys of other ethnicity do not go prowling in large groups too, not at all. However many a time whilst clubbing/drinking at a bar, I have had to purposely avoid a rather creepy advance from an Indian guy/s (and they can be persistent to the point of scary), much, much more than any other race. This is not me being racist or ignorant, I have absolutely nothing against Indians! But in my personal opinion and from I've experienced, the problem of Indian guys in packs being creepy in clubs/bars is in fact, true.

GoNavy_09,guns,1389231789.0,"Thanks for the tip, that's helpful! But I am not interested in buying from that place you mentioned if they really are that bad. I know it may not make economic sense, but if a dealer is rude and rips people off I just don't buy from them, even if they have a good deal. One store in my home town has all sorts of historic guns, but they have literally said ""buy something or get out"" to me when in there, so there is no interested. 
Thats really interesting about the Arisaka! I had heard that they were strong, but I had no idea they were *that* strong. That is really neat. 
Also thanks for the tips about the Mausers and rings sizes. I didn't know which had small or large so that is a really helpful, and really important tip. Would you happen to have some Argentine 1891 stocks you'd be willing to sell? I found a Bubba'd one for $100 and another for $250, and the ones with original stocks that I see go for about $350-$450, so if I could un-Bubba them I'd save a killing. But I'm not asking for them for free, you've already said you'll give me the Czech one and I don't want to take advantage of your generosity. So if you do I'd just add your price to the shipping of that one Czech stock. Of course lets wait on the Czech stock until I know if I'm getting this Gew98, I emailed the guy but he hasn't replied and it has been a while. I also emailed the owners of the Argentinos to make sure they haven't been altered in anyway aside from the stocks but they haven't replied. I'm currently in the process of haggling for a 1943 K98k dot barreled receiver. I'm hoping I can get it for $50 since I'd have to get so many other parts to actually build a Mauser out of it and a K98k stock is easily $200+ and thats not including a trigger guard, trigger, front and read sights, floor plate and bolt. Also it needs a safety and it would be a real project. But worth it if I can get it for the right price! 
I did some research and I'm probably going to try and get that C&amp;R license! 
I wish your collectors had your mentality of ""they should not be sold at the insane prices that they will surely command by the time I kick off, give poor guys the chance at them"" because it would sure help out a lot of us young guys who get interested. So many guys my age have expressed interest but lose all hope and give up because they see the collector grade guns going for thousands. I'm sorry you won't have someone to pass them on to, but at least you have a plan which I'm sure helps!
And thank you (to both the rifle part and the spouse part), I've always found the aircraft sights entertaining. I wonder if they ever had any success.

DERangEdKiller,AskReddit,1389231999.0,"When I tried to quit, I noticed there were two ""urges"".  one was the need to feel my lungs pulling on a smoke, and that's nothing really.  

The big one, well as nicotine leaves your system, you do feel jitters, but they are brief.  It's actually hard to understand what your body is telling you when you quit.  It's only after days without smoking you realize a overall tension in your body has slowly been ratcheting up to the point you wanna stab a motherfucker, and you don't immediately know why.

It's only after saying fuck it and having a smoke that you feel all the muscles in your body kind of just relax.

going off tobacco makes me feel an overall nervousness with life in general, and you really feel motivated by the day's stress and tension.  When I smoke, all that tension goes away, and I can think rationally without fear."

duckface08,canada,1389232216.0,"By ""instances"", I don't mean ""days"". For example, say you call in sick two days in a row - that's one instance. I just put in a number as an example. It'll depend a lot on what your job is like, if you have any pre-existing conditions (i.e. lupus), etc.

If you work a desk job, for example, you could still work with the sniffles or something like that, and unless your co-workers are routinely bringing in infectious illnesses instead of staying home, you're less likely to get very sick. I work as a nurse, so I routinely am in close contact with people carrying all sorts of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. I also work with a lot of immunocompromised people, so I have to be very aware of my own health and not go into work if I'm infectious.

Even so, I only ever get sick maybe once or twice a year (not counting something really minor, like the sniffles, which could just be allergies anyway). Then again, I don't have kids, which obviously changes things. If you are getting sick to the point of needing to take time off work multiple times a year, then you should probably get that checked out or make some lifestyle changes (i.e. eat healthy, wash your hands frequently, get enough sleep)"

But hey, here's the fun part. Women are people too. They have feelings, just like you and me, and free will. Women can have sex with whomever they want, and they aren't obliged to owe sex to someone who is just generally being ""nice"".

* I think you'll find that those who value City living the most are those who live in rent controlled apartments, or those who've otherwise made SF their home because of what it represents, not because it's close to Silicon Valley. **The market will do nothing to ensure that a vibrant mix of people continue to live there.**
* You think landlords should be able to change the rent at whim?
* **I personally do not believe that displacing someone because of a dramatic increase in rent as fair. I see it as greed and greed only.** The operating costs for this building did not change. The investment was fine and solid. It is done simply because it can be done, and I do not think one should do things simply because they can.
* You dont just get to do what you want. Beside, thats kind of selfish


* Because property rights, and society's enforcement of that right to exclusive use of a limited resource, and any number of services the property owner depends on for the property to have value only exists because society granted them in the first place.....**The owner then should not...expect the public to give them a free ride.**


*  I understand that I can't put in a fish canning factory, or build a skyscraper, just because I own the land....But accepting society's limits on private property ownership is not the same as accepting unlimited re-definition of those limits after one has purchased the property.

* Google and the rest of the tech world needs to focus on giving back to the community instead of simply taking from it, or getting around it. They are operating like software people do, making ""work arounds"" for things, instead of developing and improving their economic environment as is so badly needed.....A wonderful, relatively inexpensive and totally awesome thing Google could do would be to help build and pay for a bay bike trail from San Francisco to the Peninsula that would allow it's employees to enjoy a wonderful and safe bike ride from the City to its offices along the Peninsula. Google could even buddy up with other tech giants like Oracle and Apple and they could all pitch in to build this bicycle super highway that we could all use to get around on bikes instead of being locked up in these crappy cages: buses, trains and cars....Who wants to work with us to help make this happen?

Yes, well, you're a woman.  All women say that, as they rule.  Women's capacity for denying that they have the power in a situation is central to woman's power over men.

&gt;Just out of curiosity, how old are you? 

Thirty-seven.

&gt;Have you been married/had kids?

Nope.

&gt;I'm just wondering where you are getting these ideas from. 

Observation plus theory plus research.  But here's the easiest and simplest way to understand it:  A man and a woman come together and have sex.  She gets pregnant.  The child grows in her and the man is outside the experience, forever a mystery to him, the one thing he never gets to know.  The child is born and still connected to the mother, until the umbilical is cut, and still the father is outside the experience.  The child is placed on the mother's breast so she can feed it, and  still the father is outside the experience.

That is where the ""outsided-ness"" of men begins, in those experiences he can never partake in."

rawkuts,NoStupidQuestions,1389232408.0,"In short, a woman naturally goes through periods of fertility and infertility. Hormonal birth control basically tricks the body into thinking it's always in the state of infertility. With men, there's no analogous situation. This is one of the reasons why it's technically more difficult to make a contraceptive pill for men.

There have been male birth control pills, but they would sometimes have the side effect of making some of the men impotent, and just plain not working on 10-20% of other men. Also, in women, you're having to mitigate one egg a month. In men, you're having to mitigate over one thousand sperm per second.

Even so, it's still being actively worked on and every year or so there are breakthroughs. There are some issues with funding, were pharmaceutical companies are a bit wary about putting money into a male contraceptive pill when they're not sure how well it would sell."

The best way to stop a player like that is to stop the ball getting to them. Track him as much as you can when he is off the ball, that way you can (hopefully) stop the ball from getting to him.

Sure, physical attraction is important, and taking good care of yourself is important. You can't expect someone to want to spend the rest of their life with you if they have no physical attraction to you whatsoever, but a successful relationship relies on so many more factors than looks.

RandianHero,videos,1389232647.0,"It's not ""American"" -- it's just being a grown up. Passing from adolescence into adulthood means learning how to deal with life as it comes and not be utterly useless when your fragile ego takes a hit. People who don't grow up and learn that *aren't* successful by any measure; they're stuck in a permanent state of adolescence where even the slightest infraction against them is devastating.

Think about when a child falls and cries. Is the child crying because he's actually hurt, or because his ego is bruised? As you mature, you become less sensitive to simple setbacks like falling, because you steadily learn (hopefully) that being sensitive to hardship confers no actual benefit. You learn that big boys don't cry when they fall; they pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and carry on -- because falling isn't actually that big a deal. You learn to take adversity in stride because reality isn't there to give you a big hug and tell you it's okay. You learn that the only person who can make it okay is *you*.

If you go through life expecting a hug and sympathy every time you get kicked in the ass, you're going to have a bad time. This is equally true with men and women, but the standard is especially impressed upon men. Whether that's fair or not is irrelevant, because the point is the same either way: weakness is bad. It shouldn't be encouraged because it will end up hurting you in the long run."
nappythrill22,Cartalk,1389232652.0,"Agreed, but when it comes to spark plugs, who has the equipment in their garage to test the voltage that plug is putting out? Nobody. If in doubt, it's better to replace them. Unlike all of the rest of the electrical parts in the ignition system that can be reliably and accurately tested with a volt ohmmeter, there is no reliable way to test plugs for performance. They may still function, and that's easy to determine, but they may not be giving your optimal spark temp (a function of voltage, which is a function of the plugs resistance, which can change over time).

As a caveat, I *generally* wouldn't replace the plugs unless I was confident I had tested almost everything else first, but *SO* many problems boil down to plugs that function, but don't perform up to snuff."

Kastoli,AskMen,1389232913.0,"&gt; it was reasonable to assume you meant in terms of sexual attraction/interaction.

I don't really think it was... because the reason for the apprehension regarding long nails and sexual interaction is glaringly obvious, anyone with a brain stem could understand it.

My question is exclusively in a non-sexual context, which is why i specifically omitted the mention of anything sexual.

""I don't like long fingernails."" Why?

""Men with long fingernails are weird."" Why?

""Guys who have long nails are disgusting."" Why?

That is what i'm asking; In a non-sexual context, What is the reason justifying your decision to dismiss, and associate all these negative feelings towards a person due exclusively to the fact that they have long nails?"

To OP: 

- **Read the FAQ---------------------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;**

- invest in a good pair of RUNNING shoes. (Basketball shoes or those 9 year old nike's aren't going to cut it. Get fitted at a real running store, not a payless or a Sport's Authority.) 

- Never ever ever wear a cotton t-shirt on a run on a hot day, especially if it has a large design on it*, and doubly so on a race day.
 
- Join a running club or team to stay motivated and make new friends, (Be sure to check with them before showing up to a practice.)
 
- Vary your workouts. If your goal is to do 70 miles this week, don't do 7 ten mile runs. Instead change it up from day to day, but have your average come out to 10 mi/day. i.e. Mon: 9 Tues: 12 Wed: 8 Thurs: 11 Fri:5 Sat: 9 Sun: 16. (Disclaimer: DO NOT ATTEPT TO RUN 70 MILES PER WEEK UNTIL YOU ARE MUCH MORE EXPERIENCED.  I just used that number because 10 miles is a round number and it's easier to keep track of different numbers adding up to 10. But the example and the point still stands for any mileage.)

- Don't go too fast in the beginning. If you are unable to say the pledge of allegiance (or your nation's equivalent) aloud without stammering or breathing hard, you're going too fast!

- Eat more grains, drink at least 4 liters of **water** (Not milk, not soda, not gatorade, just water) per day, and try to cutout any soda, but if you need to have it, *never*, and I do mean never, drink it before a run!

- If you feel an ache, soreness, or pain, that's normal, it's not an ""injury."" If that pain persists through multiple runs, that's when you should start taking note. If the pain starts to worsen, or severely impedes your ability to run, stop running and sort it out before you start again. (That doesn't mean you should necessarily take a break, stationary bikes, ellipticals, swimming, and [arm bikes](http://www.fitnesszone.com/Merchant2/graphics/00000001/physiostep-XT_741x800.jpg) are great for training through injuries.)

- Commit yourself to a lofty but attainable goal. Don't just say ""I'm going to run a 5K"", say ""I'm going to runs 5K in under 25 minutes."" (Or whatever your goal time is.) 


- Not all miles are created equal. Let's say your comfortable hogging pace is 7 minute/mile. You'll get NOTHING from running 12 miles at a 14 minute pace. Instead, try running 8 miles at a 6:45 pace (or whatever your equivalent is; the point is every mile of distance should be uncomfortable but manageable.

Srace,OrthodoxChristianity,1389233441.0,"I would definitely recommend following the advice of others and talking to various priests and attending various churches.  In my area, the Orthodox Church in America parish is the one with all the converts, and converts seem to get VERY intense at times.  The Ukrainian Orthodox parishes are much more practical and laidback, with more of an emphasis on Ukrainian culture and much less emphasis on asceticism.  I don't have very broad experience of other types of Orthodox churches, but the Ukrainians definitely believe in having a good time and eating well.  The parish priest of the parish that I attend sometimes (I also haven't converted, but my family has) is also very practical and moderate in his advice.  I am a bit of a Calvinist at heart, so my impression of the ideas of God and Christ in Orthodoxy has been that they appear substantially LESS grim than the ideas I had been used to, even if Orthodoxy sometimes appears to be hard work.  I'm divorced, and I appreciate that the Orthodox view of divorce appears to be more moderate and more forgiving than that of the conservative Anglican ministers whom I knew previously.  

With that said, I haven't converted either.  One reason is definitely that I am single, and I have no idea how I would manage to get married without having unmarried sex in this day and age, and I would have no intention of giving up sex during fasting times etc.  I don't know how many people in my parish even think about this stuff - probably none - but I'm not the kind of person who can know there's a rule and then break it.  Another reason is that Orthodoxy involves this whole different way of thinking that I don't quite ""get"", and another reason relates to some basic problems/concerns that I have with any kind of Christianity.  I can definitely sympathize with your doubts, and also with that feeling that ""this all seems a little too weird.""  Nonetheless, I do think there is a more benevolent interpretation of Orthodox Christianity than the one you have received.  Good luck on your journey!

Edit:  One thing to consider is that having a big crisis and wondering if you will be saved or not might be a pretty Protestant or western Christian thing.  The Orthodox I know seem to have a fairly complacent view of it - get baptised, go to church regularly, attend confession, partake of the sacraments, be nice to people, and you're fine.  Protestants are the ones who tend to put a big emphasis on being saved or not and needing to believe in the right way and have the right kind of faith.  Maybe just chilling out, not having a crisis about it, and trusting God and the church to figure it all out is the solution?  You don't get yourself to heaven all alone, the church and the sacraments and the help of your priest will get you there, and you just have to trust that they're right and it will all work out in the end.  I kind of think that's part of the point of the whole communion of saints idea."

mmp31,politics,1389233478.0,"&gt;Tying minimum wage to the rate of inflation (well, perhaps to the consumer price index) fixes this issue, like we've talked about. I don't know why you keep saying this.

It does not fix the issue for reasons previously stated.  I don't know why you keep saying this.

&gt;I can't tell what you're arguing against here. The goal of printing money is not to directly create wealth, but to stimulate the economy indirectly by threatening the value of money stashes. It doesn't transfer wealth from the ""bottom up"", it's more of an indirect tax on all dollars - it transfers value to the government.

The point I'm making is that kicking up the inflation rate only distorts market signals by causing people to spend their money when they otherwise wouldn't have. Creating money stimulates the economy at first, but then the upward pressure on prices hinders the economy, so there is no net gain. The only thing that occurs is a transfer of wealth.  

And yes, you are correct that it does transfer wealth to the government via an indirect tax on all dollars. An indirect flat tax, nonetheless.  Flat taxes disproportionately harm the poor.  But the government is not the only entity that the value is transferred to.

When the Fed creates money, it immediately gets deposited in a bank.  The bank can create loans out of that deposit and collect interest on it. So it also transfers value to the banking system, which tends to be owned more by the higher class.

&gt;It most certainly is true. It's a foregone conclusion in economic circles. 

It's not true at all.  Zero percent inflation does not ""encourage"" hoarding any more than it ""encourages"" spending, no matter what the economy is doing.  Zero percent is neither deflation nor inflation - nothing is encouraged.

&gt;The effect I'm talking about has been well-studied since the Great Depression, which itself is considered a deflationary spiral - something we are staving off by pumping money into the economy. Deflation causes hoarding, which in turn produces more deflationary pressure. To quote Hayek,

&gt;“It is agreed that hoarding money, whether in cash or in idle balances, is deflationary in its effects. No one thinks that deflation is in itself desirable.”

&gt;Sure, factors like market uncertainty affect hoarding behavior, but adjusting the rate of inflation is how we can change the game - especially when Congress won't authorize more spending, which is what we need. 

&gt;Krugman has a nice blog post laying out why deflation - and even too little inflation - is unhealthy for any economy: http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/why-is-deflation-bad/

Deflation is absolutely irrelevant to the point.  Nobody is arguing in favor of it. I agree that deflation is bad, but I disagree that we have too little inflation.  I've already outlined several reasons why inflation is damaging - there is no need for us to amplify the negative effects of inflation further by increasing the inflation rate.    There is no net gain."

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1389233484.0,"&gt;I think I didn't make my point clearly. I was trying to say that while number of partners can be indicative of issues or not desirable traits, this isn't always the case,

So?

&gt;My other point is that, anecdotally, every short guy (under 5'5"") that I've ever dated had loads of baggage. I dumped them not because they were short, but because of what they let it become. I avoided short guys after that not because I have a problem with them being short, but because I didn't want to deal with the insecurity and the baggage that most of them have.

Irony

&gt;My other point is that, anecdotally, every short guy (under 5'5"") that I've ever dated had loads of baggage. I dumped them not because they were short, but because of what they let it become. I avoided short guys after that not because I have a problem with them being short, but because I didn't want to deal with the insecurity and the baggage that most of them have.

I can almost guarantee you that if you were with a man that was self conscious about his height, it was almost entirely because you did a poor job of letting him know it was ok. I didn't even know height was a ""thing"" women wanted until I joined Reddit, and it's certainly not been my experience in life that it's a quality women screen for at all. 

&gt;This is why I see not wanting to date short guys and not wanting to date girls with lots of partners as pretty equivalent. At least for me, it's not about the height or the partners, it's about what it often can mean in terms of how it affects who they are. That being said, I still think it's a shame to have these preconceived notions because it can lead to missing out on people that don't have the baggage that typically accompanies a certain height or certain past.

I think that's a ludicrous belief given your partner count is entirely in your control, and your height is never going to change after you're, like, 19 and you have absolutely no control over it. That being said, you appear to have just defeated your own argument."

One team has 4 starting goalies and is short a RW, while the other team has only 2 goalies, both who are in timeshares or backups depending on how you look at it but a huge bench of forwards.

Bushels_for_All,news,1389233630.0,"I'm curious how wine in grocery stores would increase tax revenue.  While it would definitely be more convenient, wine in grocery stores - the vast majority of which are not locally-owned - will be a negative influence on local economies.  

Right now, liquor stores are small businesses owned locally - hence, much of the profits get reinvested in Tennessee.  On the other hand, profits that Walmart, Target, Costco, Kroger, etc. make are far less likely to be spent in Tennessee.  The local liquor stores will fail, and that extra money will be gone for good.

Then there are the distributors, which are also incorporated and run in Tennessee by law.  Large grocery chains like Walmart or Kroger will have a tremendously-improved bargaining position over distributors.  Distributor margins will suffer in a big way, which again will hurt the Tennessee economy while greater profits would flow out of state to the large grocery chains.

I'm just thinking of the pros and cons, and if you look beyond the obvious convenience factor, it doesn't sound all that beneficial to the state itself."

Some people have natural gifts like perseverance, and certain people respond to depression differently as well, some are just stronger from a psychological or biological standpoint which allows them to go to work and go about ""normal"" everyday activities... but is that truly the healthy way to handle that kind of situation? I dunno, I would just hate to know that there is a better me out there who just needs help to get through. 

Honestly, I just don't think the people that are really suffering whine about their problems, they may confide in you, which means they trust you and hope you can help but the whiners to me are just attention-seeking children who feel sad and lonely sometimes- which is completely different than dealing with an actual chemical imbalance.

SOSBTK,changemyview,1389233822.0,"I think it depends on where you draw the line. I equal voting rights for men and women to be closer to a gender issue but I think things like legal rape/corrective rape to be more of a human rights issue. Also, child soldiers and the AIDS epidemic in Africa are not gender issues but health issues.

I'm not saying it's too bad or hard to fix I'm saying that there is no chance fixing it since it's not broken. For example a commonly talked about gender situation is the stay-at-home spouse and the providing spouse. Stereo-typically the male would be the provider and his wife would stay at home. This was supported by strict laws against women having equal rights in the work place that have been changed and now women and men have the same opportunities to provide for themselves and their families. As the laws were being changed many women encouraged other women to be their own providers and that they don't have to live off of someone else. All this is great. But it got to the point that a woman who does want to be the stay-at-home mom/housewife is ostracized by other women for not having a job and being a source of financial support. 

What it boils down to is the fact that in many cases we see the views we choose as positive, that's why we chose them, so logically the inverse of those views are the negative."

Check this image: http://imgur.com/J417AgR - blue is within 30 degrees of equator, green is within 45. This is the mollweide equal area projection, so the sizes of landmasses are accurate. Do you need me to cut up two antarcticas and put them next to Africa to prove it?

Before I finish there is another, more impatient knock at the door.  I'm almost done, and I believe it is the same person, so I don't respond (fuck you for trying to rush me).  The shit was *horrible*.  I flush the toilet and it, of course, begins to overflow.  I close the valve behind the toilet so it is no longer filling with water (it's maybe a half an inch below the rim of the bowl by the time I get to it).  I was my hands and leave the bathroom to find an apparently foreign man carrying a child waiting outside the door.

The folly of the modern western woman is that she cannot (and will not) make any sacrifice or concession at all to her partners, **because no man has ever demanded that she do so.** The men in her life have be thoroughly chastised and shamed into making every sacrifice on her behalf, while she enjoys an easy life of provision and resource leeching.

This is why you never cede ground to females. This is why you never back down from your principles. This is why you never accommodate them until they make some effort to accommodate you. It's about training women to rejoin the rest of in society, where we each sacrifice something and get something in return.

No, I don't think this measure does anything for a catastrophe, unless you can demonstrate how the flu vaccine does anything to prevent a complete mutant or deadly strain from occurring. It doesn't.

The youngest of the three, Lana who was 18, stayed with us for a summer when I was 11 while she was on break from college.  Our house was way outside of town up the side of a mountain, and my dad rarely wanted to go down, and never to cool places like the mall.  But Lana drove into town all the time.  Lana took me to see a bunch of movies and to the arcades and stuff, and for that one summer I got to feel what it was like to have a big sister.  And as an only child, that was really cool.  Also, she introduced me to Oingo Boingo.

But this is a great example of how close I am with my step-sisters:  I was 16 when Lana got married and I attended the wedding, which was on my step-great-uncle's ranch.  My dad told me that the kids of my eldest step-sister, Valerie, were downstairs in the game room of my step-great-uncle's house.  So I go down there and meet them, they're like 5 and 7, and I'm playing darts and chatting with them.  Valerie comes down stairs and totally wigs out that there's some stranger talking to her kids and is like ""Who the hell are you!?""

And I'm like ""Necron_Overlord?""

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1389234845.0,"&gt; how things changed so dramatically in the last 50-100 years

In fairness, 200 years ago it was legal to murder your wife and children if they refused to listen to you. Not advocating that, but it's worth remembering that was the legal point from which we start.

&gt; Are you telling me that men did this to themselves, willingly

I think the thing to realize is that the slippery slope starts at a point that was truly unjust to women. 

Look at the difference in divorce laws. 60 years ago, a man could basically leave his wife destitute, take the kids, and if she pushed the issue he could have her thrown in a nut ward. That's what men did when they had all the power.

Unsurprisingly, you see what women do now that they have all of the power in a divorce.

The original way divorce was handle in America was deeply wrong. But our solution was to fix a deep wrong against women by inflicting a deep wrong against men and congratulating ourselves for being thoughtful and liberal for doing it.

The divorce system illustrates a lot of the problems that go with correcting wrongs. When people are angry and trying to exert power, right and wrong are the furthest things from their minds. Our justice system isn't a justice system at all: it's a revenge system, and nowhere is that more apparent than family court."

&gt;How do I marry the painful reality of the relationship between the sexes with my own desire to find an actual snowflake and have a sweet life with her?

**The answer is, you don't.** ""Snowflakes"" are so exceedingly rare that it's more prudent to treat them like mythological creatures.

The truth is, no woman (and indeed, no person) is born a snowflake. A healthy attitude towards sex is **taught** to growing youth; children inherit healthy attitudes about sex by observing their parents, who themselves are in healthy relationships.

Right now, many of us live in cultures of toxic shame and manipulation. Most children never get to see what healthy gender-differentiated relationship looks like. They get their training from feminized movies, programmes, and music. They are cowed into obedience by female teachers and humiliated by female peers. By the time they reach the age of majority, they're so fully indoctrinated that they cannot envision the world being any other way, and they lash out violently at people who even dare suggest that things might be otherwise.

You will not **find** a snowflake. The woman fortunate enough earn your favour will have to be **shaped into the woman you wish her to be.**

everhood13,rpg,1389235200.0,"Allow me to regale you with the infamous story of the Bard Bard and the Bards. If you are opposed to graphic inappropriateness, please read no further. 

First, a bit of background: At the time of this story, our gaming group consisted of 5 players (L, B, A, M and myself) and a GM. L and B are the kinds of players who intentionally try to break things in game, and generally mess with the GM whenever possible. They are bad alone, but together they are an unstoppable force of chaotic evil. Now on to the story.

Our GM hates bards with a passion, so naturally, L and B decided that our party should form a band of bard mixes and ""go on tour."" We all agree, because the idea sounded hilarious, so so we developed these characters: Card Bard on drums (played with a mace) (Half orc cleric int under 10 played by L), Tard Bard (half orc int under 7 played by M) who had a jug tied around his neck (the other players spun him around before each performance to induce jug-playing panting), Bard Bard (full bard half orc, int under 10 played by B) the lead singer, Rard Bard (female wood elf, naked and filthy, int under 10 played by A) as a dancer, and a gnome wizard (I can't even remember my own name) who did pyrotechnics for the Bards.

In our adventures with our awesome band, we found ourselves in a hotel over night. Bard Bard was spooning with me against my will. All was well. The bards were settling down for sleep when we were attacked by goblin assassins. Long story short, we captured one. It was quickly discovered that the goblin was a female. I asked if we wanted to question the captive, but none of us spoke goblin. We had just about decided to kill our captive when Bard Bard looks at the GM, grins and says, ""I rape it!""

We all go quiet and look at the GM. The GM has fury in his eyes. He tries frantically to come up with checks to save the goblin, but she is wrapped up and unable to move. The half orcs are screaming ""rape"" over and over. My gnome is aghast. The GM is aghast. The goblin couldn't beat a strength check and gets raped by the Bard Bard and the Bards. And that is the story of how we were all forced to write new characters because the GM wouldn't let a bunch of raping orcs run around any more.

Also, none of us are allowed to be half orc bards ever again. The end."

An intensely personal question.

&gt;Though I find it hypocritical that you say I will never understand how it feels to be a man, then you tell me I can't possibly feel complete, because I've never given birth.

I very intentionally did not say that.  Read it again, there is more nuance than you are giving me credit for.

Correct.

kyrostolar,changemyview,1389235445.0,"I would feel better about this comment if it were true. While arguably much less apparent and debated as rape, there are cultures that advocate and enjoy murder. Some of those cultures are also very sexist and cast a cold shoulder on rape victims as well.

Yes, it's a touchier subject than murder (which, depending on perspective, is silly. Because... murder. They should at least be equivalent.) and yes, it is more apparent in society. Jokes have a place and even the commonplace nature of a murder joke is inexcusable in the wrong setting, I don't see how you've argued rape jokes to be all that bad in any convincing way.

Offensive jokes in all but the most extreme and profound cases, are if anything, the outcome of current or historical prejudices. *Not* the cause of them. Jokes and indirect songs are their own problem, I would love to see a case where someone heard blurred lines and decided they now had it on good authority that sexism and rape was excusable and even admirable. It takes authority, example, and preaching to put someone in that state of mind if they're not already part of a culture so accepting of the concept. Frankly, mine isn't, and I highly doubt yours is either.

Offensive humour, in the right context, can be good for us. Making light of a stressful situation can be good for us. If it can be about murder, genocide and racism, it can be about rape too. 

I'm a male and I have been raped, but I see no issue with rape jokes just like I see no issue with any other jokes, the only complication is in the context of their telling, or at the very least an understanding of your audience. I do understand the severity of the concept though, as ironic as it is to be held aside from murder and genocide as damaging, and I challenge you to change my mind as well. If you can prove that ""rape jokes are more damaging to society than other jokes of a similar category/caliber."" I may be inclined to change my mind. "

Second is her judgmental nature, she judges people for being fat even though she is too, for wearing 'inappropriate clothing', for saying 'like' etc.
My dad is pretty cool but it angers me how much he runs away from difficult situations (ie my mom) because he left us a lot when I was a kid, and he is gone so much now that my mom relies on me to fill her loneliness which is a lot of responsibility and also drives me crazy.

because that song is cheese, and the worst example of ICP.

 the beats on Riddle Box, like [""The Killing Fields""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJk4PsU9FEo) were pretty damn good. Mike Clark knew how to make good beats, and definitely was the unsung hero of the group, if that's a thing. Pretty much the beats on the albums they made between 93 and 97 are some listenable hip hop, and they should have released instrumental versions. ""Homies"" came out around 2003 or so, and they were already starting to be less shocking and entertaining by then.  

I was a fan of their music for a few years, but even by 2003 I was uninterested in their output, especially songs like ""Homies"". 

**tl;dr** ICP had songs with dope beats before they were famous and juggalos were mostly a regional thing (pre-2000). all their current music sucks for the most part.

I don't believe Fudge was competent enough to order her to do most of what she did, and was incompetent enough not to reign her in when she started abusing her power. The ministry in general, however, was not Harry's biggest fan, and likely would have brushed his complaints under the rug.

Dantilli,IWantToLearn,1389236049.0,"Have you tried asking?

Think of it this way, if someone you knew came up to you and asked you for a favour, what would you say? you'd either say ""yeah, no problem"" or, if you can't manage it/don't want to do it for them you'd politely decline. You wouldn't explode in a fit of rage just because someone asked you for help. Niether will anyone else (most of the time... there are always exceptions, but you can spot them people a mile off).

As long as you've treated them with respect and aren't ""leeching"" off them i.e. asking for loads of thing but not giving anything back, then they'll probably be happy to. It does help if you've been of ""value"" (yeah, horrible choice of words...) to them in some way in the past. This doesn't just mean logical things like money or doing favours for them, in fact social value is much more potent in most cases. Whether it be regularly introducing them to connections they might not usually have access to otherwise or just being a cool guy to be around. But if you still keep in contact you probably already have some ""value"" in their eyes. Sounds like a really cold way of viewing things... but it's not, I just can't think of another way to explain it. 

Just think of it like you're not going to help any random person just cos they ask (assuming it is a non-trivial request), but you'll help someone who's helped you in the past or someone you think is a cool guy. That's how pretty much everyone thinks.

If it's for stuff like references etc most people will definitely be happy to help. Just from the fact that they've been in your position before and you're giving them an opportunity to give back.

I know this isn't written well, but hopefully it helps somewhat :)"

namer98,Christianity,1389236162.0,"&gt; What is the correct root of תבערו?

The middle letters. You must have had a typo earlier. But it means to burn or destroy according to my etymological dictionary.

&gt;What exact text are you seeing?

When he refers to David and the show bread.

&gt;I did enjoy that. I do not know how truthful it is, but I can take what you wrote and bring it to the Lord.

The problem is, you need an answer to what work means. Otherwise, it all falls apart. What does it mean for God to work? What the heck is wrong with fire of all things? How do you make any sense of it otherwise? How do you plan on making sense of what appears to not make sense?

&gt;It is only prohibited to add to or take away from the Commandments. I never said we can only ""do"" what is in the Torah.

But how do you know it is right if it is not mentioned? [You have said yourself that only God can determine that](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1unogk/i_always_get_various_answers_concerning_christ/cekor8l). Are you putting yourself in God's shoes?

&gt;I imagine this part is tedious for you, but it is very important to me that I keep Deut 4:2, so if I am breaking it I desperately need to know.

Yes, as I showed above. You are adding to what is right when you yourself said you have no ability to do so. Is the Torah not all of life? Does nothing fall outside its purview?

&gt;Are we talking about the same account of the Pharisees?

No. There is the NT strawmen of the Pharisees, and the actual Pharisees as presented in Jewish texts. Interestingly enough, the NT strawman of a pharisee matches up almost perfectly with what the Talmud calls a ""false Pharisee"" in Mas. Sotah.

&gt;I do not see that you have done that, yet. Here is what I see:

Num 15 and Ex 16:27 (I just read this half an hour ago). Gathering food on the Sabbath is not allowed. Not just gathering sticks, but also gathering food.

He also ignored the Rabbis of his time, breaking Deut 17:11.

&gt;This is talking about judgments

What do you think they are making judgements about? Look at Lev 15:11, and guess what judgement came out of that.

&gt;There are numerous examples. Am I allowed to use the Gospels for this task?

Like I said, we can both sling verses till we are blue. But I also know the NT's description of the Pharisees are incorrect every time they are mentioned. If you want to give me a case or three, I can explain why Jewish law would say that yes, the straw men pharisees in the NT are wrong, as per Jewish law, and that the case could not actually happen.

&gt;That put should never be used to boil meat that came from the same kind of animal as the milk, to be safe.

Correct. But I also know that this law is rabbinic in nature. This is a place where the NT creates a straw man. The Rabbis *never* claimed their law was equal to God's law. But we do see it as a legitimate precaution. Because when the law is from God, are you really going to say ""no, I think I did enough. Why bother being just a little more careful?"""

Namelis1,NoStupidQuestions,1389236194.0,"So the problem with DVD's and Blu-Ray's for gaming is that they're dreadfully slow, at least compared to regular hard drives or system memory. Specifically they're very slow in the latency department. It takes a (comparably) very long time to read out a specific sector from a disk. As movies are mostly sequential accessing random items all over the drive is not a big issue.

So, basically the game tries to keep whatever may be needed at hand in Random Access Memory or RAM. Which is extremely fast compared to CD's, DVD's, or even Hard Disk drives. (Speedwise, if a DVD is a car, your ram is the SR-71)

So for example in a first person shooter the game would try to load all the critical assets into memory - like the players weapon/model, the terrain immediately around the player and so on.

There's a lot of though put into memory management. For example the doors in Metroid Prime are designed to stall the player while the game unloads the last section of the map and loads the next section of the game into memory. Same deal with the elevators in Mass Effect 1. Other games will try to mask it with cutscenes. The DVD's and Blu-Rays will be optimized to reduce the amount of travel needed to access parts of the game.

Some games will go ""fuck that"" and just ask you to install the game into your disk drive, which performs faster than a DVD, meaning less clever trickery is needed.

PC gaming just deals with hard drives which offer superior loading speeds at all times. Still all of the trickery mentioned above is still needed."

As for your questions #3, what items to vendor and what to keep, that is a question separate from build questions, I'll give you that. Here's a thread on pricing that I found with 10 seconds of looking at Reddit threads:

icp has the aclu deciding to help out on the case, also.

dontknowmeatall,languagelearning,1389236336.0,"I'm currently learning five languages, including English, and I admit that the fact that I'm relatively fluent in it already and that three of them are related to my native language. However, trying to learn three languages at the same time is not so hard if you organise your time carefully. For some people, studying everything everyday can be helpful; others find better to study each of them once a week. As a major in Languages, I spend my time surrounded by people trying to learn two to seven languages, and I must tell you that it's a matter of dedication. There are single mothers who can easily master four languages besides their own, as there are rich guys without any obligations who can hardly learn two. Learning is a matter of attitude. For Spanish the best way to fast forward would be to start reading in the language. There are simple texts you can easily find online, and if you learn the basics of conjugation and grammar you can start reading with a bit of work, but with decent comprehension, just having a dictionary near you. Now, Japanese... that's a heavy one, so if you feel like you can't handle them all at once, that's the one you should leave for the end. Try first memorising hiragana and katakana, and reading it at a 4th-grade speed. If you can do that in four months, keep going; if you can't, I suggest you to wait until you can communicate in the others to continue. Tagalog: I didn't know the language; I just researched it a little and it doesn't seem to have a complicated grammar. Pronunciation could be difficult, but that's up to you, determine your strengths and weaknesses and find the best way to learn it. If you have faith in yourself and can work hard for it, I can assure you, you'll get fluent. Maybe you need to make some time sacrifices, and you could use the help of a native, but you'll be fine. And there's the internet to help you, so don't worry. Good luck!"

jianadaren1,buildapc,1389236357.0,"&gt; Remember when ddr3 ram became common? The price of ddr2 skyrocketed. This isn't exactly the same, but don't assume prices will drop on 1440p.

I know you acknowledged that they aren't exactly the same, but I think the analogy falls apart for one important reason: DDR2 and DDR3 are not good substitutes for each other. Almost nobody who's in the market for DDR2 can say ""you know what, this DDR3 is better, I'll get that instead"". That property allowed DDR2 to actually become more expensive then DDR3.

Monitors are different. The price of the higher-quality monitor puts an effective price-ceiling on the lower-quality monitor: no consumer would ever pay more for a 1080p monitor than a 1440p (given everything else is the same). 

Because different resolutions of monitors are good substitutes for each other and in competition with each other, a drop in price in one resolution tends to put downward pressure on prices in all other resolutions.

Heliopteryx,AskReddit,1389236396.0,"It's important to keep in mind that race has little to do with your DNA. It's a social concept, not a biological one. If you looked at someone's entire genome, there would be no way to tell for sure what race they were. 

I am 3/4 Asian (Chinese) and 1/4 white. My parents were both born and raised in Canada. I grew up in the US. I am now 17. 

Until I was about 10 years old, I didn't think of myself as being Asian. I would say I was if asked about my race, but it didn't enter my mind or feel like a part of me before then. What changed was that people started talking to or about me like I was Asian. It was a little strange at first, but now I consider myself Asian because others do.

I have a few funny stories about people assuming I'm 'more Asian' than I really am. When I was in grade 10, someone asked me to help them translate something in Japanese, because apparently I looked Japanese. A couple of days ago, some guy was telling me about Asian foods and how they are so strange. He referred to them as ""my"" foods. He was literally like, ""your fried pancake things are good, though!"" Then he asked me, ""don't they kill all the girl babies in China?"" That one was a bit appalling, especially because he was assuming that just because I look Asian I am somehow an authority on all things Asian. "

Life-in-Death,vegan,1389236738.0,"I don't think sensation is usually considered cognition.  Cognition generally refers to higher order function, i.e. ""thinking""

&gt;In science, cognition is a group of mental processes that includes the attention of working memory, producing and comprehending language, learning, reasoning, problem solving, and decision making.

I know behavior doesn't necessarily point to a cause, but it is definitely used to gain understanding.  (But animals to feign things all of the time!)

But:
&gt;We can be relatively sure than animals with a homologous set of synapses experience analogous experiences,

As I pointed out in my original post, it *is* the biological similarities that indicate that oysters most likely feel pain.  I don't know what you mean about ""homologous sets of synapses,"" but yes, oysters do have nerves, with synapses, that function as ours do.  They are arranged in a different body plan as they are for all different animals.  Yes, some are more complex than others.  Oysters also have opioid receptors like we do that also indicate they have similar pain responses.  

&gt; The cerebral ganglia control the **sensory organs** while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalvia

I am confused what you think the *function* of sensory nerves are in oysters...Pain is usually the *most* primitive sense to develop.  What do you believe they are sensing?  And then why not pain?

But also, think about this ""similarity of design"" argument.  What is the amount of dissimilarity that such drastically changes function?  Cephalopods, gastropods and bivalves all have similar nervous systems.  Do you attribute pain capabilities to any of these groups?  If you do so for the octopus based on their ability to demonstrate pain-seeming behavior, then you would have to say due to their similarity to other molluscs that pain is conserved.

I just came across this article that looks like it might provide a good overview:

MotivationToControl,socialism,1389236878.0,"I would have to disagree with those here who believe that human nature is solely a product of the environment or that human activity is solely the result of material conditions. The nature/nurture debate is viewed within the scientific community as more or less settled. Both heredity and environment play an intimate role in human behavior, and there is a universal human nature that does shape culture. That being said, I do not think the findings jeopardize socialism any more than they favor capitalism.

The argument that socialism, i.e. an economic model in which workers cooperatively and democratically control the means of production, goes against human nature is flat out wrong. This argument almost always comes from a position that human nature is selfish and amoral, and pro-social behavior is imposed upon the self by society or God or whatever. IOW, you have to force people to cooperate, but they compete naturally and effectively. 

But, what researchers have found is that human beings are far more willing to cooperate and only benefit from competition when its required to satisfy their basic needs. For example, if a tribe is living on a territory with scarce resources, and another tribe encroaches on their territory thus threatening their survival, war between the tribes is almost inevitable. But, if there are plenty of resources to support the two tribes, they will cooperate, trade, hunt together, etc. The basic drive to compete for resources is only inevitable when resources are scarce. Today, with advanced technology, we have the ability to make scarcity a distant memory. Those in power choose not to.

The argument also generally makes the point that social hierarchies are inevitable and that equality is unnatural and impossible. This argument, though it has some truth, fails to account for the severe inequality of modern societies compared to the incredibly mild inequality of tribal societies. In tribal societies, no one competes for resources. Necessary resources are shared, with no regard for social status. Everyone is cared for, to the best of the tribe's ability. Even if you are the tribe's best hunter, hoarding food gets you on everyone's bad side. And, the hierarchical structure is informally democratic. Leaders can be ousted if they don't listen to the will of the tribe's members. (This goes double if they don't listen to the women.) So, the social hierarchy that we are geared to is more along the lines of popularity than actually having more stuff and maintaining authoritarian power over your subjects. This form of hierarchy, IMO, is possible in a socialist society. 

It seems that socialism, with its emphasis on egalitarianism and democracy, is far closer to our ""natural state"" than capitalism. Capitalism actually seems to be quite destructive to innate human interests. Atomizing a social creature simply does not work. Human happiness depends upon a strong sense of co-dependence, a feeling that we sink or swim together. Capitalism has us trying to climb out of the water on each others shoulders. The end result: we all drown."

In the end, I think it's a clever design that's 40 years too late.  It's still a combustion engine, and the future is electric.

I think the purpose of 3 spark plugs is the same as why modern rotary engines have 2 spark plugs.  A liter of displacement in a single cylinder makes for a very large area of combustion, and multiple spark plugs ensures that all of the fuel is detonated at approximately the same time."

I'll be the first to say; we weren't fair to Matt. Because we held so much disdain for Pioli, it spilled over to Cassel.

Necron_Overlord,SubredditDrama,1389237037.0,"&gt;You've complained about downvotes repeatedly, both in the original thread and here in this one.

I wasn't complaining about anything. The intention behind the downvotes was clear when I made my edit; people were downvoting it because I dared to imply that something could be racist, and whiny whites can't handle anyone suggesting that racism had any victims other than them.

I don't care about the fucking karma, I care about why people want to suppress anything that reminds them that racism's primary victims are not their lily white asses.
 
Those posts got hundreds of upvotes too, and those were all from people appreciating the fact that I was telling it like it is.

&gt;It's also worth pointing out that ""I don't care about karma, lol!"" is the classic response of someone who really does care about it.

But wouldn't that also be the response of someone who doesn't care about karma?  If denying the accusation proves the accusation, then why even fucking bother to pretend you're not just a concern trolling dickbag.

Ralkir,changemyview,1389237059.0,"&gt;According to CNN, the effectiveness of this year's vaccine for the H1N1 strain was 100%. That's right. This year's vaccine is extraordinarily effective at stopping the H1N1 version of the flu.

Yea, because it was specifically designed to combat the H1N1. That's the point. The flu vaccine when H1N1 first arose did jack shit against the H1N1. When a new deadly flu arises, the flu vaccine is also going to do nothing, until they design a new one to combat it. Hence what I'm saying, current inocculations of the flu vaccine do NOTHING to prevent a deadly strand from developing and creating a pandemic. Nothing.

As for the CDC (which let me tell you I already question their impartiality because of a few issues), let's assume what was said is 100 percent accurate. It does not say that taking the flu vaccine reduces a pandemic (which you have stated), and those numbers do not state that those reductions are from heard immunity. How many of those reductions are simply from the people who would have got sick now taking the vaccine for themselves? Because I guarentee you, those aren't all people who are unable to take the vaccine.

SumoSizeIt,applehelp,1389237155.0,"The simple answer is yes, but it can get so much more complicated than that. Your ultra low power processor is actually capable of quite a bit, and will ramp up the speed a bit when possible. I use mine to play Blizzard games, though something like BF4 would surely bring the system to its knees. It's also going to depend on the individual game and whether it is more CPU or GPU dependent. The Intel HD 5000 integrated graphics are a massive step up from prior generations, and the Macbook Air's low resolution screen is pretty easy to drive, but you're still going to find limitations on something that, for example, utilizes a lot of physics processing or particle effects. In the end, you kind of have to just try it for yourself and not trust the analysis. In the days of multiple cores and other newfangled processor trickery, Mhz means a bit less than it used to for performance.

It also helps that Harry possesses (not necessarily at the time) both of the other Hallows. Additionally, it is heavily implied that the Potters are related to the Peveral brothers,  the original masters of the Deathly Hallows.

But really though... I absolutely HATE the way the books ended.  Harry didn't defeat Voldemort by being better. He didn't defeat him by being more powerful. He didn't defeat him by outsmarting him (not really).

He beat Voldemort by pure luck.  The moral of the story becomes very messy...especially when Draco and Lucious are allowed to walk away.  

The only way you can beat evil, is to be incredibly lucky and have really good friends.  I guess it is an...okay moral...for kids...  but as an adult it is incredibly unfulfilling. 

All that is needed for evil to win, is for good men to do nothing.

seedarf,nba,1389237324.0,"No way it's the center, as the game moves away from the basket the need for excellent centers is lowered. There's a reason the talent among big men has decreased more and more as the 3pt shot is used more.

PG is the strongest position, talent-wise, but teams built around PGs don't tend to do well. The last one I can think of was the 2004 Pistons, but even then it's arguable that Billups was the best player on that team. The last time a team won a championship with their PG as their franchise player was the Bad Boy Pistons, and you can argue that Dumars was better than Thomas. 

I would say the best position in the league are the wing postions, SG and SF. LeBron, Carmelo, Harden, Durant, Kobe, Pierce, Wade, Afflalo. They are the most important to the success of their teams.

Of course talented centers and point guards are needed for a championship caliber team, but championship team (recently) seem to be focused on SGs and SFs, with San Antonio being the only exception."

I already think that the idea of porn being equivalent to cheating is absurd, but hey... if it is a ""rule"" that you both agree to, whatever. 

Perhaps another alternative approach would be to discuss his viewing of porn (if you are certain that is what he is viewing)and suggest that you both watch together for a more intimate experience.

vivvav,GLRP_EastBlue,1389237568.0,"**Orville**  
  
*Orville stares at the two images. He shakes his head.*  
  
""You truly do not understand power.""  
  
*Orville thinks of past things. He thinks of himself in the mines, giving half of his daily bread piece to a younger slave, eating only his gruel.*  
  
""I said before that power cannot be shared. People so often think of it as a tangible, finite thing, but it is so much more. It takes many forms.""  
  
*Orville thinks on Seuss kicking him during the Hangman Game.*  
  
""There is power in physical strength. Those with greater physical strength than others have power in their own way.""  
  
*Orville thinks on Heavy Metal Bowes during the festival, surrounded by a massive Pirate Crew.*  
  
""There is power in numbers. Those who influence others and convince them to follow have another kind of power.""  
  
*Orville thinks of the World Noble, taking his mother away.*  
  
""There is power in image. The World Nobles and other nobles are thought to be above all others, and because enough people believe it, that gives them power.""  
  
*Orville thinks on slaves being told they are worthless by the slave-drivers.*  
  
""There is power in words. To convince somebody of something is a great power in its own right.""  
  
*Orville thinks to his fight with the scissor man.*  
  
""There is power in the strange and unknown. What people fear gives the object of their fright its own power.""  
  
*Orville thinks to the Hangman Game, and how he needed help.*  
  
""There is power in knowing things. I do not know how to read. Had I not been with people who could, I doubt I could have saved anyone from that game.""  
  
*Orville looks at the skeletal man.*  
  
""Truly, the odd thing about power is that no type is superior to another.""  
  
*Orville thinks back to himself killing thirty-six slave-drivers.*  
  
""Physical strength can overpower numbers. This is why some men are known as 'monsters'.""  
  
*Orville thinks to himself verbally tearing down Seuss. ""...small and petty."" ""...pathetic."" ""Can you make your point with so little?""*  
  
""Words can overpower image, make the biggest man feel small.""  
  
*Orville thinks to Rickert saving him from Seuss.*  
  
""Knowledge can overpower physical strength, knowing something about your opponent, such as that they are bound by rules, can allow you to do things most would think foolish.""  
  
*Orville thinks to Adrian giving him food. To the scissor man running from him. To his double-knockout fight with the bear. To Joan's music carrying him to sleep. To the founding of the Broken Shackle Pirates.*  
  
""Power is in everything we do. It is in our actions, our words, in the things in the world. There is power in helping others, just as much as there is power in hurting them. All things have traits that make them unique, and this gives them their own certain kinds of powers. Power is not material. It is not finite. It is self-replicating, generated by everything and everyone. It is belief. It is truth. And those things can be changed.""  
  
*Orville thinks to the Sea King attacking the Marine ship he was imprisoned on, allowing him to escape.*  
  
""Power is in chance. It can be random. Power is in action. It can be generated. Power is a thing within itself, that arrives in various forms. Power is what changes the world.""  
  
*Orville walks over to lonely old Orville in hiding.*  
  
""You would have me believe that this man has power, that he has all the power in the world. But if that is true, why does he hide? Why does he not exert it? If he can truly do nothing, and cannot affect the world, I would say that he has no power at all. He has given up. He has been broken. He is powerless.""  
  
*Orville turns to the skeleton.*  
  
""And I will NEVER be broken and powerless.""  
  
*Orville walks over to the image of an Orville on the execution platform.*  
  
""This man, by my choice, had all the power of physical strength, numbers, influence, and more, and gave it up. But it does not make him powerless, for he has chosen to be here. He would die for the creation of the world he wants to see, and that is an act of power. He used his power to control his own fate, knowing it would bring his own death, because he measured all things he could do with his power to change both himself and the world, and he decided that this was the best course of action.""  
  
*Orville turns to the skeleton again.*  
  
""Even in the mines, I have heard of the Pirate King, Gold Roger. There he was, in shackles, facing death's door. But with his final words, he exerted the kind of power that changes the world forever. He inspired new generations of pirates, and plunged the world into what everybody calls 'The Great Pirate Era'. And then he died with a grin on his face. At the end of his life, he was powerful, and despite what men believe, he was free. He was satisfied. Truly, satisfaction is the ultimate goal of everything everyone does. Power to make things so that, at the end of it all, after all the struggle, the pain, the loss, you can look upon the end result and still smile.""  
  
*Orville looks back at the Orville to be executed.*  
  
""I should like to think that this Orville would do the same. That even bound and staring death in the face, he would have some glorious final words. Words that would have the power to change the world. Words that would leave him satisfied upon death. And those would be simple. Three little words, addressed to all the world: 'You are free!' He would died satisfied, free in that he controlled his destiny, powerful in that his words would give other people power, make them feel free and strong and influence them so that they see the power within themselves, for so much of power is belief. And indeed, that would satisfy him. Just like the Pirate King did, he would die satisfied, free, and powerful.""  
  
*Orville points to the image of the Orville to be executed before him.*  
  
""That is true power. That is what I choose."""

If you are in fear for the life of the robbery victim, deadly force has already arrived, and you are just catching up. Fortunately you don't have an affirmative duty to draw and shoot, but you do have the right.  

Sure, you're thinking that because you're the one knowingly bringing in a gun to the situation (the gun we know of), you're somehow responsible for some kind of escalation.  But it's the guns we don't know if, and the intentions of the attackers, that enable or disable you from bringing your own gun into the situation. 

Maybe you're bringing deadly force to the equation... and maybe you're bringing *more* deadly force, in addition to what's already there.

You should absolutely protect your own life, and of those for whom you bear personal responsibility, over that of a stranger, if only to see the attackers prosecuted-- I assume that's why you carry. But you may well have the opportunity to save a victim's life, possibly at the expense of the attacker's."

ANYWAY

Menstrual cups are awesome because they usually last for about 12 hours, unless of course you are flying on vacation. So I had to empty mine, which I did. So there's a toilet full of blood in the Las Vegas (of course) airport, and it WILL. NOT. FLUSH.

So some poor woman was going to walk into the stall right behind me to a toilet so full of blood that despite having a perfectly good reason she was going to think I was dying.

turtlehana,loseit,1389237838.0,"If you eat like crap exercising isn't going to help you lose that much weight. 

Some people count calories to lose weight while eating healthier, like myself, and others decide to just have self control, not eat when they aren't hungry, make healthy food choices, etc. 

In addition to healthy food choices and portion control some people follow a diet plan like Keto, Adkins, Paleo, Low Carb, Vegan, Vegetarian, Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, etc. 

Last year I started with not drinking calories which was a big influence on my weight. Now this year for health reasons I am doing somewhat of a cross between keto/low carb getting &gt;30grams of carbs a day. 

Like I said above I count calories, there are lots of apps for this if that is something you choose to do. In addition I can add a work out and it'll tell me how many more calories I should eat to not be under my calories for the day. 

You should talk to your parents so that they help you have healthier food options in the house and so they can provide support.

Usually just reducing your calorie intake by 500 calories a day will be enough to help you lose a pound a week. (However you should only do this if you are over eating and getting much more than the recommended calories)."

Life-in-Death,aww,1389237843.0,"I said in the next comments there are exceptions (as with SeaWorld's manatees) and that is why my original statement says *most.*

But there is also a big difference between taking an animal from the wild and displaying it than taking an animal that was an illegal pet.

I don't agree with you assessment of SeaWorlds rescue efforts, however.  I worked in rescue and rehab there for 2 years and it was a huge money sink.

We busted our butts to save every creature we could get our hands on.  We had top vets on staff and high quality medical care.  We are talking x-rays, ultrasounds, and surgeries for sickly sea lions.  I spent more nights sitting up bottle feeding orphaned pups then you can imagine.   The animals came in the back entrance and went out the back entrance.  Most people aren't even aware that SW does this.

And trust me, every trainer is fully aware of the history of the Killer Whales.  You can't even go to Whale unless you have been training dolphins there for 6 years.  The animal training community is a small one.  They all know what a high-risk job it was.  Our longest killer whale trainers their had all had huge brushes with death and talked openly about it.  The minute I started I knew almost every incident that had happened.  I haven't seen Blackfish so I don't know what they say, but yeah, there is no way I was ever interested in working with the killer whales, I value my life.

SeaWorld started as a great institution but then was bought by Anheuser-Busch and turned into an anti-union, money-grubbing amusement park.  Unfortunately more people have been attracted to going there now that it is log rides ands roller coasters then when it was beautiful aquariums.

From there, the next step is related, and that is to just do you. Simple, easy -- you get it.

If you notice that you've caught someone's eye, just go up and make their acquaintance. Don't worry if she doesn't end up in your bed within an hour of you two striking up a conversation; at this point, you just want to lay down the groundwork. If sparks fly, see if you can't get something set up, or at least get her number or Facebook so you can arrange something.

Outside of dating tips, the only thing I can really say is that you don't need to go to every rager thrown on campus in order to be everyone's friend, but investing time in other people is definitely a good idea for several reasons:

1. It's a helluva lot easier to make it through difficult times if you have people fighting in your corner, especially if you're going through hell together. I've leaned on myself, and I've leaned on my friends; trust me, a good friend is a priceless boon in a shitty situation.

2. The friends of today are the business connections of tomorrow, just like your brothers in the fraternity. Regardless of what it is you're getting into, it'd always be a nice bonus to have people of similar or other professions in your pocket, just in case you need something.

3. You know that one guy who always has these crazy stories that just can't be made up? Sometimes they're uber-extroverted, but I find that the best stories come from the really quiet chap who happens to know people from all walks of life and has really invested in them enough to go on all sorts of fun adventures. (Okay, so this one is a bit more trivial, but hey, who doesn't like a good story?)

I hope all of this helps, and feel free to ask questions."

It's true, and honestly, it worries me a bit. He knows he's the most skilled athlete on the field. He will try to carry the team on his back if he has to. He's a warrior. We saw that in his rookie playoff game against Seattle.

The problem is, football can't be won by one player. If he tries to do too much, we will lose and bad things will happen -- mistakes if we're lucky and injuries if we're not.

Instead, we need to build a solid team around him so he feels comfortable and so he doesn't have to overextend himself."

Later the crown via Litterfinger needs a suitable fakeArya to give the Boltons for their part in the RW and for Ramsay to marry so he has a stronger claim as Lord of Winterfell in the eyes of the northern lords. If you remember Jeyne keeps saying to Reek/Theon that she was trained, and that she knows how to please a man because of it. 

For the most part I agree, the shit that goes down in Littlefingers brothels is pretty much show only. But most of the stuff in LF brothels is HBO injecting more sex and violence into an already sexy violency story.

School administrators have been sold on the MyWhateverLab software by a variety of places, not all companies. Your teachers rarely think this software is awesome or even good--but are required to make you use it. 

At my current school, a lot of the administrators really like ""Course Redesign,"" a program by the National Center for Academic Transformation. As much as possible, they hope to replace profs with adjuncts, adjuncts with grad students, and grad students with upper level undergrads (despite numerous studies and even budgets proving otherwise, NCAT claims that the expensive problem in higher ed is professors). In other cases they want a single prof to teach thousands of students. They also completely standardize the courses to supposedly free up professor/teacher time or to make the ""courses teachable by anyone."" Yes because college courses should be so easy that anybody can teach them.... 

This is made possible by the use of expensive (to students) software that replaces their instructor. Of course, grammar software doesn't really replace a writing professor (or grad student or whatever), but I don't think many of these people really care about students. "

I also have a unique perspective which enables me to notice unusual, yet pertinent details which most other folks miss.  I'm usually the go-to guy whom friends and some coworkers come to for obscure knowledge, troubleshooting, clear/no-B.S. advice, and/or if they have unusual problems which most other folks have no constructive advice for.

I was laughing pretty hard at this.  It's so absurd, but it's true!  And guys will argue with you all day about how girls don't have to do that and how guys do all the work, but they couldn't be more wrong.

Even online dating, holy crap.  I just got a good taste of that from the other perspective.  So the profile of the girl I set up on a dating site was VERY attractive.  I picked the pictures that I thought were best for the profile (I've done online dating before and I basically have it down to a science) and within minutes, she had maybe 10 messages and 15 profile views.  It was insane - there was *nothing* in her profile but pics, and these guys were going crazy for her (and don't even get me started on the things they were saying!).  So then we set up more of her profile, answered some questions, and the views and messages come in like crazy, and they're mostly TERRIBLE.  Guys think ""oh, girls get so many messages!""  Well yeah, but they're all GARBAGE.  We even responded back to some guy with the most absurd message, and he bought it.  No girl would have taken that crap, but these guys were fawning over her (as I figured, I had to test it).  And so many messages about her being beautiful, a queen, princess, goddess, I mean, seriously?!  Almost immediately she didn't want to do it anymore because all the guys were either very unattractive, or left the worst messages that made you want to just stay away.

Then there's my other friend that is fairly attractive, has other good attributes as well, and can't get a date on a dating site for the life of her, while my other friend had maybe 8 people ask her out within maybe 2 hours!

And for guys...oh god, so easy.  Basically just flip through all the girls and when you get to one that's attractive, check her profile and make sure you're interested and that nothing conflicts.  If it's all good, send a message (note something in the profile, then ask an open ended question), then rinse and repeat until you get responses.  And the best part is guys tend to not get as many messages, so we don't have to deal with all the crap, such as getting discouraged by all the horrible messages that people right that make you think there's no hope."

I'll also say that I can turn my empathy off but usually only if necessary and I still choose to fill it in with intellectual empathy rather than emotional empathy.   In my case I'm totally not a sociopath, I've undergone a lot of rough shit in my life, have many of the classic markers of PTSD and that's sort of the effect it's had on my head, a survival mechanism if you will.  It's like a computer having to shut down a specific component because it's overheating and if allowed to keep going it threatens to torch the whole machine.  

I also manipulate but I refrain from manipulating people selfishly, I only do it if it's for their own good or in self-defense after I've exhausted other options or feel that other efforts would be fruitless due to specific personality conflicts.  It's not that I enjoy doing things that way.  I strongly prefer to reason with people and be logical with them but we don't live in a world where everyone is reasonable, logical or willing to compromise in a mutually agreeable/beneficial fashion."

About an hour later, I'm watching TV and I hear a weird gurgling sound coming from the main bathroom. I go to look, and the bathtub is full of disgusting green/brown water with chunks floating in it. Obviously, some sewage was backed up, so I tried to plunge it, but to no avail. I go grab the apartment manager and tell them what's going on, but they say that I'll have to wait until tomorrow when they'll have the maintenance guy come by. Fine, whatever. As soon as the manager leaves, I hear more gurgling, this time coming from my bathroom. I go to take a look, and the toilet is slowly filling up with sewage. I hear someone above me start to take a shower, and that's when the sewage level starts to rise really fast, and I realized that my apartment's plumbing is connected directly to the sewer main, and everyone else's sewage goes through my apartment. I put down some towels to try to avoid shit touching all of my stuff in my room, and I nope the fuck out of there and crash at a friend's house.

TheNewHero,cars,1389239739.0,"Depending how modern the turbo is, maybe those cars are still running stock turbos or whatever, but if it's not a turbo with modern water cooling implementations (when I say modern implementation, I mean the latest implementations by garrett &amp; the like [it's good to read their whitepaper on their site]), you're going to have to cool it down so the turbo doesn't coke. Rule of thumb, last five minutes of the drive, take it easy, then let the car idle for about 20 - 30 seconds after you've parked, then turn it off. If you have had a blast in the turbo, let the car cool down for a couple of minutes after you park. 

The cool down is just to allow the turbo to be lubricated etc Other than that, there's not too much else. Oh yeah, don't skip oil changes!!!

Most of all though, have fun!"

&gt; The thing is, I don't believe that it is 'all good'.

&gt; I think having a kid is damaging to the planet that I live on. I think there should be at least one place where I can actually say that without someone getting all up in my shit over it and telling me that I need to be nicer to parents. I get plenty of that elsewhere. You don't fucking see me going into /r/parenting and telling them how awful they are. I don't pitch fucking fits inside Chuck E Cheese and Toys R Us about hating kids. Why should this space have to be all warm and fuzzy to parents?

&gt; If they get offended and don't come to this sub, that's fine with me. Maybe it'll reduce the number of pregnancy stories and baby pictures that have been fucking invasive lately."
ArgyleMN,BodyAcceptance,1389239759.0,"I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I just thought I would share a little bit of what I have experienced as a thin woman in western society. I want you to know I am not saying I have it harder than larger women or anything like that, simply sharing some obstacles I have faced because of my weight.

When we first learned about eating disorders in grade school, it went beyond accusations of eating disorders for me. At first my ""friends"" said that I was anorexic, but when they saw me eating full lunches, they decided I must be bulimic. When they asked me about it, I denied it. They didn't believe me and took to following me if I went to the bathroom after lunch to make sure I wasn't throwing up. This went on for weeks.

In college, I lived in a dorm where 4 girls shared a bathroom that was separated by a 3/4s wall from another bathroom (shared by 4 other girls). A few weeks into the year, my RA comes into my room and tells me that girls on the floor had reported me as being bulimic. I later found out that it was one of the girls from the adjoining bathroom who thought the bathroom space smelled like vomit one time. One of my bathroommates backed her up because I used the bathroom a lot late at night. These girls were not my friends, I barely knew them, and they never made any attempt to get to know me before reporting me to an authority figure. At my school any concerns about mental health issues in the dorms was put on your housing record and reported to the residence director. Basically, this meant I would never receive a job in residential housing (like becoming an RA) because I had a record of mental health issues. It didn't matter that the accusations were completely false. I had a mental illness concern marked on my housing file.

Again, I am not trying to play oppression olympics, and I am well aware that being thin has provided me with many advantages in my life. I just wanted to share that ""thin shaming"" isn't only about self esteem. In my case, it impacted employment opportunities as well."

You can use any equal area projection. Including the Mollweide one which was used in the _actual picture I posted_. The same number of square miles will be the same number of pixels anywhere on any of those maps, no matter how distorted they are in distance and angles.

GREGORIOtheLION,AskMen,1389239857.0,"I'm with kangarooninjadonuts.  My brother is 16 years older than I am.  When I was a kid, he would jokingly (but not really) offer my friends money if they would kick my ass.  They never did, but as a 10 year old this made me terrified to have friends.  Keep in mind, he was almost 30 when he would do these things, still living at home.  He would tell me how stupid and worthless I was every chance he got.  My mother passed away when I was 16 and my dad married someone a few months later and moved out, leaving me with this brother.  It was then I found out he was addicted to meth and booze.  If I failed to come up with money for the electric bill (at 16), he would stay up all night, fuled by meth and Wild Turkey, playing music as loud as possible, vacuuming the walls (mostly the wall attached to my room, to keep me awake).

Terrified I would never live a normal life if I didn't help with the bills, I dropped out of high school and got a full time job.  I spent 10 more years discovering things of mine gone, pawned for alcohol and drug money, and being continuously talked down to by this slug of an uneducated human.

I give backstory to say that six years after I moved out, he was diagnosed as schizophrenic.  I'm now 37, and he's 52, still living in our childhood house, living on SSI, with diabetes, arthritis, and on so many psychological prescriptions he lays in bed watching VHS tapes all day.  The one time I've been in the house since leaving it, I literally threw up upon exiting it, because of the decay the house is going through.  I only see him at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  He's never apologized for how he treated me, but I have to be honest and say that if he did, I'd still be unable to give two shits if he died tomorrow."

For a close distance like reading a book or other text this is 300-400ppi which is what current high end cellphones are at (1080p @ 5"" diagonal)

Its likely that the oculus is a few times more than the conservative estimate(1 MOA) due to the proximity of the screen. Given plans by companies like Samsung to move tablet resolutions to 4k in a few years time that will likely be the density jump needed to make the pixel granularity unnoticeable. 

Still though they need very fast refresh rates and fast pixels which is why they moved to OLED.

Getting ultra high density and the performance characteristics will probably happen right as mainstream video cards will be ready for those resolutions. 1080p with high settings at 120/144hz requires multiple of the high end gfx cards.

Its also possible that due to the proximity of the screen other factors might play into design considerations like subpixel layout and minimizing moire effects from the pixel grid."

tehsuigi,toronto,1389240475.0,"SRT &lt;&gt; light rail. The key difference is the need for SRT/ICTS to be completely separate from road traffic. Because of the two extra rails (one for power, one for the linear induction motors), cars and pedestrians can't cross the tracks. On top of that, ICTS is automated in operation everywhere except in Toronto (union and public concerns to blame). And automated trains trying to cross road intersections is a very bad idea.

And yes, the SRT runs elevated between Midland and McCowan, as well as on the approach to Kennedy.

My cost comment is admittedly based on the [Scarborough RT](http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5107.shtml). It was supposed to be CLRV streetcars (the ones we have on the road right now) running in pairs along the same kind of route - that's why Kennedy station has a now-disused turning loop at its other end. When the TTC first began the Scarborough RT project with this setup, it was estimated to cost $85M for a planned 8.2 miles, or $10.4M/mile - the recent extension of the Bloor-Danforth subway from Warden to Kennedy was $41M for 1.6 miles, or $25.6M/mile.

Then the Government of Ontario got involved, coercing the TTC to switch to the then-unproven ICTS technology, and the cost ballooned to $101M and again to $196M by the time the truncated line opened in 1985. That's $196M for 4 miles - $49M/mile. Even guesstimating the inflation adjustment on the previous figures, that's bloody expensive. The TTC even went to the provincial government for an extra $27M to fix some of the problems on the line a year later.

So SkyTrain technology, at least, doesn't make sense in Toronto. It's a poisoned well.

&gt; I was more referring to being able to work safely elevated, particularly at Pearson with our type of weather. The type of propulsion used isn't really as relevant. I would assume they would use whatever makes the most sense for the needs of the line. 

Okay, *that* I can understand. Elevated transit is something Toronto's been lacking - I think there may also be some opposition to it, based on [historical precedent](http://levyrapidtransit.ca/chapter-6-rapid-transit-and-rising-land-values-the-complementary-rezoning-phenomenon/#.Uqi51RDvfbM) (search for York Mills station).

&gt; Generally when I say ""monorail"", I mean ""elevated rail"", preferably with rounded tracks, although I guess it does make a bit of a difference.

It makes a very sizable difference. Monorail strictly means elevated transit running on a single beam (like [Walt Disney World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World_Monorail_System)). Elevated rail is more appropriate for what you had in mind.

Glad you liked them! Toronto has a healthy amount of transit geek websites, Transit Toronto being the best."

[Electric Shock by f(x)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8I8QGFA1oM) is one of my fave kpop songs by one of my fave groups. 

Psy has been great since way before Gangnam Style, and [Right Now](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmHdefsaL6I) is my fave song of his. 

[Drunken Tiger's The Cure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQLndQKf8k4) is a recent favorite, though it's less pop and more hip hop. I love the combo of ballad + hip hop. And the video is really lovely.

I've been obsessed with the song [Smoke Hot Coffee Refill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1l4VcV_DyY) by 3rd Line Butterfly for a while.

I'm also a huuuuge fan of Glen Check and I'm kind of cheating because most of his songs are in English except [Au Revoir](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxKEIYIP4CA). 

Non-Korean musically:

[Nina Zilli - L'Amore È Femmina](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7B2Z0E35mw). There is an English version of this song I quite like too but this is the Italian one.

[ByeAlex - Kedvesem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmjsIhihJMY). I get most of my non-Korean music from Eurovision, which I recommend getting into if you want to broaden your horizons, although many of the songs are in English anyway.

[Star Salzman - Pillar of Salt (Xenogears remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Ssg-i4T4I). This is a video game music remix, but don't let that put you off. I've never played Xenogears but I love this song.

[Yoko Kanno feat. Origa &amp; Ben Del Maestro - Inner Universe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIP41E4B-bI). This is from the Ghost in the Shell soundtrack, an anime which I got bored of partway through but this song is great.

[Eyþór Ingi Gunnlaugsson - Ég á Líf](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtunhyMW1hM). More Eurovision. XD

Yeah denying you sex will make you want porn though. Unless you can train yourself to pleasure yourself with just thoughts of things or her or just the feeling instead porn. You will have built up sexual tension and she won't be there to help and make love. You will turn to porn which is what you don't want. She needs to understand what she's doing is actually negative and cruel. What she  I should have done when you relasped, was tell you that you've done a great job so far and you will beat this. And that she's proud of you. Denying sex is just not kind. Beating porn is hard and you may relsap many times before overcoming this and she needs to understand this.

I know you love her. But, she needs to understand that even if she is trying to support you... that denying sex is actually not supporting you. Sorry long reply!"
charliebeanz,offmychest,1389240762.0,"&gt;Of these three definitions (just the first ones that popped up on google), would you disagree that suicide meets the second definition? Concern with your welfare over that of others?

It CAN, yes, but as a rule? No. A lot of people are alive today because they know that if they left, somebody would be ruined. When I was suicidal, I knew that my Mom would miss me a lot, she would cry and she would have a hard time getting over it, but ultimately, she would be just fine. The only reason I didn't kill myself is because I couldn't think of a way to do it in a way that wouldn't traumatize anyone upon finding my body. Shot to the head? I don't want to make anyone clean THAT up. Overdose alone in my apartment? Would take weeks until someone found me, and by then... wouldn't want to expose anyone to that. Somewhere public, then? No, that's cruel also. And the way I saw it, that was me being unselfish. In the throes of depression, you can rationalize anything.

If I was to die and the worst thing someone says about me is that I was selfish when it came to how I felt about the quality of my own life and I chose to end it rather than suffer through just one more unbearable day of the miserable existence I was living in, well, that's alright."

An example of just how big an impact culture has on us is the fact that pink and blue were not considered feminine and masculine until relatively recently. [More info from a better source](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/When-Did-Girls-Start-Wearing-Pink.html) than Wikipedia.

When she is ready to make a change she will eat more of a variety imo.

Lamb, rabbit, salmon, tuna, shrimp, cod, scallops, crab, yellow tail, albacore, eel, escalar, ground turkey, and turkey burgers. 

I still don't like olives, cantaloupe, blue berries, eggplant, radishes, mango, grapefruit, and pork n'beans...

The more I tried them (the foods I didn't like), the more I put them with other foods I liked, found new ways to prepare them, etc the more I liked them. You just have to do what is right for your body. I was 21 when I made this choice and am 26 now.

If you aren't going to push yourself because you feel that you cannot the only option is to count your calories and take vitamins. Eat what you like just within your caloric recommendation. 

Exercise isn't going to do much if you are eating crap. It is difficult to have a balanced diet if you can't eat some foods that'll balance it.

I'm sure some of the people who end up there are there for a reason, but that does not condone, or excuse those abuses. 

I blame the shitty parents, who should be held accountable for their inability to raise the children they brought into the world. I get that some kids have stability issues, but those parents need to own up and take responsibility. It's like the religious people who kick their child out for being gay, or getting bad grades. Those parents should be treated as the child abusing criminals they are. 

It should never be left to a ""camp"", or state run facility to raise children. Those parents should be forced to participate every step of the way. "

aquanautic,actuallesbians,1389241028.0,"Find a new doctor! It's really hard to deal with any issues you may have if your relationship with your doctor is that awkward. 

In the future, I'd say something along the lines of not appreciating them de-legitimizing your sexuality (if it comes up again or if you do go back to this doctor). Whether your doctor intended to or not, that's pretty much what happened. It's one thing to take a history, it's another to make judgmental comments like that (had a doctor bitch about my nipple rings...never saw her again). 

I've had three different doctors do pap smears on me. The first was a crazy old lady who put her finger in my butt without warning and asked awkward questions about my piercings. I was really uncomfortable with her and I left her care as soon as my insurance allowed. The second was a nurse practitioner who was awesome and didn't talk down to me at all; she liked that I had lots of questions and gave good answers to them. I moved away from her, unfortunately. The last one I went to made comments about how I *needed* an STI test with a long look and had an attitude as soon as she knew I was sexually active. I honestly came home and cried after that appointment, she wasn't gentle with the exam and she was so freaking judgy. That was the only place my university could get me in, though. 

Moral: bad doctors suck. Good doctors are great and will make you more comfortable if you have any sort of issues. "

RandianHero,videos,1389241138.0,"Well said. Though I will point out that part of being a man is learning how to take words like that not as personal attacks, but as reminders. Taking offense is a choice, rooted in an underdeveloped ego that is not yet capable of sustaining itself. People who feel attacked, or discriminated against, or who choose to give in to their own vulnerability are not damaged by the phrase ""be a man"", but rather their own failure to accept themselves. Any phrase taken in that context can be hurtful, as a fragile ego is one that finds offense in everything in order to protect itself from having to look inward. But ""be a man"" is the only phrase that reminds boys that they're missing the mark, and that they need to try harder if they want to stop feeling attacked. It's actually a very *good* thing to say to children, because that kind of reinforcement reminds them that staying in their current state is unhealthy and is the reason that they're unhappy.

I'm probably one of those kids who was ""vulnerable"" or ""abused"", by classic definition. But one thing my father did that I still hold true to this day is remind me that I have to stand on my own if I ever hope to be happy with myself. The only thing I wish was that I had learned it sooner.

We've seen what happens to people when that's how you behave.

If you find someone with unfounded and ludicrous faith claims that you can't take seriously, don't take them seriously. If they want argument and debate, avoid ad hominem and give them real answers.

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1389241320.0,"Slippery slope indeed.  You don't live my life and aren't privy to a lot of the insane nonsense I've had to deal with.  When I have to manipulate, it's always to improve someone's life or remove a threat which can't be neutralized using other peaceful means.  I do take the initiative to make that decision for others and I do not apologize for it in any way because the results are always positive.  

Example: I recently had to do this with a coworker who is a textbook case of [Histrionic Personality Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder) as well as large helping of [Narcissistic Personality Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder) traits in the extreme and was generally fucking up the social climate of my entire workplace and being a nasty, selfish, drama-flinging, manipulative little shit, turning people against each other and against me in what was previously a happy work environment.  He was very good at hiding it and only acting out when authority figures weren't around and doing it in a way which allowed plausible deniability by using others to do his social dirty-work.  So I did an end-run of manipulation around him, planted seeds of information in various other people which helped them start asking questions, see him for what he really was and opened their eyes to his selfishly manipulative bullshit and forced him to stand in front of a mirror, metaphorically speaking.  And now he's a much nicer, more cooperative and almost drama-free person and we are all getting along with each other swimmingly and are more effective at our jobs as well as interpersonal work relations as a result of my manipulation. Manipulation is neither good nor evil in and of itself, it's all about how it is used. It's a tool like anything else, can be used for good or evil, as a weapon of destruction or a band-aid to heal.

Second, you got played. It happens. You're young. He's almost certainly not going to break up with his gf soon, and even so, it wouldn't be to start a relationship with you. He wants your body, but not you.

Lastly, I know you're young and want to have fun. But perhaps try to drink in moderation more. It's cheaper, you can still get a buzz, and you won't be as likely to make mistakes like this one.

Maybe we could restore some of your ability to move, but you would need to get a job first to pay your bills.

Hopefully this example helps illustrate the problem with your idea, which is something called ""Social Darwinism.""

The problem with it is that it assumes that everyone started at the same point and those who are wealthy, healthy, and have good jobs earned them on their own.  

The problem is that this isn't true at all.  People's states in the world are not merely a product of their own actions (e.g., laziness, criminality, etc), but largely the hand they were dealt.

Medical conditions, rape leading to pregnancy, parental abuse, inadequate education system, difficult home life, bad cultural influences, mental disorders....these are all things that people often do not have any control over that radically influences their place in life.

I think if you actually spent any good amount of time with these people, you would come to realize that much of your personal successes is due to your parents, your health, and the situation you were raised in.  

Most of them are on welfare and food stamps because they need them.  Most people getting food stamps are already working, and most people on welfare or unemployment will only be temporarily.  

Outside of much touted (but not that significant) waste, fraud, and abuse, the vast majority of people on these programs are using them as intended: as a safety net to prevent the occasional bad streak of luck from becoming a permanent sentence of destitution.

an employer can terminate the employment of an employee who has been employed continuously for three months or more if the employer has given the employee proper written notice of termination and the notice period has expired;
or 
an employer can terminate the employment of an employee without written notice or with less notice than is required if the employer pays termination pay to the employee.

Walking_Encyclopedia,worldbuilding,1389241811.0,"That's a good idea. I think I have a good political history now, based on the comments this has received. Mind giving me your opinion?

The industrial revolution kicks off in early 17th century in Prussia. The new technologies expand throughout modern-day Germany quickly.  This scares France and Russia, both of which have different reactions. France increases its trade with the Germanic states, in hope to slowly assimilate their technological prowess. Russia figures that because the area is divided into a bunch of tiny states, they have enough people to take the area by force. Eastern Germany falls quickly, and the rest of the states realize that they need to work together to prevent being overrun. With their combined industrial might, they take back their lost land, and the relationship between the states closen. Their unification behind somewhere around 1650, and Germany, once unified, becomes military dictatorship. They stop sharing industrial secrets with other nations, but all of Europe now has the foundation for industrial progress. This allows each nation to have its own ""style"" of industry and machinery. France and Germany's are similar, due to France's proximity to the origin of the technologies. France and Germany are overall very industrial. They have an almost entirely mechanized Navy, Army, and Air Force. Germany invents the steam-powered airplane in the early 1700s. Spain, due to its large coastlines, focuses on its Navy. Russia remains the least mechanized, but instead focuses on infantry weapons and strength in numbers. Britain becomes industrialized, however not to the extent of France or Germany. They don't see either as a threat, because they figure that France and Germany will take care of each other if a war breaks out. Peace continues for a long time, and France becomes sort of the benevolent superpower, while Germany is seen as the evil, oppressive military powerhouse. Spain, during their industrialization, clears nearly every forest in the country, leaving them seek out for more lumber. Still jealous of Portugal's acquisition of Brazil, and knowing that Brazil in particular has extensive rainforests, Spain attacks Portugal in the early 1700s and steamrolls them. France, seeing itself as the ""protector of Europe,"" declares war on Spain in turn. Germany sees this as the prime opportunity to take land from France, and crosses the border into Western France. Britain, while unable to quickly field an army rivaling Germany's, diverts its entire economy and industry towards giving money to and supplying France, in an attempt to prevent Germany from getting to close to the English Channel. Britain's economy lies in ruin, and it turns to its colonies in America to continue funding France's two-front war. In a year or so, the colonies become angered with Britain's tight hold on them, and declare independence. Britain itself is in a depression, and doesn't have the will to fight, and simply allows the colonies to break off. Because there was no war for independence, the newly free colonies lack a sense of unity or patriotism, and instead of uniting, they become a loosely-associated group of nations, much like Germany before its unification. France loses the war, and signs land in the West to Spain, and land in the East to Germany, becoming about half of its original size. Spain focuses its efforts on expanding its colonies in the Americas, which prevents Britain's old colonies from expanding westward and gaining any real power. Other than the loss of territory, France isn't a particularly weak place. The money supplied from Britain allowed France to retain its industrial and social structure through the end of the war. The depression on Britain gets worse, and because the man in power isn't elected, nothing gets done. Over the course of the next hundred and fifty years, Britain becomes an elitist society with everybody dirt-poor except for a few very wealthy at the top. In 1863, a communist rebellion is sparked by the very angry population. The revolutionaries establish their base in western Wales, in a town they will eventually call Ironside. The rebellion lasts 11 years, and the communists finally take over in 1874. However, the infrastructure of British society isn't fully restored, and even through the 1880s, Britain lacks a strong government.

I lost about 40lbs in four months a few years ago (not juicing back then).  I would weigh myself every day with only boxers on before I had breakfast. 

I've never found any thorough answers as to why our weight fluctuates as it does, but I generally assume there are lots of factors involved.  As one example - after a night of drinking, I always drop two pounds.  And then the next day, I'm up a pound or two over what I was before drinking, and then it evens out after 2-3 days.  Add to that calorie intake, exercise, sugar levels, etc, and a moving average is the only thing that seemed to track consistently.  I was able to see incremental changes - to the decimal - of how my progress was.

These days, when I'm tracking, I usually use a spreadsheet, but back then I was using [caloriecount.about.com](http://caloriecount.about.com) which is just-ok in the UI department but they do show a moving average on their weight graph.  "

ebonlance,Warmachine,1389241993.0,"1) Generally you don't need to worry about this. It's exceedingly hard to get a back strike against a model barring certain special abilities, placement effects, etc. The +4 ARM isn't going to save you most of the time with single-wound infantry, except against blast damage, so don't feel obligated to wall up every time. This is a game that favors aggression so it's often more effective to run or charge than to wall up and get killed anyway. A notable exception are the Khador Man-o-Wars and Cyriss Reciprocators, whose higher ARM under SW and multiple boxes of damage per model mean they have a pretty decent chance of surviving a charge from all but the most exceptionally powerful melee attacks.

2) There are rules for structures on pg 88-89 of the main rulebook. It's not as complicated as it is in 40k - typically the only thing you'd get inside of a structure is cover, or perhaps elevated LoS for being on the roof of one. You basically designate the rules for entering them, switching between floors, and what bonuses they provide on a game-by-game basis. They can be destroyed and you don't want to be inside of one when it happens."

Not really, unfortunately. We all have to play it by ear.

A good rule of thumb though would be the ability to slot in a particular mod. For example, I use Barrel Diffusion (Pistol Multishot) on pretty much every secondary weapon I own, so once I get enough Mod points to slot that in, I'm instantly more confident in my ability to tackle higher level enemies, and *60% of the time it works all the time.*

Jokes aside, the only true way to know is to try it out. Take on missions and if they end up being easy, keep going! If not, level up a little more, or try playing ONLINE with random groups or even a group of friends/clanmates who can help you along. "

Even so, you should be able to get any expensive liquids into your carry on. 

If you decide to buy makeup there, be sure that you find a reputable store. They'll only cater to a few skintones as well. Anyway, picking up makeup there is a bit risky if you don't make sure you're getting it from someone authorized. There's fakes of *everything* in China (the markets where you'd bargain have a ton of fakes. If you aren't good at bargaining though, you're better off buying from a department store). 

What you wear will heavily impact what you pack. Keep in mind that the standard look in China is very different, so you'll look very American if you wear many looks (also good to know: short skirts are pretty common, but don't show cleavage). Foundation and mascara are very universal though. 

That's a super long plane ride, and you'll hopefully be sleeping for a lot of it. Are you sure you want to wear makeup for it?

CaptainSnacks,teenagers,1389242143.0," So a questions for the girls. 

Backstory: in September I started to have a ""thing"" with a girl. Everything was fine but her parents wouldn't let her date because of her shitty grades. 

Fast-forward a month or so. We have the homecoming dance, and at my school it is referred to as the ""twerk fest/grind party""(this is literally what people call it). Well I decided to go. The girl I am having a thing with, let's call her H, can't go because her parents forbid it. 

So I go anyway and I met this other girl, let's call her G. She is literally all over me at the dance (jumping on me, we're dancing together, she grinded on me but told me to stop because I still had a thing with H, etc.) and I can tell she likes me. 

After the dance, her friend asks for my number and I give it to her. I then start to continuously receive texts from G for the next two weeks or so. 

By this point I have lost interest in H so we break up. G eventually requests to hang out over a weekend, but unfortunately I am busy, so I tell her. The second day we come back from said weekend she stops talking to me and I start to talk to one of her friends to find out if everything is okay. She tells me G is not interested in a relationship so I lay off but request to still be friends with G. G accepts but from then on never texts me back anymore or returns my texts. 

I tried inviting her to a school play to talk things over and hang out, she immediately declines. One of G's best friends and I become pretty good friends, let's call the best friend J. J can see and eventually she asks me what's wrong. I don't want to at first, but she eventually talks me into telling how I feel about G and that I still really like G etc. 

J offers to help, but with no luck. G tells J she used to like me, but no longer does once she found out I like her. Fast-forward a week, J and G and another one of their friends get together and they call me. They ask me why I have been venting to J all my problems with G. I hung up because they were screaming. J resumes to text me for a while, requests I apologize for my ""rude behavior""( I literally got out like 2-3 words during their screaming). Whatever, I apologize to salvage J's friendship and tell her I wish that G would forgive me. J tells me to lay off for a whole and see how things go. 

Fast forward. Winter break comes around. By this time J and I haven't been talking very often, and G is consistently mad at me so we are not talking at all. I find out from a friend that G tweets about me(I don't have a twitter). I get extremely mad. I didn't do anything about it though. We come back to school today. J and I do not chat often, G just glares at me in the hall and I glare back. 

So my question is should I continue to try to make amends with G, or even continue to pursue her, I really like her and all my friends have told me to forget her and stay away from G. I just don't know what to do. She's the first girl who has liked me legitimately, I feel as though H just wanted a boy toy and I'm not into that.

&gt; TL;DR: Had a gal, not interested in her no mo. Got a new gal, she isn't interested in me no mo. What to do?

&gt; Edit: On my phone so I apologize for any grammar or spelling errors.

He was very possessive, and then finally I ended it because my mother was basically verbally abusing me about the relationship, so I had no relief and was stressed to the point where I was starving myself and my hair was falling out. I ended the relationship but then he used the ""secret"" aspect and kept threatening to tell my mom if I didn't do what he said. One example was I wasn't allowed to be in the same hallway as him in the mornings. One time I was late to class and I thought I could cut through that hallway because he was in class. He bounded out of the room and asked me what I was doing in that hallway. I told him I was late to class and he replied ""I told you very clearly not to come into this hallway. I guess I'll let it go this time, but if you do it ever again, I will march down with you to your mother's classroom and tell her in front of her entire class"" and then I went to class and had a major panic attack. My entire days were spent walking on broken glass, school wasn't safe for me because I had to deal with him. Home wasn't safe for me because I had to deal with my mother constantly on my case. It was just a period of time that was very dark, and to this day if my mom mentions him at all I deny ever dating him.

At what point during the process of inebriation can consent be said to be revoked / not exist / be reasonably provided?  That's difficult to answer, particularly since (at least in Western countries) alcohol is such a huge social norm and it affects everone differently?

At what point does personal responsibility apply during the consumption of alcohol?  Assuming you've inbibed of your own free will, being drunk doesn't excuse you from other acts, such as drunk driving, or other offences you commit when drunk (at least so far as I know).

funkalunatic,CrazyIdeas,1389242285.0,Well this is certainly the right subreddit for this post.
PositedSymbols,philosophy,1389242286.0,"There are multiple modes of nihilism, such as ethical nihility (the view that no moral utterances are intrinsically ""good"" or ""bad""), existential nihility (the view that there is no intrinsic purpose or universal reason such as for there to be a continuity of life; all reasons or incentives in this field are merely preferential), and so forth.

I will now quote your initial point labeled with an ""a"", below:

&gt;A) there is no inherent value to anything [of nihilism]

Applying my exposition, it can be deduced that someone can be nihilistic about ethics, yet not nihilistic about their own existence (though perhaps a bit odd if one were to do such, or vice-versa, there is no apparent cognitive dissonance present). Furthermore, generalizing ""nihilism"" as a system that which encompasses ethics is a patently fallacious understanding of what nihilism even is: a type of position, rather than a particular position which, if espoused, necessitates particular *ethical* positions as well. Regardless, enough of the arguably trifle, because the essence of your so-called ""paradox"" is that nihilism is an ethical truth; and that's fine, we can simply view ethical nihilism and apply its contention that of what you claim it to be.

From the outset, I think that there is a blatant categorical error here; that is, you are conflating two types of factual-claims: the ethical (normative, meta, et-cetera), and the existential. Ethical nihilism is the meta-ethical assertion that no moral system is inherently, intrinsically, or otherwise innately moral or immoral at all, for whatever reason that may be (I, myself, am an ethical nihilist and non-cognitivist; non-cognitivism is my position for *why* I am nihilistic in that respect); thus, it is not a postulated ""ethical truth"" in the sense that it is asserting a particular ethical element as true or untrue, but, categorically, speaking about the nature of these evaluations regardless. To disambiguate, what I mean to say is that ethical nihilism is not applicable to itself because its own contention, i.e., that there is no inherent moral standard of sorts, can't be applied to the aforementioned. The nature of the proposition is necessarily transcendent of its own principle's domain..."

BuildMyPaperHeart,Warframe,1389242294.0,"&gt; The people who don't want to suffer through the grind have the Platinum cash shop. Your argument is invalid.

Not... really. Some people just don't like the grind, and yet don't want to pay. Yes, it does boil down to ""if they don't like the game, don't play it,"" but it's perfectly reasonable for F2P game players to not want their time wasted. 

I fell out of Blacklight: Retribution because I felt progression was painfully slow. 200 cash and like 300 XP per game? It doesn't scale well for the higher levels, and I stopped around Level 23 because of this. I didn't want to shell out real money just so I could make the gun I wanted. 

Maybe I'm just reacting strongly to your word choice. I probably am! Maybe none of this makes sense and I'm just saying stuff. Just be aware that some people don't have the time or patience to grind OR pay, and that's as valid as any other outlook at the game."

lazulii,australia,1389242309.0,"I go to uni in Wagga and I have never met or even heard of anyone that had to sleep in cars, prostitute themselves out, squat, or whatever because they couldn't afford somewhere to live or to buy food on centrelink. I was able to pay $220 a fortnight for rent in a shared house and still have enough money to pay for food (the only time I ate noodles was when I wanted to eat noodles), fuel and bills. I didn't live in a big fancy house, I didn't go shopping all the time, I bought what I needed the most, and either saved the rest or used it for alcohol, or going out when my bf was in town.  Most people I know on YA don't even look for jobs because they are comfortable getting by on what they receive from centrelink, most can't even find a job and give up, and those that do have jobs have employers that understand that you need time to study and are willing to work around uni anyway. 

Also everyone on YA/Austudy/Abstudy gets the Student Start-up Scholarship at the start of every semester to help with text books or any other start-up costs.

http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/student-start-up-scholarship

&gt; *If you are a full-time student undertaking an approved scholarship course and are receiving Youth Allowance, Austudy, or ABSTUDY Living Allowance, you will receive the Student Start-up Scholarship in two half yearly payments.*
&gt; *In 2013, the Student Start-up Scholarship is $1,025 for each six months of eligible study, a total of $2,050 in 2013.*

Plus rural students(like me) are eligible for a relocation scholarship through centrelink.

http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/relocation-scholarship

&gt; *In 2014, the Relocation Scholarship for students whose family home is in an area classified as Inner Regional Australia, Outer Regional Australia, Remote Australia or Very Remote Australia will be:*

&gt; * *$4,145 if it is the first year in which a student is required to live away from home to undertake full-time study in an approved scholarship course*

&gt; * *$2,073 if it is the second or third year*

&gt; * *$1,036 if it is the fourth year or subsequent year*


And if you are really struggling every university has emergency scholarships. For example, Charles Sturt has 7 emergency/equity grants for people who are struggling.  

http://www.csu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/52835/F2729-Scholarships-brochure-2013_FINAL-WEB.pdf

&gt; * *Emergency Equity Food vouchers*
Financial assistance in the form of vouchers up to the value of $60 for students who are in need of 
immediate emergency assistance to purchase food and other essential items.

&gt; * *Emergency Equity Grant*
Financial assistance up to $500 for students who suffer unforeseen adverse or emergency events 
such as accidents, fire, flood, natural disasters, theft or unexpected illness or health problems.

&gt; * *Professional placement equity Grant*
A grant to assist with costs associated with completing a compulsory professional placement as 
part of their course requirement such as travel, accommodation and uniforms.

&gt; * *Relocation equity Grant*
Provides financial assistance up to $1,500 for students who must relocate from a rural 
or remote location to reside in on campus university residences at CSU.

&gt; * *Residential schools equity Grant*
This scheme provides assistance for accommodation costs incurred by students studying 
distance education subjects who must attend compulsory residential schools on campus.

&gt; * *Technology equity Grant*
Provides financial assistance up to $500 for the purchase of computer equipment 
and broadband internet, so that students are not disadvantaged in their studies by 
not having online access.

&gt; * *Textbook equity Grant*
Up to $300 to provide assistance in purchasing compulsory textbooks to meet course requirements.

I'm sure centrelink has something similar too.

I'm not saying that its that easy for everyone, obviously where I live and attend uni is cheaper than Canberra but its very, very possible to live off centrelink. If a student is receiving centrelink and living in a car, squatting, struggling to buy food or prostituting themselves out, I would think its because they are spending too much money on one thing (maybe their rent or buying a new car) and have little left over for the other necessities. I think the bigger problem is many students, first years especially, that have never lived out of home aren't that good at budgeting and spending money wisely and end up blowing it all."

tomanonimos,legaladvice,1389242410.0,"It is also reasonable for a customer to believe an employee. An employee is given guidelines on how much authority they have, by the owner, which they must follow. It is the employees responsibility to follow the guidelines. It is unreasonable for an outsider to know the extent of authority an employee may have unless explicitly stated on their uniform (ex. job title on name tag)

In this situation, an employee representing the owner gave the OP permission to access the property. It is reasonable for OP to assume he had been given permission to enter the property and not violating the code in question. This is a different situation if OP just went on the train property without receiving permission from any employee. 

Your example: If a front desk employee gives a customer a discount, it is reasonable for the customer to assume the front desk employee has the power to give that discount. A customer is not required to know what an employee can and cannot do.

Many things will therefore not seem relevant, but could be.  For example, asking ""What did you have for dinner that night?"" could demonstrate that her memory was hazy.  Her willingness to sleep around might demonstrate that she made hasty decisions.

At the end of the day though, unless the prosecutor objects, the defense can do anything they want.  If the defense wins, there is no appeal due to double jeopardy.

If the prosecutor does it, even if the defense doesn't object (or the judge doesn't agree), they could appeal the verdict based on the irrelevant information after the trial is over.  Then appeal that decision if needed.

Honestly, though, as much as your opinion is your own to have, I particularly dislike gender-based stereotypes and social stigmas that force people into conforming to them.

Why are guys not allowed to have feelings, or explore them artistically? I don't want to be with someone that has a limited emotional range, because my emotional range is much wider than that. While there is nothing wrong with a limited emotional range, it just isn't something I am interested in. I want to be with someone that will be able to understand what it is to feel one way, despite KNOWING that feeling that way about it isn't going to change anything.

Also, every time a guy reinforces some weird female stereotype, I feel very excluded and kind of just want to go away. Because it makes me feel like I have already been stamped with some label that isn't true. And that label brings with it several other labels that also aren't true. But I can't say something about it because ""it's just a joke"", or worse. I become one of *those women* by saying something like that. Even if it's something that's a little weird to stereotype that way. (Being a ""hopeless romantic"" and liking Twilight aren't mutually inclusive, you know.)

I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm not saying you're some evil misogynist or anything. (You're not. Just so I can be perfectly clear.) I'm just hoping to bring another side to those kinds of things is all."

We are busy on every route between 8am and 9am. So that will never change.

Sure, they might determine where they can put in more community buses, or where they need more coverage in non-peak hours. But I doubt that was enough of a reason to invest in a new system. They could have done some analysis with the help of a city planner to do that. Plus, Vancouver's growth is with ""condo neighbourhoods"" - e.g. Burnaby around Still Creek, Metrotown, and others. It can't be that hard to figure out where new bus service should go.

First day of 2013.

To tell this story I must add a back story, I will be brief.

Then SO and I got a hotel room for NYE, we got pizza and hot wing, it was our thing then. We ate them and did our type of celebration (unfamiliar bed sex) only I left the pizza out, I figured that Pizza Hut was packed so full of preservatives it wouldn't matter too much. Next morning we get up late, too late for the hotel breakfast so like any guy in his early 20s I leap to the box of pizza and devour the last of it, mind you it sat at room temperature for several hours.

....Later that evening, I am getting ready for school (I started my winter term of college on the 2nd) I have a beer while I am getting my shit ready, clothes, notebooks, pens, reminder notes on not to forget the shit I have just set out. I start feeling kinda off, I figure it is the beer I was indulging in a Torpedo IPA, pretty bitter stuff. My ill feeling is making me not wanna sleep so I go to where my videogames are, and decide to play for a little bit. I feel some gastrointestinal pressure and do what a person does to relieve said pressure. Result: Shit my pants. Alright, I am an adult I can deal with that. So I go wash up and get what ever is left out of there. But I still feel odd. I try to lie down but that doesn't help.

I go back to the bathroom and sit in front of the toilet thinking I am going to throw up. Of course some odd psychological constraint is blocking that then I remember my then SO's voice in my mind ""when I feel kinda I'm gonna throw up, I make myself just to get it over with."" So I do that, a little comes out.... I look at it and what comes next I never anticipated. A torrent of projectile vomit, so much weight and velocity that it is honestly bouncing out of the toilet on to myself. It is on the walls, the floors, my pants, my shirt... Everywhere.

Then I feel it. My bowels are not finished. I flush the toilet and quickly hop on and proceed to feel the evacuation, the force feels like my insides are melting and pouring out of me. I feel a tickle in my throat while this is happening, what do I do? I can't get off the pot, shit will fly everywhere. I can only vomit on the floor while I am surely filling up the bowl.

At this point my dad has risen, hearing all theses gagging and gurgling sounds. He opens the door to the bathroom in between projectile vomits on the floor I muster the strength to mutter ""No.. Dude on't come in here."" He proceeds to walk in to a massive pile of puke and a stench like no other.

His words will live in me forever.

""Oh, this is way better than what I thought was going on. I thought you were choking yourself while whacking off. Thought I was gonna have to pull you off the door while your pants are down.""

We are a very open house so we retell the story at every Christmas and in his version I ask him to wait until I am finished to pull me off the door.

TL;DR Puking on the floor while filling the toilet after getting food poisoning and my dad comes in thinking I am pulling a David Carradine. "

That sounds appropriate to me. Obviously, those things (hostile body language and facial expressions) are going to drive a person away, and might be much less obvious to someone than their height may be.

Edit: And obviously this isn't the case for everyone. This post is a very personal experience and doesn't seem to be meant as general advice for everyone.

2. Backwards compatibility means shit to the casual players, who are really the main target market for the Wii and thus, WiiU.

3. The adult games that you mentioned are MULTI PLATFORM. Only Bayonetta 2 is an exclusive. Games that come out for the PS4 and Xbox one will probably not be ported to the WiiU because of its lack of processing power. 

Fact is: unless you LIKE playing Nintendo games and don't mind having nothing else to play, there is really nothing that will compel you to get a Wii-U. For a person like me, who doesn't like both Zelda and Mario, there is basically no reason for me to get a Wii-U over PS4 and Xbone. "

Success is measured in a variety of ways, but those people in the correlation are not very successful to me, and their ""drive"" (my definition) has diminished as they started smoking more and more.

No, but they share some traits with women, including sexually desiring men. The pre-natal hormonal processes thought to influence a person's sexuality are in some ways similar to the ones for the opposite sex. 

This also undermines your second argument - are gay men socialized in the same way as women during the time when their brain is developing? What about transwomen?

I'm sure there's plenty of flawed studies in the area, but that doesn't mean there aren't good studies. And you can't simply say, ""the studies have issues, therefore the opposite of their conclusions is true."" You have to produce contradictory studies that are well done.

If a problem is simply breast shape, then the person criticizing needs to be made aware that they might as well be saying ""you have a giant, offensive nose"" to the poor woman, its not something she can help."

- It never hurts to get your medical squared away. I will tell you right now that nothing is going to benefit you more than going to the doctor for every fucking cough or ache you get. And no I'm not joking. Does the wife complain you snore? Go get a referral to see a sleep doctor and get a CPAP machine. Knee been bugging you for a bit because of the non stop running you do? Go get it looked at and make sure they document every little damn thing. This is how the VA is going to decide if you meet qualifications for disability, or if they need to see you to clarify some things. 

- You have a few (I'll assume two since you probably went in for a 6 year and another 6 year on XC-train) but no bachelors? Get your ass in gear and just get one from the AU-ABC program and accelerate it majorly. I'm talking max out your TA. If you are fully getting out (nor Reserve/Guard option) then make sure you maximize this benefit. Do not use your GI Bill until you are really ready to use it. It could very well end up being your lifeline while you are job hunting. 

- Buy a suit and get both a Resume and a CV ready to go. Do not rely on TAPS or whatever other transitional class they'll have for you. Save your Leave so you can cash it out in case you cannot find a job in time that you get your walking papers. Start saving now!

They are more a way of determining possibilities and discussing them with a professional. Further, I'd be extremely wary of any professional who diagnosed solely on the basis of self-tests.  They really need to dive into your mental nuts and bolts over several sessions to be more certain.  Even so, make sure that if you are seeking out a professional, that they are HFA/ASD-literate, ideally a specialist in that area if you have strong suspicions of having ASD/HFA.  There are a lot of psych professionals who are woefully underinformed and diagnose very sloppily when it comes to autism spectrum stuff.  If you want to have a slightly clearer picture of your wiring and/or rule out certain things, try taking all three of the self-tests listed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_tell_if_i_have_asperger.27s.2Fasd.3F) and address the results with an ASD/HFA-literate professional."

Celdurant,premed,1389243690.0,"* I agree with the first point. We are all in various stages of the process ourselves. I would assume 99% of us are not on admissions committees making decisions about accepting applicants, therefore we can only say what we think works, or what worked for us. Advice on these types of boards are anecdotal in a sense, but the composite you take away from multiple reasonable replies is generally good.

* This is silly. While SDN, and even /r/premed occasionally have the extremists who are out only to prop themselves up and disparage others, by and large I do believe that these forums act as source to help, not hurt, our fellow med school hopefuls. For the most part I think that premeds are helpful and caring individuals who encourage and support other intelligent individuals who are in pursuit of the same dream.

* The third point I find to be pretty ridiculous, at least for /r/premed. Plenty of people have asked for advice, both general and specific, and the response is usually positive and helpful. There are countless guides, suggestions, etc. proposed for almost every problem. The only thing I can see getting low responses are niche or rare situations. Our community is small, and we don't have all the answers to everything, but we do try to point people in helpful directions.

Pre-med advisers are free to have their opinions. In this day and age, a lot of people seek sources of immediate feedback, flawed or not. These online forums are a source of feedback, which is crucial in this highly competitive process. I know a lot of people who only listen to what pre-med advisers say, and end up lost at sea because of it. 

There's nothing wrong with using every resource available to get informed, as long as you maintain perspective about the advice you're receiving. We are not faultless gods, and neither are pre-med advisers. "

CaspianX2,Games,1389243887.0,"&gt;Sega would never do that. They have some of the most famous gaming IPs in history, and by keeping them on their own hardware they can also profit from console sales.

- the words of numerous Sega fans 14 years ago.

**Edit**: Okay, people seem to have misunderstood what I meant by this.

I am not saying that Nintendo is in the same situation Sega was, nor that Nintendo is destined to go the way Sega went. That is of course entirely dependent on how they play their cards moving forward, and what changes the market goes through in the future.

What I *am* saying is that having a huge stable of famous gaming IPs isn't enough to ensure victory. At one point people were talking about Sega being the new king of videogames, and could point to a huge catalog of extremely marketable franchises as a surefire sign their future was secure... but then they released two poorly thought out add-on consoles and a successor console with a disastrous launch it could never recover from, and by the time the genuinely great Dreamcast came out, even strong US sales couldn't save it from its weak showings in Japan and the PS2 hype machine.

Sega was undone by multiple factors, but those factors weren't really the quality of their games or a lack of strong franchises in their stable. Their problems were mostly disastrously bad business decisions that undermined consumer confidence in their brand, weakened their ties with publishers and retailers, and crippled them financially.

Well, currently, Nintendo has made some questionable choices regarding the design and marketing of the Wii U, which have strained their ties to publishers and retailers, and this is after the Wii seriously undermined consumer confidence in their brand. At the very least they *do* have a steady influx of cash in part thanks to their thriving handheld market, but this isn't the first time that they've essentially used their handheld market as a lifeboat, and I have to think that they can only do that for so long, especially considering that the 3DS itself was widely seen as a failure until Nintendo made a drastic reduction to the price point along with a decent outreach program to win back consumers.

Nintendo has some things going for it that Sega never did, and they've got some things going against it that Sega didn't have to deal with. But even though Nintendo's well-known and lucrative franchises are a huge boon to the company, they aren't a guarantee that Nintendo will survive anything. Sega showed us that much."

The transfer orbit was 90,000km x 295km 22.5 degrees

Confirming that something is in an orbit != tweeting about it != reaching apogee.

All they said in the tweet was that they *launched* it.

Semi major axis is 6,380 + 90,000 = 96380km

2 * pi * ( ( (96380)^3 ) / 398,600.4418 )^0.5 = 297777.146 seconds or 82 hours.

And, shockingly, before the Great Society programs were enacted, the poverty level was decreasing at a rate of 1% per year. 

A libertarian would get rid of expensive food vendor licenses and zoning restrictions, so a poor person could make money out of their house instead of being expected to pay hundreds or thousands to jump through legal hoops then have to pay for a commercial property or rent one as just one example.

Basic economics show that if you make it easier to sit and collect a ""free"" paycheck, people will do so. Eliminating a handout system and replacing it with a charity driven, means tested and publicly accountable system of private welfare would get rid of the moochers and direct those resources to people who need it.

My wife's first employee was a young black female teenager with a bad family life. She left home at 18 and tried to apply for government assistance. Since she was working two jobs (to pay for school) she wasn't eligible for nearly anything. A social worker told her she would have to quit nursing school to qualify for housing assistance. My in-laws decided to take her in and help her get back on her feet and she's doing great now. Meanwhile, my deadbeat neighbors have never worked a day in their life but can afford a new Cadillac CTS, new KIA, yard management service, cable, internet, etc. Its ridiculous to think this is helping society."

m00nf1r3,AskWomen,1389244276.0,"This is the first thing that came to my head... when I was 11 years old, my mom sat me down in the kitchen to have an adult talk. She was a very wise woman, and we'd have these talks about people, relationships, how to treat others, etc. These long, deep prophetic talks. It was nearing my bedtime and I really wanted to play my Nintendo before bed (probably dating myself a bit there) but I sat down to talk with my mom, hoping it wouldn't take long. I was wrong. She kept talking and talking... I was watching the clock, my freedom ticking away, zoning in on bedtime, NES untouched. The longer she talked, the sadder I got. Finally, I just started crying. Still listening to her talk, not sobbing, but tears fell, and I think some sniffles were involved. Her face changed dramatically from one of deep wisdom to one of deep concern, and she asked me what could ever be the matter.

""I have 9 minutes until bedtime and I really wanted to play my Nintendo but you talked for so long...""

My mom looked at me for a second as if to gauge the truthfulness of my response. When she realized I wasn't kidding, she started laughing really hard and told me to go play Nintendo. I think I got to stay up a little later that night.

swimmiee,AskMen,1389244411.0,"I don't understand the answers in this thread. How are women supposed to know if a guy is interested in her for more than sex if she has it too quickly? That's just asking to be pumped and dumped. Also, I'm assuming this is also coming from the many men who say they don't want women who've had ""too many"" sexual partners. How are we supposed to keep our numbers low enough for you if you are demanding that we have sex with you immediately, rather than when we feel comfortable with it? 

My advice to you as a girl who's read this subreddit for a year or so, trying to make herself the ""ideal"" girl for guys to date (who was also promiscuous in her past and had low self-esteem as a result), is to stop asking for dating advice online. Have sex when you feel comfortable with it and you feel confident that the man is interested in you for more than just sex. Judge him by his actions and how interested he seems in spending time with you. Make your own boundaries and stick to them, without being self-righteous about it.

kempff,askscience,1389244576.0,"Soft bread is soft because it is humid. Hard cookies are hard because they are arid.

When the water vapor goes from bread to cookie, it leaves the bread hard and makes the cookies soft.

In the wintertime you can resoften your brown sugar by wetting and squeezing out a paper towel and tossing it as a lump into the bag with the brown sugar. The wet towel rehumidifies the sugar so it returns to pliability.

You can recrispify stale chips by microwaving them in an open bowl until they are hot, then toss them for a while in air so they dry out and get crispy again. Or repliableize stale brittle flour tortillas by steaming them over the gas flame of your rangetop. Just flip them back and forth a few times.

It's the pasta principle. Dry pasta gets hydrated in hot water and goes limp. Leftover cooked pasta forgotten on the countertop returns to its natural hard state.

You can salvage old chocolate cake, or make good brownies better, by slicing them into fingers and leaving them next to you coffeemaker for a couple days to dry out. They transform into chocolate biscotti perfect for dipping in your morning coffee.

Some Italian marketing genius came up with the idea of taking unsellable old stale rock-hard leftover cake, cutting it into smaller pieces then charging 1600% the unit price for the original cake. And the sheeple love it. He was probably an ancestor of the guy who invented those little energy drinks you see in on display at bars.

It's the same idea with soap. Soap cleans by getting dirty. Jesus saves by taking on our sins. Or the Empath who heals by getting injured http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OF5bXlJnfI Or the Skeksis, who live by sucking the life out of the living.

I'm no music expert, but she just doesn't have pizazz to make me want to keep listening. Royals is the worst with this. She has harmonizing and a beat, not much else there. Maybe some people like the minimalism, but I really don't care for it. I like being able to hear new sounds every time I listen to a song or album, be it Lady Gaga or John Mayer. 

She's also been picking fights with other celebrities who are way more popular than her. Does she want people to hate her? 

Also, minor things that she does that bother me:

The T. Rex arm thing while singing. What is that lorde?!

However, this rule is not enforced very consistently. The way travelling is called in the NBA, you see many plays where players get away with taking their gather step after firmly having the ball up off the ground, or getting away with somehow taking multiple steps during the gather.

another30yovirgin,ForeverAlone,1389244669.0,"Yeah, hope really sucks. I met this woman in my salsa class. I thought she was cute from the beginning.

I kept thinking I needed to ask her out, because that's what guys are supposed to do. But I didn't. I wasn't ready yet. Then I started to suspect she was a lesbian, though I still am not sure. One day she announces that she's quitting the class. I tried to get her to stay in it, but she had made up her mind. But she said we could still hang out. Well, I found her on Facebook, we chatted a bit. I gave her my number. Then suddenly she didn't respond for a while. When she did, it was awkward. Then I told other people about this and they said ""well, you still haven't actually asked her out"". Even today, someone I talked to was encouraging me to try and get her to do something with me.

The long and short of it is this: every step along the way, there's been some level of hope, whether a big amount of hope or a little tiny bit of hope that I haven't allowed to be extinguished. She's not interested. I don't need to be a mind reader to get that. But, you know, maybe there's still a chance.

I hate hope. This has been a terrible roller coaster of emotions. On the one hand, I want to just drop this and forget about her. On the other, I really don't want to be rejected, and I'm pretty sure that's what would happen. This sucks, in short."

DO start pleasant conversations with her to give her lots of attention, but just quietly turn away from her or leave the room when she starts being super negative. 

Playing into it, discussing it, calling her on it, are all giving her attention for bad behavior. 

Find ways to give her lots of positive attention. Do bring up the baby. Make baby crafts in front of her, etc and talk to her about it if she remains positive. If she's negative continue to do the fun happy things but don't talk to her or respond to her.

jgagnon_in_FL,nyc,1389245031.0,"&gt; The snow began to fall about the 10th of November, 1779, and continued falling almost every day until the middle of the following March. The Northeast virtually shut down. It was known as The Hard Winter, and may have been the coldest these parts have seen since the Wisconsinin glacier.

&gt; It was a world of ice. The rivers, creeks and streams on Long Island were frozen solid, as was Upper New York Bay. The East River and the Hudson River could be crossed by foot. British cavalry thundered from Manhattan to Staten Island. Long Island Sound was more ice than water.

&gt; As for the frozen ducks, the Long Island Loyalist judge, Thomas Jones, a sober man not usually given to tongue-in-cheek tall tales, passed along a “remarkable if true” story about a Staten Island farmer named Goosen Adriance:

&gt; “He went out in the morning upon his farm, which adjoins the water, and going along the shore, he observed a parcel of ducks sitting erect and in their proper posture,” Jones wrote in his book, “History of New York During the Revolutionary War.” The author continued: “He walked up to them, found them stiff, and as he supposed perfectly dead; he carried them home, threw them down upon the table in his kitchen, where a large wood fire was burning, and went into the next room to breakfast with his family. Scarce was the breakfast over when a great noise and fluttering was heard in the kitchen. Upon opening the door how great the surprise. The supposed dead ducks were all flying about the room.”

&gt; According to weather historian David M. Ludlum, no winter before or since was as cold.

&gt; “Long Island Sound was almost completely clogged with ice, and people were able to cross from Long Island to the vicinity of Stamford on the Connecticut shore for several days,” Ludlum writes in “Early American Winters: 1604-1820.” “Some Hessian soldiers took advantage of this route in order to escape from their regiments.”

&gt; Judge Jones, who lived at Fort Neck (now Massapequa), wrote in his book that 200 provision-laden sleighs, pulled by two horses each, escorted by 200 light cavalry, made the five-mile trip from New York to Staten Island. On Long Island, with British occupiers making demands for firewood, cattle and living space, already harsh conditions were made even harsher. Part of Long Island Sound became a highway of ice. “It was so strong, that deserters went upon the ice to Connecticut from Lloyd’s Neck, upon Long Island, the distance more than 12 miles.”

&gt; George Washington’s troops were shivering in winter quarters at Morristown, N.J. — one writer said it made Valley Forge of the previous year look like a picnic. But his men occasionally sneaked across the frozen harbor and attacked British troops on Staten Island. The British hauled cannon across the ice from Manhattan to defend themselves.

&gt; WASHINGTON, an inveterate diary-keeper, has this entry for Jan. 6, 1780: “The snow which in general is 18 inches deep is much drifted — roads impassable.” He was apparently referring to the new snowfall from a major storm on that date, since other records indicate there was already close to four feet of snow on the ground.

&gt; “In the woods it lay at least four feet upon a level,” Jones wrote. “It was with the utmost difficulty that the farmers got their wood . . . All the wood upon New York Island was cut down. The forest trees planted in gardens, in court yards, in avenues, along lanes, and about the houses of gentlemen by way of ornament, shared the same fate. Quantities of apple trees, peach trees, plum trees, cherry trees, and pear trees, were also cut down.”

&gt; The New York Packet reported a thermometer reading of 16 below zero in the city. Current records of Central Park readings only go back to 1869, so this would beat the 15 below zero recorded in 1934. The severe cold reached up and down the coast, from Maine to Georgia. Ludlum says that the Connecticut Courant in Hartford provided the most complete temperature record. And, due to the lack of sophistication of the newspaper’s audience, the editor believed it was necessary to explain the nature of a thermometer and what its readings meant.

&gt; When springtime came, New York was depleted of wood. So on June 16, 1780, the new British governor, James Robertson, issued an order to “the inhabitants of Long Island” to furnish wood for the army barracks in the city, “to guard against the severities of a long winter.” Their quotas: Kings County, 1,500 cords; Queens, 4,500; western Suffolk, 3,000 cords. The inhabitants of Southold, East Hampton and Southampton were required to cut 3,000 cords from the Smith and Floyd estates at Mastic. They were to be paid at varying rates, but it is not clear whether payments were ever made.

I went there because I wanted to go to college in San Diego (initially to play soccer, but I didn't play soccer when I got there, I focused on course work instead). I didn't really even consider the stats on the nursing school, most people should, I'm fortunate that SDSU had a great program (super competitive to get into to, much sleep lost worrying about the admission process), was networked with all the hospitals in the area, and had an outstanding Nclex pass rate. 

Every nursing school will have it's pros and cons and every program will have good and bad professors/instructors. SDSU SON was not immune to this rule. I had a few teachers that broke some people out of my cohort unfairly, and there were some courses that I was better off learning from external resources, like podcasts, iTunes university, YouTube, and here on reddit, actually...sure it was frustrating at the time to feel pressured to seek out external resources to learn content they were SUPPOSED to be teaching, but I turned out to be better prepared with more current material, win win. 

My clinical placements were excellent. By luck of the draw among 7 contracted facilities, I remained with Sharp Facilities pretty much every semester but my pediatric course, the only pediatric hospital in SD is Radys, so I did my time there. I fell in love with sharp, and the more clinicals I had there in the different units I was placed, the more I felt like I was actually being trained to work as a nurse with a team that actually got to know me, as opposed to some students who floated all 7 facilities. Sure, they got variety, but I think my consistency allowed for me to actually experience what I could be expecting when I was due to be shot into the real world post-graduation. I basically lived at sharp hospitals for 2 and a half years between having clinicals there, taking a night -shift externship in the emergency department, and occasionally having to be a patient there (got in a car accident right before graduation). 

If I didn't already know I was going to move to Dallas after graduation, I would have fought like hell to stay in that facility. I loved it, and I have SDSU to thank. I miss it, and hopefully, one day, I might get to go back.  "

Some people *are* allergic to some inks.  Certain colors, red being the most common IIRC, are more prone to cause reactions.  Continue your aftercare as instructed, at this point just keep the tattoo out of the sun and the skin moisturized with soemthing like Lubriderm or similar ""neutral"" moisturizer and try to keep your stress levels down and diet, climate, etc as stable as possible.

And here: http://www.polishmeals.com/2013/07/potato-pancakes-thick-grate/

With some modifications. For example the herring salad called for pickles and onion but as the herring was pickled and packed with onion, I used some of those instead of pickles or fresh onion. The salad was good but strong!

Sausage was a cheat purchased from our neighbourhood Polish deli. 

The dipping sauce for the pancakes is mayo mixed with powdered curry (I know, pretty low-brow but all 3 of us love it!) and the veg was just Bok Choy because it was in my fridge. 

Overall cool and tasty experience - had never made anything close to this before!

Wisconsin has sort of been the always dangerous but never dominant team of the B1G, so we've seen our fair share of getting beat up in big games -- by MSU and OSU especially.

Barring catastrophe, Illinois is almost certainly a tournament team I think. So there's a lot to like about Groce and the crew.

http://www.medicinenet.com/circumcision_the_medical_pros_and_cons/article.htm#circumcision_medical_pros_and_cons_facts

This is exactly what I linked to.  In case you didn't know, see the following for the spelling of the word ""circumcision.""

&gt; makes no mention of circumcision

You need glasses?  It's on that very page.  I mean, did you really just make the argument that it made no mention of circumcision?  

Can I throw a glass of water in your face and have you tell me that it was not wet in the slightest?  

Can I then set you on fire, and put it out with more water, so you can tell me that the water did not, in fact extinguish the fire; it was a combination of happy thoughts and unicorn shit?!

Since I'm in a good mood, I'll provide **yet another** source to support my argument, even though you lack the mental coordination to do so yourself.  I will say, in advance, that this particular .PDF originates from an internationally recognized professional development source **for physicians.**  It is curated and maintained **by physicians.**  If you read it, you will notice many, **many cited sources for the information** presented within the text at the bottom of the paper.  

It specifically discusses medical benefits and risks associated with circumcision, yet does not promote or discourage the practice without performing a patient specific risk analysis, taking into account factors such as regional ethnic geography and patient risk for certain pre-existing conditions.  
 

http://sti.bmj.com/content/74/5/368.full.pdf+html

&gt; GM is wrong, if circumcision made men cum gold, and immune to all forms of disease it would not justify GM of infants.

That is your opinion.  That is not fact.  Opinion =/= Fact.  Ethics are subjective, and solely based upon the perception of the individual.  Thusly, while one can extol the virtues of a particular belief system, one cannot effectively proselytize and/or inflict their own values based judgement on others, without their own perversions of morality being called into question.  I gives a fuck about your opinion, son.  We all have one.  Argue FACTS.  

&gt; I bet you didn't even read your own ""source"".

I bet you're actually a primate on a typewriter, occasionally breaking up random chunks of garbled text with spaces and punctuation.  You're too busy flinging poo to form a rational argument.

This is the last wall of text you're gonna get from me.  If you cannot provide proof, you have nothing to offer to the discussion.  If you have nothing to add to the discussion, then don't reply.  If you do reply with more of your immature garbage, and do not provide supporting references, I will dismiss you as a person with a severe mental disability, and will treat you with ""kid gloves"" accordingly.

I have a younger friend (I'm old by this sub's standards) who spent his late high school years being a skinny nerd.

Dustl,civ,1389246042.0,"Gandhi, as well as 2 other Civs, chose the order Ideology, which is why my unhappiness is so high.  This game was very odd for me for a few reasons:

* Gandhi was a warmonger. Straight up, he almost wiped out Hiawatha, and he helped Hiawatha take out Montezuma very early on in the game.
* Gandhi expanded like crazy, although he didn't open Liberty.
* My first immortal game, but I'm surprised that Gandhi won cultural victory so early on
* Although Gandhi was at war with the rest of the world, everyone was still friendly to him. He had taken 3 cities throughout the game, and I had bribed him to go to war with Hiawatha 4 times.  Everyone was still friendly with him.  
* He was able to make DoF with Civs that he had made peace treaties with the turn before.
* Was allied with 8+ city states, and I had to beat 150+ influence in order to ally with them

I'm not sure where to improve my game except for getting the guilds up quicker, having better food for my cities, and being a little more war heavy.

I had:

* Libraries in all cities by turn 85
* NC up by turn 125 (was DoW by Monetzuma which delayed this for a bit)
* Took a detour to Machinery before Education (I was afraid of Hiawatha massing on my borders), though I don't remember what turn I got all of my public schools. Probably around turn 185 (which is late, I believe).
* Had 4 Research Agreements by this point already done, and 2 in progress
* Went Tradition fully, 3 into Patronage (to get the 25% science boost for each allied city state), 2 into Rationalism, and 2 into Freedom

Any tips on what I could have done? I was ahead in tech by quite a bit, but no where close enough to get the victory condition.

Additionally, Gandhi had allied with half of the city states (i had the other half), but I had to beat like 150+ influence to get allied with them.  I didn't have the funds for that at all at this point in the game. However, it's a moot point, because the game hadn't even reached World Leader voting yet.  "

AnimusHerb240,occult,1389246044.0,"It can be just as frustrating for those who feel close to it and have difficulty describing it as it is for those who are trying to find out but feel hampered by all the esoteric language and beating around the bush. And the nature of the process of description can seem, for the initiated, to strip so much of the message away as well as increase resistance from inquiring minds.

There are a lot of weird things an ""occultist"" could try to say concisely with the aim of reeling in seekers more efficiently, but I remember what encountering those things seemed like to me before I spent much time with any of this, so I remember firsthand the degree of fruitlessness in the initiated having tried to explain things to me in their terms. Forgive the analogy, but it is similar to an adult being unable to explain some life lesson to a child, who might even have formed exactly the right question to elucidate some truth they are trying to get closer to, but sometimes there is nothing for an adult to do but smile at them and tell them that they will come to understand in time through experience.

Many in this subreddit might frown upon my wording, and there's many in this subreddit whose wording doesn't sit quite right with me, either. I tend to think of different attempts at communication as different shaped keys, trying to fit in various shaped keyholes of the heads of those receiving the message. The keys that I say might not fit into your keyhole (not that it would keep me from trying my best to explain).

A great analogy is humor and jokes. If I were to tell you point blank to your face, ""Blonde people are stupid,"" it probably wouldn't make you laugh, you probably wouldn't enjoy the experience, you would probably get nothing from it except maybe contempt for my character. But if I lay out a myth for you to chew on, set up a scene, describe some characters, then deliver a punchline, then I've got the proper formula for a ""blonde joke"". I have to set it up in such a way that you understand the situation, and then let you connect the dots for yourself between the setup and the punchline. If you can't connect the dots yourself, then there is no enjoyment of the joke, and your enjoyment of my joke was my whole initial intention.

Occult literature is like a certain kind of joke, but the ""punchline"" is you getting closer to something unnameable that an occultist would posit is ""worth getting closer to"".

There's an esoteric depth to everything—any given trade/skill, music, math, teaching, athletic endeavors—and what I think is cool about studying ""the occult"" a.k.a. ""the hidden"" is that it sort of helps unlock that ""hidden"" aspect of all of those aforementioned things. Music and science and philosophy and math and literature seem *different* to me than they did a few years ago, even when I thought myself quite adept at the time. My problems, my family, my career, my outlook on life, as well.

All we can do is suggest different literature and disciplines so that the curious can do the Work for themselves and reap the rewards. I would say it is unfortunate that I have not written an occult text myself that I can shove into your hands and make you read, but since we live in the digital age, one might consider this very subreddit a living document, the beginning of a new flavor of occult literature in and of itself that can benefit from the dynamics of the hivemind (as well as suffer from its pitfalls).

Well, I've begun to ramble now. I am reading Crowley's *Eight Lectures on Yoga* and recommend it highly. He eventually gets at the notion that ""yoga"" and ""magick"" are synonymous in a sense, so don't be thrown by the title if it happens to mistakenly conjure the image of a bunch of folks getting together on rubber mats to stick their butts in the air while listening to soothing music."

And no, he hasn't cheated. He has done a few [small] things that make me not trust him but nothing that will make me break up with him. 

A question about your relationship if you don't mind, during the four years you have been with your girlfriend, was there any time where you guys were apart for a long time?

I want to live and live well. I want to take care of my body. I love myself. So I decided that I'm not dieting to lose weight I'm changing my lifestyle so I have a better life. My suggestion is to love yourself and promise yourself that you'll take care of you. Hold yourself accountable. (I know easier said than done but I am currently doing this and I have a new found since of pride). 

If you just have someone push you then what will happen when they aren't there anymore? What if you just do what you are told and just go with the motions and do not learn anything from it? 
Perhaps find someone that'll join you in your weight loss, not just a coach.  Someone that will diet with you and learn with you. Teach each other portion sizes, how to tract food, what foods are good to eat... actually doing it yourself makes it more of a new way of life instead of a temporary thing. 

Sorry I don't have anything for you and don't know how to get in touch with the biggest loser.

&gt;Nena solo estuve, triste y sin nada amar, no podía entender el por qué otros me atacaban, libre quería estar con criaturas similares, pero ahora sé, ahora sé que soy un pez gay (pez gay)

&gt; (Pez gay Yo) un maldito pez gay (soy un pez Yo) follando otros peces (todo bien nena) haciéndoles el amor gay.

&gt;Esas noches solas en el supermercado, queriendo meterla en los peces congelados, viviendo una mentira aunque todos sabían cuál era mi ley (pez gay) y ahora sé que soy un pez gay (pez gay)

&gt;(Pez gay Yo) un maldito pez gay (soy un pez Yo) follando otros peces (ahora sé quien soy nena) haciéndoles el amor gay.

&gt;Antes me asustaba aceptar mi realidad, solía ocultar que iba al club gay a pescar, bailando con marlines, enrollándome con pargos, yendo a casa con salmones y dándonos mimos largos, pero he salido ya y me quiero liberar, con róbalos y atunes en Vermont al azar; muchas nalgadas dar, traseros agitando, teniendo una orgía en tu maldito acuario (acuario, acuario)

&gt;Un maldito pez gay (soy un pez Yo) follando otros peces (ahora sé quien soy nena) haciéndoles el amor gay.

&gt;Me encanta parrandear, soy la puta del mar, ladillas no me dan sino cangrejos de verdad, cenando macarena no pude contener mi impulso de follarla y que viera al rey, al rey mas gay de los peces gay.

&gt;Un maldito pez gay (soy un pez Yo) follando otros peces (ahora sé quien soy nena)

&gt;Me debo controlar, una zorra no soy, no puedo solo follar a donde sea que voy, me encontré un amante, un lucio travesti que es de Monterrey, y juntos somos peces gay

&gt;Un maldito pez gay (soy un pez Yo) nena soy un pez gay (ahora sé quien soy nena) haciendo el amor de pez gay (pez gay, pez gay, pez gay, pez gay, pez gay, pez gay)

The literal translation:

&gt;He estado tan solo, nena, he estado tan triste y decaído, no podía entender por qué los cabrones bromeaban a mi alrededor, quería ser libre con otras criaturas como yo Y se cumplió mi deseo, porque sé que soy un pez gay (pez gay)

 &gt;(Pez gay yo) maldito pez gay (Soy un pez Yo) dándole a un pez gay (está bien, nena) haciéndole el amor a otros peces gay

&gt;Todas esas noches solitarias en el supermercado en el pasillo del pescado congelado sintiéndome como una zorra porque no estaba siendo honesto aunque todos decían que tenía que hacer un cambio (pez gay) ahora sé que soy un pez gay (pez gay)

&gt;Maldito pez gay (Soy un pez Yo) dándole a un pez gay (está bien, nena) haciéndole el amor a otros peces gay

&gt;Solía estar asustado, negando quién era, actuando hetero pero luego saliendo a los clubs de peces gay, bailando con los marlines, enrollándome con todos los pargos, me llevaba un salmón y trabajando en esas aletas mimosas porhoras. Pero ahora he salido y soy libre para amar lo que quiera, sea aleta amarilla o róbalo o aquella trucha en Vermont, nalgueé ese holandés, sacudí el trasro de ese mero, vendré a tu casa y tendré una orgía en tu maldito acuario (acuario, acuario)

&gt;Maldito pez gay (Soy un pez Yo) dándole a un pez gay (está bien, nena) haciéndole el amor a otros peces gay

&gt;En serio salgo mucho, soy la zorra del mar, cuando digo que tengo cangrejos lo digo literalmente* estaba cenando y simplemente tenía que entrar en esa macarena en el plato, porque soy el más gay de los peces gay (pez gay)

&gt;Maldito pez gay (Soy un pez Yo) dándole a un pez gay (está bien, nena) haciéndole el amor a otros peces gay

&gt;Pero me tengo que establecer, no puedo ser una perra, no voy sólo a dormir con cualquier pez, ya no más, me encontré un amante, un hermano que es un lucio travesti llamado Trish, y juntos somos peces gay (pez gay)

&gt; (Pez gay Yo) Maldito pez gay (soy un pez Yo) dándole a un pez gay (ahora sé quien soy nena) haciendo el amor con otro pez gay (pez gay, pez gay, pez gay, pez gay, pez gay, pez gay)

tattedspyder,tattoos,1389246259.0,"The internet is your best friend right now.

If you have vague ideas rattling around in your head start searching through images.  You'll find stuff you either want to use or can use as inspiration.  Start saving, printing, sketching, build up a collection of images that you want to use/incorporate/draw from for your tattoo.

While you're doing that search the parlors and artists in your area.  Most places have websites now and most artists post their portfolios somewhere online.  Look at reviews, portfolios, etc.  Find a shop and artist with a good reputation and a portfolio you like and go talk to them, see how your interaction goes, see what the vibe in the parlor is, find out if it feels like a good fit.

If all of that seems good then bring your bundle of inspiration to the artist.  Sit down and talk to them, bounce ideas around, go back and forth.  Remember that, while you do have the final say on what goes on your body, the artist has been doing this for years and knows what they are talking about.  They have every right to offer advice and you should listen.  

If at the end of all that you end up with a design, artist, and price that you feel happy with you just need to schedule your tattoo."

Thjoth,anime,1389246392.0,"I've been trying to figure out how to make them work for a while, and unfortunately I don't think there's any reliable way to contain a .454 Casull in any kind of a 1911 platform, no matter how heavily modified.  Well, unless your goal is to effectively create a grenade, then I suppose it would work. 

The only semi-auto handgun design I've ever seen that managed to contain this level of power is the [Wildey pistol](http://i.imgur.com/YZYhcLQ.jpg) and it has nothing in common with a 1911 except for the general control scheme.  The ones chambered in the proprietary .475 Wildey Magnum cartridge are hurling a 250gr (16g) projectile downrange at nearly twice the speed of sound and producing 1,900 ft-lb (2,600 J) of energy at the muzzle.  This is almost exactly the same energy produced by the .454 Casull.  This is also very close to the amount of energy produced by a full sized rifle cartridge being fired from a full sized rifle.  I love big bores, I mean a lot, but even I know that the people cramming these things into handguns are lunatics.  My kind of lunatics, but lunatics nonetheless.

Aside from all that, .454 being a rimmed revolver cartridge, getting it to actually feed properly would be a bitch as well.  My only experience with a rimmed autoloader was a guy's Desert Eagle in .44 mag, and it was horrendously unreliable.

So, it's unfortunate, but I don't think these could be made to work."

blahtender,buildapc,1389246779.0,"Wow... I don't know who told you that there's no better CPU for gaming than an i3, but as stated in that thread, the i5 is better. The Haswell i3's won't bottleneck any current video cards, nvidia nor AMD. The Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge i3's will bottleneck the highest-end cards, and they are not better than an 8320, except maybe if you're playing Skyrim or Starcraft. I didn't expect the performance gap to be this big when Haswell first came out, but I've been pretty impressed with the difference. 

The FX-8320 also doesn't seem to have any issues running alongside even the highest end cards, but they do generate more heat, and require more power than an i3 or an i5. Since AMD's heat syncs are generally loud and mediocre, a lot of people end up deciding to spend more money on an aftermarket cooler. People see this as an argument for Intel, because their coolers are a little more up to snuff, and unless you're overclocking, they're fine. 

If you're wondering why people would recommend a dual core i3 over a quad-core 8320 (which I would only recommend a Haswell i3 over it), it's because Intel's cores are just that much more efficient in most applications. 

In metaphorical terms we can use a very nerdy D and D situation: 

An AMD 8320 is like 4 humans hammering out 4 longswords on 4 anvils.

A Haswell i3 is like 2 dwarfs hammering out the same 4 longswords on 2 anvils.

The dwarfs finish first, because they're better at that kind of work (they also think they're crappy swords, but that doesn't matter in this metaphore). 

There are a number of applications and games that the 8320 will handle better, but for the most part, the Haswell i3 is a little better and doesn't get as hot."

JonWood007,lostgeneration,1389246848.0,"Eh, I think the $6k a year thing is too low.

As you probably know from r/basicincome, my own UBI plan involves $10-15k a year, with 32-40% tax rates across the board to pay for it (including capital gains and corporate....most loopholes eliminated). This assumes perfect tax collection rates, but is doable if we have around a 2.6 trillion budget otherwise (assuming universal healthcare, with all other programs eliminated). 

The tax is flat of course, and while at first glance this might seem unfair to the working poor, they actually get a great deal. Keep in mind that:

1) Everyone recieves UBI

2) UBI eliminates the welfare trap

3) High tax rates claw back the benefits in an equitable way.

Say you make min wage and earn $15k a year. Well, you pay 40% of that, which is $6k, and then add a $15k UBI. So you end up making a total of $24k. This is the equivalent of raising the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour, and that's AFTER taxes. Middle class would see less of a difference. A single income making $40k a year would pay in $16k, and get $15k back...meaning they'd pay in a total of $1k, or 2.5% federal taxes. Someone who is rich would pay a lot more, since the current top effective rate is like 23% (way too low IMO), while it would now be almost 40%. So they get a lot more of the tax burden. But hey, since the job creators aren't creating jobs, since the wealth isn't trickling down, etc., I say we make it trickle down, and this would be less harmful than a standard wage increase anyway since the taxes would be based on peoples' ability to pay, while a min wage increase could put people in the red.

Some people think that 40% capital gains/corporate tax rates would be devastating to the economy, but the data seems conflicting on that subject, and given the craptons of misinformation about tax rates' actual effects on the rich, I'd suspect at the very least that this may be a scare tactic. After all, other first world countries have high effective rates in the 30s and don't seem to experience a lot of problems."
