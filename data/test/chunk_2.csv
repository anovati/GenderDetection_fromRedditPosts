Maybe later you can have that discussion but just try to keep your reasons vague for the time being. Trying to ""discredit"" her religion at this stage will probably only create a distracted and hostile conversation. Instead focus on how you are still a good person with good morals and that is because of how she raised you. You are still her child, who loves her very much and appreciates all the sacrifices she has made to raise you into the man/woman you are today. 

At some point you may also want to ask her what personally convinces her that Christianity is right and why she still believes. Don't do it to argue her views, because that will be impossible as it will most likely be something along the lines of ""I can just tell or feel it in my heart"" etc. Just keep quiet and listen carefully. Hopefully it will get her to honestly question her convictions and give you a better understanding of why she believes.

Kyokushin_Dude,AskReddit,1388622708.0,"In my experience, a few things you will want on an extended trip abroad:

1.  Double-check that your bank/credit cards know you will be traveling.  May I suggest opening an account that does not charge foreign exchange fees?  It will save you potentially hundreds of dollars on a trip.

2.  Plug converters are very important if you are traveling abroad in a country that does not use your type of plug.

3.  Bring any medication you use on a regular basis with you, even if it's domestic.  It's no fun running out and trying to find a decongestant or deodorant in an unfamiliar place. Furthermore, bring a list of medications you may want/need and try to find out the local equivalents in that country. 

4.  I always make an itinerary with local information so I don't have to hunt around for things to see/do when I get there.  Saves time and money when you get to your destination.

5.  Check to see if your cellular data/voice rates change while traveling.  

6.  A hat.  Odds are you will be outdoors more when you are traveling.  A hate will save you some misery.  

7.  If you are traveling abroad, a dictionary is helpful for looking up basic words.  

8.  Consulate/embassy info on-hand in case something goes south.

9.  Are you flying for longer than a few hours?  Rent a few movies on a tablet or on a computer so you have something to watch on the plane.

10.  Leave some extra space in your bag so you have room for souvenirs.  If you pack your bags to the brim on the way out, you'll have a hard time bringing anything home. 

A few other things that have saved my butt on trips:  have backup plans with hotels if possible.  I've had hostels and even hotels cancel reservations on me.  Having a few ideas for backups in your mind can only help, and costs you maybe a few minutes of planning at home.

Local GPS-based map apps can be a lifesaver, but try to get ones that don't require data.  

Comfortable shoes.  This so many times.  Your feet will suffer if you don't bring a good pair of comfortable shoes.  "
Duckylicious,vegetarian,1388622711.0,"Congrats! Well done on you.

I too had to fight an uphill struggle against my mother when I decided to become vegetarian in 8th grade, and it was a gradual process (I kept eating fish and seafood as a compromise until I was 17 and said ""enough"", and didn't start paying attention to things like gelatin until much later - 90s Germany didn't come with a ""suitable for vegetarians"" label, heh), but eventually people do come around, at least if they've got even an inkling of an open mind.

The longer you stick with it, the more they realize you're serious about it and not just doing a picky fad thing to piss everyone off. And eventually, most people realize there's still plenty of stuff you can eat and you are neither starving yourself into an anemic creature, nor making it impossible to cook for you. 

Hell, I'm vegetarian and my partner has food allergies (as well as some very strong dislikes), and we've been managing to do an alternating weekly dinner party thing with a couple of omnivores for over a year and still get excited over what to cook next."

bigwoody,Seahawks,1388622795.0,"How do we know it's Pete helping DB adjust?

I feel like you don't become an OC in the NFL if you're completely incapable of making adjustments - one example comes in radio commentary.

In the last game, the Rams decided to take away the naked bootleg. When we left the backside DE unblocked, he charged upfield to hit Russell if he kept the ball. Bevell adjusted by no longer calling bootlegs, letting Marshawn cut back into the vacated space (notice he had a big day).

The radio commentators were asking later what Bevell could have done to open up the bootleg again, since Wilson often gets big plays from the bootleg, that Bevell should have found a way to get it working again!

This understanding is wrong - the bootleg was simply taken away, all we could do was punish them for pushing the DE upfield. The adjustment wasn't obvious, but it was effective.

Why is this important? Sometimes it seems like Bevell isn't doing anything - we aren't running, and Wilson is struggling, why aren't we running? Sometimes it's because they have 8 in the box and a bear front forcing us to single block their best defender, and the answer is to try and open up the quick passing game. If that doesn't work, sometimes commentators expect some sort of coaching magic - the players still need to execute.

Sorry for rambling, hopefully the point I was trying to make is getting across."

I loved that we were actually gathering useful information that you could use as part of your free-form assassination attempt - and you didn't have to get it all, but you could if you wanted.  Getting a map of a castle with guard routes on it and things like that - you can plan your approach ahead of time.

mr_fishy,ainbow,1388623302.0,"Those sorts of issues aren't inherent to polygamous relationships, however. Also, not all polygamy is polygyny (multiple women with one male partner) - there are also historical situations in which polyandry was common and in fact beneficial.

Really, though, in Western patriarchal society, marriage PERIOD is oppressive to women. So as we improve marriage in general, polygamous marriages are improved.

Plus, I really don't see the point in arguing that because something is harder or more complicated we shouldn't do it. Of course poly relationships require more effort and are more complicated than relationships with only two people. Large extended families also tend to be more difficult to manage and more complex than families with single or no children. That doesn't mean people shouldn't have five or six kids if they have the means, or that three or more generations of a family can't live together. There are plenty of situations in which poly groups are just as good or even better than the ""traditional"" nuclear family, despite being more complex. To use an analogy, if we were talking about math you wouldn't say that we shouldn't teach calculus to anyone because it's more complicated and harder than simple addition, would you?

Really this isn't a matter of something being bad because it's complicated, it's a matter of everyone doing what's right for them. For some people, that happens to be polyamory and polygamy. For others, it's monogamy."

It's sort of like Kim Jong Il. According to official (North Korean government) accounts, this guy has performed some superhuman feats: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/8965150/Kim-Jong-ils-greatest-achievements.html .... it wouldn't be that intellectually challenging for future historians to dismiss these outlandish claims while still acknowledging his historical existence.

Omega037,relationships,1388623670.0,"If you get cheated on, you get cheated on.  Being insecure about it won't prevent it from happening, though it could make it more likely if it causes her to be unhappy.

Thus, you have to just trust them and be the best boyfriend possible.  At least then you can say you gave it your all and have no regrets.

In terms of actually reducing the chances of getting cheated on, look for girls with different behavior patterns than your previous exes that seem safer.  The girl who likes to get smashed at the bar and flirt with guys is probably more likely to cheat than the quiet bookworm.

Also, establish clear boundaries early in the relationship and stick to them.  If texting other guys or spending the night alone at another guy's house is a problem, then tell her that.  Then if she does those things, end it.  A lot of times a person who cheats was someone who was allowed to get away with a lot of iffy acts earlier on.

Billtodamax,fireemblem,1388623696.0,"Yeah right after New Year's Eve seems like a great time to play FE7. Definitely not going to need to restart a whole bunch.

CHAPTER 11: Lol they sent a soldier to assassinate hector. Myrmidons too expensive for you?

Anyway this map looks fairly awful. Luckily I trained Matthew a whole bunch in Lyn's story, so he can help Hector reasonably competently. I roll through the level reasonably comfortably despite my expectations, cursing Hector's skill and the handaxe's accuracy several times against the archers, only burning through 1 vulnerary which I make up for by stealing the archer's. Then I wolf beil the shit out of the boss and Hector gains strength for the third level in a row. One track mind there buddy.

Lord Uther shows that he knows exactly what his brother's like, then sends Oswin along to keep him safe which honestly is probably overkill.

CHAPTER 12: Oswin brings Serra along with him, which is awesome she's the funniest character in this game. Shame she competes with Priscilla and Lucius for a party spot and thus will never see use unless she really knocks it outta the fuckin' park with her levels.

Marcus ambles over to the village and I wonder to myself why I thought it was a good idea not to train Dorcas in Lyn's Route. I manage to clean up the enemies around their area without using Marcus anyway, so that's fine.

I lure Zagan into Eliwood on a fort so he can level up but he gains literally only health so I don't know why I bother. Meanwhile Hector misses a bandit on like 65% shots for 4 turns straight so I don't get to give Serra any exp 'cause the map ends.

Bill the tactician catches up with Matthew and Serra, Hector gives us a stern look, map end.

CHAPTER 13: Marquis Santaruz proves that he doesn't have the courage to finish what he started and Guy loudly talks about how to recruit him.

I send Oswin and Hector left to grab the village and kill the boss, while everyone else pushes towards Guy to recruit him. Rebecca nearly dies because she's frail as hell but she dodges a 64% so it's all good.

Guy is a total bitch to recruit just because of the sheer unit spam I have to contest with, and the fact that I can't turtle up with Marcus cause I need to get to the village. I end up having Marcus tank the killing edge blows to the face twice (he isn't critted! hooray) before killing off the bandits and pulling back to deal with the units. Matthew ends up with 1 solitary hit point after Guy is recruited but hey it's not dead.

Meanwhile team Metal Gear Solid have been fucking cruising through their section of the map. Probably should not have sent Oswin, but he busts down the tree stumps with one iron lance blow so it saved a lot of time.

Oswin ends up assaulting the bridge force from behind because none of those enemies can actually deal damage to him while Serra spams the shit out of her heal staff. Hector meanwhile finishes off a stray archer and heads for the boss.

The boss is basically built for hector being dropped on him, so I do that. I start sorta vaguely thinking about supports at this point then realise that basically none of these units are gonna be there come endgame. I will want HectorxOswin at least to B though, so I start that.

Marquis Helman shows us he's a total coward who'll sell out his allies if they do a little thing like murder him when he wusses out of killing a couple guys.

CHAPTER 13x: Yaaaaay fog. At least we get Merlinus out of this - he's just awesome. I don't think I could possibly play through this game without him. Hector asks Eliwood if he'd sleep with Lyn and he gets super embarrassed and changes the subject to the merchant that's under attack.

I immediately start with Marcus picking up Merlinus and win the chapter. Seriously, the hardest thing about this chapter is the optional objectives. I have Bartre, Dorcas and Guy go down and left while Matthew goes by himself over to the forest down and right to lure the bandits and nomads.

Marcus tanks the shit out of like all of the  myrmidons who probably could have killed Eliwood if they all charged him but they didn't so I kill them off gradually. Lowen heads over to the village to grab some much needed money, and Oswin tries to murder Puzon but doesn't crit on the last turn so I miss out on the kill.

This is the first time this map has gone anywhere near this smoothly. I think it's probably because my Matthew's pretty levelled, so he can more easily handle the things I ask him to.

Anyway Hector's a dick to Merlinus but he joins us anyway.

CHAPTER 14: Haha these guys are so cartoonishly evil. We discover their shitty little ambush and get to fighting. I'm leaving Guy and Dorcas behind to guard Merlinus - Dorcas because I'm not going to be using him, and Guy because I don't have a spare sword for him so he's wasting his killing edge. Matthew, Bartre, Hector, Serra, and Rebecca head directly left to recruit Erk, while Marcus runs as fast as he can directly to Priscilla's village, weaponless, to get her. Eliwood, Lowen, and Oswin all amble towards the center of the map.

Marcus eventually reaches his village but he has a cavalier following him so he can't recruit Priscilla yet. Erk team recruit him really easily while Lowen and Eliwood almost die fighting like 2 pirates down south. Oswin has started walking at the horsemen around Erik.

Erik then freaks out and asks for reinforcements and Ephidel turns out to be not a very nice person, what a shocker.

I have Oswin solo basically all the horsemen in the middle except when Erik starts to get low he drags him up to hector so I can kill him with Rebecca. This involves having Oswin block the path to Serra, who spams heals at a weaponless Hector while Rebecca plinks Erik for 2 damage a turn.

Meanwhile Marcus still hasn't recruited Priscilla because this horseman is still there, plinking away at him. I finally get Lowen and Eliwood down to provide her a safe place to stand when she's recruited.

Then I go back to support grinding while Marcus stands there getting nicked to death. I let him get down to 3 hp before Eliwood starts ramming a rapier up his arse. Unfortunately Oswin and Hector must not be feeling chatty because I don't get my B-rank.

So apparently Rebecca captured Erik with a bow and arrow. That's cool. Oswin bugs Hector about returning to Ostia (why are you even bothering guy) then he declares his undying love for Hector.

Post over, everyone go home."

According to the explanation on the [source site](http://zerotaka.web.fc2.com/houraiindex.html), it was originally built by the public sector in 1971 and operated as a nationally-owned, prefecture-run resort. After about 10 years of unsuccessful run, the operation was outsourced to a private company which could not turn it around and eventually bankrupted in 1998.  
  
From the bits and pieces of information on the site, the resort was ill-conceived from the beginning: heavy snow closed the access road making the resort nonoperational for several months every year (this happens at several ski resorts in Japan which has [the heaviest snow fall in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ibuki#Nature)); it was out of the power grid and its generator was not able to provide stable enough power even for TV.  You might ask why did they develop the resort in the first place then. Well, there was a sulphur mine nearby that shut down in 1969 and the resort seems to have been built to create alternative employment to the region."

You like, dick, you like men. Fucking cool. But how come you because you like dick all of a sudden you have to have to act like a wimp?

I've traveled quite a bit, and most gays abroad are indistinguishable from hetero men. Seriously. There is generally no fashion difference between the heteros and the homos -- from fashion to speech. I remember many times over thinking some guys where gay who were actually straight, and other guys who were gay but didn't find out for days after knowing them. Yet, here in the states all of a sudden gays feel like they must become some sort of victim with their own little special snowflake culture. I don't get it. You're gay, you like men, but you still have a dick between your legs -- why do you all of a sudden have to act fucking annoying?

I don't mean to rant, but fucking christ, every time I come back to the USA i get the same feeling.

Morgs_huw,AskMen,1388623880.0,"Age thing, I date a lot and nearly all girls in the 19-22 range fall way to quick and get far to caught up in something that is nothing. I think there is a far greater expectation and desire in younger women to have a BF, not necessarily to meet a great guy, just to have a BF.

Women 24+ seem to be more grounded and relaxed, they still want to meet someone, but they dont just want a BF, they want a great guy.

Maybe you need to have a more solid idea of what it is you want, then you wont let fantasies get in the way. Unless what you want is a fantasy"

VT-Sensational,paradoxplaza,1388624135.0,"&gt;If you're trying to conquer Europe getting a colonist instead of +10% disciple(or whatever) no matter what you do is kind of bad.

Sure, but it doesn't really dictate anything as far as singleplayer goes.

Multiplayer is another story.

&gt;No, it is not sustainable to only pick diplomatic ideas, or to only pick military ideas.

Which only limits you in very specific cases, like if you want a nation that's colonizing, trading, vassalizing and sustaining a massive fleet, all at the same time.

Going for an all out diplomatic game as Austria, for example, means you're picking up espionage and aristocracy too, instead of the colonization idea groups.

Sure, you could pick any ideas you wanted in EU3 because there was no resource system to contend with, but straight up picking all the ideas from a single tree isn't a very effective strategy anyways. The monarch points system doesn't detract from freedom, it merely adds actual choices where there were none before. Do you spend your points on this, or that? As opposed to not having any points to spend to begin with."

griffer00,AskAcademia,1388624138.0,"The ""marketing and PR"" work done by some scientists is straight-up misleading at times. For example, this article:

http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/blog/2013/08/28/a-major-cause-of-age-related-memory-loss-identified/

&gt;“Until now, however, no one has been able to identify specific molecular defects involved in age-related memory loss in humans.""

This is a direct quote from one of the study's authors. However, this is a misleading description of the study. The authors looked at one candidate marker -- out of perhaps dozens identified in contemporary research -- in one brain region in mice. They're able to get away with this because Kandel -- one of the forefathers of modern neurophysiology -- was involved. It looks bad to criticize a Nobel Laureate, so I doubt anybody will seriously call them out for it. No matter your field (business, academia, whatever) you will get backlash for badmouthing the boss.

Science has trouble admitting that it is plagued by the same biases that are a natural phenomenon in any other human endeavor. For instance, most fields of study are small enough such that some peer reviewers can tell which researcher they are reviewing based on subject matter and/or writing style alone (defeats one intended purpose of peer review). It's not uncommon for a reviewer in your field to suggest that you include a nod to his/her own research in the discussion section (you can appeal it and say no, so it ""doesn't hurt to ask""). Concerning grants, research is often funded simply based on who is on the review committee: a grant that scores well one year might score terribly the next. Or, a funded researcher with a mediocre idea is more likely to get funding than a non-funded researcher with a great idea. However, there are few researchers who will openly admit that these supposed bias checks don't work the way they theoretically should. Instead, scientists commiserate with each other about these woes  in private, if at all, over beers.

For lack of a better phrase, I would call it ""soft dishonesty."" Science likes to pretend it doesn't happen, or that it has worked out contingencies for when it does... whereas similar processes are accepted in the business world for what they are (e.g. marketing, networking, posturing)."

You need experts to a degree. The key is to keep those experts in check, and to find a way where they hear the views of ALL people, not a select few who can buy themselves an audience.

lamblikeawolf,infj,1388624449.0,"Kind of. It depends on the person I am dealing with.

It is my general policy to be as up-front with people as possible. I can't stand mind games, or coy little whatevers. I am not telepathic, and I never want to make anyone else feel as if they have to be. This works pretty well, because the majority of my friends are the same way, and I have enough tact (or at least it seems to be the case) that anything negative that would come out isn't said hurtfully.

However, if I don't feel that the other person is going to be supportive of my feelings, then I withdraw. Like with my sister. She doesn't listen to me (never has), and will feel like anything I have to say is an attack. She needs some serious help, and I didn't appreciate her shit-talking of me at Thanksgiving. I don't appreciate her overjustification about her drinking (before she was pregnant, while she was pregnant, while she is breastfeeding...) But I won't tell her about that, or anything else that bothers me. I've stopped going over to my mom's house (she lives with our mom), except for very specific occasions, like holidays, and to jailbreak my brother, because sometimes his car is broken.

I think one way to deal with this is to, instead of hiding your feelings, be blunt with people. ""I wanted to talk about something that happened the other day. You may not have meant X when you did Y, but that is how I took it. I would like to discuss this with you so that we can both understand each other better."" At some point, you will recognize it at the same moment that it is happening, and you will be able to have the discussion then. Remember, you have to be open to their feelings and explanations in the same way that they must be open to yours. If you can't do that, work with yourself about that. Start internally recognizing when you're holding others' to different standards of your own.

If they can't do that, withdrawing may not be the worst thing in the world. I realize that our society tends to try to make people get along and be all ""kumbaya"" with everyone, however, some people are just toxic. Learning to recognize when people are not good for you is an important skill, and it doesn't make you a bad person when you ""doorslam"" someone because of that."

That said, if at the end of the day you just don't think you can get over the idea of him having been with someone else, then there isn't much that can be done.

Also, he would need to show his commitment to not letting this happen again, by being willing to do something like not drink anymore (or at least not get drunk)."
VoxMeretricis,sex,1388624455.0,"First of all, I think you're justified. I don't think that you're going to be able to change her mind, and frankly I don't really know that trying to change her mind would be a legitimate thing to do - people have certain sexual boundaries, and if this is one of hers, then you should respect that.

However, I'm trying to think about how I would feel if a man was grossed out by my sex juices, and frankly I would be offended. I'm healthy and clean and if a guy didn't like my wetness I'd start feeling self-conscious about what is a perfectly natural part of sex. 

A few suggestions: would she be wiling to go on some kind of BC in order to double up on protection against pregnancy? That would help you feel more comfortable coming inside her.

Second, tell her how her come-aversion makes you feel and see if she's willing to give you some other kind of validation when you're having sex or coming. Okay, so come itself grosses her out - she should be counteracting that self consciousness that I think is a pretty natural reaction on your part by telling you how sexy you are in general, and how awesome it is you two can share pleasure together. There are plenty of ways to get around her aversion to come without making you feel less desired. 

Finally, there are ways to come on her without actually getting your come literally on her. She'll probably never let you come on her face - and that's her right, and you should respect that - but try having her wear a high-waisted pair of pantyhose, rip the crotch open for sex, and come all over her ass while it's ""protected"" by the pantyhose. Go out and buy her a cheap bra with lots of coverage, and come all over that instead of her skin. It's not exactly the same as coming on her bare skin, but it's a good compromise. "

In the majority of places, a car is a necessity if you need to get anywhere outside of walking distance, which means that a person who isn't allowed a drivers license probably did something really bad to be denied one. 

Believe me, I'd love to just hop a train everywhere, but the cost to make that possible in the entire country would be insane. I really don't see why you're getting so aggressive about the transportation options of a country you've clearly never set foot in."

TV has a predestined time and frequency its traveling on with packets pre-made (?) To be a specific piece of that channel, no buffering is required its all there just needs to be expanded (all the packets put in the correct order) . 

Internet is quite different, there is a lot of delay. Tons of ""hops"" between backbone routers make multipul milisecond additions per packet thatis being transfered back and forth from u to youtube. 

You also need to consider 2 things.1 is tcp/udp. The other is QOS. 

TCP/UDP is 2 separate ways to send packets. With TCP all packets are sent, then the sender waits for a conformation. If a packet was lost or takes too long to get to its destination then the missing packets are resent. This adds a considerable amount of extra time onto loading. We call this buffering. That grey bar on youtube is the packets inline for the video already known about. This is ment to make the video look better not make it faster. If u had the option of useing UDP u would have very little buffering but sometimes voice will be behind the video, or clips of the video will disapear, or the player will only play voice or video, bc the sender (youtubes servers) only send the packets, they do nothing to make sure you are getting ur packets. 

QOS is Quality of Service. This is a simple protocol that says ""traffic that is voice gets priority 1, traffic that is http gets priority 2"". Everything on the internet is thrown together as a big http or https (which it is possible to further pick this appart). So ur tv channels get a higher priority of traffic then ur internet traffic. Like as an example 3 packets of tv info then 1 of http. 


So with a combo of these, youtube sends u higher quality but slower packets, and ur isp throttling ur connection, and youtube throttling ur connection u end up with shit for quality. 

Im really sorry if this dosnt make since to u, my english isnt the greatest and in typeing this on a phone. If u need more indepth info in happy to assist u or anyone. I have a lot of experience with this stuff but its been a few years.  "

I feel that I should name my coffee cup because we have such an intimate relationship, but I'm not sure what I'd name it, or what gender it would be. It'd have to be something *sexy*. Maybe *""Natasha""*.

My gramma's middle name is Savon, because she was born under the kitchen table and her parents couldn't think of anything and the wallpaper said ""Savon"" on it. They thought it sounded nice. So, my gramma's middle name came off of wallpaper and means ""soap"".

Delts28,AskReddit,1388625042.0,"I've got a few more things that I'd add here after seeing you're off to Japan and that it is a longer trip.

1) Not sure where you're from but check your electronics in case they'll need a voltage converter as well as the normal socket converter.  Whilst some things like laptops have their own transformers which will normally be fine you could seriously damage other goods, especially if you're coming from Europe.

2) A comfortable bag, I prefer messenger bags personally since I can keep an arm over it but if you're out sightseeing all day you need something that is comfortable and not a pain to access frequently.

3) A reusable water bottle, I have one on a carabiner that I clip to my bag.  Nothing worse than walking round and starting to get dehydrated in the early afternoon.  You can of course use a normal plastic bottle but I like being able to clip it somewhere.

4) Look up how to make reverse charge calls from Japan.  Hopefully useless info but could make a real difference if the worst happens.  Knowing how to do this in Malaysia would have saved me the horror of trying to Skype on a laptop in the middle of a very noisy McDonalds.  Not fun.

5) Take plenty of cash and don't rely on bank cards.  Despite telling my bank every time I travel where and when I'll be abroad they've cancelled at least one of my cards.  Take precautions with the money like not keeping it all in one place, but don't go too overboard and worry about it too much.

6) You need less shoes than you think.  I always over pack on this one despite knowing I'll only wear two pairs at most anyway.  Trainers and walking shoes should do 99% of situations anyway.

7) A recently written guide book.  Whilst apps and the internet are great for looking up places on the go, a good guide book will never need data or batteries.  For the first 24 hours in Japan neither my phone or kindle could pick up signal for some reason.

I'd also agree with everything [u/Kyokushin_Dude](http://www.reddit.com/user/Kyokushin_Dude) said.  One thing I would say with regards to medication though is always take a prescription for any meds you take with you.  If it is not prescribed check its legality for where you're going."

Orelle,history,1388625147.0,"""A People's History"" is a great suggestion, so I'll add a different take on this challenge. My background is somewhat similar to both yours and your friend's, so I'm thinking of books that helped me gain a more balanced critical appreciation of our country. 

For the whole historical shebang, I'd suggest something by [Daniel J. Boorstin](http://www.goodreads.com/author/list/10378.Daniel_J_Boorstin), perhaps from his ""[The Americans](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/913587.The_Americans_Vol_2)"" trilogy: book one is the colonization and founding of America, book two is from the revolution to the Civil War, and book three is from the Civil War to 1970's America. I started in the middle, with no regrets. The books aren't long. I think if you read both Boorstin and Zinn, you can walk away with a pretty well-rounded conception of U.S. History. Personally, I'd read Boorstin first. 

Regarding our governance specifically, which sounds like the sore spot for your friend, I have some ideas that aren't quite 'catch up on everything' but more in the 'patriotism' camp. As a teen, I read ""[In Our Defense: The Bill of Rights in Action](http://www.amazon.com/In-Our-Defense-Rights-Action/dp/0380717204),"" by Ellen Alderman and Caroline Kennedy — it's not a history per se, not even landmark legal cases, but rather specific, approachable cases and touching stories that illuminate our rights. It definitely made me more appreciative of our system. (In fact, it's hard to open any book with Caroline Kennedy's name on it and close it without feeling patriotic.) 

I continued along this line of constitutional history later, reading ""[Freedom for the Thought that We Hate](http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Thought-That-Hate-Biography/dp/046501819X): A Biography of the First Amendment"" by Anthony Lewis. It's not ""A Short History of Nearly *Everything*,"" but it is a terrific short book that somehow starts us in 1500's England, and travels through time to land very relevantly in present day U.S.A., packing a punch about what's special about America and why we shouldn't take it for granted. 

Another, trickier idea I have is to go more inward-out with your history, rather than an overview; I might try a broad but locally-based history book. For example, I'm in California, and I can't read Carey McWilliams' work without being in awe of my state, warts and all, and its place in U.S. history. 

Good luck!

To catch him when he is falling, to let him know that his feelings and words are not falling on deaf ears, and to be the man he needs to simply show someone cares for him. A father is so very many things but at the same time can be one of the most simplest. 

In my darkest hours of attempted suicide and alcoholism my father just extending his arms out to me to hug me made an immeasurable difference.

Relationship wise: obviously you cannot force your bf to wear a helmet. If he really doesn't want to, he won't. 

But I think you are right to be upset with him because not wearing a helmet when skiing is pretty frickin stupid if you ask me.

I don't care if he has been skiing for 15 years...if anything that means he should be aware of the risks of skiing and know how important head protection is. It doesn't matter whether he sticks to groomers or goes into the trees or other terrain, the risk of head injury is so high no matter what the skill level of the skier is. 
A simple Google search should be enough evidence to show how important helmets are in preventing head injury and death. When choosing between having to wear a ""silly looking helmet"" or a trip to the emergency room, I'd choose the former. 

Can some people go skiing sans helmet and have nothing go wrong? Definitely. But why would you take that risk?"

The business of speeding up walking when your afraid makes you look scared (shockingly enough) if theres someone coming loudly and quicky up from behind step to the side and turn side on to let them through, if they're a quick walker you'll get a thanks if they're traying to mug you you can see if they got a weapon if they look sketch etc and more importantly **you can see them** and figure out what to do. You aren't working fast and making noise maybe masking the sounds of them about to speed up or pull a weapon.

Pepper spray or a pistol* sure but it could just be me but I think the keys in your hand makes you look so vulnerable compared to raised fists and you can do plently of damage with them along especially if you hit jaw, kidney's etc and this is ignoring the insane painful knee to the groin.

The universe is expanding fast enough that the farthest galaxies are receding faster than the speed of light, they're over 20 billion light years away despite being ""only"" 13 billion years old."

From what you've mentioned, she probably is actually really busy. One of my close friends is an ENFJ and he's forever overscheduling himself. Also, he gets so many text messages. (Extroverts and their large number of friends...) I'd give her the opportunity to hold up to the expectations she has set for herself before you get too far within your own head about it, or start doubting her or yourself. She says she wants to keep seeing you, so you have to assume she means it. Besides, it's not like she said she couldn't see you at all for the next couple of weeks, is it? I don't know how 'dating' is supposed to work, but it seems like there's the possibility that maybe you could grab lunch together for an hour or two somewhere in there, you know?

Yeah, this is straight-up cuntery. I don't fucking care that he's running eGaspy but fuck any player that is so fucking insecure in his ability to come up with an all-comers list that he needs to read his opponents' list ahead of time and skew his own on the spot.

The etiquette I use is basically steamroller rules. I have two lists ready at any given time, and let my opponent know it's going to be one or the other. Then both reveal which lists we're playing right before deployment. Of course, most credible players will have their own SR lists ready to go and won't be wasting time tailoring their list to win a one-off test match unless they catch themselves in a major hole right away. (For example, ""Oh shit, you just made me realize I have no counter to Iron Flesh Kayazy in either of my lists, can I make some quick adjustments to them before we go?""). 

Don't tolerate that bullshit. If they start trying to sneak in hard counters, call them out for not having an all-comers list or find a different opponent. It's anticompetitive and should be shamed right out of the LGS."

As I said, feminist focus on outcomes, not opportunities. The wage gap has been easily explained away, or even proved false. 

The reasons why women might be promoted less than men, is not because of inaccessibility or barriers to women. 

Like I said, outcomes, not opportunities. 


&gt; Add to that that many people still believe these are ""men's"" fields and that women don't belong in the sciences, and there you have it. 

Some people believe anything.  





&gt;The point is to change that way of thinking and the injustices women in the field often face to make the playing ground more accessible and actually of interest to women.


From your post, there are no physical or real barriers, but merely what some people think. 



Again why do you need to encourage women to do what you think they must do, rather them letting them choose on their own.

Just using made up numbers, it means that if Medicare will collect $20 trillion in taxes over the next 50 years, it is predicted to cost $60 trillion over the same 50 years.  

The predicted cost is not a ""triple cancer"" worst-case scenario.  It's based on historic usage combined with predicted life expectancy, etc.

Noumenology,rage,1388626107.0,"Well, the simplest way to say it is that political beliefs lie on my spectrum - this is a bit of a simplification, but it would be like

&lt;Communism - left wing - liberal  - centerism - conservative  - right wing - fascism&gt;

Most people in the United States understand ""liberals"" as people who affiliate with the Democratic Party or are on the political left (socially liberal and economically liberal, rather than conservative). But others will tell you that politically left in the us is more like being a centrist in the rest of the world - across the board the us is more conservative than other countries. 

People who are leftists are also sometimes labeled ""progressives"" - Obama reached out to those groups in 2008 and then stabbed them in the fucking back over stuff like government secrecy, military funding, foreign policy and war, environmental policy... Similar to how some republicans accuse others of being ""too liberal""or RINOS, leftists see liberals as pandering to big business, corrupt beurocratic cronyism, anti-democratic in excluding civic engagement and public participation in government, and hostile towards advocacy, activism and dissent (such as the maligning of Occupy Wall Street by Democrats, the way Barbra Boxer sees domestic surveillance, and every thing fucking Joseph fucking Lieberman ever did)."

Just a limp, but... not as if her husband can't notice it. Face-making must be odd, like a girl with glasses or a brush with a negress. Not certain if the notice makes the want, or the want the notice. Still, I wonder. Had her skirts turned, wished me to see, they could always tell when a man is courting by his cuffs. No surprise there - lions and hares do it too.

&gt;Strange dream this afternoon. Stood in an empty hall, but not alone. Escapes me now.

I'm wondering if the strange dream is a reference to Algernon Blackwood's [The Empty House](http://classiclit.about.com/od/Empty-House-Algernon-Blackwood/a/The-Empty-House-Algernon-Blackwood.htm).  OP is an English Lit major and Blackwood is English but was born in the 1860s.  This only comes from a few minutes worth of googling so it's a stab in the dark.

Therefore he must become a master in it too, be able to perform it as a totality. He who in a pin-factory only puts on heads, only draws the wire, works, as it were mechanically, like a machine; he remains half-trained, does not become a master: his labour cannot satisfy him, it can only fatigue him.

They have a stable, calm and caring home in Claremont.  She and her husband are currently trying to gain permanent custody of her two grandchildren, whose biological mother is, frankly, not suited for parental responsibilities and chooses her company and live-in partners very poorly as you can glean from the article below the main fund-raiser section in the link above.  

The elder Von Kahles have sunk pretty much all of their savings into legal costs for attempting to gain custody, are very worried about their grandchildren and beside themselves trying to keep them from falling into further abusive situations.  The mother, despite repeated chances to improve things for her child and become a better parent, refuses to give up the children regardless of her obvious deficits in parenting ability and refusal to surrender the children to a home where they are not under threat of abuse and a hostile environment. As is typical, DCYF is useless unless the situation is dire.

Kyokushin_Dude,AskReddit,1388626506.0,"For the record to add to Delts28's very useful additions :-), here's some Japan-specific info:  Japan is 100v, and uses the same plugs as the US (though they have the ground plug less often.)  Voltage is rarely a problem for devices designed for the US like phone chargers or laptop chargers, but some higher-voltage electronics from the UK can have problems.  Hair dryers will be less useful, but if you don't have much hair don't worry about that one. 

One fun thing in Japan is that vending machines are literally EVERYWHERE.  You can't even climb Mt. Fuji without seeing one.  You'll never die of thirst in Japan.  :-)

YES TO CASH.  Japan is a cash-based society, and many ATMs (outside of the post office and banks like Citi) will not recognize your silly ATM card.  I would carry around $200-500 USD (so, 20,000 to 50,000 JPY) on me at all times so I could not have to worry about paying for taxis or train fares.  Paying with credit cards in Japan can be a serious hassle, and if you go anywhere that isn't a hotel or department store, don't expect credit cards to be accepted.  

Having a bank that is used to international travel helps, too.  Schwab never got in my way while traveling in Europe or Asia, thankfully. 

Additionally: Japan is cold in the winter!  Even as far south as Kyushu, expect some cold weather.  Pack warm clothes! I would recommend (seriously) to bring a scarf, a nice wool cap, some gloves, and a jacket.  If you are a Westerner or are larger than an American medium, it can be a pain in the butt shopping for clothes there.  I had a small wardrobe I built up when I was there, and I often had to buy L or XL sizes.  You are very unlikely to find ""large"" shoe sizes there, so bring comfy shoes.

If you travel from city to city, YOU MUST GET THE JR PASS.  http://www.japanrailpass.net/ You will save a ton by having it.  If you are staying within the Tokyo and maybe Osaka/Kyoto region, don't bother.  But even two trips on the shinkansen can make the JR pass worthwhile.

A few things to NOT bother bringing to Japan:

-  An umbrella (umbrellas are cheap and everywhere).  Also, umbrellas are oddly one of the few things I find Japanese will willingly steal.  It's sort of a ""take one, leave one"" in my experience.  YMMV on that one, but don't bring a nice umbrella.  

-  Detergent or anything for washing clothes.  Easy to find, cheap. 

-  Discover cards.  Visa/Master/Amex only.  "

alaskandesign,nutrition,1388626531.0,"Doctors aren't really nutritionists and often tend to focus on reactive, rather than preventative care. 

Cut out any sugar and refined (white) grains. If you drink soda or energy drinks, cutting those out will go a long way. 

Replace processed snacks with vegetable snacks, fruit snacks, nuts, seeds. 

I would add berries (berries are in the 'dirty 12' so buy organic berries*).

Nuts are good for you, but high in calories, so eat some, but don't overindulge if you're trying to lose weight. Pumpkin and sesame seeds benefit the immune system. I also recommend walnuts, almonds, and sunflower seeds.

Leafy greens should be a staple part of your diet. They are dense in several nutrients and minerals. Add fresh spinach to meals (on sandwiches, salads, tacos, omelettes).  Look up some recipes for steamed kale, or kale chips (people are crazy about these). Leafy greens tend to also be on the 'dirty 12' so this is another time when you should get organic. Turnip, mustard, romaine, etc. They can be a 'bed' for other foods too: you've probably heard of ""a bed of greens.""

Add fresh garlic to your meals. To get maximum benefits from it, let it sit for a few minutes after chopping it, and don't overcook it.

* Noctua D14 is a good cooler (I have it.) But I seriously don't recommend it for vertical tower builds as it's massive and heavy. Liquid cooling is the way to go.

* 16gb of ram is useless for gamers, no matter how powerful the placebo effect may feel.

* For the SSD, you honestly only need 120gb. If you have doubts, here's a **[Tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1tzhab/tutorial_1000_usd_gaming_tower_the_simple/ced6ync)**

* For the HDD you are paying $60 for a noisy drive with only a tiny bit of performance benefit.

**This is all you need to achieve the performance and convenience you are looking for. Now re-evaluate what you really want to spend money on.**

They have a stable, calm and caring home in Claremont. She and her husband are currently trying to gain permanent custody of her two grandchildren, whose biological mother is, frankly, not suited for parental responsibilities and chooses her company and live-in partners very poorly as you can glean from the article below the main fund-raiser section in the link above. 


The elder Von Kahles have sunk pretty much all of their savings into legal costs for attempting to gain custody, are very worried about their grandchildren and beside themselves trying to keep them from falling into further abusive situations. The mother, despite repeated chances to improve things for her child and become a better parent, refuses to give up the children regardless of her obvious deficits in parenting ability and refusal to surrender the children to a home where they are not under threat of abuse and a hostile environment.

Unless you distance yourself and find a way to move on, your feelings will only get stronger.  You act in the way a friend should, but are having to constantly repress feelings.  Every time you see her kiss another guy or hear how great a guy is in bed, it will be like being stabbed.

Given your post here, it sounds like the level of pain is already pretty rough.  Additionally, you will feel guilty for feeling this way about a ""friend"", which will also be repressed.

Now here is a really bad part.  Over time (it could be weeks, months, or even years), this repressed pain will grow and eventually metastasize into a subconscious hatred for her.  Your conscious mind will still love her, but your subconscious will see her as the source of this pain and attack her.  You will become increasingly passive aggressive and mean, both against her and anyone she is dating.

Eventually this will cause the ""friendship"" to end, but not until after a long period and things becoming quite toxic.  Worst yet, you won't be able to effectively move on and date someone else while you still have these feelings for her.

At the very least, you need to be honest with her about how you feel.  Then she could at least be understanding of why you need space and try to be discreet to spare your feelings.

Anyways, it is your choice what you want to do.  You can either take my advice as someone who is older, married, and has a lot of relationship experience, or you can ignore it.  Most people, myself including, had to learn it the hard way, and you might have to as well.  Hopefully it will be more like 3 months than 3 years to learn though.

As an aside, during the toxic phase you will generally become an asshole to other people as well, and will start feeling true misogyny.  It really isn't a fun place to be."

While there are friendly people out there who are up for spontaneous conversation at any time, my experience has been that the majority of people want to be left alone when they're standing in line at the bank or riding the metro home. I wouldn't think someone was creepy or weird for trying to strike up a conversation, but I also wouldn't be receptive to it.

Instead, work on expanding your social circle. Sign up for a local team - kickball or something. Start going to some kind of class, like yoga, cooking, or something like that and strike up a conversation before/after. Go to outdoor concerts or Shakespeare in the Park if the weather permits where you live and strike up a conversation about the performance. Especially useful could be volunteering. Go to the local animal shelter, food bank, whatever. All of these are chances to socialize, chat other people up, and meet new people that don't involve randomly walking up to people in public places."

No, because taking into consideration all the evidence and discussion available, your position is blatantly wrong. 

&gt;Surely your opinion is the edge that makes you superior over others! How shortsighted.

When did I say or claim to be superior? I'm simply stating that your stance isn't right.

&gt;Especially considering that you are wrong according to Science.

Wait... You can't be serious; ignoring the fact that the overwhelming majority of the scientific community disagrees with a shit ton of your ""opinions"", you were arguing a little while ago that ""science"" (i.e. the scientific community) had been wrong in the past, therefore they're wrong now. Now you're saying that they aren't wrong, and instead share your viewpoint? Can you point me to the journals (remember, we're talking ""science"" now) that support this claim?

&gt;The fact is that Science has been wrong in the past.

Besides my previous point addressing this; *so?* Groups make mistakes (and note this was a longggg time ago, where things were done differently)

&gt;Also it's a fact that there is no such thing as 'absolute truth' in science which you have implied.

Again, playing word games. Assuming what you just said is true, it would be pointless to refer to everything we speak about as only 'probable' or 'highly likely' (although in this discussion I used those words to keep you happy).

&gt; FYI I'm educated. I researched evolution. I was taught evolution.

At what level? At what institution? Which courses?

&gt; I know what I am disagreeing with.

Sorry, but if that's true you're perhaps being the biggest troll I've seen in a while regarding the topic. Myself along with many others have gone into deeper debates with you in the past, and you typically just stop responding to the discussion or make nonsensical posts.

&gt;You on the other hand assume your beliefs to be superior over mine simply because they are your beliefs

Learn some basic kanji (1 through 10, 100, 1000, go, come, eat, drink, etc.)  Start building basic vocabulary and learn basic conjugations (past tense, negative tense, etc.) Speak it as much as you can while you're there!

Yes, anti-pot laws can be incredibly useful for catching 'hard criminals'. It's the often cited 'not all pot smokers are criminals, but all criminals are pot smokers'. Obviously there are exceptions, but it's a rule that holds very true for everyday use. The problem is whenever someone wants to use the law to target someone else. 

Don't like gays? Go bust some clubs in an area with a proportionately higher ratio of gay bars and arrest some people for possession. Don't like black people?

The thing that keeps me from leaping to even libertarian socialism is the pathological urge to avoid any division of labor or hierarchy in the workplace. There needs to be someone who knows what's up and can manage affairs, and he deserves compensation, even if he's not doing the dirty work. That said, those doing the dirty work are human beings and ought to receive a living wage if possible. 

I can definitely agree with the socialist criticism of wage labor as it is currently practiced but in a free market it seems to me that it would be largely reduced or nearly eliminated over-time, but I see nothing wrong with people working for wages if they'd rather do that. The problem comes when the economy is structured to permit a single class to economically dominate a weaker class.

On a single patient? That can't possibly be good.

I was trying to find some good scientific or medically backed English websites on the subject but find myself lacking, finding mostly blogs and a men's health entry about the subject on askmen.com. 

Since I'm Swedish most of my sources on information about this are also Swedish and I was hesitant to use them since I don't know how to easily translate the page. However I want to give you a good viable source so here goes either way. 

[This article](http://translate.google.se/translate?hl=sv&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.umo.se%2FKroppen%2FKillars-underliv%2FRen-mellan-benen---kille%2F&amp;sandbox=1) goes through the hygiene of the uncircumcised penis, and [this article](http://translate.google.se/translate?hl=sv&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.1177.se%2FVastra-Gotaland%2FTema%2FSex-och-relationer%2FKroppen%2FUnderlivshygien%2F&amp;sandbox=1) goes through the hygiene of both men and women. Neither recommends washing the genitals more than once a day and recommends against the use of soap on the genitals.

The first article mentions how smegma is antibacterial and anti fungal but since it's produced constantly, there is the need to wash away the residue of the old stuff or it can have the opposite effect. It also mentions (like the second one) how excessive washing and the use of soap can dry out the sensitive mucous membranes that keep things moist and healthy. This can lead to itching, rashes, cracks in the skin etc.

I have provided a google translate version of the articles, but keep in mind that it's a bad translation, still it should give you the gist of the situation.

The first site is ""a national web-based youth friendly clinic for young people aged 13 to 25 years. The purpose of the site is to make it easier for young people to find relevant, current and quality assured information about sex, health and relationships"".

The second site is ""Sweden's entire gathering place for information and services in the health and care.""

Both are official outlets backed by research done by educated medical professionals.

I hope that is good enough for a source for you.

&gt; If this negative assertion is in response to a claim made by another party in a debate, asserting the falsehood of the positive claim shifts the burden of proof from the party making the first claim to the one asserting its falsehood, as **the agnostic position that ""I don't believe that X is true"" is different to the explicit denial ""I believe that X is false"".**

Because I am in to you and when I'm separated from you I want to see you. Men are physical beings. Even if its not a dirty picture it doesn't mean that it doesn't help build attraction. If I can't see you for a while then it helps me feel a little closer to you. I might also have a little ulterior motive in the back of my mind that maybe if we exchange a few non-dirty photos then maybe you will send something a little sexier. Also, I talk to my friends about what's going on in my life, and I share that I've been hanging out with a pretty cool girl that I'm kind of excited about. If I'm not facebook friends with you I'd like a picture that I can show them to brag a little bit.

Barely. People are still people. My point was that the ""social opinion"" is not a good compass for how a society should be run, that is what the example was for.

&gt;I'm saying that the economy we observe today is telling us that governments should impose regulations if we want to have a sustainable economic future.

And I'm saying that I disagree, but lets leave it at that because it's a discussion that's been pointlessly played out thousands of times on this subreddit and many others.

VoxMeretricis,AskReddit,1388627916.0,"One striking thing I notice about your post is how vague it is, and I think the important part of is in your your tl;dr: you can't articulate your thoughts or desires. Until you can do that with yourself, you're never going to be able to communicate with others.

I suggest beginning with a ruthless period of self-reflection. What are the flaws that you want to change, specifically, and why do you have them? How did they come about? Make a commitment to yourself that you will never lie to yourself, and that you will communicate with *you*. Beginning a journal or writing may help with this process - instead of feeling, writing forces you to speak. It also allows you to fine-tune what you want to say. Try keeping a journal thematically, not chronologically. So you'll write not based on what you're feeling that day, but about one particular facet that you want to change - you'll write about selfishness, for example, for a month. The next month, you'll write about isolation. Focus on self-improvement, first, and your relationships with people will become more healthy as a result. "

Hmm... I kind of understand where you are coming from, but then again... Why would the center of balance be off? Assuming the furries evolved from the same basic organisms as the modern human, and also assuming they are intelligent as we often depict them, surely, their bodies must be formed in a way that active movement by walking would be possible, no? If they had no balance, and limited bipedal mobility, it is unlikely they would evolve to be intelligent. I have an idea. Would you ""go into exact details and/or ramble on and on"" about this in a new thread? I would be willing to discuss with you, and others, about this, but I don't think this is the place, as this is somewhat off-topic from the original question. What do you think?

It's tedious and slow and painful, but once you get them down, pictographs can be remarkably easy to remember.  Learn 10, and you'll find the next 10 to be easier.  Learn 20, and the next 20 will be easier.  You'll start learning radicals (constituent parts), which will give you foundations to build upon when learning new kanji.  And it'll just build from there.

If you are only concerned with reading, get a flash card app on your smartphone.  Do 5 to 10 a day!  If you can get around 100 of the most basic kanji down, you'll have no problem with most basic things.

Jethro_Cull,Frugal,1388628411.0,"Can you get FIOS internet?  I live in East Falls.  It's in Philly, but suburban-y and we don't have as many options as CC.  In my neighborhood, we have 2 choices for high-speed internet: FIOS and Comcast.  We cannot get FIOS cable TV, however.  So, Comcast is our only choice.  We opted to forgo cable TV and have an HD Antenna and a Roku with Hulu/Netflix. 

We started with Comcast last year.  We had internet only for $29.99/mo for the first 6 months, then $49.99/mo for the next 6 months.  Our first-year promotional rates will expire in February and our rates will go up to $75/mo.  I'm pretty confident that when I call later this month, I can get them to at least keep me at the $29.99 - $49.99 deal again.  If they won't agree to charge me less than $50 - or if they charge me $50 but don't agree to throw in any goodies (like free cable+HBO), I'll go to FIOS in a heartbeat.

In 6 months, I'll be a ""new customer"" again as far as Comcast is concerned."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388628730.0,"&gt;Who's labor will you steal in order to redistribute? Let's face it, after you bleed the rich I will have to be made to serve the poor.

We live in an interdependent society. The rich could not get rich except for the labor of others. There's too much to do. The problem is, these rich exploit workers paying them the least they're willing to accept. And in a world of no better options, that's not a lot. You see, you hide behind the legalism of transactions being ""voluntary"", but you forget to understand that when you're put in a situation in which it's accept what they give you or face negative consequences, that's no better than a gun to the head. The only difference is the passive weapon of starvation rather than the active weapon of a gun. It, in effect, becomes the very argument you would likely use against the state.

&gt;Umm, you and your govt just made me your working slave so I can serve the poor.

You work for yourself, and under my system, you benefit most from the fuits of your labor. Not the poor, not everyone else. The thing is, when the rest of society depends on you for their sustenance and you don't deliver, the state becomes necessary to do the job for you.

&gt;Umm, business's dont make the laws. 

Come to work at 8 AM or be fired.

Stay until 6 PM or be fired.

Do this or be fired.

Do that or be fired. 

We can let you go for any reason. You looked at me funny. Fired.

Businesses make all kinds of rules that govern the schedules and behavior of those who work there. And if you don't abide by the rules, you're fired. Have fun starving to death, because you'd eliminate all safety nets too.

&gt;y, and your type of govt that will permanently enslave me for your self righteous goals, or I get thrown in jail or shot, I'll take the former.

Well, I'm going into ancap territory now, but do you think in a COMPLETE absence of government, businesses would not do the same? To say they would not, you would be ignoring all of the mafias, drug cartels, or strike breaking techniques that are violent.

Look at China, how the rich use the government to shut down any attempt at labor organizing. Do you tthink that without ANY government (once again, going in ancap territory, so sorry if you're not an ancap), that they would abide by your principles of nonaggression and not pick up arms themselves? Do you really think that private ""rights enforcement agencies"" would not become the private army of many corporations? To argue that they would not, you once again ignore history.

My ideas involve a sacrifice. A limitation of the rich's power to enslave everyone else. You ca't have liberty if that liberty includes the right of some individuals to in effect enslave the rest of humanity. You can't have true freedom until everyone has a basic standard of living, in which all can choose whether or not to work for more. Until you achieve that, the rich will always control the poor. As long as people are reliant on the rich for their sustenance, and are forced to play to their tune, there can be no freedom to speak of.

You freedom is a freedom of a small minority of wealthy gatekeepers to oppress everyone else. Do you really believe the BS you push? Or are you a shill for the Mises institute or something like that?"

It's because we are able to disagree with each other, and though that seems like a bad thing in this context, it's one of the biggest proponents of change in the world.

It was a 2 car wreck, and it was at an intersection, but one car was able to be pushed out of the road and the other was on the median on one side, so traffic wasn't blocked at all. When they showed up, they parked their trucks in the middle of the intersection (it was San Felipe @ Voss, so not a small intersection by any means) and blocked traffic for about two minutes while they stood in the middle of it and flipped coins to decide who would be the one not getting to take one of the cars.

and dont they claim its an aliance ship in me3? either way I think the hero who saved most of the crew of the normandy, the galatic council, several other groups AND THE ENTIRE GALAXY, would be accepted and that would be a really different experience than going from the human spectre that no one is sure about because the were rumors about him killing nihlus and such to the human spectre who know one is sure about since people say he is working with terrorists.

What's that?

It means you're confident to the point that you only need what goes on inside your head to be happy, you don't need the validation from the outside to be happy and/or when things go wrong to bring you down. 

What I'm saying is that, say on the inside you feel like you're a total baller and you love yourself. That's healthy in moderation. If you go out and are outcome dependent, there are two situations, both bad: A. You get many girls and you become a cocky piece of shit B. You fail and you are sad and hate yourself

From maintaining the same internal feeling, staying constantly happy with whatever happens (since changing the past is impossible, there's no point in trying), what happens could be: A. You get a lot of girls and feel happy like before B. You fail but you're happy and you feel fine because you're confident in yourself.

she one day had a special order to deal with for a customer and she spent her whole shift freaked out over this one order for one item. she ignored phone calls from vendors, the district managers and even other customers. she actually left customers on hold with no intention of answering the phone at all. she snapped when I told her that a customer asked to speak to her. a reasonable manager would have been able to time manage to give appropriate attention to everyone who required it. this is/was her first time managing.

by_a_pyre_light,Games,1388629099.0,"Well, yeah. Many genres just aren't made for a keyboard and mouse, and others really excel with it. Racing games, fighting games, and third person games (like Deadpool and Batman, less Gears of War) are all best layed with a controller. I don't know any PC gamers personally who don't have a controller of some sort, especially an Xbox controller since they've been supported in Windows since 2005, and before that Logitech put out some decent ones. Hell, I have even heard PlayStation controllers work well, as do WiiU ones, but I haven't personally tried either of those. 

My point is, at this point, nearly everyone has a controller from their other systems or can get one for dirt cheap, and virtually all of the games of the past 10+ years include controller support, most natively. *All* traditionally controller-based console ports like racing games, fighters, etc. have native support, and every shooter I've played has it too. 

People should not need to worry about needing a controller for this type of game, they should have one already or kind of, you know, expect it for a fighting game.

professor__doom,AskEngineers,1388629146.0,"Lifelong DC area resident here.  Washington, DC was not built all at once, nor was it ""planned"" like the ""cities"" springing up in China.  Only the central core of the city was built ad-hoc during the Federalist period; the rest grew up semi-organically--i.e. houses/shops/hospitals/etc were built according to evolving economic needs over the next two centuries (the [last farm within the city limits](http://ghostsofdc.org/2013/08/12/last-farm-in-the-district-is-doomed/) continued to operate until 1939.), but the street grid itself, monument and park placements, etc were built according to the L'Enfant plan.  Some parts of the city, like Georgetown, predate the Revolutionary war by a longshot.

The street grid itself is actually reasonably effective over 200 years later.  Rush hour travel between Tyson's Corner, VA and Silver Spring, MD, for example, is much faster going through the city than via the ""organically grown"" roadways outside the city limits.  Can you say the same about organically grown cities like Boston, or even Baltimore?  Nope, both cities required [massive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig), expensive [tunnels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor_Tunnel_Thruway) to spare drivers the nightmare of navigating unplanned, labyrinthine city streets.

The Washington Metro system was built according to a central plan issued in 1968, with origins dating back to 1952.  The transit authority is, on paper, under the purview of so many different federal/state/city/county agencies that it's effectively accountable to no one.  So, de facto, it's basically run by[ corrupt, racist union thugs](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/26/metro-derailed-by-culture-of-complacence-incompete/).

Despite this, I think it's safer, noticeably cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable than NYC's ""organically grown"" transit system, which is the result of the gradual conglomeration of several independent, competing organizations.  If the regulatory environment was different, the system would be even better.

Today, the downtown core is less ""endemically poor ghetto"" and more like a sterile, glass-enclosed college campus/hipster mecca, with the [highest concentration](http://www.calinst.org/bulletins/b1112m.htm) of graduate and professional degree holders in the United States.

DC was also deliberately built according to your criteria:

&gt;A) Access to fresh water, B) Access to Navigable water (for trade), C) Access to Arable land (for farming) D) Access to mineral deposits (for mining) or E) Being situated on the only passable path through a region (for military defense).

At the time of Washington's founding, the Potomac and Anacostia rivers were critical regional trade routes.  Georgetown originally grew up as a port where Maryland tobacco farmers were able to load their cargo onto seagoing vessels.  The Navy Yard held a critical role in ship and ordinance production through WWII--not in the least because of its location on the Potomac. [ Seagoing ships](http://www.flickr.com/photos/isaacpacheco/4626060768/) still travel up the Potomac and stop in Washington.

The problems DC has had historically are mainly attributable to the lack of competent local government.  [Until 1973](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_Home_Rule_Act), DC was controlled by a Congressional committee, and we all know how ""awesome"" Congress is when it comes to passing fair and effective legislation in a timely manner.  Since 1973, DC has spent 16 years under Marion Barry, who managed to be corrupt, incompetent, and openly racist all at once.  So competent local rule has only been a reality in DC since 2000.

TL;DR: DC is a ""planned"" city only in terms of its location and transportation infrastructure, both of which are actually remarkably effective given the circumstances.  DC was also not ""built from nothing;"" the port of Georgetown long predates it.  DC is absolutely not ""over half ghetto"" today, it is actually one of the most educated cities in the country. And DC's historical problems have been mainly due to the lack of good local governance and not endemic to the idea of a ""centrally planned city."""

chrunchy,canada,1388629197.0,"More flexible work force, if you don't need them you can fire them. Plus, many don't know local labour regulations. Their visas are also typically tied to the job they're doing, so if they lose that job they have to go back home. This is an incentive to not complain about working conditions.

The major one is that you can pay them less, and offer less benefits. Typically an employee cost is wages +25% (give or take 10%) because you also offer dental, pension etc. Bringing in a TFW you can pay them less plus you offer less benefits so it's a win/win (for the company).

A legitimate reason for bringing in TFWs is not being able to find the skilled employees. If you need pipefitters and you've really tried to find people to do the job but nobody shows up for the interviews you should be able to apply for a TFW.

But this also gets corrupted by a company offering *too little* a wage for the position. If you need a welder but you're only offering minimum wage for it - of course you aren't going to find anyone wanting the job. But companies approach the business-friendly government and say ""we need a TFW"" and the request gets rubber-stamped.

I've seen writers change lines mid-filming. Audience reactions also help with actor timing and delivery. A joke might fly when read one way but die when read another way. And of course, the laughter is recorded and mixed into the final televised product. However, I think much of the laughter is either dumped or pulled from other recordings. For instance, a director/producer might like the enthusiasm from the audience but wish to play it out more and so they'll incorporate a bigger laugh track either from the same recording session or some stock library. At this point I think the main purpose of the laughter is to gauge the effectiveness of the jokes. I find it hard to believe the networks and production companies don't already have an infinite variety of pre-recorded laughs."

Guys, this dress has MOTHERFUCKING POCKETS!!!! I can't stress how much I am in love with this dress. It hugged my hips and waist perfectly, and it came down to my knees. I have never had all three of those happen at the same time! I had pockets to put my phone in so I didn't need a purse, and I towered over everyone. The Toms Wedges are a truer black than the online pictures so I didn't bother with uploading them. The wedges are also the most bomb-diggity comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I broke them in at work (8 hours of constant standing) and my feet didn't hurt by the end of the night... and I never wear heels!

Also, please forgive the awkward mirror shot. The only way to get an even close to full body picture in my apartment is to take the mirror and wedge it between the ceiling and my desk. Damn being tall!

tartcouplet,asoiaf,1388629504.0,"&gt;Unless he meant it, and he meant to be a martyr.

The fact that Oberyn poisoned his spear tells me that the point of fighting Gregor wasn't only to kill him. Oberyn knew Gregor would die whether he ended up taking Oberyn with him or not, you know? 

I think Oberyn's motivations for fighting are very different from those of almost any character we've seen so far, in that he didn't just desire revenge or justice or to kill his opponent outright. The point of that fight was for everyone to see his and his family's anger at what was done to Elia and her children. He wanted Gregor to admit to being the monster that he was, so that anyone who'd used him or allied themselves with him would have no choice to face that fact. 

Anyone who didn't know or didn't believe the rumors would feel horrified and ashamed, and most importantly, they'd resent and blame those who had to have known about it and did nothing to prevent it or administer justice.That was the point, right there. He wanted that more than he wanted to win the fight... and he wanted to kill Gregor, of course, but not before any of that had happened.

I think even if Oberyn had known that prolonging the fight to force Gregor's confession would end up costing him his life, he still would've done it. That doesn't mean he wouldn't have preferred to win, obviously. But winning wasn't as important as revealing the truth and expressing his rage. I've gotta say, I respect that a lot. Even if it meant that one of the best characters in the series bit it before we could really get to know him. "

I've decided that I'm going to focus on three things this year: being present to the moment, living openly and honestly, and behaving humbly. I found my struggles with those three things were the cause of almost all my distress in 2013.

Living openly and honestly scares the shit out of me and I don't know how to begin, really. I'm afraid to talk to my parents about my past porn addiction and various transgressions I've kept secret for a long time. I'm afraid to talk to my fraternity about how much our pledging program bothers me. Probably most of all, I'm afraid about talking to the women I find attractive about said attraction.

I'm not sure if it's technically hormonal cystic acne but it looks and feels the same. I say that because I'm on Lo Seasonique which I believe has the same level of hormones for 12 weeks, so my hormones shouldn't be fluctuating much (that was the whole idea behind me switching to that BC -  I had terrible PMS headaches every month, now it's only 4x / yr). 

But I've been on 50 mg of spironolactone and Ziana (clindamycin &amp; tretinoin) for nearly 5 months now and I've definitely noticed some improvement.  When I went back for my 3 month follow up, the doc said that technically I have perioral dermatitis but she has to code it as acne for insurance so they'll cover the RXs. She added metronidazole cream, which I use in the AM, and recommended that I try cutting out different potential irritants like fluoride and SLS in toothpaste.  I'm hoping that switching to Desert Essence SLS and Fluoride free toothpaste will help, along with the 3 Rxs. 

And I've had no issues with the spironolactone aside from peeing more often and that's leveled off.  And I'm 28, btw.  :)

Madscurr,uwaterloo,1388630234.0,"Hey! 3B Compuatational Math student here. To be perfectly honest, for your first few co-op jobs you won't be as qualified to program anything as a CS student would be, and you won't be as qualified for math jobs as a math student would be. You'll also have a much harder time explaining to prospective employers exactly what it is you are good at. It may be hard for you to find the kinds of jobs you'll want for a while.

That said, I have no regrets about this program whatsoever. I absolutely love it. The math is less theoretical (although there's still lots of theory) and the programming is higher level (although you still need to learn the basics) than you'll find in other programs -- instead what you will learn to do is solve the kinds of applied problems that pure mathematicians don't have the computational knowledge for and that computer scientists don't have the mathematical knowledge for. You will learn to write algorithms to solve discrete problems that simply cannot be done by hand, and then you'll prove that those algorithms will give you the right answer using mathematical reasoning. Then you'll learn how to improve those algorithms based on your knowledge of how the computer actually does the work. You will learn how clever applications of linear algebra, graph theory, optimization, calculus, probability, etc, have made companies like Google, Apple, and Netflix unspeakably rich. 

Plus, it's super easy to pick up a minor in either CS, Stats, or CO, depending on which major courses you choose. I'm getting a minor in CO by accident because I was only missing one requirement, which I happened to take as an elective. Also, there are surprisingly few requirements for CM, so you'll have lots of room in your schedule for electives/minors."

Cersei has the same issue. She resorts to force and threats and manipulation, not even realizing that being *nice* is what gets you what you want. 

It's funny to me that Margaery's worked that one out on her own, while Cersei's watching her going, ""Why can't I trust anyone?! I was a huge bitch and everything, and they still hate me!""

I also think Tywin just doesn't care enough about Tyrion to want to improve his character or morals. He tells Tyrion he has to stop whoring when he needs him to, and not before, because he simply never had cause to give a shit whether Tyrion whored his face off. Which, as you so perfectly analyzed, is why Tyrion did it. 

As you said, he was trying to get his father's attention, but Tywin couldn't have cared less. Randyll Tarly's parenting was actually more defensible than Tywin's, in my opinion. Even though he couldn't accept Sam as he was, at least he cared enough to try and make him into someone he could be proud of. Tywin didn't even care that much, and nothing Tyrion could've done short of bringing his mother back to life and growing three feet would change that. "

When Bail calls upon Obi-wan to join the rebellion, that is the start of the plan to beat the Empire. Before that, the plan was merely 'survive.'

If Luke had gone off to the Imperial Space Academy, chances are that would have ended Obi-Wan's vigilant watch. At that point, Luke would have grown up and able to make his own decisions in life.

If you look at it from the start, the probability of having 1,000,000 tails is indeed ridiculously small. But if you consider the moment where you just got the 999,999th tails, then the probability to have a 1,000,000th is exactly 1/2, whereas a gambler would believe it to be very small."

periodicchemistrypun,AskReddit,1388630897.0,"&gt;I didn't feel much challenged in any way
did you go solider? second time round I went an ability centric class and it is ALOT more fun. you may have to set the difficulty higher but i found plenty of challenge that required strategy both playthroughs, i felt more this way about ME 2, it was easy most of the time

&gt;most of those skill points didn't end up meaning a thing

well when each character gains 2 points each one of them is likely to gain a new milestone which can be a new ability which is alot more important when you can use more than one at a time and arent just using one of them every so often and each point that didnt get you a milestone gave stat bonuses which can really help.

&gt; Every weapon didn't feel like a copy-paste version of the next one

i can see where you are coming from but this is an argument in so many RPG's however each weapon did have differences, some times subtle but they did and it became more apparent with the end game ones, at mods to that mix and you can go from an AR shooting 10 bullets 15m in front of you or one that never overheats or misses.

&gt;clunky

i personnally dont feel thats the case, the mako's a little silly and ME2 was a MUCH smoother third person shooter but that says more on ME2, I really felt good with how ME1 handled. all in all i LOVED the strategic and unique genre blending combat that became generic third person shooter combat in 2


&gt;I was fine going back to square one

i get that but you became a hero in number one, all that you accomplished socially is thrown away, you are back to square one, that is a cheap way of dealing with difficulty and makes it a rehash imo, i want a ME where i can enjoy having accomplished something and have the world react to that. it would be a really different experience than going from the human spectre that no one is sure about because the were rumors about him killing nihlus and such to the human spectre who know one is sure about since people say he is working with terrorists. Imagine a mass effect game where the descisions you made had an actual impact on the next game? its the same reason people hated 3.


&gt;which were mostly just plot points

exactly! the learning about the reapers was well paced out and that is only about the reapers. I did appreciate the new setting a bit and the midpoint of a triliogy is the best point to do such things but I dont really know why i was there half the time, because I wanted to track down some scientist? how do i know he can actually fight? i dont like tali for this reason but pretty much every squad mate in 1 were harden vets. not some silly krogan baby, another childish person (who was supposed to be the worlds best biotic), a teenager on a gap year, two terrorists and a geth, seriously thats just weird, they made up a plot twist that allowed him in and why did legion never get round to fixing the hole in his chest? some characters i liked and some missions i liked but loads i couldnt care when I am trying to save the universe, if the game started off at the same point but instead of being blown up shepard is searching outside council space for prothean artifacts where people hate him for saving the council or love him for it that would be cool, cut the collectors right out, it felt like some random bit added because they wanted a different and less interesting enemy than the geth. I do appreciate seeing more of the universe but i dont think it made sense why alot of the time, running errands and such that wasted tension and alot of the information was either about the silly collectors (where were they in ME1? soveriegn could have used shepard dying during that game).

I love mass effect and its because of that that i hate ME2, because i felt ripped off buying it day one. i think I should just not buy any bioware game sequels in the future"

&gt;At the hearing, Ms. McCallister proclaimed the accuser ""very credible"" and attested to the belief that Mr. Strange was ""a potential threat to [the accuser's] safety."" But Ms. McCallister disavowed knowledge even of the accuser's version of events. ""As a safe-harbor advocate, I really don't need to know a lot of details, and so I didn't ask her to go into great detail,"" Ms. McCallister said. ""I don't really want survivors to have to tell their story over and over again.""

&gt;Ms. McCallister had referred the accuser to Kelley Taylor, the university's sex-discrimination enforcer and the accuser's second witness. Ms. Taylor also described the accuser as ""credible"" and added that she found the allegation ""very compelling.""

&gt;Mr. Dodge asked Ms. Taylor to describe ""typical behaviors"" of ""somebody who may have undergone a sexual assault."" She listed three. First, ""they frequently cry."" Second, ""their storytelling is sometimes disjointed, sometimes not."" Third, ""there's often a lot of emotion inserted into the story that is about being very upset or in disbelief or unsure what to do next, petrified.""

&gt;The second ""behavior"" is tautological; every story either is or is not disjointed. The third is a windy elaboration of the first. Thus Ms. Taylor's testimony amounted to a claim that in principle a woman's tears are sufficient to establish a man's guilt—an inane stereotype that infantilizes women in the interest of vilifying men.

scatmanbynight,pics,1388631199.0,"&gt; I cant shift the burden of proof onto you by saying ""you are wrong.

It's fascinating that you call something stupid that you so obviously don't understand. That's not what it is saying. It's saying that when someone makes an explicit denial (i.e., you are wrong), than the burden of proof is on them. Let's take your example:

&gt; I say ""there is no gravity, there is actually small gremlins holding us down""

The burden of proof is on you.

&gt; ""no in fact gravity is the way it works""

The burden of proof is on me. I can show the person loads of evidence on why gravity works. 

&gt; I cant shift the burden of proof onto you by saying ""you are wrong.""

You didn't. You shifted it back to yourself by making an explicit denial. This is not a negative in the sense that you think it is. 

This is why you hear some atheists making a distinction between being agnostic atheist (I do not believe there is a god - a negative) vs gnostic atheist (There is no god). This distinction is important because the agnostic atheist has no burden of proof, the gnostic atheist does. 


&gt; This is mindblowingly stupid.

This is basic Logic and Rhetoric 102 stuff. You're welcome to pretend that there is no such thing. Not my issue if you choose to remain ignorant. The quote I pulled out was from a reliable source. It directly contradicts what you're saying. Don't be stubborn.


Edit: In response to your edit:


Do you not understand what this means?:

&gt; If this negative assertion is in **response to a claim** made by another party in a debate

This is exactly what the person was doing. Jesus Christ, man. This is black and white. If a person says ""you are wrong"", the burden of proof can be shifted to them. End of story. Cut and dry."

I feel if you fantasize or watch p you're focusing too much on that and not enough on your actual pleasure and feelings of it. Just my thoughts.

The people who were in the dance classes were new at it too, and we're all getting better at approximately the same rate. Some people are better than others, sure, but I have a secret weapon: I can practice. I can supplement my lessons with lessons at another studio. I can do things to make sure that I'm always getting better. And it's difficult and sometimes I get frustrated. But I'm never going in and making a total fool out of myself. Everyone knows I'm there to learn, nobody expects me to be good at it already.

I'm 32 and have never kissed anyone. There's no kissing class where you're assigned an equally inexperienced partner and you can practice with each other. There's no teacher to break it down and make it easy. I can't even date someone I suspect might be inexperienced, because I would not have any idea how to find such a person, short of hanging around playgrounds. 

The long and short of it is that most of the people I might kiss have probably already done it hundreds of times with many people. They expect that I've done the same. And even after I summon up the courage to ask them out, they can and do reject me, and that totally breaks any forward momentum I had going.

Jrodicon,skeptic,1388631649.0,"There is no proof here. I am not a quantum physicist, just a undergraduate physics student. I'm not saying that Green is wrong, he could be completely right, but all this is is theory. Physicists saw weird things (as they often do), and Green cried out ""Multiverse!"". Since there is no solid science to the multiverse, lots of things could point towards a multiverse, since you can essentially modify the theory to match the context. The articles also talk about links between gravity, dark matter/energy, and the multiverse, but we don't understand gravity or dark matter/energy very well at all in the first place. Maybe a multiverse theory could tie these ideas together and solidify them to fill in the blanks, but until we get solid tangible evidence, any solution we come up with could be completely wrong.

From here it is a bit of a stretch to claim any of this to be proof of alternate realities experienced by drug users. I was pretty convinced by this stuff as well after a bit of experimentation with psychedelics but ultimately had to completely dismiss my experience of all validity when I repeatedly saw why my experience and the things I learned from it to be very wrong. It just made me FEEL like there was some realty to my experience, but in the end I concluded that the drugs were tricking me into a false, unjustified sense of certainty. That being said, the experience helped me to more clearly understand my known tangible reality, but saying that my ""sixth sense"" about the intangible was perfectly right would be ignorant."

Reddit is a place where people aren't held accountable for what they say and it definitely brings out a mix of suppressed misogyny and mob every-one-else-thinks-its-funny mentality.

Why? Because more profits for them. Or do you have a complete and utter lack of historical knowledge outside of what your libertarian echo chambers have told you? 

Also, if you cripple the government, how can they stop them from ruling over you? Are you really this naive? 

And how do they dismantle despotic business? Why not stop businesses from becoming despotic to begin with? You do this by abandoning your bull**** ""free market"" principles. You do this by allowing the government to regulate. You do this by allowing a basic income to minimize our reliance on these businesses for our wealth in the first place.

by_a_pyre_light,Games,1388631914.0,"I understand. There are reports of Arkham Origins' QTE boss battles having a similar issue. I think that part of the issue may be that most PC keyboards only respond to one letter key at once, so a mechanical keyboard may resolve the issue because they can recognize multiple keys simultaneously. 

Anyway though, my point still stands that anyone interested in a fighting game, especially Mortal Kombat, would likely already have a controller or recognize the need for one, since the game has always been played with a joystick and buttons, from its earliest arcade days to its console days. Some games are built with specific controlling devices in mind - fighters are built for controllers, EYEs are built for mice and keyboards. Technically you could reverse those, but it's not the natural design of the game and the games suffer as a result.

I understand your preference for an independent 'community-based' event, but in this case the community bads outweigh the community goods.  Find a warehouse somewhere and trash that."

If someone is transgender, they'd just adjusting themselves to match up with what their gender truly is.  Everyone else doesn't have to, since it lines up plenty good enough.

And, when it comes to gender - I believe it's just genetic in origin.  Every person has a certain energy to themselves, a certain place they fall in the spectrum from the most masculine to the most feminine, regardless of assigned gender at birth - from Ellen DeGeneres being a tomboy to Prince rocking heels back in the day.  And, those people identify as CIS.  

It's only when it's even more extreme does someone need to make things line up better to allow themselves a happier life.

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1388632112.0,"B for A substitutions in situations that require negotiating a personal issue are typically a sign of an avoidant personality disorder, not narcissism (although some avoidants display signs of narcissism developed as a layer of ego insulation).

Avoidance can be triggered by a shitload of different childhood issues, but typically in men who seek promiscuity without emotional connection, it comes back to dear old mom, including emotional negligence (but not physical negligence, which will generally lead to some form of sociopathy), an asexual image of the mother (divorce or widowing without remarriage or dating,  hyper-feminism, and hyper-religiosity are popular sources), a burdensome family load (lots of little siblings to take care of), poor modeling of pair bonding (lack of proper male-female relationships for role modeling).

The upside is that about 50% of the literature for TRP is basically a re-hash of treatment programs for avoidant behavior. Work on social skills, force yourself to go out an engage, don't over-weight the value of response, even creating a lifestyle that attracts others -- all that actually shows up in the lit for AvPD. It's pretty much TRP minus the right-wing political stuff.

The big difference is that AvPD therapists will tell you to work on understanding the emotional world of the people that you mean to seduce. That is to say that you might benefit from trying to appreciate their reality rather than dehumanizing them.

Based on my knowledge of both TRP and AvPD, I'd say that's where you're at. And, honestly? That's disappointing. Because you can appreciate women for just being women. Yeah, it's harder in a world where they're not taught to appreciate the joy of being women, but . . . they're not all empty husks of vapidity. And, yes, a fair number of them are boring, but let's not act like we're just an army of fiery Latin lovers waiting to leave them all a bunch of quivering wrecks.

Perhaps you'd benefit from some further distance from women for the time being. It doesn't sound like you're wild about the results you're getting.

One of the downside to TRP is that it doesn't supply much of an answer to the ""now what?"" question. You're not going to magically de-program the desire for a fulfilling relationship with a person you value and who values you. TRP will tell you how to get to a certain point with women, but beyond that point the rate of return drops pretty dramatically. After that, it becomes your problem.

I'd encourage you to either go for full distance from women for a while, or to at least explore their world a little more before defaulting to ""hate fuck"". You're dumping a lot of expectations on a woman who is likely not much more than a random stranger."

AssaultKommando,starcitizen,1388632239.0,"Outmaneuver - likely not, or at least not by a telling margin that'd dictate your strategy. It's also debatable if that'll have the effect you think it does. Someone who translates energy fighting or boom and zoom tactics to space will be able to bounce you repeatedly and at will, and there'll be very little you can do about it. It'll be the Pacific air war wrought in miniature, but without the earlier phase of Japanese dominance.

Let's face it, the Hornet is a dedicated space superiority fighter. The 325a is a rich man's toy with a few guns and missiles tacked on. It won't embarrass itself, but the technical specs are firmly in the Hornet's favour. Barring a massive skill disparity, I'd expect the Hornet to ream the 325a at least 75% of the time. Given the panoply of weaponry it mounts (2 each in the nose, canards, wingtips and turret), the first time you appear in its gunsights will likely be the last. Heck, it can probably peck you to death with the turret while both of you are stalemated.

All my schools were 50% Asian as well. So that actually made me in the majority. As well, places I have been, no one gave a single shit about race. No one paid attention to it. You did not deserve to experience this.  

Life it seems can be so cruel, you did not deserve to be in your circumstances.

You said you can't move out, maybe that can be a long term goal? You are so discriminated, you do not deserve that, you at least deserve to make equal money, over here, that is an offense against the law. 

As well, do you have anything that you are proud of? Anything that you are really good at? You may have heard this a thousand times, but people tell me all the time that if you focus on you, and doing things that make you happy, then everything else falls into place. Everyone has something that makes them tick.

I use Frank Yang as an example. He was once someone incredibly shy and awkward, and one day decided to change.

Now he lifts nonstop, and has made inspirited many people. He inspired me.

He is someone who found something to be incredibly proud of, and I think that helps.  He found something that made him tick.

Laozen,taoism,1388632427.0,"Wow! You've done your homework! For me, the idea of rebirth is really not so much literal as it is a means of describing the repeating pattern of existence. A man is born, lives, and dies, but at the moment of his death, into the world comes another life and the cycle repeats of the illusion of division, but all things inherently have the Tao as their source, or rather, the very concept of Tao by its nature places it as an inherent quality of being, what Zen students call Tathata, 'suchness' or 'thusness.' In this cyclic yet centered way, the game of existence continues indefinitely.

If I am the sum of my parts in harmony, and these elements are all part of a larger harmony, then what am I but an eddy in the ocean of the Tao? Therefore, what is death to me, the real and fundamental me that lies beneath the paper-thin shell of my ego? In this sense I'm as old as the universe, older even if I can speak for the Tao that not only is within me but is the very essence, the very core of my being! All I see and experience, all this is not only filtered through my senses but through my brain, which is fed by the very things I experience. *I* am that which I experience, I am, and you are, the Tao!"

That's fine, but it does seem like the parameters have been narrowed to a point that focuses only on the more outrageous, populist forms of religious enquiry (creationism, intelligent design, literal readings of the scriptures). I'm not convinced these type of views are held by the majority of people who self-identify as Christian, so it is no wonder people complain when they are reduced to a kindergarten understanding of God."

GetOffMyLawn_,sysadmin,1388632582.0,"It depends where you work. My last gig was 23 years. In that time I pretty much had the same job I was hired for but also about a dozen more. This was through 4 company mergers, department reorganizations and 3 or 4 corporate restructurings. We were constantly trained in new technologies and the team itself was full of lifers. The noob at been there 7 years. We had a solid team and the company was very big on respect in the workplace. People genuinely tried to be nice to each other and we got way more done in that type of environment. Not being nice was not tolerated, you would get educated on how to be a team player. A lot of us could have gone out and gotten way way more pay in the financial sector or as consultants, and a few did, but most of us didn't. The lack of politics down at our level along with the constant technical challenge made it a happy place to be a geek. The company was also family oriented, so lots of relatives on board, and lot of people had grown up in the area and gone to school together. Not so much in my group but that still made it feel like one big happy family. And then once you get so many years with the company the extra vacation weeks kick in, as does vesting in savings plans and the pension. And then I got within striking distance of early retirement, we had a nice early retirement policy, so I hung in there until was able to bail early with medical insurance and a pension. (Pension maxes out after 40 years of service and yes we had quite a few people maxing that out. No forced retirement either.)"

for me, over-eating has never been an issue, it's food choices and lack of activity. I know I have a big challenge to correct my food choices. I do like and enjoy healthy food.. I just... like and enjoy convenient junk better lol.. I know Ill have to grit through it and allow my brain to reprogram itself like you said.

I think my biggest hurdle is the not giving up. I do tend to have a defeatist attitude ""oh I totally blew today.. well.. screw it"". So I really appreciate your tips on the mind-set!

Greyalpha,AskWomen,1388632628.0,"&gt;Some sexist men, particularly nervous can't-not-objectify-you guys, see women and think of them as walking vaginas, hence their inability to relate to them as fellow human beings. So go talk to those guys about how theyre transphobic. 

Not all women have vaginas and not all who have vaginas are women. You said that not them. What you said was transphobic.

&gt;No one said hurr hurr theyre sexist. They ARE sexist. You were excusing their actions based on motives saying if their intent isnt malicious, its not so bad. I say, it is. To you, that's ""hurr hurr"" I guess. 

The hurr hurr comes from your knee jerk reaction in which you made completely unfounded and baseless allegations about the mentalities of men you read one paragraph about.

&gt;Sexism doesnt mean ""hating"" women. It means excluding them, treating them differently solely because of their gender. OP experienced TEXTBOOK sexism. 

So all strait men must be sexist because they only date women and thus treat them different. I will look forward to all of your accusation of sexism on all the comments in this subreddit where women talk about how they treat men differently."

However if that clip didn't cut out so early you'd hear the rest of his argument which makes it clear that what he meant was women are built for sex, and since rape is forced sex it would be less of a painful ordeal to deal with and get past than a guy getting beaten so bad that he is an inch away from his life, but lives because guys aren't built to be beaten up.

Should? No. That's why my original reply said...

Take a debate competition. If this same situation happened and person A asked person B why they made an explicit denial, they wouldn't be critiqued for misunderstanding burden of proof. They'd lose if they didn't have sources, but not because of a burden of proof mistake. Meanwhile, if person B tried to point out a burden of proof mistake, they would be critiqued for doing so.

Point being, if you're going to be so insulting to the person you replied to, when you could have framed the reply in the calm manner you did here, you should make sure you understand the basis of your insult. "

I'm I so fucking old that work ""hookup"" no longer means sex? Fuuuuuuuck, I am sooooooo old. Get off my lawn.

Honestly? You sound like my one friend who's 22 years old. He was a skinny dude who had to go fucking insane to put on weight. And then he'd mindlessly nice guy his way through shit like a swol nice guy.

These days he's really good. The first thing he did was assemble a very good social circle. In fact, I know him through a family friend who functions as a bit of a fixer for people (in the touristy TV show sense of the term, not the Tarentino movie sense of the word) who basically took him on as a rebuilding project. Now that group of guys just rolls, raises hell, and lets women kind of come to them. If you're in good shape and you and your friends are having a good time, women will come to you.

(Disclaimer: I generally roll solo and kind of ping around like a free electron among social circles that I know when I'm out, but that's just how I'm comfortable -- I have to have an easy escape hatch when I socialize.)"

sammynicxox,changemyview,1388632918.0,"I, personally, couldn't have an abortion. Especially as I've already had a child so I know what pregnancy feels like and at what stages, and I can't imagine terminating a pregnancy (outside of the very rare chance of a life/death situation or whatever) and we'd *make it work*, but I also have amazing health insurance and my husband and I both have stable, full time jobs. If that changed and we were living near poverty with one child already, I'd likely consider adoption because it seems very irresponsible to bring more children into my family if I'm already struggling to care for the family I already have. Of course we're very careful, but things happen.

My mom did that with my brother. I was four. She was working three jobs and couch hopping, I was living with my dad. She was in a very, very abusive relationship with an absolutely psychotic man. She managed to get out, get a restraining order, and get herself in a safer position. But she knew there was no way she could care for a second child when she already was struggling to keep her head above water and couldn't provide for the child she already had at all. So. She opted for adoption.

But, unfortunately, that's not always an option a lot of people consider because it involves giving up your body and possibly your health. I can understand both sides and try to remain respectful of the fact that I may not know someone's private situation. "

I was really surprised (he had great makeout instincts!). We agreed that we both felt a bit put on the spot and decided not to go further that night, but after a couple more dates his virginity was done for. I was really happy to be with him for his first time and I think he appreciated that I was more experienced (ahem). 

I can't tell you how other girls will react, but I was glad to know ahead of time that my bf was a virgin, only because he was feeling weird about it, and we were able to work through some of the weirdness by communicating. But, I am glad he waited to bring it up until it was clear to both of us that we were interested in going to bed together. If he'd brought it up earlier it might have seemed like too big of an assumption.

He is still deliberately taking the focus away from Mary, and inferring the equally-blessed-ness of those who hear the word and keep it.  I am not denying--nor was Edwards, who says in this post, ""Great was the privilege [of Mary]""--it is just that Scripture seems plain that to glorify Mary *above* others is incorrect.  And so Jesus graciously redirects the woman in the crowd; and in the other example, when the man says his mother wants to speak to Him, He responds by verbally denying that she's even His mother!  He seems to have gone out of his way to affirm that she had no *special* consideration beyond that of any who do the will of God.  I understand that this was to make a point in light of his audience (He obviously didn't disown Mary as His mother, as we see at the cross), however, He does seem determined to restrict any attempt to elevate her *above* others.

I am just confused why, if Christ wanted Mary to be exalted in this way, why He would continually cut down those who tried to do so and redirect everyone's attention to the ""common"" believer.  This happens again in Mark 3, of course."

When Tolkien writes about a forest, he really wanted you to know how forresty that particular forest was. 

Jokes aside, he makes you feel like you're really there, to the point that when I watched the films, I couldn't really fault Peter Jackson for the vision of the whole thing. I've read the LoTR series many times over the years, and those films were pretty damn close to my imaginings. IMO this is only really possible because the old man made sure you knew precisely what everything looked like.

The only parts I find hard to re-read are the introspective character dialogues, particularly between Frodo and Sam. By all means give the books a go, and if you get bogged down in some of the description, by all means skip ahead, it's unlikely you'll miss anything critical to the plot. If you're of a mind to though, read the descriptions and try to picture the locations in your mind, you won't be disappointed. "

That's why the analogy is apt - the AK47 and Chromecast are both cheap, reliable, and easy to use. The AK47 is the gun of revolutionaries for just these reasons, and perhaps the Chromecast will be the device that allows the masses to ""rise up"" and force the content oligarchy to change.

lit-lover,AskReddit,1388633652.0,"Chili. Oh my goodness chili is super easy. Here's how I do, and everyone who's ever had mine tells me its damn delicious. Here's my sweet ""breakfast chili"" recipe:

* 1/2 lb (maple) bacon
* 2 lbs of ground breakfast sausage
* 2 lbs ground beef
* 1 large Vadalia onion
* 1 packet of chili seasoning (meant for 1 lb of meat)
* 1 can of chili beans 
* 1-2 cans of other beans (light or dark kidney or black)
* 1 large can of tomato sauce
* 1 large can of chopped tomatoes
* 1 airplane bottle (100 ml) of bourbon whiskey
* brown sugar
* maple syrup
* salt &amp; pepper

In terms of materials, you'll need only a large frying pan and stockpot. You can always half the recipe (it is rather large), but it does really well in the fridge/freezer. 

Fry the bacon until it is pretty crispy. Remove from pan and keep the grease in the pan. Break up the bacon into small pieces and place small pieces in the stockpot while it is ***not*** on the heat. Then, brown your sausage in bacon grease. When it is nearly done, sprinkle in some brown sugar and mix in. Then, drain in such a way that you keep the grease in the pan but transfer the meat to the stockpot. Repeat process (fry in previous meat's grease) with ground beef and add the spice packet when it is nearly done. Transfer meat to stockpot keeping said grease in pan. Finally, saute the onion in the bacon/sausage/beef/chili spices grease until soft. As that's going on, add the can of tomatoes (with juice) and tomato sauce to the stockpot and turn on the stove. Then, add the beans (do not drain chili beans can but do drain the other cans) to the stockpot as well as the whiskey, about two tablespoons of brown sugar, and about a tablespoon of maple syrup. When the onions are done add them after draining. Stir everything together and boil for roughly 7 minutes (mostly to burn of the alochol flavor but also to blend the flavors). Season with salt and pepper to taste, but make sure it boils at least a little after you add more spices. Eat. Be happy. Have a heart attack. 

Know that this chili is ***super dense and thick***. Think hearty as fuck. 
 
If you like spicier chili, use non-maple bacon, and change the sausage to 1 lb and the beef to 3 lbs. Use pepper to season all the meats and salt only for the beef (pork is already salty enough). Increase chili seasoning packets to 3. Saute a couple of cloves of garlic alongside the onion. Don't use maple syrup or brown sugar to season at the end but Sriracha (RIP) instead. Bam. Spicy chili :)

Also, this is one of those recipes with which you can get creative, changing your ingredients to your personal palate. "

I think Edwards would agree, as per his phrasing, ""surely that was not so great a privilege as it was to have the grace of God in the heart, to have Christ, as it were, born in the soul.""  The title of the post is unfortunate--I think the argument for our being MORE blessed than Mary would be John 20:29, or perhaps to argue that others than Mary might do more faithfully the will of God.  But at any rate, I agree that she shared in the blessings of salvation. :)  I think that is missing the point of the post, however, which is that we have the blessing of the Helper, and of seeing Scripture confirmed in Christ's death and resurrection, of believing without seeing, etc., and, all importantly, that God's blessings to us are equally beyond counting."

We do not need to approve of their various other specific beliefs/practices in order to believe they were *dead-on-correct* in this one thing. Hence we can honor them and refer to them without imitating them on all points.

Likewise, we ourselves are flawed as they were, in ways unique to our time. I'm sure in 300 years our generation in America will be viewed as horribly depraved in our own ways, much like the Founding Fathers are vilified by so many nowadays for having owned slaves.

panjatogo,worldbuilding,1388633852.0,"It seems like a very interesting world, but I have three main comments:

IIRC deserts are frequently caused by mountain ranges as clouds are stopped by the peaks on one side so rain doesn't get to the desert on the other. Even if the planet in general gets more rain than earth, since you described it as having many mountain ranges, I would probably still expect more than a few deserts, or at least dry areas.

Why is there more hydrogen? Is there some kind of natural process (something like photosynthesis or something geological, like volcanoes releasing CO2) that releases hydrogen into the air? Is it cosmic? Or is it just some unexplained phenomenon? Hydrogen gas reacts incredibly easily, so it is not very stable in air, which is why there is practically none in earth's atmosphere, so for it to be present, it would need a regular source. I'm not a xenometeorologist, though, so there might be a different way for it to happen on a habitable planet that I don't know about.

Why do the native people purposely remove digits? Does doing so give them problems walking or anything? In humans, every toe is important in maintaining balance, so if they evolved with 6 digits, I would guess that they would be the same. That's not to say that it can't be something commonly done, but it seems like a particularly crippling body modification, so I'd be surprised if there weren't repercussions."

Of course, the very very large majority also realize that these characters are not real and will never be, but still, the mind is an odd place of imagination.

oniongasm,FeMRADebates,1388633940.0,"Not at all, I copied that from an comment of mine months ago. I just recognized the numbers in your post.

That said I have issues with the stats you've used. If mothers get sole custody 44% of the time in court and 63% of the time after mediation, how can fathers also get partial/full custody 70% of time when they fight for it? The numbers seem contradictory.

As for your talking points (thanks for those btw, I like them!):

1. If the stats I reformatted are any indicator, then it's frankly unclear. But this is how I think about it: if it's going to court, both parties are likely going to want at least partial custody. And if it's 44/40/11 for FEMALE/JOINT/MALE custody, that means women get some form of custody 84% of the time. Men get it 51%. To put it another way, women are only denied custody 16% of the time, men are denied 49% of the time.

2. I think that the MRM should *absolutely* try to encourage men to seek custody. But a lot of that is my bias towards the nuclear family, frankly.

3. In a roundabout way, sure. But not particularly much, or all that quickly. Let's take the thought ""women are weaker, but they are better caregivers"". If you say ""women can do anything men can do"" you will certainly fight gender roles, but you won't do much to help dispel the idea ""men are worse caregivers"". The idea that men are worse caregivers is very closely related to the idea that women are better, *but they are not the same idea*.

4. Your math is wrong. 33% of men want no custody. HOWEVER: those men who want no custody are going to face little opposition from their former partners (82% of whom want sole custody). These men aren't going to be the ones going to mediation, or going to courts. I mean, that's just my assumption but it seems to track. It's the 66/67% who want custody who are going to be dealing with the system. They'd be the ones to deal with any bias.

5. I'd argue that the mediation cases are relevant as well. So let's say the 80% that don't deal with any 3rd party. The men here aren't being actively discriminated against, but I'd assume that more men would seek custody if they were socialized to do so. As for those going to remediation, I'd guess that most men want some form of custody if they're there. And women get sole custody 63% of the time. That seems off, but I don't know enough of the process to say why.

6. If I had to guess? Pressure from legal proceedings leads one or both parties to say ""Fuck these legal fees, we both see how this is happening, let's settle."""

Comma20,ffxiv,1388633960.0,"Basically, Twintania (And any other monster) has a priority list of abilities, and will cast them, when possible when they are off cooldown in that priority list.

So lets say the list is (I can't remember exactly) Plummet, Death Sentence, Conflag, Fireball, all with their own cooldowns.

Even if you are expecting a Conflag and it comes off cooldown, if Plummet is off cooldown, Twintania will use it, then immediately after Twintania will use Conflag. These are both put on cooldown, and will be used based on priority when off cooldown. What is likely happening for you is that due to DPS timings in Phase 1 (Sometimes you'll get a little more or a little less), the necklace is breaking at different portions, causing Twintania to want to cast in different orders.

You can resolve this, by pausing DPS at a certain point (just before necklace break), then forcing the break straight after an ability (Death Sentence or Plummet) to make everything line up nice and consistently."

Pretty sure there are individuals paying those taxes that you impose upon them. You know, like how in the first part of this very post you say that you are dictating what individuals can and cannot earn.

whatwatwhutwut,TrueAtheism,1388634471.0,"I think that your analogy ignores several issues, first and foremost that Phil Robertson is functionally a brand ambassador. His expressed views and values reflect on his employer. My employment would be at risk were I in the same position and sought to comment on controversial issues through very public media. I would similarly acknowledge my employer's right to free expression through distancing itself from me (in direct response to my expressed views).

I do think that society would be better if a general response to such statements were argument, yes, but I personally wouldn't want a bigot in my employ. If someone happens to hold certain personal views that I disagree with, that's their business. The moment they make their views public, that's no longer a private, personal matter. If it's going to affect my potential income, I have every right to respond as I see fit. Of course, I feel that A&amp;E was merely taking advantage of an opportunity for publicity (whether or not this is so, it paid off), so I am more arguing in favour of the spirit of their actions as opposed to what they may or may not have done."

Indorill,htpc,1388634610.0,"I tried doing something like this, and for me I couldnt get it to work.

Using VM's and IOUMMU/PCIe passthrough it is theoretically possible.  I ran into problems with finding the right mix of hardware and VM hypervisors.  I tried this a little over a year ago, and things are changing so it may go better now.

Ultimately though you will find that there is lots of hardware out there that should work with ESXi/KVM and GPU passthrough.  The difficulty is that sometimes it still wont work. Then you need to return hardware, and buy other pieces, until you find the right combination.

I tried this with an AMD 6300 and an ASROCk Extreme3 mobo. Both should support VT-D/IOMMU passthrough.  Proxmox/KVM would not pass through any of my hardware to a VM, and ESXi only passed through my RAID card.  Neither hypervisor was able to passthrough my network cards or a GPU.  Sure it would setup like it did, but the VMs were unstable and didnt work.

I eventually upgraded my rig to an actual Supermicro server motherboard and an opteron processor.  All my network cards, and my RAID card passed through just fine to different VMs.  I was unable passthrough any PCIe GPUs to VMs.  

I have seen that there is a new version of ESXi out now, and it includes supposedly vastly superior GPU passthrough support.  If I had the money and inclination to do it all again I would get server mobo/CPU, and a couple of GPU's with HDMI out and try that route. 

Based on my experience and the effort/cost it would take to do it though I would recommend against it.  I would say build 2 small HTPC's and put them in a case that supports 2 motherboards like the ones from Mountain Mods if you are so inclined.  

Even if you can get an ESXI server setup to run multiple HTPCs with GPU passthrough, then you still need another PC for management purposes.  Well there are some work arounds, but again, its a major pain in the ass.  

I finally used my ESXi server to run pfsense for routing, UnRaid for a media server and plex, and a few other VMs for things like website hosting.  I then just use my tiny HTPC's and Roku boxes to connect to my media server via plex. It works great from home, or when on the road.  I have to RDP to a VM in order to copy my files from my travel PC to my UnRaid server, but if you are into things like usenet then thats not really necessary."

JustinJamm,Christianity,1388634645.0,"People are given rules/laws in scripture, yes. But in the New Testament, people are generally *told/appealed to* when it comes to what's right.

For instance, Paul *appeals with* Philemon to accept his runaway slave Onesimus as a brother, rather than as a slave. He does not use force or manipulation upon Philemon to make him release Onesimus.

In the same way, I believe scripture would uphold justice, while appealing to all victims to forgive, although they have the right NOT to forgive -- and the rest of us are bound to stand up for the victim, rather than legislating to the victim that they have no right to be avenged.

(Abolishing the death penalty can actually be more about *preventing the State itself from doling out death*, rather than declaring that victims cannot ask that the death penalty be applied. I myself find it wrong to *actively stop* victims from seeking ""balance"" justice, but I would also counsel those victims towards forgiveness. The power of forgiveness goes much further to showing compassion to criminals than passing a law to simply prevent a specific consequence.)"

Since he has been HC our drafts have actually been pretty good. His first pick was Tyron Smith our franchise LT and 1 of our 2 probowlers. Jerry hadn't spent a first round pick on OL in like 20 years before that. Then this past draft we trade back in the first, still nab our franchise center, and pick up a 3rd round receiver who as a rookie took control as our #2 so we can cut Miles Austin June 1st and save 5mil in cap space. (Which we desperately need cause of Jerry's awful Contract/draft/trade decisions before Garret showed up.)

Look, no one in their right mind would think Garret is even a average game day coach. He just isn't. But he brings the personnel and locker room stuff. Maybe he will get better at gameday coaching? We know for a fact Jerry won't get better at GM. At least Garret has his ear enough to control the players we draft. That gives us a chance to compete.

Drakkanrider,sex,1388634851.0,"I'm going to assume you watch pornography, because it seems like most people on this sub do.  Even if you don't, I think the analogy is still useful.

So, in this porn you're jerking it to women with giant fake tits.  You like looking at those porn star tits, they turn you on.  They're big and round and bouncy and you like thinking about sticking your face in them or squeezing them  Are you going to be unhappy in a relationship with any woman who doesn't have giant fake tits?  Probably not.  Would you want an average-breasted woman you loved to break up with you because of the giant stripper titties in your porn fantasies?  Would you want her to feel like she isn't enough for you because you like getting off to other women?

Unless your gf's fantasies and fetiches are extreme to the point where she cannot get off unless they  are involved, or sex is unfulfilling if they're not involved every time (which I'm doubting), then there shouldn't be a problem.  DP is pretty easy to do with one person, just get a dildo and/or a buttplug.  You can roleplay a gangbang if you want.  I don't know what to do about the black guy thing, but I somehow doubt she'd be dating you if she was incapable of getting off to a white guy.  Hell, practice an accent and blindfold her or something if you need to.  I guess my point is that there are a lot of creative ways to explore a fetish or fantasy that don't involve sleeping with other people.  And if you don't want to even make that effort, then it's up to your girlfriend to decide whether she can't live with a relationship that doesn't incorporate those aspects of her sexuality.  You need to talk with her about that instead of making the decision for her without a discussion.

Edit: And please don't listen to the people saying ""Automatic dealbreaker, dump her.""  It's up to you two to decide how to approach this and what to do about it and you should at least talk to her about it."

RichardBehiel,woahdude,1388634870.0,"Sadly, government-funded space programs are at the mercy of the political climate, which has a tendency to worry about the petty shit.

That's why I'm so excited about SpaceX, a relatively new private company that launches satellites into space and will be launching American astronauts soon for the first time since the shuttle program ended.  Currently, roughly 60% of their revenue comes from non-NASA customers, so the company is resilient to the whims of politicians.  I'm hoping we'll continue to see them accomplish great things.

Check out /r/SpaceX if you're interested.  It's a great way to keep up with the latest SpaceX news, and the community is wonderful.  The next launch is this Friday!"

* The H60 is essentially a useless purchase, and performs worse than air cooler counterparts. H80i is the minimum buy.

* While that motherboard is a good model, it's likely a lot more than you will actually need. I saved some money by getting a more reasonable model capable of overclocking.

* 16gb of memory is useless to gamers and regular use, no matter how powerful the placebo effect is. It's only useful to video editors and the like.

* The 840 Pro 256gb is a pointless buy. You don't need that much SSD space. The Pro is only marginally better than the Evo as well.

* Got you a far better GTX 780 model, overclocked with EVGA's ACX cooler.

* I own the HAF XB, while it's a nice platform, the Corsair 540 Air is a far better design.

* 750w isn't quite enough to SLI with top end GPU's safely. With that in mind I scaled down to a high quality 650w."

I had a question. Is there any place we can see David Silverman's ""true"" drawing style? The commentators have mentioned that some animations were ""distinctly David Silverman"" (like the episode where Homer has a bum heart and Mr. Burns is telling him he's terrible and then the heart basically explodes -- the whole time Homer is giving a really bizarre series of facial and body expressions). But they were still in the Simpsons universe, so I wasn't sure what David Silverman's ""actual"" style was.

Feel free to disagree with him on the second thing if you want it doesn't really pertain to the argument we were having, but for argument's sake I'll play devil's advocate.

Male bodies aren't built to take a beating, at least not inherently. Sure you can build muscle to take a punch to the arm better but that doesn't work here. It doesn't matter whether men are inherently built for it or not, that would only matter if the argument was comparing how built women are for being beaten to how built men are for being beaten. It doesn't matter if you're built for it, you're going to be beaten within an inch of your life. Regardless of how your genetics are, or how how strong you are being beaten almost to death is going to be as painful for a buff dude as it is for a skinny dude.

Being beaten to death quantity wise (how long the beating is, how much effort the person/people have to hit you) will vary more for a skinny guy than a muscular guy, but quality wise (the pain you'll feel) will be the same because in both cases regardless of how strong you are you're going to be equally close to death."

Meanwhile, the 20 part of the crowd are the ones being silent about TRP. You'll get ugly chicks all day talking about how bad TRP is, but it's not common to get a top 20 chick bitching about TRP. Afterall, she's benefiting from the current model so why should she bother rocking the boat?

On a personal level, I've been with both those groups, and I'll tell you what, it's an entire different zeitgeist between the two.

bunker_man,Christianity,1388635561.0,"I suppose that some people would say that while what they did was wrong, and moral relativity is false, that CULTURAL relativity still applies. Meaning that they lived at a time when it would have seemed natural for them to do this, and so if they were still trying to do so as well as possible, that they might not be fully culpable for not realizing it was wrong.

If you imagine that there is a perfect hypothetical moral state that everyone COULD be in, and everyone exists in a specific cultural place, then they would be judged by how well they, from the place they were in tried to move toward a better one instead of worse. As horrible as it seems to people now, the idea that someone could themselves be owned simply seemed obvious to people in the past. Everything else could, why not people themselves?"

ImaginaryDuck,AskMen,1388635707.0,"I made this decision. I was looking for a gf for a long time because I didn't have anyone who cared about me in my life, including myself. This made me desperate and I ended up in some bad relationships that made things worse for me. 

So I realized I had to care for myself because no one else would. Treat yourself, be kind to yourself(don't be delusional though), get yourself happy with where you are in your life and who you are on your own and people will pick up on that. 

I always wondered why certain guys got girls when I couldn't,  but looking back the guys were just confident and happy and people gravitate towards that. People couldn't stand to be around me when I was depressed and bitter, so I decided to be happy. It isn't always easy, but I made a conscious decisions and effort to eliminate or ignore the negatives in my life and focus on the positives, especially the little things and I am so much happier. People have noticed and now a lot of them really like me, treat me better, and want to be around me.

I haven't found that special someone yet, but that's not to say I haven't had opportunities. I just decided to pass on them because they weren't right for me and they wouldn't have been good for my life, which is a powerful feeling to make that decision.

Yes, load and save times from an SSD is tenfold faster than from an HDD. I'm not saying that getting an SSD now is not a good idea, SSDs now are extremely ubiquitous but you are under a budget. An HDD can do everything an SSD can, sans the speed.

Benchmarks will help you with your choice of 760 + SSD or 770. Remember that you are under a 1000$ budget. Are you satisfied with the performance difference between the 760 and the 770? If yes, then drop that SSD and get that later. If no, then get the 760 and SSD."

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1388635788.0,"Sounds like possible Seasonal Affective Disorder,  of which I suffer a moderate degree.  What has helped: using daylight-spectrum (5000kelvin-6500kelvin) compact fluorescent bulbs, you can find them in most any big box store.  You may have to read the fine print on the package or base of the bulb for kelvin ratings.  Put them in the fixtures near where you tend to spend the most time in your house and see if that helps lighten things for you (pun both intended and unintended).  If you are light-sensitive and find that those are a tad harsh for you, try the [Repti-Glo 2.0](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2752558), which has all of the benefits of the above but with a slightly warmer visual color tone and an exceedingly high color rendering index of 98, which is exceedingly close to sunlight. 

However, don't put it anywhere where it will be within a foot of your skin for long periods of time as extended exposure can cause UV damage.  For the same reason, don't put UV-sensitive items like art, sensitive textiles, or collectibles really close to it either. The amount of UV radiation it puts off is small but still slightly more than that of typical fluorescent bulbs, however it drops off drastically a foot or so from the bulb as the beam spreads.  The product I listed above is normally for reptiles and plant-growing but functions just as well for people.  Keep in mind that you want it in a situation where the bulb is directly exposed to you from a short distance rather than through any sort of shade or smoked glass/plastic lens. It comes in a number of wattages and types, from compact fluorescent to standard T8 fluorescent tubes.  I wish you the best of luck in getting this issue dealt with."

What the author is trying to say is, ""green"" nitrogen rich things (grass clippings, kitchen waste cooked or not) can get stinky.  That's why you need to keep a balanced pile with more ""brown"" carbon rich things, ie, sawdust, dried leaves, straw, etc, to cap the smell and break up the pile so you don't have this festering pile.   Too much green, gross pile.  Too much brown, takes forever.  Mix them together, sweet smelling pile that turns to compost in weeks/months. 

I assure you, the same thing exact thing happens to cooked veggies as to raw, it just moves faster.  Well, cooked veggies won't sprout in the pile.  Only difference. "

LulzGoat,teenagers,1388635953.0,"I don't. I'm a pc geek or whatever (probably not as hardcore as many but I'm getting there). If I had to say why though, it's because of stereotypes. For example, bronies. You pretty much think of [this](http://www.liketotally80s.com/images/my-little-pony-bronies-rjdaae.jpg) or [this](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/030/9/f/ohayocon_2012__bronies_by_bigal2k6-d4o5vyf.jpg). Stereotypes form and those tend to become the representative of all fans of certain things. I for one like MLP: FIM (all the other ones were dumb as fuck, barbie movies would've been better) but I don't behave like that at all. 

Gamers, pc geeks, otakus, they've all got negative connotations attached to them because of overplayed stereotypes. I mostly blame this on human nature and the media. After all, everyone tends to remember negative things over positive ones. The media knows that it's audience prefers hearing about negative things going on in the world vs positive things (not always true, sure, but the negatives are normally what pull the ratings in).

As such, the negative aspects of these cultures are overrepresented and is what we use to label people of all sorts of fandoms. 

Using me as a personal example, I'm into PCs. I love working with hardware and software. I'm also into watching anime and reading manga. Heck, I love reading just about anything (except military novels, those tend to bore me ... and research papers, gawd I hate reading those things). I go to conventions when I've got the time (only been to like 2 in the past 3-4 years). The most typical stereotypes associated with these things would be a neckbeard living with his parents, probably living in their basement. No job and no social life. Most of his time would be spent playing WoW or something like that. 

Of those stereotypes, I'd fill the living with parents one (I'm in university, and it's cheaper commuting from home than renting a place close to the uni) and the no job one by the end of February (contract expiration :S). I'm not a neckbeard (well, during exam season maybe, but my exam beard has always pulled me through) and I'm fit (k, well I've got a bit of flab). I don't go clubbing or anything but I do have friends that I hang out with whenever I can, it's not easy since we all live hundreds of kilometres apart but we manage to do fun stuff outside of school.

TL;DR Stereotypes dawg"

Yoga. Do it. As a fit guy, yoga is the bees-knees even if I wasn't surround by fit women in tank tops. Its calming, relaxing and will defiantly help that heart rate.

Avoid salty foods, HR increase when these are eaten because you body pumps water into your blood to keep salt levels even, but this makes the blood thicker and your heart has to work harder.

What would be good to know is the differences between different guns. For example, a Glock has no safety and it has an internal hammer meaning you can't see whether it's cocked or not from the outside *and* you really have to watch trigger discipline(like you should be doing anyway). 

Another big thing is that guns are *loud*. You can't shoot a gun in a car like in Pulpfiction. I shoot guns and it's loud enough from someome shooting handgun 50 yards downrange so you better have your ear protection on."

Unless there is quite the extenuating circumstance that was left out of the story (and I can't even imagine what it could be anyway) there was no possible reason not to apply a discount card to that script if you had one, or at least cut it back. It's not like you won't probably dispense the rest of a broken box of sumatriptan within a week or two.

SenseiCAY,relationships,1388636285.0,"You made a decision, and in the long run, it will be best for you. You will undoubtedly question the decision because there were clearly good parts to the relationship that you'll miss. You'll think of the great dates you had, the feelings that existed, and the sex that was had, and miss those things, but again, there was a reason for the breakup, and it trumped everything else. I know I had second thoughts when I broke up with a girlfriend, but we broke up with them for a reason, and it doesn't help anyone to try to undo what's been done.

The truth is, your exes probably won't ever completely leave your thoughts. Hell, most of the people that I've ever dated in any capacity haven't completely left my thoughts. You'll eventually get over her and stop thinking of her romantically. That being said, I'm in a relationship now, and there are certain things (places, foods, even certain people) that remind me of people that I've dated, and I'd be lying if I said that they never cross my mind. They all affected my life positively in some way, and I was better off at the end than I was before we met. I lost my virginity to one, I grew a pair of balls and asked a girl out, which led to another, I learned to deal with a bit of heartbreak when I briefly dated a girl but I liked her more than she was into me, and so on. Don't suppress these thoughts. Just think, ""yeah, that was nice, but she wasn't right for me"" and move on. When you can get through your days without getting caught up in these thoughts, then you're ready for a new girl. Everything will be fine.

tl;dr: It's natural. Let it happen, but don't go back on your decision."

Thank you proving my point without me having to say anything. Gluten is this new big bad evil that causes everything... I mean... EVERYTHING... and everyone has hopped on the bandwagon right as they were hopping off the trans-fat wagon (let's not forget the MSG wagon before that). It's easy to know more than a doctor when you have gluten!

A miniscule percentage of people finally found an explanation for their intense pain in celiac disease and now it's suddenly the answer to every unexplainable issue that people feel.

Got a headache? GLUTEN! Feeling down? GLUTEN! Have an upset stomach? GLUTEN!

Joint pain is NOT a symptom of a gluten issue. You've got that confused. Correlation does not equal causation. Joint pain is a symptom of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, obesity, or injury. In some cases a gluten free diet may help ease the pain of RH, but RH is not caused by a gluten intolerance. But trust me, if you have RH, you aren't dealing with ""minor join pain"".

Then again, the fact that you're so quick to discredit doctors... you know... those people who go through 8 years of specialized schooling just so you can know more than them, lets me know that anything I say will get ignored just as fast or faster.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1388636884.0,"It *really* depends on what/how you cook.  I once went almost a year with just a saute pan, a saucepan, and some chopsticks. But right now, I'm pretty loaded up on cooking equipment and always adding more, because a lot of what I cook requires certain equipment. Sometimes I cook at my sister's place, but it can be a pain, because we'll plan on making something and she won't have the right tools or equipment for what I would make, but it's perfect for what she would make.  

It also depends on how you want to cook - for example, to get a great pan sear on a burger, you would want something like cast iron, or heavy bottomed stainless steel - but if that's not necessary to you, then you can cook it on nonstick or even broil it in the oven.  All depends on your preferences.

What about crock pots?  They're great for one pot meals if you like stuff like chili, stew, pulled pork/beef, etc.  

What I'd recommend is go with the basics at first of stuff that you *know* you need, and then get the rest as you realize that you need it.  So get a chef knife (Victorinox is great and SUPER cheap), big cutting board, and some cooking utensils (spoons, ladles, whisks, tongs, spatulas, peeler, etc.), and also some type of saute pan (nonstick, cast iron, SS, whatever you prefer), maybe a larger pot for pasta if you need it (or smaller if it's just you), and whatever else you think you need, such as some half sheet pans for baking/roasting things.  

Then, as you come across things that you need, you can pick them up.  Bundles suck, because they almost ALWAYS have things you don't really need or will never use.  Just get the bare minimum and go from there - Amazon is usually fairly cheap, too.

I don't know how experienced you are, but feel free to list the types of things you cook and I can give you a rundown of the equipment that you need to accomplish that."

I however firmly believe it should be renamed to Neurological Shitstorm, since VS is way too tame to describe what it actually is. 

The most notable symptom of it is a constant film of thick static over one's visual field. Exactly like an old tv with bad reception. It also comes with tons of other weird visual stuff. Most of it is just normal visual phenomena, but intensified to a point where it's debilitating. 

Afterimages for example. Most people, if they stare into the sun, or perhaps a light bulb for a few minutes will see a negative of it that lasts a second or so. This is normal. But with VS... if i so much as look at an object lighter in color than its surroundings for a second, i'm going to be seeing it for quite a while, burned into my vision.

But it does that for a lot of things. Floaters... little dead cells within the eye that for most people are invisible, because the brain filters them out. With VS... every one is visible. 

Sometimes colored blobs float by, sometimes sparks. Sometimes a small area of my vision momentarily distorts into a fuzzy clump... and as i'm writing this a jagged purple line just flashed into my vision and disappeared for no reason at all. Everything shimmers all the time, and sometimes, usually when looking at a light colored background, it's like looking through a layer of smoke or steam. 

Blue field entoptic phenomenon as well... it's normal, to an extent. If you stare at a bright blue field (such as the sky when there are no clouds) you will eventually see white sparks going in circles if you concentrate. These are caused by white blood cells in your eyes casting a shadow. Your brain usually filters this out of your perception. With VS... every damn lit surface is covered with them.

It's not all visual as well. It comes with a ton of other neurological crap as well. 

Constant raging tinnitus. My ears ring, loudly. Constantly. 24/7. I don't have any hearing damage, it's entirely neurological.

Derealization as well... which is a feeling of being completely disconnected from the world. The easiest way i can describe it is... it's like when you're playing a video game in the first person perspective. You're seeing from a realistic perspective, but at the same time, you feel disconnected from the character you're playing because you simply aren't actually that character. Except... that's how i feel all the time, about reality. I do of course know the logical differences between what is real and what isn't, and i have a perfectly firm grip on reality, yet at the same time i feel entirely disconnected from it.

Other neurological phenomenons you've probably never heard of happen to me sometimes as well. Alice In Wonderland Syndrome, Exploding Head Syndrome... sometimes i'll have visual hallucinations when i'm trying to sleep. Nothing too terrifying, just random stuff. One time i saw a plastic pipe sticking out of my bedroom wall, i went to touch it, and it was just... gone. I hallucinated it.

Anyway, VS is real shitty. There's not a moment of peace for me ever. Even in a completely dark, completely silent room i'm seeing a raging light show and listening to screeching tinnitus.

No one i ever told about it ever believed me. My parents thought i was full of crap when i told them about it (it started when i was in high school). I've told multiple optometrists about it, and none of them had any idea. It's very isolating... living in a different world than everyone else. 

I finally managed to figure out what it was when i came across an obscure internet forum about VS just by googling it, where everyone was describing the exact same symptoms i experienced... Over time the forum died out, and now we have a massive facebook page with thousands of members, all of them experiencing the same mysterious symptoms, all of them getting no help from doctors.

[I made a simulation of all the crap i see. It's not 100% accurate since i spent about 5 minutes making it in gimp over a shitty stock photo, but it's a decent representation of the shitstorm i deal with 24/7](http://i.minus.com/iyvHQrx7uHSZj.GIF)

EtherBoo,insanity,1388636902.0,"Hi there.  I'm a 31 year old male (32 in April) who has two herniated discs at L4-L5 and L5-S1 and mild stenosis around the area of aggravation.  My first 3 rounds of Insanity were cut short by muscle spasms that were so bad, I could barely walk.  I resorted to a cane at certain points to get from the car to the office.  I know a few things about back pain!  I don't know exactly what caused the herniated discs, but it became apparent when I wasn't healing after rest and chiropractic treatment.  I had to get 3 steroid epidural shots (cortizone I think?) to resolve the issue and undergo 6 months of PT to get rid of the nagging pain.

With that out of the way, I tried other workouts, but nothing came close to the rush of Insanity.  I ran 3 miles daily and did 30 minutes of 10 Minute Trainer (3 different routines) and I couldn't get that feeling of ""HOLY SHIT WHAT JUST HAPPENED??"" you get from an Insanity workout.  So after a few months of this, and mastering some core stretches  (like Side Plank on one of those giant inflatable balls), I decided to give Insanity a 4th run.  I made it through, and strengthened my core enough to get through 2 rounds of Asylum 1 and another round of Insanity (I did A1, I, A1) and I started Asylum 2 last week.   

Here's what I did:

* **WATCH YOUR FORM!** Seriously, this is one of the most important things you can do.   If you're tired and landing your Power Jumps with stiff knees, you're going to wreck your knees and back.  If you aren't paying attention to your form, you're probably doing the work wrong.  ST will tell you, he doesn't care if you can do 100 Mountain Climber Switch Kicks if your foot doesn't come above your hip.  Form is paramount.

* Cut the workout down.  If your core isn't strong enough to handle 6 days a week, drop down to 5.  I cut the Wed workout (unless it was a Cardio + Abs day, then I switched it with Friday or something), so the recovery day was on Wednesday.  

* Watch your jumps.  Power Jumps?  How about Power Squats?!  Squat in the same way you would for a Power Jump, then on the way up shoot up into a small hop.  Just be creative with new ways to do the same movement, without the jumping part.  

* Core, Core, and more Core.  I added core stretches and exercises to the beginning and end of every workout (Dead Bug, Hip Up, Bird Dog, Low Plank, and Side Plank are good places to start).   

* Be Careful on Recovery Workouts.  I've seen people post the meme ""You keep saying 'Recovery', I don't think you know what that word means!"" Let me say, during my second run last year, I can't tell you how amazing the recovery is.  The only reason I can say that is because my Core was strong enough to do the moves and hold the isometrics without feeling like I was going to die.  The first run, it was almost impossible for me and I felt like death.  The second run, it was a great workout for me.  You NEED to be careful during this workout, going about it with sloppy form will wreck your back.  The days that my lower back hurt the most was always after recovery because it's a killer.  Remember, your Core includes your lower back muscles also.

* Go at your own pace.  Shaun will say ""MORE, MORE ... I NEED MORE!!"" Look at the text right underneath ""Go at you own pace!""  He's trying to encourage you to find that energy you're hiding away.  Don't kill yourself or try to keep up with Tonia.  It's a losing battle.  Do what you can.  

* Extra stretches.  I always did extra stretches for my lower back.  

I hope this is helpful.

Women want the best, but more importantly, they want someone BETTER than them. If you aren't more valuable or have high status than them, then on a primal level what reason do they have to attach themselves to you? You can't offer her anything.

How do you tell if someone is more valuable/ higher status than you? In our primal brains, you can look at how you treat each other. The bad boy treats her like scum, therefore he must be more valuable than her. Regardless of whether or not it's true to subjective, her primal brain will interpret it that way. And he's CERTAINLY more valuable than the guy who let's himself gets pushed around by her.

So I returned home but then applied to grad school to Georgia. I love it here! And, to add to the move, I then accepted a job in Dallas, which I'll be starting after I graduate. 

With that said, I do miss home.  I went back last week for Christmas and man, it's awesome being around family. But, I don't know if I'd ever like to go back- nothing wrong with the area, and I'm a die-hard Philly guy but everywhere I go just reminds me of my youth."

THECapedCaper,Games,1388636948.0,"&gt;What do you expect and hope will be the major trends of 2014?

Social gaming for sure. I expect there to be a lot utilizing of the standard social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to be used, as well as utilization of other platforms like Twitch and Youtube to make a bigger impact than next year. 

I also expect there to be a ""YouTube for gamers"" competitor so that we can finally lay waste to the Let's Play debacles that Google has shown us over the past few months. If I can code a website and want to make money, I would absolutely get started on that. The backlash was so huge that people are asking for a YouTube competitor for regular videos as well. I think this happens.

I also think this is the year that people give up on Call of Duty. They've been getting worse and worse and as long as Activision keeps exploiting the franchise as much as they do it's certainly not going to get any better.

I kind of expect a third party developer to use the Wii U as a great tool for their game, though I'm not giving my hopes up.

&gt;What are you personally looking forward to the most?

I don't expect there to be too many great ""AAA"" games because other than the South Park game I'm not particularly excited for anything at the top of my head. I do expect a lot of indie games to make the same splashes that they made last year. They may not have the advertising budgets but boy do they know how to work the Greenlight platforms and get the word out through Reddit and other social media."

Sure, but there was nothing in his post that implied he was advising the person to do this. 

&gt; this is unattainable without vasts amount of money, luck

You should clarify what you mean by ""vast"", because this could be an example of someone having a gross misunderstanding of what it takes to reach self-employment.

&gt; Family first, work second, ""life experiences"" third

You spend a large portion of the rest of your post describing things that most people would consider life experiences. For example:

&gt; Go out on weekends

Experience.

&gt; move occasionally for work no short term contracts if you can

Experience.

&gt; time spent on trips/fun times with close friends/partner/family

Experience. 

So, I have no idea what your  ""advice"" even is. There is a lot of rambling and connecting dots in a way that directly contradicts what you're saying in your first paragraph.

&gt; This advice is terrible

I'm not sure if you are disagreeing with the advice based on a misinterpretation of what he was saying or if you are doing a terrible job at explaining why it is terrible. To me, it sounds like the meat of your advice pretty much agrees with the post.

calrebsofgix,AskWomen,1388637053.0,"I absolutely agree with you. I was just talking to my SO about this and that's pretty much what I said. The issue here is that this kind of mentality perpetuates an inequality between the sexes. 

It's not institutionalized *per se* but as a man I can say that I would likely give up my seat for a woman. Therefore I'm part of the problem (though I wouldn't judge another man for not making that choice). 

This kind of thinking leads to a lot of gaps we see in society. Think of the wage ceiling, for example, with american women getting paid 81 cents to the male dollar ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male%E2%80%93female_income_disparity_in_the_United_States)) but with the average male working up to 20% more hours (same source). If men didn't have to ""prove themselves"" then they likely wouldn't push themselves so hard. Additionally, 98% of the wage gap (same source) can be attributed (I'm paraphrasing) to having children as childless women make almost exactly as much as childless men. Controlling for education, hours worked, minority status, and other factors they can even make *more*. Which isn't bad. I'm not upset about this. I'm just saying that the ""patriarchy"" is perpetuated by this, and many other, institutions of thought and that if we're going to see equality we'll have to move away from this kind of thinking. Hell, maybe my generation (and the ones before it... and possibly a few after it) will have to die out before we can truly shake the bonds that tie us to gender normative relationships and generalized inequality. Either way, this kind of thinking (""the disposable male"") is damaging to everyone."

If I had to guess though, I would say the meta-aspect of it.  Discussing/complaining about stuff you see on the site.  Plus, there's been more attention drawn to and criticism of the hate group The Red Pill on AskReddit and SRD lately, and we bluepillers always like to see the general reddit populace make fun of them, too.

However, I actually discourage bringing TRP up in the defaults.  The reason being is that each time they get mentioned their subscriber numbers go up.  While most redditors see them and think wtf is this and express that sentiment, a few desperate, idiot neckbeards on this site are drawn to their sick and twisted ideology.  I'm against anything that benefits them.  The only other notable hate group I can think of on reddit is /r/niggers, and they never got above 6k subscribers after being in action for 4-5 years.

h0m3g33,paintball,1388637319.0,"When I size a paintball I look at the light I see through the sizer. I aim for the smallest sliver of light showing around the edges of the paintball, if you see no light then it's too small. I have noticed that on days that vary a lot (humidity, temp, etc.) I'll end up changing the sizer.

You will notice a change in accuracy when you need to change the bore. If the bore is too small paint will start going in every direction like a 98 w/o a barrel, also issues with paint leaving the barrel (getting stuck) is often a sign of major underbore.

If the bore is too large it's normally not a big deal, unless some crazy extreme change happened.

To answer the overbore/underbore I'll suggest slight overbore (see above method), slight underbore can work just as well, but if you underbore too much you will notice it, I like minor overbore because if there's differences in paint it gives some room to change.

**TL:DR** Overbore OK, Underbore can cause issues, Choose sizer with light check/blow method works too."

Anyways, to me at least, computer science is essentially one of the coolest majors out there (not that I'm biased or anything). Not because it's dealing with computers or any other tech based related stuff, but because if I think of something and if I put my mind to it, I can essentially do whatever the fuck I want (given enough time).

 Like imagine you're a civil engineer, you can't really do or make anything on your own without significant amounts of overhead and materials and whathaveyou.

If you're a CS or SE(software engineering) major, as long as you're not needing any art or interfaces or whatever, all you need for fun little side projects is an IDE (integrated developer environment, pretty much where you write and compile/interpret your code). It's not bulky either, so you can bring and show off your projects whenever and wherever you want. You can also look back on it and not worry about losing it. 

And that's why it's awesome.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388637406.0,"1) I said the right to life was a useful TOOL to guide morality by, not that I don't subscribe to it. You're twisting my words. Quite frankly, I think the highest goals of morality in the first place are to preserve human life, and to enhance peoples' life experiences, avoiding pain, maximizing positive outcomes for people. That being said I don't treat human life as a ""right"", I treat it as the very end goal for morality and governance in the first place. After all, as a pragmatist, I must have a goal to aim my pragmatism toward, mustn't I? What good is morality without a goal to accomplish? Humanity is that end. And that includes human life, and human well being. Rights can accomplish these goals, but as you'll see in my scathing view of libertarianism, a very imperfect way to do so.

2) And I notice from your comment history you're a libertarian. That being said you likely have zero clue what the heck you're talking about.

Here's the thing about libertarianism and morality. They're extremists. They come up with these fundamental principles by which life should be based around, and then take them to the most extreme conclusion. They're the fundamentalists of the conservative movement. And because they're extremists, they react to liberalism in a reactionary way, making strawmen like you're doing now. This is why I can't have a serious discussion about my political views with a libertarian without being accused of being a communist, or a fascist, or something like that. Even though nothing can be further from the truth! There are many versions of left wing politics. There are liberals, which are American democrats. There are social democrats, which push for European style social democracy. Think western europe with its generous social welfare systems, while still maintaining a large amount of freedom. This is my camp btw. Then you have the socialists and the communists. I don't subscribe to these guys. Too restrictive, their cures no better than the disease. 

The thing about private enterprise, is that like government, it has the potential to harm. Ultimately, businesses are only in it to maximize profit. And this can run contrary to the common good. Now, I dont propose a government takeover of all industry, since planned economies are shown to be disastrous, but I do think universal healthcare is shown to work. Quite frankly, the solutions to our problems as a society, and as a species, are not found in the extremes of politics. Your libertarianism is no better than the communism you're apparently against. The answer is somewhere in the middle. The most successful countries in the world, the ones that are the most pleasant to live in, are not the communist countries. Nor are they the unrestricted capitalist countries. They're countries that take the best ideas from both philosophies. 

So yes, I believe government should step in to protect people from business. Because business, left to its own ends, IS exploitative, and they'll oppress 99% of the population so the top 1% makes more money. You can't truly be free unless you have reasonable protections from both government and business. It's just that I focus my attention on business, because I think that with the exception of the current NSA crisis, the government is adequately restricted from being tyrannical. If we lived in north korea I'd obviously want to focus on government because business isn't the bigger threat here.

ALL power must be restricted, government and business. It's just that I believe our republic based on the separation of powers, largely has good restrictions, so my intention is to control the power of businesses. "

KellyeTheGreat,sex,1388637489.0,"I only asked because there is the possibility of asexuality, which someone else had mentioned.

I think long term relationships can be very difficult, especially sex for some people. You have kids, you get settled, you become complacent. It can be hard to see your partner in a sexual light, when they've exposed so much of their normal and mundane side.

Sex, for some people, can be something you have to work really hard at. You can easily get used to not having sex at all, and just not feel 'attracted' to your partner.

This might seem silly, but you could try just having sex with him, even without the attraction. Maybe it will awaken in you why you were attracted in the first place.

Another thing you might try, and a lot of people may disagree with me, but try having a glass of wine and having him kiss your neck, or other things that you find arousing. The wine may be just enough to lower your anxiety, and raise your arousal so that you can enjoy sex.

Otherwise, is there something emotional or physical about him that specifically repels you? Maybe he cheated, or hurt you, or his temper turns you off? Maybe he's too meek? Try thinking further on it, and see if there's a specific trigger for your not wanting to engage in sex."

Knowing how to change a car's wheel is a great start if you have all the bits and you can save a lot of money doing it yourself(plus it's definitely an impressive skill if you can change your girlfriend's wheels safely).

My supplies when I do it include: A torquewrench, an airwrench and compressor, proper airwrench sockets and normal sockets for the torquewrench, anticease so the wheel is easy to take off at the next change, a tiny(tiny) bit of oil for each stud, and a good proper hydraulic jack. Big tip, tighten the lugnuts after the first 100km after the change on alloy wheels because they will get a bit loose. If you want proper instructions and can give you them.

Now, why am I going on about changing wheels? Because the best way to learn is by doing, and if you're in a climate like mine you have to change your wheels every 6 months so it's a readily available situation.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1388637715.0,"One of the big problems that gets a lot of attention among MRAs is that way too many men just don't give much of a shit about anything (aside from women/sex). Compare the size of the MRM to feminism. Most people I know don't even know that there even is a MRM. If a movie presents something offensive to men, it just gets laughed off. If it's offensive to women, there's usually a shitstorm.

That gets talked about enough though, and I'm more interested in the broader economic scope. A big reason why Corporate USA in general (not just entertainment industry) cares more about women is simply because they spend more and are more reliable as consumers.

Women spend more on consumer goods than men. They save less. Just read up on the countless studies and articles comparing spending habits of men and women. A lot of guys contribute to this further by pedestaling women/sex over their personal needs. Buying luxuries cars instead of practical ones just to impress. Buying gifts. Paying for fancy restaurants geared towards women's tastes or romance in general. Even the demographics of prostitution support the idea that men are spending more on women/sex, while women spend more on everything else.

Women are financially more consistent and risk-averse. There's more variance among men. More risk-takers. More failures and more wild success stories. More hobos, but at the same time more rags-to-riches successes. Even feminist writers, while boasting the financial prowess of women over men, will point out that it is due to men's ""overconfidence"" (which a few admit is correlated to risk-taking). 

So it makes sense that much of entertainment is geared towards women's tastes. Not only do they spent more, but they are more consistent financially. Men on the other hand are less stable financially (take more risks), much higher variance, spending less,.. and that's on top of simply not giving a shit. 

So the question becomes: Why *should* corporate USA give a shit about men when we're such a terrible consumer base?

I don't personally have a solution to this. If you really can't stand the entertainment industry, then you can just avoid mainstream entertainment and support indie development of entertainment. That's the direction we're all going anyway. For video games, we have Steam as a platform, for example. As technology improves and development platforms are improved, indie development of shows, movies, and games will become easier for the average guy.

In general though, just avoid over-investing emotionally and financially in women, and care more about yourself. Otherwise, you hurt yourself and men in general in the long run."

If you need to weight the end of the rope, tie a rock or stick to it. If you are throwing a bear line, it is better to only tie the first half of the knot in a sloppy fashion, so that the rope unravels after it passes over the branch.

And as far as catching a tree branch across a river: when was the last time you came across a river that would surely rip you off your feet, and that you needed to cross badly enough that you searched for ages before you found a tree with a suitable notch in it.

The real use I've seen of the monkey's fist is as sketchy-ass climbing protection.

Riali,AskReddit,1388637869.0,"Our family's ""Wow, awesome, seems like a creative restaurant"" dish is Blueberry Maruzze

- Red Pasta sauce of your choice- veggie or meat are both good, homemade is obviously better.  Not chunky is a big plus, too spicy isn't going to jive well.

- Fresh or frozen blueberries

- Pasta shells (medium for a thinner sauce, large for a thicker one)

- Gruyere cheese, or mozza if stronger cheeses aren't your thing (we usually do mozza if kids are in attendance, you can also do half and half if you like a little sharpness only)

Cook the pasta a hair firmer than al dente, drain, mix in sauce and blueberries, keep mixing until all or most of the blueberries disappear into the shells.  Put it in a casserole, cover with cheese, bake until browned and bubbly.  

When you eat it the blueberries are a sort of surprise inside the shells... really unexpected and yummy."

I'm not trying to compare/contrast in the fashion you stated. (see below)

&gt; I understand your point that ""The Fountain"" was more controlled whereas ""Cloud Atlas"" was more open and variable. Even still, two totally different results.

I am more arguing that The Fountain, overall, feels like a film where Darren Aronofsky exhibited total artistic control and the entire movie was consistent and coherent. Aronofsky is an Auteur. Cloud Atlas on the other hand felt scattered and disjointed in a way that screamed to me ""too many cooks in the kitchen""... which could have something to do with the movie having 3 directors. I just feel like it fell really flat, but not without potential. 

I don't think there is potential for common ground or agreement on this film based on your comment and the loads of others in this thread. I simply can't buy or agree with ideas like...

&gt; ""Cloud Atlas"" is sweeping yet with enough detail and believability in terms of characters and storylines that it stands as a still stronger film.

I don't agree with literally any of that, it's almost like I watched a completely different film than most other people in this thread. Everyone is entitled to like what they like right, but I just don't see it this this one.

I'm really not sure these films should even be compared to each other anyway, they are so different.

Take it home, at some point before cooking, between a day to an hour before cooking, hit the meat with a hammer several times. The spiked hammer works out really well. Once it's thoroughly tenderized, apply dry rub and Worcester Sauce then place in sandwhich bag. Leave to sit until cooking time.

Heat a pan up for a few minutes, then apply the steaks to it. This will pan-sear the meat for flavor. While searing the meat, crinkle aluminum foil and place in a cake pan. This is to allow most of the excess juice to run off of the meat while cooking. Otherwise you end up with half-boiled, have broiled meat. Put the steaks on the foil, Set the oven low and long, &lt;300 for about 20 minutes. Flip, and wait ten more. Now you've turned the toughest crappiest steak there is into juicy 3-chew and swallow meat."

steelhorizon,AskReddit,1388638201.0,"IMHO Peter Jackson tells a more complete and modern story than Tolkien did. For instance in the Lord of the rings, Tolkien painted the elves as holier than though pompus jerks, whereas as Peter Jackson has a legion of elves show up at the Hornburg (Helms Deep) to show that they are still honorable. Also Tolkien pretty much hated women, so Peter Jackson added in way more to the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, which added a bit more depth to the movie. 

As for the Hobbit, Many of the events that are added into the movie were happening in Tolkienian lore even if they were not in the original hobbit story. By adding the events to the story Peter Jackson again makes a more complete story, as well as a solid lead up prequel to the LoTR trilogy.

AboveTheBears,hockey,1388638251.0,How much did it hurt to make that joke?
xthorgoldx,Games,1388638251.0,"To offer some counterpoint, the sheer variety of the game mechanics available is also a potential weakness of the game. There are a *lot* of ways to take out mooks - hit them with doors, get them to shoot their comrades then get electrocuted on the lightswitch, trap them in a room that locks the door when they try to open it... but it's entirely up to the player to use these mechanics.

The problem, therefore, is that it's *very* easy for players to get bogged down in basic tactics that work well as opposed to experimenting with out-of-the-box uses of the tools available. This doesn't *detract* from the game's baseline quality, but keeps it from having a much higher standard for the player. 

This is reinforced by the bonuses being explicitly for stealth gameplay - you don't get a bonus for killing *everyone* or killing everyone with a specific maneuver, you only get a bonus for being undetected and for not killing anyone. Bam - anyone trying to be a completionist is automatically locked out of every lethal mechanic because using them forfeits the objectives given.

It's a great game that deserves the praise it's getting, but a lot of tiny missteps in design kept it from being a *really* great game."

Martin194,AskReddit,1388638407.0,"My Opa (Grandpa, but he's Dutch).  He was never a soldier or anything, but he's worked hard through his whole life and I'd say he turned out pretty successful.  He was born in Groningen months before WWII.  Not sure if his village got bombed or anything, but he and his friends would find all kinds of shrapnel and other war crap in the fields and make toys out of it.  His family moved to Canada in the 50's where he met my Oma (also from the Netherlands, from Zuid Holland though).  He was a teenager and couldn't speak much English, but he learned and got jobs in factories, chemical plants, and other places when they lived in the Windsor area.  At the same time, he and my Oma raised four kids, one of them being my Dad, and lived a relatively comfortable life.  He found his true calling, however, on the windy plains of Southern Alberta, where the family moved and began raising pigs in the late-70's.  He went on doing this for almost 30 years before finally retiring and settling down on an acreage about 20 minutes from Taber.  

So, yeah, my Opa never became famous or fought in any wars or anything, but I admire him anyway.  He didn't live in poverty, but life never handed him anything either; he had to work hard to earn everything he achieved and he didn't let adversity get him down.  "

blue_eyes13,MakeupAddiction,1388638429.0,"I'm going to give you my honest opinion in hopes you won't be offended- just trying to help! They look a little overgrown and too big in my opinion, but you have amazing brows to work with. Thick brows like yours can be shaped into pretty much any style you want. Mine looked pretty much like yours when I was growing up and I was made fun of for it, went through a stage after that where I overplucked (don't do that!! you'll regret it), and now get compliments on them since learning to shape them myself. Your best bet is to go somewhere to get them professionally shaped the first time but I'll tell you what I do. 

Mine grow long like it looks like yours do as well. After washing my face, I use the palms of my hands and kind of sweep all the hairs in my eyebrows upwards. Trim the ones that stick out up over the main border of your eye brow. You can do this in the downward motion too if you want, but I find it makes mine look choppy sometimes. This will help you with the overgrown look. Pick a celebrity whose brows you admire and bring a picture with you to the appointment to get them shaped- heck bring multiple pictures. It will help the person doing them get a better idea of what you want and ensure that you don't come out of it unhappy. If you feel like doing it yourself at home I think the only real part that needs to be shaped is around the arch of your brow- you want there to be an arch, but keep the general width of your brow the same until it tapers at the end. [Kind of like this](http://data1.whicdn.com/images/55416626/lily-collins-eyebrows-18_original.jpg).

bunker_man,MensRights,1388638509.0,"I know all those things. That's the problem. It's less of an objective declaration of stance and more of an insult to everyone else. By calling yourself humanist you are implicating that some other people are non-humanists. That is, people whose ideologies operate on blue and orange morality that somehow has nothing to do with human concerns. That's a step beyond even calling it wrong, and moves into the realm of insisting it doesn't even need to be realistically considered since it is non-humanistic. Essentially the same thing modern feminism does. It's literally one step removed from simply calling your ideology ""The right one.""

Obviously there are in theory valid uses since it does have a meaning. But the problem is that words of this nature skirt pretentiousness; especially when groups actually use them as if the word alone indicated everything about the group that you needed to know, despite having more in depth attributes."

As long as you make sure not to let any wound get infected you'll be good. But as a tip, always try to climb with your back foot &amp; ankle pointed.

I'm a 5'0"" 90lb college student, and it's not uncommon for me to have trouble finding age appropriate clothes in my size.  Often things are too big or too long for me.  Sure it's annoying and sometimes inconvenient when a store doesn't have an item I like or need in my size, but I don't whine about ""average size"" privilege or whatever.  I look somewhere else or see if maybe there's something in the kid's section that will work. Not to mention, I get why not every store carries size 0/00 pants with a 26"" inseam or size 5 shoes.  Most people don't wear those sizes, so it probably won't sell very well.  It's the same thing with bigger clothes.  It's why the Macy's in my town had a ton of XS and XL sized sweaters on clearance the other day, but my mom couldn't find many mediums or larges.  Or why both me and one of my mom's taller friends can usually find shoes at places like Nordstrom Rack or Marshall's.  It's supply and demand, it's not that complicated.

As a man, I know I can take the emotional beating of someone trying to take advantage of my generosity and willingness to be there. You learn and move on. I am a good looking dude and still would go for years with no action, so that speaks something to my shyness and lack of ""game.""

poryphria,kpop,1388639155.0,"**1. Rain Effect** - This intro didn't really catch my attention, but it was fairly short.  3/5

**2. 30 Sexy** - The song is alright- it doesn't lose much when you listen to it without the MV, which is a positive.  I honestly don't know whether to give it a 3.5 or a 4 out of 5.  I'll give it a 3.75/5.

**3. LA Song** - I can't help loving it.  Unlike 30 Sexy, this loses it's oomph without the MV.  The MV was fun, and I loved that Rain included foreigners that weren't only eye-candy.  The juxtaposition of ""wtf stares"" and the sensuality was kinda cool.  4.5/5

**4. Where Are You Going, Oppa?** - I....like Hyuna's rapping here.  Wow, that doesn't happen often.  The beat is by far the best part of this track, but I wish another female rapper would have collaborated with him.  4.5/5

**5. Marilyn Monroe** - Without the lyrics, I don't know if Rain used Marilyn Monroe in the title ironically (she's one of the biggest deconstructions of the western sensual woman and so many artists use her in their songs/titles, and I find it a little funny).  Can't wait to read the lyrics for this one.  The song itself is a little boring, and I hear styles like this being done better.  3/5

**6. Baby** - I like the chorus.  Better than Marilyn Monroe, IMO.  3.5/5

**7. Superman** - Rain and falsetto usually doesn't work, in fact it's verging on ADTOY's falsetto levels.  Like with ""Where Are You Going?"", the beat is the best part of the song.  4/5

**8. 알아버렸어[8]** - Rain, stop rapping please.  You're not the best vocalist, but if you stay in your range like Lee Hyori does nowadays, people won't notice.  Everything but the rapping was okay.  3.5/5

**9. Dear Mama Don't Cry** - It started off a little slow, but it got better.  My point from the previous song stands.  4/5

**10. 30 Sexy Remix** - This remix works really well for a party, and I actually like it a little more than the original song. 4/5

**3.9/5!**  I'm a little let down, because I don't think this was the best comeback for a guy going through military woes, dating woes, and hiatus woes- he had to go all out (like Block B did), otherwise he can't get back on the public's side.

It's not poorly written.  I've seen that thrown around a few times on here, and I know it's something to just add fuel to the fire, but the story is not poorly written.  It reads nicely, along the lines of any modern-day fiction.

Again with RPatz...more fun with truth and taking things completely out of context!  Based on what you said about seeing his interviews and thus determining that he hates the character I can't tell if you're a)lying and haven't seen any or b)have seen some and just decided to make up an interpretation of them that fits the Twilight hate circlejerk.  Probably a bit of both.

&gt;  he hated Edward so much that that's how he decided to play Edward; by hating himself.

This is so easy to debunk that it's not even funny.  I can even see exactly how this was taken out of a context.  Edward is a self-loathing character.  By hating himself, Rob was portraying the character accurately.  Standard method.

You say it's demeaning to read the book but then say that you didn't read them.  Lolwut?  Also, it's interesting to see people trash Bella for going through depression.  How dare she be depressed about a traumatic event!

And about the sparkling.  I love how you're criticizing an author- a creative- for thinking outside the box and deciding to put her own twist on the vampire narrative.  There's no law that says vampires have to be written a certain way.  That's part of what makes Twilight so cool- Stephenie Meyer completely flips the canon on its head and changes it up.  Also, LOL it's cute when you pretend you don't know her name...redditors do that to Justin Bieber all the time and it amuses me.

md619,TheRedPill,1388639422.0,"&gt; The success that the ""bad boy"" enjoys with women is not due to his being an asshole who treats women like pieces of shit. Though he may think of a woman as nothing more than a collection of lukewarm holes in which he can stick his appendage, it's not this trait which draws women to him in a sexual way.

I'm not misquoting you, it's right there. Then you go on to talk about all the noble traits that bad boys have:

&gt;Bad boys get laid because they are alpha males. They are strong, powerful social paragons. They are independent, highly masculine and unafraid. They are unapologetic about their choices, their actions and their sexual desire. They command a high level of social status and respect, they do not supplicate to anyone and they are prepared to fight for their beliefs and desires - no matter how immoral or reprehensible they may be to others.

which are not necessarily true at all. There are plenty of bad boys who are scum in their own right and pocess almost none of the qualities you mentioned. It implies that women are still attracted to what most men think they SHOULD be attracted to. Therefore women still think like us."

thebandz,punk,1388639586.0,"Yeah, I even made a fuckin' post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/1pra7o/i_wanna_start_a_band/

I emailed OFF!'s contact, almost jokingly, saying:

""Man I live in the fucking suburbs which is a bad place to be if you wanna be a punk rocker I can't start a band or play shows or nothing and I can't do shit about it because I'm fucking 16

All I wanna do is rock out and have a good time could you hook me up with some guys or just play one of my songs and say ""that song is by luke brekhus"" or fucking anything man

http://lukebrekhus.bandcamp.com/ I've posted a demo there check it out and see if you're inspired to do anything for me""

To my surprise Keith Morris actually responded: 

""Your songs are good and you need to take your time and reach out to other musicians who might not necessarily be ""PUNK ROCK"" but might be open minded enough to want to participate in playing in a band with you. When I co-founded BLACK FLAG our first drummer had absolutely nothing to do with ""PUNK ROCK"" and didn't even listen to some of the music we liked. He like playing the songs and he did an amazing job playing them when we recorded the NERVOUS BREAKDOWN E.P.
As for OFF! playing one of your songs it doesn't work this way as we write our own songs.
HAVE FUN,
Keith Morris
PS Are there people at your school who listen to what you listen to? If so talk to them and find out if any of them would be interested in starting a band. Is there a music store with a bulletin board or music magazines, local or in the nearest big city throwaway weekly papers with ""Want Ads"", ""Musicians Available"" or ""Musicians Wanted""? If so go there and check it out!""

This really hit me because I was only looking for punk musicians who knew all about punk when I should've just been looking for people who were willing to play. Craigslist is not the place to go for me. That's what I've learned. Nobody responds and everybody wants to play classic rock shit. I'm probably gonna go on some site with musicians you can contact. And if that doesn't work I'll figure something else. It's all about trial and error.

Hey if you're fuckin' trying to start a band listen to my shit and consider being in mine lol why fuckin' not

Don't ever think you're too old. Keith Morris, guy I emailed, fuckin' 58 years old. Listen to ""Wiped Out"" by OFF! and tell me there's an age where you can't be in a punk band.

FireSail,short,1388639609.0,"I'll be honest, I've never suffered from the same social height-ism that some members here detail, but maybe that's because I'm of Middle Eastern heritage. I think because shorter is normal in that culture, Americans give me a ""pass"" - despite being short I still am viewed as smart, masculine in a social context, and am never edged out in conversation or what have you.

By contrast, I have definitely seen romantic rejection because of my height and know it first hand. While it sucks, it's the sort of thing you get over - sexual attraction is fickle, and people are generally ingrained into what they find attractive (often resulting from societal pressure they were born with).



But it's nothing compared to the anger I feel at the societal height-ism. That stuff is straight up malicious. And it's so prevalent, it's pervasive everywhere. And so openly, commonly accepted. And it causes long-term associations because the media is so permeating. Once I ""opened my eyes,"" I was baffled how I can't escape it.

Like take the movie ""Grudge Match"" - not one preview goes by without poking fun at Kevin Hart's height. They mention it multiple times, it seems to be a running gag even.

Then he has another movie, ""Ride Along,"" with Ice Cube. I was walking out the metro the other day and saw the poster for it. It's Kevin looking up worryingly as Ice Cube towers over him and glowers. Again, playing the height thing again.

The newest Hunger Games movie - Jennifer Lawrence's baker boyfriend, a sensitive, submissive side-kick, is shorter than her. The dark and handsome lover who tempts her is taller. Like, REALLY? In the words of Chris Carter: ""C'mon man!""

It makes for a problem in that people, young men and women, get bombarded with these images and they become the reality. So I don't get mad at women anymore who can't overlook height - they're just still brainwashed into it, just like others get brainwashed into cults and misguided beliefs. I think the guys getting frustrated with those women, who just care about sexual success, are missing the larger, more important picture.

MattieShoes,DotA2,1388639653.0,"I did the math with Clockwerk once upon a time with graphs and all, though the block rate was 70% (which turns into 61% because dota).  

Now the block rate is 80% which turns into 66%.  Clock gets double the damage block because melee and mek was *still* better on clock except for extremely early levels or where he doesn't actually use the mek's active.  If clock is balling out of control early, I'll still get Vanguard, but it's not core.

So let's break it down:

* 2225 cost vs 2306 cost -- negligible
* 13.3 damage block  vs 5.71 armor, 7.71 with active -- You get more damage mitigation from the armor beyond about 80 damage which even supports will reach in the first few minutes... And that's not counting the extra +2 armor from mek's active, which you give to allies.  
* 250 HP  vs 95 HP with 250 HP AOE heal -- 95 extra HP from mek, plus you just healed allies for up to 250 HP *each*.
* +6 HP/sec regen  vs +0.15 HP/sec and +4 HP/sec aura -- Vanguard is better for you here, but much worse for your teammates.
* +0 mana vs +65 mana -- Mek obviously

The woman can not turn around and say ""there is nothing wrong with being bald"" or ""I'm proud to be bald"" if she is secretly wearing a wig.  But then again, by wearing the wig, she will attract more men. Furthermore, the gender component matches.  Wearing heels is considered feminine and being bald is considered masculine.

Graphics should not be important. Gameplay is far more important than graphics are or should ever be. Also, one decent (and I stress *decent*) FPS doesn't make an entire catalog good. Between diversity of games and overall review scores, the 3DS just stomps all over the Vita. While I recommend getting both for their respective exclusives, the 3DS is just a better buy. 

Also factor in that a Vita+ Memory stick is so much more expensive that you can get a 3DS and several games for less.

I believe all of the parts are on YouTube, under the players names. There should be/probably are more videos/documentaries on the more recent players that may interest you as well.

Other than that, it might be useful to try to be a player (if that makes any sense). Simply attempt to learn what's going through the players heads as they go through the game. (HowToHockey has some pretty good videos to understand this thought process)

Clothes: go to the mall and buy nice clothes. No cargo shorts. Get your self a nice pair of kicks. I suggest nike or jordan basketball shoes or sperrys. Love them both. I like dressing in button downs and polos and nike t-shirts because I play a lot of ball. **You do you**.

Gym: join a damn gym. Your school might have a weight room. Use it. Work on losing fat first before you gain muscle if you're bigger. ""Curls get girls"" but focus on your whole body.

A much better alternative would be putting in the effort and planning to ensure that he’s **permanently** incapacitated—whether that means killing him or something else. Eight years ago, two freshmen in my dorm planted child pornography on their roommate’s computer and set Limewire to share it; he just got out of prison this fall. In the case of a child molester caught with child pornography, his prior uncharged bad acts—here, molesting the daughter—would be admissible to a jury in my state both to show absence of mistake, and at sentencing.

**Edited** to clarify: I think vigilante justice is uncivilized and runs contrary to my beliefs about fairness and integrity. I’m writing on the assumption that the vigilante has irrefutable proof that the target has raped someone (perhaps by being his victim), reasonably believes that he will rape again, and has no other practicable legal recourse that would avert the threat (*e.g.*, reporting his previous crime to the police). For example, a victim whose crime has passed the statute of limitations knows that her attacker has just gotten sole custody of his children and has seen him engaging in the same victim-grooming behaviors he’d shown to her.

tPRoC,videos,1388639942.0,"&gt;But the real thing- is that no one's ever heard this dumb ""cola bottle baby"" song. Because the song kind of sucks. Millions of people heard it and threw it out.

Absolutely shitty opinion. The song doesn't suck, it just didn't gain any traction. You do not need to say that Daft Punk ""refined"" it or that the song sucked to justify what they did. Does [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd60nI4sa9A) suck just because [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdwVVI4B3oY) was way more popular?

Music (and most artforms honestly) are based on copying other people, that's the only justification you need. Art is all about reinterpretation. We wouldn't have rock and roll if Elvis and a bunch of British dudes didn't start covering blues standards, stealing Albert King riffs and naming bands after Muddy Waters lyrics.

3- They're more racist than even the strawmen they're making white people out to be.

4- Real Africans don't even necessarily share this irrational hatred of white people. Who have been fucking things up for blacks in the worst parts of Africa? That's right, *other black people.* Sure, colonialism plays a part to an extent, but whites are definitely not to blame for the shit going on in Somalia or Sudan, and white people weren't the ones wielding the machetes in Rwanda.

This silly bitch has constructed in her head some sort of fantasy world where blacks can do no wrong and white people are to blame for everything bad in the world.

An important point to note here with your ""demand"" argument is that investment only includes goods and services that businesses purchase. The wages they pay to employees don't count toward investment only because they already count towards consumption.

So if your argument is that demand is more important, you need to accept that businesses whose overhead is too high won't be able to contribute to demand. I.e., the ""but demand!"" parrot is misleading."

TooPoorForLaundry,sydney,1388640112.0,"Public transport, here we go.

**Tickets**

There are 3 ""zones"", which is really a fancy way of saying *distance from the CBD*. Zone 1 is the smallest, and is just a circle with a radius that is x from the CBD. As you go further out you get Zone 2, and then 3. You can see a detailed [zone map here](http://www.sydneytrains.info/tickets/pdf/mymulti_fare_map.pdf).

This map also has on the top left an explanation of what is included with each MyMulti ticket – these are weekly unlimited travel tickets which most people use if they're travelling daily. It's best to first figure out what suburb you're living in, the train station you'll use, and buy a ticket appropriate for that. 

If you're not travelling daily you can buy single or return tickets for bus, train or ferry.

If you're travelling only by bus, you can buy a ticket with 10 prepaid rides on it. This is called a MyBus. But of course it would make too much sense to have these work with the zones, so they use sections. If you're using a MyMulti you don't need to worry about this as bus transport is free, but if not, take a look at [this page](http://www.sydneybuses.info/tickets/calculating-sections) for an explanation of the sections. Fuck sections.

Most of the buses are cashless, especially around the CBD, so it's best to arrange to have a ticket beforehand. You can get them from most small corner stores, or also at a train station.

*(As I'm writing I'm realising how confusing this shit really is.)*

**Logistics**

Our tickets are paper tickets. You need to make sure you always carry them when you travel – they are checked.

For trains you generally use your ticket to get in to the station, and then when you leave whatever station you arrived at. Some of the older stations don't have barriers to stop you. No biggie, just keep your ticket on you.

Ferries are the same. I believe some of the smaller docks don't have barriers, but from what I recall they sometimes have cashiers on board.

Buses you dip the ticket in green machines at the front of the bus once when you board, even if it's a Multi. You don't need to do anything when you're getting off the bus.

**Freebies and Touristy stuff**

There are free shuttles in the CBD, and also Parramatta (and maybe Chatswood? Not sure). Take advantage of these. The one in the CBD runs from Central to Circular Quay and you can easily make a day. Check out China Town, hop off along George street and walk a few blocks to Darling Harbour and then check out the Bridge and Opera house. It is all walking distance as well, but hey, the bus is there. They run every 15 minutes or so during the day.

You may also want to hop on a train that crosses the bridge just to check it out. 

**Opal**

We're getting an Opal card to replace our paper tickets and it's being rolled out slowly. It's meant to be slightly cheaper I believe. Check out [the website](http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/opal). If it's in your area when you're here that might be better."

And, I really like the games. I loved KotOR and Jedi Outcast and a couple of others, and there's no denying that Mass Effect took *a looooot* of inspiration from Star Wars, especially since Bioware developed KotOR and Mass Effect, and I really, really like Mass Effect, so I can appreciate the similarities.

Still, the original movies are hammy, with poor visuals that didn't hold up 20 years ago, much less today and aren't properly explained during the final transition scene in Episode 3 where all the tech goes Dark Ages to the original trilogy.

It was pretty much all sample-based, and instead of mp3s we'd post [""tracks""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracker_(music_software)) which were basically files comprised of samples and the patterns would trigger them very similarly to how you saw them laid out in the video. As you could write whatever you wanted into the metadata of the tracks, people would credit samples they borrowed from elsewhere, or even state what they created and if they were cool with their samples being reused in other tracks. Point is, there are literally thousands and thousands of these tracks available to download at different sites, all legal, all for free. The tracks were sometimes included in demos, which were realtime music videos showing off the coder's skills.

firehatchet,loseit,1388640649.0,"As someone who was formerly in your position, let me give you my lifesaving trick: COUNT YOUR CALORIES. And not half-ass counting calories, like: ""Oh, that's about a tbsp of peanut butter"". Actually measuring and weighing stuff to within a couple of grams. Not obsessively, but there's a fine balance between knowing what you're putting in your body and just guessing.

It totally changes your perspective from ""I just won't eat and ignore the hunger in the hope that I'll lose weight"" to ""I know I'm eating a healthy, sustainable diet."" It works wonders. Calculate your daily caloric requirements using a calculator like freedieting.com or myfitnesspal, and chose a 500-700 calorie deficit, no more or you won't lose weight, no less and you'll be hungry, relapse or what not. You'll see the pounds come off at a steady clip of 1-2 lbs per week. Come up with a weekly meal plan to keep yourself on track.

Continue being active (i.e. going to the gym, no one is looking at you) and don't worry about a cheat meal once a week or so. It helps your metabolism and is good for your sanity. Just advice, but it worked beautifully for me!"

First, there are some processes to attainment you should probably be aware of. It's considered inappropriate for anyone to make the claim themselves, although it can be verified. It sounds like you're either not a Buddhist or are new to it, but this is one of the reasons that the guru-student relationship is so important and so emphasized. Enlightened beings can verify enlightened beings, but the rest of us won't know.

That said, certain titles are reserved for high level of attainments, so it's not too difficult to pick them out either. Zen masters are typically considered enlightened, most notable of the zen masters being Thict Nhat Hanh. His Holiness the Dalai Lama XIV is by definition a bodhisattva who redirects his birth to continue teaching in this world. Likewise, most of the recurring tulku lineages are enlightened beings. In the Theravada traditions, there are whole communities of arhants. Someone posted a biography of a recently-passed female arhant from a Thai Forest tradition not too long ago. It was a very interesting read.

I found a recent thread where individuals list more examples [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1t9qlg/are_there_any_enlightened_people_alive_today_are/)

LogicX,AskReddit,1388640882.0,"Boston, MA -&gt; Myrtle Beach, SC

In May 2012 my wife and I were living in Boston and vacationing in **Myrtle Beach, SC** and fell in love with the [Market Common](http://www.marketcommonmb.com) area: We stumbled across an open house for $200k new-construction 4 bedroom homes a mile from the beach, 5 minutes from the airport, $400/yr in property taxes, and were blown away, as its such a contrast with Boston housing. Started plans to move the next day!

In November 2012 we moved to Myrtle Beach - and its been great! I'm a web entrepreneur (work remotely) and she's an RN. Being set on the job front is important here: After that you can really take advantage of all it has to offer! We've made more friends in our first 6 months than in 6 years in Boston. I found like-minded tech folks through [CoworkMYR](http://www.coworkmyr.com), and am having a blast starting an entrepreneurial/[web startup](http://www.cocelerator.com) community here.

We've even started a website to highlight the reasons why Myrtle Beach may be the right place for others to move called [**Why Not The Beach**](http://www.whynotthebeach.com)?

Some of the highlights:

* Low cost of living (home, gas, property taxes, etc.)
* High quality of life (little traffic, great work-life balance, less stress)
* Great weather year-round
* The Beach!
* [Airport](http://www.flymyrtlebeach.com/) with cheap flights (&amp;lt; $100 RT) to most Northeast cities
* [Fiber To The Home](http://htcbluewave.com) in most areas (50-100mbps)
* Good K-12 schools, Coastal Carolina University
* Access to capital - for startup founders (lots of wealthy retirees)"

Second, the lack of representation of women in research and medicine at the time (and today, to a lesser but still very real extent) only demonstrates why feminism is necessary.

The armor is so bad that you can't really abuse its really good gun depression, because even snap shots will usually tear through the superstructure up top.

We have legitimate gripes over standards being lowered purely for the sake of allowing more women in the the armed services. For instance, it's great that some women can pass the infantry test and prove that they're just as good as the boys, but we're never going to have equal amounts of men and women serving in that MOS. We worry that standards for becoming an infantryman will be lowered for women, and consequently they might not have the ability to do everything that their male counterparts can do. 

If worst comes to worst and a female Marine can't haul a 300 pound hunk of Marine to the Doc because of her different standards, then we might lose someone all because some pencil pushers decided equality was needed in an area that doesn't need it."

Jarkus86,changemyview,1388641639.0,"I can't argue in favour of sex with animals but want to add to /u/themcos additional considerations. The fourth possibility is that it is possible to have a sexual experience with an animal that is both consensual and harmless and yet still morally impermissible. An example is if you were to smear peanut butter on your genitals and get a dog to lick it off. Working on the assumption that the dog would enjoy this as a non-sexual experience and that it would not harm the dog physically or psychologically, this would still not be ok by most standards. So this raises the question of why this is not morally permissible. Is this because we understand that inter-species sexual contact is counter the the biological imperative? If so, this removes the equivalence of sex with infants or the mentally handicapped and instead provides an argument for why sex with animals is not ok that is not based on consent or harm. Effectively, what I am saying is that it is not the same as a pedophilic act or as abuse of the disabled but still morally impermissible.

Now... in a normal storm this amount of energy just isn't enough to really affect the temperature, even if it is measurable.

NOW... with that knowledge, you can calculate the amount of energy involved in enough rain falling, within the 40 day and night time span, to cover the earth to above the mountain ranges, and that amount of energy ends up being enough to literally boil the earth.

On that note: If you assume the water was just floating in the atmosphere initially, once again, the earth boils.. PV=nRT, I'm sure it'd be a little more complex than that, but... you increase n (moles of molecules) and if nothing else changes the temperature goes up."

As far as nail art tools go, I would start with the basics:  

* [Dotting tools](http://www.amazon.com/Dotting-Marbleizing-Manicure-Pedicure-Ounce/dp/B004OHQR1Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388641592&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dotting+tools)
* Striping Tape (which I see is already on your wishlist - woo!)
* [Nail Art Brushes](http://www.amazon.com/Detailing-Drawing-Painting-Brushes-Dotting/dp/B00A20OQYE/ref=sr_1_29?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388641592&amp;sr=1-29&amp;keywords=dotting+tools)

These will take you a long way, and I see that you have stamping tools on your list, too. Stamping is WAY fun, so once you're equipped, make sure to practice a few times on a sheet of paper or some other non-nail surface, just to get the hang of the motion and nuance of timing. When you're stamping your nails themselves, make sure to stamp a few hours or even the morning after polishing. This gives the solvents in the polish time to dry (really, they take about 24 hours, but depending on how many coats you're using and the type of top coat, a couple hours might do) and prevents the non-dry lower layers from sliding under the pressure of the stamping tool.

davidmanheim,changemyview,1388642197.0,"Two possible answers:

**First**, the existence of diverse opinions does not contradict the existence of an ""objective"" moral claim. The difference is smaller than you might think; if the world is a reflection of gods will, then morality is reflected in the world anyways. The morality in this case, without belief ion a deity, refers to the existence of an objective reality, and that which is compatible with reality, instead of being based on the desires of a deity. (This deity who defined reality, and which therefore has morality reflected by the state of the world and the way in which people interact.)

What do I mean by this? Humans have certain basic mental and physical traits. If people were not susceptible to cold weather, there would be no moral imperative to provide warm clothing to the needy. If they did not need food, feeding the hungry would similarly be irrelevant. The appeal to making life better for humanity as a whole is objective inasmuch as the physical reality is objective. 

That said, is physical reality beyond dispute? Clearly not. We debate whether giving money to the poor will breed dependency, or allow them to make themselves self-sufficient - and this dispute is just as important for Christians as for atheists. The basis of moral claims is at least partially about the consequences of the actions; the question of whether or not to act morally still remains the same, that is; whether to act in the best interest of others, while still consistent with your own safety, well-being, etc.


**Second**, despite the existence of a deity, morality is somewhat subjective, or at least mutable. The debate about what God truly wants from you, what you can do that makes you moral or immoral, is absolutely non-objective, and mutable; it is a product of the times you live in, your mental, physical, and financial capacity, and your understanding of the world - all of these differ based on the era in which you live, your personal circumstance, or even your age, your location, and your gender.
As a concrete example, as a Christian, you believe that God gave a Bible to the Jews, then changed the rules in some ways about a thousand years later. Clearly, even within a single religious system, there is change in what is considered moral. (I won't discuss changes in Christianity over the past couple millenia, as your understanding of that depends on denominational understanding of the history of the church, but whatever you believe, those changes exist as well.)"

I go out to dinner with an old friend from junior high days sometimes, and I have a friend from university that I hang out with sometimes too.  My boyfriend has met both of them and I was never romantically involved with either.  For me personally, I would feel guilty hanging out with a new guy one-on-one while dating someone else."

Canuck147,changemyview,1388642410.0,"I've seen a lot of plugs for Guns, Germs, and Steel. It's a good introduction, but I'm going to recommend [Why the West Rules for Now](http://www.amazon.com/Why-West-Rules-Now-Patterns/dp/0312611692) - it handles the topic you're looking a little more deeply.

At the end of the day, the question of 'why are white societies more successful' is usually rephrased as 'why did western europe have the first industrial revolution'. 'White people' came to dominate the world for centuries because they industrialized, developing powerful economies and powerful armies. Using these powers they colonized or conquered their way across the globe until we reached our present power structure.

So why did western europeans have the first industrial revolution? Guns, Germs, and Steel makes one very important observation concerning the development of civilizations: Eurasia has an East-West orientation, while the Americas have a North South orientation. Why is this important? Because climates tend to be similar along lines of latitude (ie. an east-west axis), but different along longitude. This means that crops and animals domesticated in Eurasia could spread quickly compared with the Americas because they wouldn't have to adapt to new climates. This is why wheat spread through Eurasia in a few centuries, but corn spread through American in a few thousand years. All of this means that the deck would end up stacked in the favour of some society from Eurasia.

So why did it end up being England at the head of the industrial revolution? Ultimately a confluence of geography, geopolitics, and luck. I believe the romans and chinese developed combustion engines, but they exploded and had no obvious use. English miners used these engines to pump water from mines, which conveniently cooled them and prevented them from exploding - hence a bit of luck playing into it. As for the rest, remember that from 500-1700 CE China was the centre of the world. All the exploration that European countries were doing was essentially to establish trade with Asia. 

This immense economic incentive to reach Asia drove the development of more sophisticated navigational and marine technology, and began Europe's stumbling into Africa and America and establishing colonies. It is precisely because Europe was so poor that they continued to explore and establish colonies. China essentially halted exploration early into 1100s I think - extravagant voyages around the world were seen as a waste of money. China was the centre of the world and any worthwhile trade would come to them.

Britain on the other hand, had to develop itself through colonies. It established a sophisticated trade network between Africa (trading slaves), the Americas (trading raw materials), and Europe (trading industrialized goods). This flow of trade and materials helped further develop Britain's manufacturing sector. By this point Britain had accumulated enough power to dominate India by the mid 1700s and China by the mid 1800s.

So if I were to try and summarize things, saying that 'white people' produce better societies is a pretty short view of the situation. Western European societies came to dominate the world in the last 400 years precisely because they were in a political/economic backwater giving them motivation to explore and colonize, fortunately located on substantial coal reserves to drive industrialization, and conveniently located near the Americas to exploit their land and resources.

I wont say that culture played no part in all of this. Obviously if the Chinese had taken a greater interest in what Europeans were getting up to halfway around the world things may have played out differently. But at the end of the day the incentives in the 1700s - which is arguably the first time industrialization was socially, politically, and environmentally possible - Western Europeans were incentivised to industrialize, while Asia was not.

smootie,needadvice,1388642589.0,"I think it is very smart of you to pursue a trade.  At least where I live, there is a huge shortage of plumbers, electricians, etc. whereas I know tons of unemployed university graduates.  You get to finish school in a shorter amount of time than a university student, it costs less, and you would probably be able to find a job in any town.

There is a huge emphasis on getting a four-year degree in our society, and I think it's dumb.  So many kids feel pressured to go to college and rack up debt just to come out with a degree that they will never use when they would have been much happier and employable if they had learned a trade.

Don't worry about not having passion for your job.  Some people (myself included) get satisfaction from a job well done and don't care as much about *what* the job is.  It's a means to being able to pursue your hobbies.  You're only 25 - people change careers multiple times over their lifetimes, so don't sweat it.

It's normal to be afraid that things won't work out.  When I invest a lot of myself in a goal (and get my hopes up), I feel really vulnerable and always worry about how things will turn out.  It's impossible to predict the future, but if you work hard to make things happen (like doing well in your classes, making sure to always say ""hi"" to your classmates, start going to job fairs and making connections in your trade), you have a much better chance of getting the outcome you want.

Nogbadd,AskMen,1388642744.0,"I think you meant ""I don't THINK men are as easily manipulated, and hurt...""

I disagree with two parts of this statement; the first part *and* the second part. The first part because anyone can be flattered by the attention of the opposite sex, and a young *boy* is more likely to be susceptible to manipulation by an older woman, as his sensitivity to manipulation/ deceit will be lower than a teenage girl's, who is aware of her sexual allure, and will have already have developed suspicion of overtures from others.

Secondly, boys have feelings too, and physical sex before the person is emotionally ready will affect the rest of their lives. It is massively sexist to pretend that it won't. The person will feel exploited and used; boys and girls. 

If the boy was my son, and he was below the legal age of consent, I would seek legal redress and make sure the judicial system gave her the appropriate punishment. The punishment for women committing sexual offences against minors is a week's vacation at DisneyWorld, I think, and I would push for the maximum punishment allowable under law"

My Mazda I have had 6 or 7 years now and will probably keep it until it dies or gets to be too unreliable. 


Ive got to be honest, thats one of the best pieces of advice Ive gotten.

I think part of my decision making that effected that is my brother recently got a loaded mazda 6 and its just light years beyond my car.  They have the new body styles and everything is upgraded and for the first time in my life I was getting caught up in all that (which I suppose is the idea from a sales perspective) ... but when you really look at it its not that important.


reliable (my Mazda has had practically no problems but I couldnt imagine too many new cars would?), 22K is about the max I can do pricewise, has to have rear seats, I want it to be fun with decent to good power and handling (I dont want to be locked into a payment on something I dont 'want') , good ac.


we have a son, who isnt 2 years old.
we arnt planning on having any more kids (though a 2nd is possible, not at this time)

I know with a G35 (my drummer has one and its an impressive car to me) there is a back seat but its very small and itsnt great for adults but I would imagine a kid would do fine in it until they are quite old (I used to ride in the back of my dads Camaro with no problem and that was a 2 door).  Im assuming the back of a g37 is very similar.  


my girlfriend and brother keep saying I should just keep the price down...but I dont think thats what I want.
She on the other hand also like more European cars and is bigger on interiors than I am (though I do want the car to be nice)


I guess the bottom line would be this:

If this was me before our son I would probably get the mazdaspeed (but why do they have to have those seats), used g37, or gti but now that I have a son to consider I worry more.
I think to myself what happens when my current Mazda goes and my gf cannot take on a payment for herself for whatever reason (she has had a low paying job for a while but just got a new job that is a step up and could possibly be promoted again soon...but in our minds we havent adjusted to that yet)


and to muddle things up a bit more I also have some interest in a used Audi A4.

so basically if its just what I want it would be these 4

MS3, GTI, G37, A4
I could swing the MS3 new but the others would probably be used"

At what some consider the 2nd most important offensive position, where consistency is key to not only the QB but the entire line, we started 3 different players at center last year.  They consistently gave pressure up the middle to the point the run game was completely ineffective.  (Ineffective because we actually couldn't run the ball, not that our coaches decide not to)

The context of how the draft went is the biggest factor.  The Cowboys didn't have any leverage.  As mentioned above a lot of teams wanted to trade back because the lack of blue chip talent.  If you look at who was drafting behind us (NYG, then CHI) both of them also took what most would consider mid to late 1st round linemen (OT &amp; G).

IndependentBoof,Redskins,1388642891.0,"No I'm not, you just keep falling back on the ""you're not addressing my argument"" to everyone who rebuts your claim that Haslett hasn't had a chance.

To recap, quoting your own words, point-by-point:
&gt; It takes about 2-3 years to fully shift defensive schemes from a 4-3 to a 3-4.

And he's been there for 5 years and the defense keeps getting worse, not better.

&gt; Shanny said that the day he was brought on and its pretty much understood that it takes at least a couple years to make that shift.

And it's been longer than that.

&gt; The salary cap was overwhelmingly targeted toward defense and special teams.

Unsubstantiated. The salary cap is also a poor excuse that everyone blames here at /r/redskins. Was it unfair? Absolutely. Did it hold us back on a couple signings? Probably. Is it mostly responsible for any of our ailments? No. Allen restructured several contracts so that we didn't lose much more than Lorenzo. But he was special teams, so that's beside the point.

Both offense and defense had to make minor sacrifices (more so, lack of an extra signing or two). The offense got better while the defense progressively got *considerably* worse than what it was before Haslett arrived.

&gt; Haz's performance on other teams, and our performance prior to hiring Haz and switching defenses are irrelevant as they don't have anything to do with what I said.

No they're not irrelevant. You said he wasn't given a ""fair shake"". He's been given too long a chance in Washington already and if he really was better and we just didn't give him enough time, you could prove it by showing that he performed better when he didn't have a cap penalty or transitioning defensive schemes. Yet, when we look at his history, he's always sucked.

He was given a ""fair shake"" and in retrospect, he really shouldn't have been given a chance at all."
argleblather,needadvice,1388642895.0,"I do a reasonable impression of an adult some days. I'm 30, have a job/career I'm happy with, married, own a home. Very grownuppy type things. 

I say reasonable impression, because I have friends who have kids who don't really 'feel' like adults. Some people are old from birth, some aren't. 

I moved out, went to college, at 18 and haven't been back. Among many people of my generation, that seems to make me kind of an oddity. I didn't have a period of returning to the nest. I recommend that path if you can do it (for some it's not financially possible, or not feasible for other reasons.) but it means I've had to deal with feeding myself and making sure I have a place to live for 12 years or so. Some was college housing, but I've had utilities in my own name for 10 years. 

For advice... this is just my own experience, and your mileage may vary. 

* Live below your means. You'll probably be broke for some periods, learn how to spend thriftily during those times, and keep it up when things are better. Knowing how to do that let me pay off my student loans and purchase a home (with my husband) in the same year. 

* Hit 'zero' over and over when calling customer service until you get a person. Often you can talk to a person and explain what you need much more easily than navigating 10 different menus. If you don't know what kind of help you need, ask for technical support. They tend to have more behind the scenes access and can often help with more issues than you might expect. 

* When you know something is right for you, don't be swayed. If you know x job, significant other, city is right for you, go get it. Don't let detractors talk you out of something you feel in your gut is right. 

* Be kind. The world is a big place, and humans are generally a very selfish species. Most of the time kindness takes almost no effort, or skill on your part, and maybe a small amount of time and thought. 

* Try to live so that if everyone lived that way, things would work out pretty okay. Let others go ahead of you in lines sometimes, if you spill something, clean it up, call people once in a while just to say hi. 

* Figure out how to organize bills. Mine are pretty much all set up for autopay so I don't worry about it much. Setting up a folder, or a mail divider might also be helpful. Whatever your way of best organizing things is, find a way to sort out bills so that you don't end up with late fees. 
 
Everyone who has ever lived has had to figure out how to be what they are, and I think most of us don't realize 'hey, I'm a grown up!' until waaaaay past eighteen. "

Not quite. I agree with the sentiment, but want to correct the substance. In most cases, according to biblical law, rape is punishable by the death penalty. If the woman involved is engaged or married, the man would be put to death - and this includes the vast majority of coreligionist women in the ancient world. (Oh, and the rest of the cases? if the woman is single, the man pays a monetary penalty, but is also required to support the woman for the rest of her life, as a wife, so it's not just a minor property crime. On the other hand, rape of women outside of the tribe / during war, etc. was not a crime at all, it was part of how disparate groups interacted, a fact that was true through the middle ages, at least.)"

Why should it be that the large servers like NA and EUW have 50 challenger spots (&lt;0.005% of players), whereas smaller servers like Oceania have the same number of spots for a much smaller player base? (~0.05% challenger players).

In my opinion the challenger tier should represent somewhere between 0.05 and 0.1% of the total ranked player base on each server."

Get a nice, small piece of meat, usually a strip steak.  Trim any excess fat off.  

Heat up a wok or small cast iron pan with a bit of oil.  Sear the steak on each side, 30 seconds or so.  

Add equal parts soy sauce and mirin (cooking rice wine), about two tablespoons each per steak, and a bit of ginger and garlic.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes or so (or less, if you trust the source of your meat).

Pull the steak out and chill in the refrigerator for a few minutes.  While the steak chills, reduce the sauce to about half its original volume. Slice the steak as thin as you can and pour the reduced sauce over the top."

Of course, if she had gone to the police I would have been arrested. I separated from her, sought an injunction against her stalking me, and subsequently divorced her. I check with my son that she is not striking him, as I think it is only a matter of time.

It took about 3 months for me to be really comfortable going anywhere and eating a full meal or whatever (and I do have occasional relapses) but it is a massive positive change to my lifestyle.

Malarazz,AskReddit,1388643514.0,"The one time when I was discussing this with a girl (just a friend thankfully), she said you literally cannot possibly be kissed by someone without having some level of desire yourself, so that's why it's cheating.

Maklodes,TumblrInAction,1388643517.0,"This one actually strikes me as pretty reasonable. I don't think she's saying that the phrase ""strong, independent woman"" is ableist. (In fact, neither ""ableist"" nor ""strong, independent woman"" appear in her post.) It's more a gripe about how sometimes feminists act as if it's sexist to say that some women (like some men) are not strong (for most reasonable definitions of strength -- physical strength, strength of character, whatever -- there are women who aren't strong, right?). It's also a complaint about the tendency of some SJWs to act as if disability were not in any way... well... disabling, rather than being something that, while you can do a lot to overcome it, still sucks compared to being abled."

ndecker,teenagers,1388643539.0,"Well I went from a little boy to a man between 14 and 18. Did it through self discipline and a motivated family. Went from a shallow boy who sat inside playing video games all day, to a young man who is pursuing the steps to his career. 

Well it all started with my grandmother death 4 days after Christmas 2009. This showed me that life was finite and you have to make it last. She always kinda spoiled me and she basically raised me so it was tough the first year or so. I was stupid, went through my awkward phase then, and learned a lot about social interactions and life lessons then. Still I say around playing video games and didnt have much skill or talent to show for... Got first girlfriend around this time, learned how to treat girls right from her, as we didn't last long. 

By the time I was 16 I had my first job and was slowly coming out of my shell. I had some friends, I started a vocational school program that turned out to be the best decision of my life, and started doing a lot of things with my dad. He taught me a lot about home and auto do it yourself things. We built a master bathroom for my parents and renovated the old one for me. That vocational schooled paid for my private pilot license. At this time me and my dad rebuilt my grandmothers car and I use that car today as a commuter, yeah I feel like that car is a part of me. 

At 17 I had some jingle in my pocket, a lot of friends, but still played the video games. Verizon came by and dramatically capped our DSL service. Ehh we've tried to have then did it but there's nothing we can do about that. The only good thing about it is that it deterred me from online video games. I was a bad call of duty addict and I hated it. The school paid for my instrument pilot license as well. 

18 saw a lot of changes. I felt like my dad was my best friend, and he still is. I learned how to work with my hands, I'm outside weather permitting just tinkering all the time now, I have the best girlfriend I can ask for, she amazing (happy almost 4 months , 6 months talking) I have an awesome truck we rebuilt for fun, a 3.9 GPA and I'm studying to become a commercial pilot. 

Think I'm starting to like the person I've become. "

Noumenology,SRSGaming,1388643544.0,"&gt;Someday I expect to attend a PAX and not even be recognized. That’s honestly fine with me. I don’t want the material on PA or who I am to keep people from attending and enjoying PAX. During the Q&amp;A at PAX Prime we actually talked about slowly removing ourselves from the show over the next few years. We’ve been doing it for a decade now and I’m happy to step out of the way and let the show grow without me rather than inspite of me. That’s only part of the problem though. The other part is fixing some of my own issues and that’s something I need to do on my own. 

This, this right here, REALLY reads like a humblebrag to me. I want to believe, I appreciate the effort and all, but it's hard not to see this as one big grandiose gesture where Gabe hauls out a dusty old soapbox, telling us all how much ""soul-searching"" he's done, then limping off the soapbox and slowly hobbling into the sunset like a pathetic Incredible Sulk"

duckface08,nursing,1388643594.0,"I think it'll take some reflection on your part as to what exactly you're hating about med-surg. Some people just have no interest in it and/or have another specialty they feel passionate about, so moving on to something else would be reasonable.

If, however, you're just feeling overwhelmed and want a slower pace, it could just be that you're a new grad and are still on a steep learning curve as you transition from student to nurse. I remember being a new grad and feeling overwhelmed all the time, going from one task to the next and focusing on getting through the shift without killing anyone.

Now, a few years later, yeah, I still have my insanely crazy days but for the most part, things that used to overwhelm me are now normal to me. I no longer have to mentally go through the step-by-step procedure of changing a PICC dressing; I automatically grab what I need and just do it. I can now gauge how long I need for certain procedures and organize/prioritize my day based on that instead of guessing and taking longer than I thought when I was still new. Nowadays, I can have an unstable patient with tubes and lines in and out of everywhere and not bat an eye, whereas if I was a new grad, I'd freak out. I've learned so much over time that things I used to have to look up, read about, and think about are already in my head, so I can devote time to other things, like learning new stuff or talking with my patients.

Honestly, I think the decision will have more to do with what you want and where you actually see yourself over the next few years. The workload issue may or may not resolve on its own as you become accustomed to the pace and your new role."

davidmanheim,changemyview,1388643764.0,"I guess I was unclear on what you were asking about, I'm sorry. It seems that you are now asking an epistemological question about the nature of imperfect knowledge and perfect knowledge. I think it's closely related to the distinction you draw, but must be extended, which answers the question.

There is nothing, when we discuss human action and human understanding, that completely supersedes human reason. This isn't semantic, it is critical - the existence of God has no ability to make my decisions supersede myself, form the standpoint of logic. We can talk about perfect knowledge, but morality is only meaningful in the context of actions that occur via mediums that cannot convey perfect knowledge, our selves. All action, and its evaluation, therefore, critically hinges on human understanding. 

That said, I'm unsure what the difference is between having a non-objective moral code, and having an objective moral code that we cannot have any objective knowledge about (because we use flawed human reason to understand and apprehend it.) This difference does seem semantic. If God exists, it's a platonic objective moral code, but one that can only be subjectively approached, with no way of knowing is we are progressing or regressing, since only flawed reason can tell us that. If not, it's a subjective code. 

I'm not sure how to evaluate any difference between these two conceptions of a subjective moral code. Perhaps you can clarify?"

This is something that the core European social democracies do on a regular basis. Hell, Germany and France are even doing it right now not only to African or Asian countries, but to countries in their own Eurozone periphery. Germany and France are fighting tooth and nail to prevent Greek, Spanish, and Italian workers from enjoying the same protections and wages that German and French workers enjoy.

German and French financial irresponsibility is at the core of the current Euro crisis (in much the same way that Wall Street irresponsibility and greed is at the heart of our financial crisis in the US), but the price for that gets shoved onto the periphery, essentially because the central European countries can get away with it. That's the sort of behavior you get with capitalism, and social democracy doesn't do a damn thing to stop it.

2. Yes, this is highly documented and studied. Check out the Discovery documentary ""The Science of Sex Appeal"". Men will always want beautiful women, women will always want the alpha. The reason is a result of evolution, our genetics are much more powerful than anything society tells us.

3. No, I don't think all women do, there is a very small minority of LGBT, a-sexual etc... But the vast majority of woman are attracted to dominance. Even the ones that won't admit it, *especially* the ones that won't admit it.

I don't only care about sex, no one here does. It is a subreddit about sexual strategy so that is what we talk about.

I over analyze stuff all the time and always have because, in the past, I've been ""burned"" by overlooking details (like not double-checking the deadline for something, or assuming that someone else completed a task I asked them to do).

I learned to force myself not to think about things once I analyze it *thoroughly* a few times.  At first it was really hard, but over time I realized that not analyzing something to death *did not* result in a catastrophe so I gained more confidence.

I also learned to accept that I'm just an over analyzer, and that it can be a *good* quality.  My attention to detail and organizational skills are pretty amazing because I triple-check things in my head all the time.

I used to be pretty good at explaining things (I used to be a trainer at my last job), but over the course of getting my math degree, I found that my language skills have gotten a lot worse.  I've found that it helps a lot to practice explaining things.  It felt foolish at first, because what kind of idiot has to practice *talking*?  But one of my favorite professors (and IMO, smartest and most charismatic) admitted to me that he practices talking to other people all the time.  

If you think about it, it's actually quite difficult to explain a process clearly to another human being because you can't just recite your steps, you have to ""repackage"" the process in a way that makes sense to someone who was not there for the process.

Reading fiction is supposed to help with language skills, too, so I am trying to do that as well.

Shifting up changes the ratio of engine rotation to wheel rotation and  compounds the issue (in much the same way that starting the car in 2nd would).

They wanted someone with experience in this area and I thought it would be awesome because I enjoy group sex and they are my friends, so why not?  The threesome itself was great, but things became awkward the next day.  My friend became pretty insecure about his relationship, how much his wife loved him, and he would constantly say that I was only hanging out with him so I could fuck his wife.  That friendship ended, I tried saying sorry in as many ways as I could but the damange was done.  A while back I decided to look him up, I'm friends with his wife on Facebook so I figured why not see what he's up to.  He doesn't have a Facebook profile, that's not strange.  I decided to Google his name and that's where I found out from an article in the local paper that he's in jail for the next 5 years for raping a woman.

Triplanetary,socialism,1388644519.0,"The ubiquity of cash transactions we see today may seem like an old, old concept, but it's actually fairly modern. Yes, currency has been around for thousands of years, but until the 19th century, it was not exchanged in every single transaction. More common by far was *credit* - and again, not in the modern banking sense (though that happened too, obviously), but in terms of personal relationships between people. *Trust* between members of a community. Open-and-shut, tit-for-tat transactions have historically been reserved for strangers and members of different communities who had no basis to trust each other.

The ubiquity of cash today has the function of breaking down those trust relations between people, making impersonal and self-interested transactions feel normal.

I'm not sure I'd go so far as to claim that money *is* slavery - I'm not comfortable comparing things to slavery because it implies that I've experienced a hardship and level of oppression that I can't begin to fathom - but David Graeber makes a case for the strong interconnection between money and slavery in his book *Debt*."

Less thinking and more doing is the answer to getting out of that funk. You can know all there is to know about PUA theory etc. but if you're not an interesting person otherwise, you won't get many bites.

And what's wrong with being a self-improving introvert in the way he describes. There is something beautiful about committing to a little me-time to help you accomplish your goals.

smootie,college,1388645310.0,"Man, if I was able to get by as college student at 30+ years old, you're going to do fine at 23!

There will be tons of other students your age.  Even if it's traditional school, many seniors will be 23.  Unless you walk around with your age emblazoned on your shirt, no one will know (or care) that you're 23.

It sounds like you are most worried about making friends in college.  Here are some tips that worked for me:

*  Don't expect to find besties right away.  It takes time for most people to warm up to new friends so give it time.  I don't want to see a post from you in /r/needadvice in a month complaining about how nobody likes you!

*  Small talk is lame but it exists for a reason.  I personally hate small talk, but I've learned that it's a fact of life.  For most people, it's the best way to get a conversation going.  Make small talk with people in your classes.

&gt;""Have you taken a class from this prof before?"" 

&gt;  ""Do you know how much the final exam is worth?""

&gt;  ""Have you started on the homework?"" and ""What did you get for #4?""

&gt;  ""This is my first semester here.  Is there anywhere good to eat nearby?""

*  Be proactive and invite people to do stuff (don't wait for them to initiate).  Many people will say no, but it's a game of numbers.  Eventually someone will say yes.

*  It's easiest to make friends in your major because you automatically have something in common.

Good luck!  You'll do great!"

That said.

Fidelity is a funny game. Some people make up rules for what counts as their own version of fidelity, to evade issues like cheating. That can be a very slippery slope..

For a number of years, (total of 7+ so far) my current SO and I have: broken up multiple times; dated other people; (I actually only dated one.. Almost married him..!) as well as ""opening"" our relationship (on his end). All of it was so, so painful for me. Explosive pain. Just always in such a constant state of hurt. (We have other issue on top of this as well). 

But.. The past couple months have been decent. Quiet. I'm not stressed about him cheating, it has completely left my system, that care/worry.. I changed. He changed. It's much less dramatic now. Yay. 

Keep your guard up for a bit.. Make sure the person is worth you putting in so much of your energy, etc., it's so hard to see clearly in these periods.

But in the meantime, stop throwing food. You might kill someone and start a tantrum spiral. Go on light duty for a while, admire some nice statues, and make sure your dead are good and buried.

You've basically just swung your argument 180 degrees away from mine while calling me sexist (which is meaningless), ...while that is equally sexist, and doesn't meet the level of integrity established by your own objections. 

By the logic of ""which gender develops ""sexual allure"" faster"" (whatever that means...) in a highschool, you can guarantee the young, attractive athletes are going to be far more aware of the effect they have on their female colleges, than the young girls do on the boys. 

&gt;Secondly, boys have feelings too, and physical sex before the person is emotionally ready will affect the rest of their lives.

I disagree with both points. It sounds like MRA drivvle. Support this position with a coherent argument...I'd like to see how you got there....

She began to dance in a state of euphoria. This is what she knew. This is what she lived for. Her blue body swayed like a palm tree in the wind creating click-clack sounds with the material of her skirt. She pranced forward over the wet and bloodied human bodies, decapitating them as she went. Her necklace was missing some beading from her last cyclonic adventure and she intended to mend it. 


“Do you not see the wreckage you’ve caused? Do you not love these believers?” a voice cried out. It could not be human, she had killed the ones near. She had gotten drunk on their blood in act of victory.


“These were not believers,” she slurred. “These were worshipers. They were their own idols. They prayed in currency. They adored war. They gave thanks with lying tongues,” she explained incredulously. 


“Maybe they could have changed,” he suggested.


“My dear, they have heard your words for over 2000 years now and have done little to improve their minute world. You believe I am here with the singular intention of sating my lust for blood but that is only partially true. They have cast themselves into darkness and that is why I am here. I was summoned.” -001

A helmet can really only do so much. It isn't going to save your ass from slamming into a tree at 40 mph. What it does do though is take what normally would be a shitty wipe out that would leave you sitting half the day out and turning it into something you can shake off easily.

dukiduke,food,1388645840.0,"Cooked up four racks of spareribs for a New Years BBQ, and I once again reminded myself both how great this technique/recipe is and how lackluster restaurant ribs are. Big thanks to [Amazing Ribs](http://amazingribs.com/recipes/porknography/best_BBQ_ribs_ever.html)!

I joined forces with my uncle for the first time, and we used his Big Green Egg and normal Weber propane grill to cook the ribs. Neither of us had done ribs on a grill before, so it was a (delicious) learning experience. I trimmed them down to St. Louis-sized racks, put my favorite Mephis Dust rub on the slabs and the trimmings, and let them sit in the fridge overnight. 

We fired the grills up around 9:30 this morning, put water pans right on the coals in the BGE and over the flame covers on the grill, and got the thermometers on both around 250-275 F (we went off the built-in dial thermometers on the grills, so I think it was hotter than that). Added soaked apple wood chips directly to the coals on the BGE and in a pierced aluminum foil envelope to the grill. We also had mesquite ones, but I don't think he added those. Ribs went on at 10:00. Two racks in the BGE that, due to size limitations, we cut in half and cooked standing up using a V-rack (flipped them every hour or so). The other two racks and the trimmings went on the gas grill. Snacked on some of the trimmings as they finished earlier, and took the racks off around 2:30 (I believe). 

Fricken amazing! The ones on the BGE had a terrific and balanced smokey flavor, something that's obviously been missing when I've done these in the oven. I don't know if I got a good picture of it, but I think the ones on the BGE did have a little bit of a smoke ring, too. All of them were all juicy, succulent, and didn't really even need sauce. And the trimmings were just as good as the racks. It's the same tender meat with no bones. Those were best chopped up with some sauce with a little kick - lip-smacking delicious. I am in love with ribs, and this hit the SPOT. I've made these ribs in the oven about a half dozen times before, and these might have been the tastiest ones yet. 

As for sides, we had a sweet-n-sour coleslaw, a traditional creamy coleslaw, a carrot, apple, and cranberry salad with some mayo dressing, and brussels sprouts sauteed with pancetta, garlic, olive oil, S&amp;P, and balsamic vinegar.

You can do a lot to show interest in what they are saying by not crossing your arms too.

I've heard RBF (resting b face) is bad, but you should smile. You said smiling without a reason seems fake. Maybe you could think 'why not smile?!?' Smiling brightens your face up, makes you appear more friendly, and makes yourself and others happier. Sometimes smiling at people makes their day or changes their mood. I always smile!

Because I truly believe that these things are much, much more important than if a person's shirt is the right size or if a person's pants are too baggy. 

Also because I have a limited amount of close girl friends from which to poll on what women as a large group really care about, so I can only answer as per what I and my close friends have discussed. Which is sort of the issue with any ""what do women want/prefer/like"" question as none of us here can truly speak to the desires of such a large group.

Ichorum,AskMen,1388646215.0,"Later on tonight.

Things are just coming to a head, and today I was trying really hard to do right and with everything my mother just dropped on me, I feel like nothing I did today was helpful or was right.

The house is a disaster and I cleaned up after the cat got sick. My Grandfather came down from his house and there wasn't anywhere he could really sit, so I moved around some things for him and had a nice conversation with him about the family and how the only family members that haven't done the rest of the family wrong are my mother, one of my uncles, and him. We talked for around an hour and a half about that among other things and he never said anything about the house, and it was just nice.

Then, when my mom got off of work I told her that he came down and she just blew up. She was just talking about how if she were home she would have just told him to come back the next day, how disgusting the house was, how people must feel when there's cat vomit on the floor, (which I cleaned up, and she still said it was disgusting.) and how everyone that comes in must think we're slobs.

My mom has severe asthma and is a smoker (I know. Please believe me, it hurts and I know.) she hadn't had a cigarette at all today so I'm sure that's part of the explosion, but when she talks about how terrible the house is, she's basically saying I'm terrible. The only thing she does in the house is the cooking and that's assuming she doesn't feel too run down from work. 

I do cat litter when she's not here so the dust doesn't get to her, I do the dishes so she doesn't get out of breath, I do the trash so she doesn't have to walk out exerting herself, I vacuum for the aforementioned dust reason, I do the lawn/shoveling/weeding because she can't. I'm starting to cook too so I can keep her in the living room, away from the oven and from getting overheated. I can smell her smoking right now and it's just depressing. 

I don't have a job, I don't go to school, I'm not in the reserves. I'm doing nothing, I feel like nothing, nothing's biting, and it hurts like everything. I feel like I can't do right and I just want her to be happy. I don't have a learner's, let alone a license, I don't go out, I celebrated NYE alone and I can't find it in me to care about anything else but making someone's life easier, and I'm doing everything I can, and it amounts to nothing. 

I realized she's part of the web of reasons why I'm so depressed and I have no idea what to do. I don't have anywhere to go, I have nothing. I don't care if I end up dying twenty years from now, forty years from now, or twenty minutes from now. I don't care if I end up homeless. I know I've done well in the painfully long, but short time I've been here. I've done right by others, but I can't make her happy, and she deserves it, and it's killing me, or at least trying to.

I've tripped on the unexpected landmines that life seems to be laying out for us all, I've lost my best friend, I've lived with terrible things that have happened to me, but I've always gotten back up. I know I'll take twenty more stands until I'm absolutely certain I've helped as much as I can, but I'll be god damned if right now I don't feel like waving the white flag and hiding in the covers until life just blows over.

Sorry it's long. If you've made it this far, thank you. I'm glad you saw it."

Because I'm going to tell you straight up that your girlfriend has spoken what is on her heart, and that is how it is. This does not mean that you are lacking in any way, or that there is something wrong with you. Sometimes, even people who are in love cannot coexist. It takes a lot of guts to admit you have shortcomings. I am willing to bet that through more self-discovery you will find that you have more strengths than weaknesses. Never settle for less than what you deserve... and you deserve to be loved for the wonderful man that you are.

What pain are you solving? Who has it? Is this a vitamin, aspirin or vaccine?

What's your strategy for overcoming the chicken and egg problem in any marketplace solution?

You want app Devs to do the grunt work of putting their apps in...
But they won't bother because you have no visitors/eyeballs
And they won't reward people with free apps for reviews since there's no-one to read the reviews.

The visitors won't come because you won't have a comprehensive enough listing of apps (to start).

You can't get enough visitors to know about it and use it without a ton of marketing spend. These are all the chicken-and-egg issues for which a strategy is needed.

What's your revenue stream? Advertising is a weak answer: do you realize how many eyeballs you need for that to have any impact? A friend of mine works for a company with a top 100 traffic website, and they didn't make enough off banner ads to support the 10 employees, and had to pivot.

I started with Ignatius' letter to Polycarp.

I looked Ignatius up, and it turns out he and Polycarp were disciples of John; Ignatius was bishop of Antioch (where we were first called ""Christians"") while Polycarp was bishop of Smyrna.

Antioch is in south central Turkey near the border with Syria, and Smyrna is in western Turkey on the coast of the Aegean Sea across from Greece. Both towns still exist and have people living there plus a lot of interesting ruins from ancient times and have thriving tourist industries. There are tours where you can follow Paul's missionary journeys that include these and other places mentioned in Acts.

These letters from Ignatius were apparently written around 105-115, and John died around 90, so these letters are coming fifteen to twenty-five years after John died. Ignatius wrote them on his way to Rome to be eaten by lions during the halftime show in the Coliseum.

On the whole, in the letter to Polycarp, Ignatius is pretty much saying all the same things Paul said to Timothy and Titus about how to be a bishop.

At one point in the letter Ignatius talks about how to deal with people who have voluntarily given up marriage.

""If any one can continue in a state of purity, to the honour of Him who is Lord of the flesh, let him so remain without boasting. If he begins to boast, he is undone; and if he reckon himself greater than the bishop, he is ruined.""

In other words, those who have given up marriage have the tendency to think themselves better than those who have not, out of spiritual pride.

I think there is a lot of truth to this. As a Catholic I acknowledge the single state - or rather the celibate state, where you make an explicit vow to forgo marriage - to be better in and of itself than marriage, but ... the taller they are, the harder they fall, right?"

But this person DID come across it, and then *downloaded* it. If you came across it, would you download it? He did! And then, because his lawyer didn't think he could win his case in court (because, duh! he broke the law), he took a plea deal.

I don't know if this guy is a pedophile, and neither do you. We can't make that assessment. What point are you trying to make, exactly? That looking at child porn is ok if you're just curious? Is that a valid excuse? ""Sorry judge, I just downloaded it because I was curious.""

There's a huge difference between talking about your looks and giving someone hurtful and unasked for critique on their appearance, especially when pretty much saying that they are the ugliest of their friends.

Personally, sex is a huge part of life and a huge part about getting to know yourself and your significant other.  You learn so much about the other person in the bedroom that I wouldn't want to wait and eventually figure out that we're not compatible.

I know my friend would constantly ask me questions about what to do in bed with his woman, and that she was having a lot of problems reaching an orgasm because neither one of them had any idea what they were doing down there.  In the end it turned out to be a fun learning experience for both of them though, and now she's pregnant with their first kid on the way.

ScipiiRye,TumblrInAction,1388647207.0,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_canada

&gt; Slavery in what now comprises Canada existed until 1833, when slavery was officially abolished. Some slaves were of African descent, but most were aboriginal (typically called panis, likely a corruption of Pawnee). Slavery within Canada's current geography was practised primarily by Aboriginal groups. While there was never any significant Canadian trade in African slaves, native nations frequently enslaved their rivals and a very modest number (sometimes none in a number of years) were purchased by colonial administrators (rarely by settlers) until 1833, when the slave trade was abolished across the British Empire.

Slaves have existed in New France and Canada as a British colony;

&gt; Historian Marcel Trudel has recorded 4,092 slaves throughout Canadian history, of which 2,692 were aboriginal people, owned mostly by the French, and 1,400 blacks owned mostly by the British

The largest influx of slaves were from British loyalists fleeing the American revolution. Their rights to their slaves were guaranteed by British law, but in the span of 10 years the colony passed the [Act Against Slavery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_Against_Slavery) in 1793 which prohibited the importation of any more slaves.

So don't feel bad about shitting on your fellow Canadians, because you're not! The French had slaves, the British had slaves, but the Canadians did not. I am not a believer in holding modern-day Canadians accountable for the actions of the French and the British. "

Nogbadd,AskMen,1388647420.0,"Sure.

Assuming you meant to write that ""men are not as easily manipulated as women"", the onus is on you to support this generalisation. We all mature at different rates, but in general an adult will be more able to manipulate a younger person. 
But your contention is that a young man is LESS easily manipulated than a young woman. I disagree! They are either as likely to be manipulated, as they have less life experience, or the girl will have been exposed to many more warnings and guidance than a young man. Her propensity to question the motivation of someone making overtures will be at least as great, and probably greater, than a young man. This sensitivity will be related to an awareness of the *potential* for manipulation; ""I am being seduced by someone in a position of authority!"" You claim the reverse based on....well you suggested which part of your anatomy your argument came from.

When teenagers enter puberty, they experience a range of physical and emotional changes. When a boy's voice changes, and he develops stubble, and starts to grow, we can see his development. Boys tend to feel awkward as they grow into their body, and adjust to their voice and hormonal drives. None of this is especially attractive! When a young woman starts puberty, she may develop a million insecurities, she may be anxious about her body, but outwardly she develops curves and the sexual allure that attracts interest from others. She will learn that men look at her, and talk to her and that men are interested in her body. She will also learn that some men are interested in her body for their sexual pleasure. 

In general, teenage boys do not experience being sexually objectified as much as teenage girls. But maybe you and I visit different websites? The notion that boys are not hurt by sexual abuse by women is one of the myths that is being busted again and again. But many people cling to this myth, on the 'nudge nudge, wink wink' basis. try [here](http://www.pandys.org/survivingthememories/id8.html) or [here](http://forge-forward.org/wp-content/docs/Female-perpetrators-and-male-victims-why-they-are-invisible_mjw.pdf)

Sexual allure means that girls are aware of their sexual attraction before boys, as girls mature earlier than boys. Being self conscious about breasts which boys are staring at is a bit different than being self conscious about your penis which no one has ever seen but you. 

You then give an example of a straw man, relating the impact young men who perceive themselves to be attractive perceive that they have on young women. This is irrelevant. The post is about an older women developing a relationship with a younger male, not a peer to peer relationship.

There are my coherent arguments. Where are yours?

Brown some diced chicken breast and hot link (andouille if you're fancy) sausage in a pan. Add to a box of Zatarain's gumbo or etouffe as directed. Add peeled and deveined shrimp as box instructs. A French baguette with butter is a perfect side.

Slice tomatoes. Open a can or jar of marinated artichoke hearts, drain them for a bit so they're not soaked in oil. Scramble some eggs. Add the hearts, the tomatoes, and some feta cheese, in that order. You only want to get the veggies hot, not melt them.

Lay out about two feet of aluminum foil. Place salmon on foil (whatever size Sam's Club/Costco sells). Season liberally with cajun or creole seasoning. LIBERALLY. Coat that shit. Add a half stick of butter, plop it right on top. Close up foil around salmon. Bake at 400 for 10-15 min or grill for the same amount of time. If it's not completely cooked but warm throughout, you're good.

Asparagus. Cut the bottoms off, about half an inch. Toss in oil, salt, and pepper. Put in foil boat like salmon and cook for similar times.

Buy frozen, raw chicken wings/drums. Thaw. Toss in oil, salt, and pepper. Grill for 15 minutes or so, or bake at 400 for a similar time. Combine Frank's red hot sauce and butter per label instructions or buy Frank's buffalo wing sauce. Toss cooked chicken in sauce. Toss salad (chopped romaine or iceberg) with some cherry tomatoes, serve with bleu cheese (or ranch for pussies) dressing.

Buy a log of Jimmy Dean sausage, brown in pan. Scramble eggs, cook in pan with sausage. (1/2 of a Jimmy Dean log is about 1 dozen eggs). Add creole seasoning liberally, serve. OR: fry pork chorizo in pan, add scrambled eggs. No seasoning."

Unfortunately or fortunately (depending on your viewpoint) Native Americans/First Nation/Indians have been given the image of the [Noble Savage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage) over the past thirty or so years and the world has swallowed it hook line and sinker.  Its much better then before but when they were seen as barbarians waiting to be converted to Christianity but all the same as an avid historian I've gotten in lots of arguments with people about the subject.  There are lots of folks who believe that before the evil white man came to America the Indians lived war free lives where all they did was smoke peace pipes and dance around fires and shit like that.  I have this hippy at my retail job who talks about how the Native Americans were these enlightened people who lived spiritual war free lives before ol' whitey came (he almost started crying at the end).

This is what I was getting at - people have a tendency to *far* overplay the small differences between the sexes, as if proof of difference is justification for the whole litany of culturally constructed gender norms (which, as long as we're talking evidence, have changed drastically enough over the centuries and cultures to indicate that biology is a minor factor in play)."

You had a difficult experience on a powerful psychedelic, one that raises some interesting existential/philosophical questions, but you're dealing with a lot of anxiety right now, so you really shouldn't try and ruminate on them too hard.

Just replace ""man"" with ""kW"" and it makes perfect sense, e.g. if a microwave needs 2 kW of power to run, then running it for an hour uses up 2 kWh of energy.

*Note: No offense to the ladies, but ""person-hour"" isn't as commonly used as the archaic ""man-hour"", so making this comment slightly less sexist would also make it less helpful.*"

Jakedubbleya,AskReddit,1388648491.0,"Chili. Just google chili recipes, there are some REALLY good ones people have submitted to recipe databases. 

My favorite thing about chili is you can feed yourself/others for a week on 30 bucks worth of quality ingredients and the longer it stays in the fridge the better it gets. And it's easy, so easy. I prefer a spicy sausage (not hot dog) chili myself because organ meats have all the good nutrients, pork is extremely cheap and spicy sausage was created by god for this very purpose. If you are the vegetarian type then you can try suicide as an acceptable substitute.

Next throw some mixed greens (the more bitter the better, iceberg lettuce is NOT what I'm talking about here) in with some balsamic, onions, sliced tomatoes, green olives and feta and bam you got your greens covered. Once again I like spicy so I often add some hot peppers to the salad as well.

My favorite part is that with some eggs in your fridge you can mix the greens, peppers, sausage and feta in to the eggs and cover it with some balsamic for a kickass breakfast scramble :)

After ten years of bachelorhood this is my ultimate ""in-the-fridge-at-all-times"" combo of foods and it's kept me healthy, fit, full, happy and well liked by visitors. It's also so damned cheap and easy to prepare and clean up. I also keep a few bags of costco fruits, potatoes and onions around because they are dirt cheap and you can do so much with those things and once my produce starts to turn I throw it all in the juicer or make wine out of 'em (yeah, you can make spinach-pear-onion wine).

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1388648505.0,"I've never owned a business, but worked for people that have. A flower shop and now a pizza kitchen. 

Any thing perishable should be sold 3-4 times what you paid for it at wholesale to make a good profit. Non-perishable is typically twice what you initially paid for. 

To run a business is very difficult. Make sure it is something you truly enjoy because passion is what makes a business run. 

Granted its a pizza kitchen, my boss has had it going for 18 years and is going strong - because she enjoys what she does.

Ralkir,changemyview,1388649278.0,"&gt;You have not adequately convinced me to accept that claim.

Well if you are refuting the correlation that's a completely different situation than saying it is a correlation therefore it does not matter, because the fact remains that if there is a correlation it does matter. 

&gt;And I would disagree. This is a broad generalization, and I feel it is rapidly refuted by any number of exceptions. An partner in a physically abusive relationship able to escape and build a new life. A naive person who entered into a contract without realizing that they were not going to be fulfilled/satisfied with that one exclusive partner. Somebody who became financially entangled with somebody who had huge undisclosed debt. All of these are examples where a divorce is preferable to a marriage with no divorce.

I will admit my statement was not specific enough for what I was trying to say. What I was trying to say is that a divorce is always bad when compared to a marriage that does not need or warrant a divorce. What this means is, a divorce is an indication that something went wrong or was wrong. That is inherently bad when compared to a successful and happy marriage.

Using it at DL, however, I found it to be quite a bit less accurate. The basic information is reliable, as far as which rides you can expect to be open on given days, which will be in high demand later in the day, and definitely the best time to be in the park is the first 2-3 hours from rope-drop.

Are you planning to visit both parks on Sunday? That may make splitting up the precious early morning hours a bit more tricky, but if I had to pick a park for a crowded afternoon, it would be California Adventure. Although it's smaller, the paths are wider and it's generally designed to better handle crowd-flow. Also, because DL has the classic attractions and no alcohol, it seems to attract the majority of the stroller-set, which makes maneuvering (assuming you're without one?) easier in DCA. "

ScipiiRye,TumblrInAction,1388649495.0,"Also: there are typically two styles of sonnet studied in English literature: the Petrarchan (or Italian) sonnet and the Shakespearean (or English) sonnet.

The Shakespearean typically consists of 3 quattrains and a final couplet, the volta occuring between the last quattrain and the couplet, with a usual rhyming scheme of abab/cdcd/efef and gg. There are several of Shakespeare's sonnets that defy this convention, however, the only one I can recall offhand is Sonnet 35.

The Petrarchan usually incorporates two quattrains (or an octave) and a sestet, and the volta occurs near the first line of the sestet. The rhyming scheme usually is abba/abab/cdcdcd.

Generally speaking, though, the sonnet is a 14-line poem in iambic pentameter.

Kairos27,worldnews,1388649603.0,"In regards to your example; it depends. Here's how it works:

The uneducated are at the whim of the educated/ those in a position of power. So basically, the more power you have, the more pull you have. If you murder, but you don't have connections in the police force, or anyone else higher up, or with anyone who could intimidate said people, you'll get fucked up by the cops and everyone else. However, if you DID have connections, you'd be let off scott free. 

No-one using it as an excuse, the fact is that India needs everyone to be educated, and have a decent income, so that they can fight back against these corrupted officials who have learned they have a whole lot of power. They do things like tell little kids that because they were walking in the street, they're being fined, and the kids don't know any better.

evilbrent,lifeinapost,1388649620.0,"Hi, nice story.

So. I want to pass on a piece of writing wisdom that my high school english teacher passed on to me in my final year of highschool. I had written a (perfectly good, I mean, I got full marks for English in high school) essay about a tremendously emotionally important experience (for me, it was a particular moment in a sport where I had performed very well and experienced a rush of adrenaline and self-esteem) and in my writing I repeated phrases like ""the best experience in my whole life"" and ""never been so scared in my whole life"" and ""more on the edge than I'd ever been in my whole life"".

My teacher was very nice about it, and I'm trying to be here. But... you're 19. You're a baby. Your whole life hasn't happened yet, not by a long shot. There is almost no chance that in fifteen years time you will consider this the love of your life. This depression you have is legitimate, and the emotions you're having are real, but (and this may not seem like a nice thing to say) but if you think that's heart-break, boy, are you going to be in for a surprise!!

And I mean this in the nicest way possible. Getting your heart broken is how you know you're alive, it's how you know that your life is progressing and you're getting older and more mature and more ready for the time when your true actual love will come along.

These transient moments of time that you write about, those are real, and your life will be made up of a huge series of moments just like them. I get that this experience has in a large way shaped your idea of yourself as a blossoming man up to now, but when you're 30, I guarantee you that all of this will be a pleasant memory, a learning experience."

OrigamiRock,changemyview,1388649649.0,"Let's take the example of the Iranians, who in the early 1200's far surpassed Europeans in Mathematics, Astronomy and Medicine. They happened to be unlucky enough to live in Genghis Khan's path and he came along, burned their cities and libraries and slaughtered 75% of their population. It took several centuries for their civilization to recover. The population of the Iranian plateau didn't get back to pre-Genghis numbers until the 1950s. 

This left them vulnerable to anyone else who came along and eventually the Russians and British. After carving more and more of their land away, those two empires eventually split Iran/Persia in two spheres of influence and proceeded to dominate trade and foreign affairs. Since by this point they had the technological advantage (as well as sheer numbers) any efforts to exert Iranian independence were futile. 

This culminated in shifting dynasties until Reza Pahlavi took over and managed to soften the shackles a bit and sign some trade deals with the Germans. Him declaring neutrality at the start of WW2 didn't seem to matter and the Allies invaded Iran anyway and replaced him with his young (more pliable) son. Obviously the reason for this was the other geographic curse: oil. 

So there you have a few centuries of European domination of a west Asian country that was originally far more advanced, all because it was unlucky enough to be in Genghis Khan's way. "

WW helped my parents to lose a significant amount of weight. My dad went from seriously obese to 'normal' weight, and doing WW helped to reduce his blood pressure, he no longer needs to take meds for it. My mom also lost a lot of weight, though she has regained some and is no longer doing WW. Basically if you're going to be on WW you need to realize that a) losing weight is difficult for women and ESPECIALLY for the 90% of PCOS diagnosed women who are overweight/obese, and b) you can't just do the diet, lose the weight, then go back to eating however you want, it has to be a life long commitment to eating in a controlled manner.

It was hard the first few weeks and I had to literally slap my hands out of the way. But once you get past the first 30 days it gets a lot easier. 

I am now a YEAR without nail biting!! :D I am now a lacquerista!! I love painting my beautiful long nails and seeing them decked out in polish makes me hate that it was ever a habit to destroy them! 

Honestly I just gave myself a reason, after getting on /r/redditlaqueristas I knew I wanted to decorate my nails and not just nom on them. Also, my boyfriend loves back scratches and I wasn't able to give them to him because I had little nubs. So that was partially the reason, I wanted to give him back scratches before bed instead of just nub rubs haha

Anyways. It's a mindset and you have to be ready to make that change. I still have days where I pick at my cuticles but I make a mental note to  just put lotion on them and see them grow better.

Some law enforcement departments are undertrained in matters like this, or with issues like rape or domestic abuse. They often are educated on these matters by third party sources as they aren't included in their typical training.

Shacod,gaming,1388650521.0,"With the way people play in the standalone, getting attached is a really, really bad idea. You are either equally geared and die because someone saw you and shot without interacting first; or less geared and die because no matter how hard you try, 10 5.56mm rounds to the chest is a lot less escapable than the swing of an axe. If someone with a gun sees you before you see them, you've already lost. 

On the bright side, when I have a fresh spawn I can just pull out the dukes and try to punch somebody with better gear into submission before they see me, I mean at that point I have nothing to lose and most likely a better spawnpoint to gain."

25tolife_,AskReddit,1388650642.0,"Another easy mexican dish: Tamale pie.

Ingredients (serving size: 1 baking dish)

* 1 package hamburger beef
* 2 cans sweet corn
* 1 uncut stem of wild onions
* 2 cans rotel tomatoes
* 1 package shredded cheese
* 1 small tub sour cream
* 1 can enchilada sauce
* 1 package of tortillas

Brown the beef in a large stove top skillet, separating into smaller pieces. Dice wild onions and add into skillet along with sweet corn, rotel tomatoes and enchilada sauce (approx. 1 can). Let skillet come to a medium boil and let simmer for about 15 minutes. (There's a lot in the skillet, it's ok to give it some time).

Prepare a circular baking dish by spreading sour cream onto a tortilla and place at the bottom, facing up. Add meat and sauce mixture, top with shredded cheese, and repeat until you reach the top. Finish with a tortilla on top, and spread shredded cheese on top of the last tortilla. (This will cause the top tortilla to be crunchy instead of soft when baking it).

Bake the tamale pie for about 10-12 minutes at 425 or until top tortilla is golden brown. Serves 2-4 people.

InvictusRex,AskMen,1388650657.0,"&gt; I am a darker / more serious person in general

Actually, it's probably this.  Being serious has never once helped landing a girl.  Serious isn't fun.  Having your life together isn't fun.  

-------------------

I used to be a douche and it took me a while to realize, so I hope you understand I'm not trying to be mean, just trying to help.  Hopefully this might be a bit of an eye opener:

&gt; Sorry if this comes off as narcissistic or self centered.

You preempt the whole thing by apologizing for being narcissistic.... So at some level you know you are.  That's not a trait to be proud of.  

&gt; I don't really need to study hard and I've got excellent grades, I'll get a scholarship for Uni next year. Because of that, I devote most of my free time to be productive and to work on my ""quest"" to excellence.

A modest person would have written: ""I do well in school and have a lot of free time...""  

&gt; I've been working out for almost 3 years now and my body is looking great, I've almost maxed out my genetic potential and I could probably compete in natty competitions with a bit of extra prep and devotion.

So you're a geneticist now and can determine what your body's natural potential is?  That's nobel prize quality shit right there.  Again, it's un-necessary fluff that makes you sound.. arrogant.  A modest person would say: ""I've been working out for almost 3 years now and my book is looking great""

&gt; I learned how to sew so I altered all of my stuff to fit like bespoke stuff.

Gives off a ""know it all"" and douchy vibe.  This is something that has really no place in your post, you throw it in because you're proud of it (which is fine), but what matters is how it sounds to other people.  

&gt; I work as a part-time salesman in a clothing store and I pull off great numbers. Nothing much to say here.

There's ""nothing much to say here"", because again this is more information that has no reason to be in your post.  You've added it in to show how ""awesome"" you are.

&gt; I also own a business that I started last year with my 3 of my friends. Basically, we are specialized in the event fields and we organize the **biggest** parties for my school level in my town. **Think 1000+ people every time. I'm glad to help hundreds of people hook up every few months during these events, but I sadly can't partake to such things because I have to work and make sure the event runs smoothly. I don't seem to get much cred for these things from the women out there. You'd think that the party host would get some fame, but it doesn't seem to do shit, probably because it's mainly hard work behind the scenes and because people don't necesserately label me with the events. From what I see, my salesmen pull off most of the fame from these.**

The parts in bold, make you sound like a douche.  It's more unnecessary garbage that has no real importance and is just added to show how awesome you are.  

&gt; I also participate in a club at school where I have the roles of a VP.

Being VP of a club in school means jack shit. Why the fuck was this included?  

--------------------------------------------------

All that stuff I mentioned is good stuff.  It's important to be proud of your life, but you don't have to stuff your accomplishments down people's throats.  People don't like that.  Maybe, as an exercise, look through your phone and see if you do this elsewhere.  See if you're just throwing in extra information into your conversations that really doesn't belong, but you include it because it makes you seem awesome and superior.  Also try to actively think about what you say aloud.  Before you say something, ask yourself it it actually contributes, or if you're just throwing it out there cause it builds you up.  "

He is her boss. He knows her schedule, and if it *were* work related, he would not be asking her that question.

She deflected the issue instead of helping make you feel secure, because she's guilty of something.

Were she innocent of anything she would not be texting her boss late at night for random conversation, or ignoring your concerns and acting like you were in the wrong. She would instead have explained exactly the situation that called for such texts, and would want to do whatever it took to make you more comfortable in the future. She would not have used past relationships to justify her unwillingness to expand on the conversation you were having. She also wouldn't have (the next morning) tried to shame you because of your very legitimate question the night before regarding her boss. 

The text asked when he would be seeing her ""again""... If it's not work related, which it almost certainly isn't - that means it's been an ongoing thing and they've seen each other previously.

I took a quick skim of his history seeing what he said, which probably made my comment out to be more negative than intended and aimed more at his meta attitude about his stature than being relevant to the particular thread. I tried to filter it out but failed obviously, so sorry about that!

It's not my business, but when he posts in a public forum with that attitude he IS inviting criticism towards his views, just like my opinion drew your criticism. I sincerely think though that people need to stop focusing on what they can't change and will advocate that whenever someone does. I wanted to be encouraging in my post, but wrote it out WAY too negatively.

I've been in a shitty life situation myself that I had no control over, and it took a lot to stop beating myself up over it. But once I stopped and started looking positively on things and working on what I could, I definitely felt happier. I also found a lot more success in the things I tried when I wasn't worrying about things out of my control.

Noumenology,changemyview,1388651566.0,"Who is God? Better yet, what is god? 

In the beginning was the Word, or *logos*. The word is a symbol or a sign. It is understood by its denotative and connotative significance - what it represents, and what it evokes. The Zohar says 

&gt;Before He gave any shape to the world, before He produced any form, He was alone, without form and without resemblance to anything else. Who then can comprehend how He was before the Creation? Hence it is forbidden to lend Him any form or similitude, or even to call Him by His sacred name, or to indicate Him by a single letter or a single point... But after He created the form of the Heavenly Man, He used him as a chariot wherein to descend, and He wishes to be called after His form, which is the sacred name ""YHWH"".

The nameless being god was before creation is understood as ""Ein Sof."" This is god which is beyond and outside human understanding to where god is incomprehensible. God is omnipotent, yes? Then how is god limited to your conceptions of it? God is not a he, or a she. God embodies those connotations and yet god also is more than them. 

 Christians believe god is manifested in the flesh through Jesus, and also is understood as the father, and dwells in us as the Holy Spirit. The godhead is a mental device, a construction of language so that people can understand and experience god in a way that suits them. It's like a telephone receiver, but god at the other end is not on a telephone. God is the telephone. And something else. 

The bible is the way that people learn about god in Christianity. Another telephone receiver. Or, better example, it's as though god were the ocean and tried to pour itself into a cup for people to see and taste. God is not that mug. The water in that mug is part of god. But it is not all of god. Ministers teach the bible as the ""inspired"" word of god. Authors were inspired but *not infallible.* they are working in cultural contexts and with personal histories that make them pour inspirations into mugs of their own design. And those designs are full of some pretty gross ideas that have nothing to do with god - ""suffer not a woman to speak"" and so on. 

You can throw away the mug, you can hang up the phone, use what metaphor you like. But if those things don't suit you, why are you using them? ""if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.""

If you're going to reconcile your faith, you have two options: abandon it completely and find something else that satisfies your personal needs, or make a ""mug"" of your own, and don't forget to draw water more than once in your life. I was raised as a very conservative Christian, but I would be an atheist if I still believed in the literalism of the bible. Geology will quickly make an unbeliever out of anyone who thought the earth was any less than millions upon millions of years old. 

I sincerely hope you are able to find your answers without too much pain in your struggle. This may be your *noche oscura del alma*. In any case, best wishes. Feel free to pm me if you like. "

porpoiseoflife,worldbuilding,1388651581.0,"I'd say you could go with realistic-ish. If you put things in roughly the right places, then not many people would raise too much of an eyebrow. Just avoid extremely stupid mistakes, like putting a jungle in the middle of the tundra for example, and you'll be roughly fine. Look at worlds like Krynn or Eberron or even MIddle-Earth. They're flat-out improbable by the rules that we would use in this sub, yet detailed stories came out of them. The only thing you need to be sure of is that your world isn't so impossible that it breaks your reader's suspension of disbelief. So no putting a jungle on the edge of an ice sheet or anything silly like that.

Topics like tectonics and wind patterns and ocean currents and climate bands are all background information, when it comes down to it. It doesn't actually come up in the story unless you specifically put it there. Weather is a much more applicable topic for a novel, but in the end it won't be a major plot point. They're all there to give you, the author, a better idea as to how the planet as a whole works so that you don't have to think about it while you're writing. "

cbearski,OpiatesRecovery,1388651751.0,"Hey, what you're doing is a huge deal. You should know, It's going to feel scary when you wake up in the morning. Your body's gonna want to tell you that this was a mistake, that you need the perks, that you can quit another time, today is not the day. Don't give in. Get through the pain. It's worth it to push through cold turkey. It can be done, I promise. Don't let your body tell you otherwise. 

first off, delete the numbers of using friends/dealers out of your phone. It's crucial for the detoxing process, especially if you're doing it at home.

Take epson salt baths, as much as you can, or as much as you feel you need to. I remember my body experiencing great discomfort, and baths helped that a whole lot. They'll help your muscles loosen up, they're relaxing, all that good stuff. 

Try to keep yourself busy if you can. I tried going for walks, despite the cold. It was miserable making the effort, I didn't think my body could handle it. But it helps moving around just a little bit, not feeling as tense as you would just trying to ignore the pain and sit around all day. 

If your experience is like mine was, sleep is going to be very tough. You might have to get used to a zombie-like trance for a while, as the perks are probably a huge part of the reason you've been able to sleep for the last few months or years. If you find yourself awake at night, trying to sleep, try writing or drawing. I used to write till my hands cramped up. I'd write about my experiences w/d-ing, they're a good reminder of what I don't want to return to. 

And please, by all means, try and go to NA meetings! Even AA meetings if you prefer that. I know there's a huge stigma with the AA/NA culture, but they provide tremendous support, from people who've been through similar situations to you. They're worth checking out. I simply go to be able to relate to fellow addicts like myself. It's good to talk to people who can understand where you're coming from, and talk to them about how they managed to get sober, too. 

This is not going to be easy. But you're doing is a big, big, big deal and you can do it. You know what you need to do for yourself. You know what you deserve in life-- genuine happiness, success in business, good times with friends and family, etc. You *are* smart and witty, and you can really be all of that and more when you get sober and learn to love yourself and your life sober. 

Don't be too hard on yourself. You recognize that this isn't the life you want to continue to live, and that's the first step to getting better. Get over this hill of detoxing, take care of yourself, be patient. You won't get better overnight, but *you will be ok* nonetheless. 

I wish you the best through this process. Stick to it, and you will not be sorry. if you wish to talk to anyone, feel free to PM me. One of the first people I talked to when getting sober was on Reddit, on this subreddit, and he helped me tremendously. Don't be afraid to reach out. 

Sorry for the long post, I just feel I can relate to what you're going through now. Went through this process last year and am 9 months sober today, it can be done :) "

4. You will now be asked for an Ip address, The IP address is like a mail box for your xbox, And with a strict or closed nat it makes it hard for the mail man to deliver the mail and sometimes even fail to deliver it, you want to make this as simple as possible so you can get all of your mail!.

Now, so you don't conflict with other mailboxes you will want to create a unique one. IMPORTANT: Almost all IP adresses begin with *192.168.1.1* DO NOT CHANGE THAT! 

You will want to pick a unique last 3 digits! My recommendation: 192.168.1.150 the most commonly used ip addresses are 100-110 so anywhere outside of that will make it pretty secure.

Now, The subnet mask most commonly this will be 255.255.255.0

Along with the subnet mask you will need the gateway, Commonly this is 192.168.1.1 

*If these do not work go to your start bar on your computer&gt; go to run&gt; type in CMD&gt; type in ipconfig/all and you will find your subnet and gateway!

Now with your dns, set this as 192.168.1.1 This is the most common, DO NOT WORRY ABOUT SECONDARY DNS!

2nd: Now that you finished that, on to the computer portion, You will want to type in your address bar of any internet browser your ip dns which again is usually *192.168.1.1* You will be in the settings for you router, Congratulations!

Now that you are here you should search around for a port forwarding section, Once you find this you will want to follow these steps.

You will see Commonly a column for: service name, port range, local ip,local port, and protocol.
(do not worry about local port this is not important.)
You will need to forward 4 ports for your Xbox one!

Do it like this.

You will need to enter a service name for all but this is not important

you will need to open port

IMPORTANT: the local Ip you enter for each is your Xbox One's IP address

Port range: 3074 - protocol: both
Port range: 80 - Protocol: TCP
Port Range: 88 - protocol: udp
port range: 53 - Protocol: Both

Apply these settings.

3rd step Reset router. Go check your xbox ones network settings again. It should now be set as NAT TYPE: Open!

Congratulations!!! You opened your nat and you should now be able to play with all of your friends on xbox live!!!

We broke up due to long distance and miscommunication. We both held on to things that we thought were ""good dating techniques"" and in the end lost each other. What was hard was that it was the best relationship i've been in and mutually for him, so to mend the trust issues that sprung after was very difficult. 

We took several attempts at getting back together, but the first few didn't work out due to our trust issues and the fact that we've hurt each other immensely during the first breakup. So many mutual friends told us to stay away from each other, to move on. We both listened and thought it was the sound advice, but giving away something so special and once in a lifetime experience was way too painful.

But I'm glad neither he nor I gave up in the end. I've made some mistakes and so did he, but we ended up communicating where we went wrong. He made the whole-hearted effort into counselling our problems and now we have a better understanding of each other. The relationship is now better than it was before!

FountainsOfFluids,AskMen,1388652261.0,"I'm not so sure. I think the problem is a sore lack of education about how most people are attracted to each other. Why do certain people have a lot of success romantically, and others don't?

My point is this: if a person is living their life according to certain principles, they will be far more likely to attract a lover than someone who takes the easy route through life. Principles like placing emphasis on physical health and fitness, cultivating a healthy social circle, and deciding on a life path and setting goals that are in line with that path. I'm sure there are other fundamentals that are not coming to mind, but I hope you get the picture.

If a person is leading a good life by their own definition, with societal expectations as guidelines (with a certain amount of flexibility for non-conformists), then romantic opportunities tend to appear naturally.

If, however, a person is lazy, gluttonous, or perhaps overly obsessed with niche hobbies that separate them from social interaction, then clearly the opportunities for romance will be fewer, and overall life satisfaction will likely be low.

In this way, ""success with women"" is a fairly good correlate with happiness, even if it isn't exactly necessary to be happy."

Have you developed feelings for this woman? And does she have feelings for you?

mountainunicycler,funny,1388652694.0,"For one thing, being in CO doesn't make the fact that weed is illegal federally magically go away. Any company working on a federal contract or hoping for a contract has to know its employees can pass a drug test if necessary. Even if every single person up to the CEO was indifferent to weed, or even pro-weed, because it's illegal federally they can't gamble on it. Someday they'll be sitting in DC and people  will be asking questions and they have to know they can give the right answers and back them up. 

That reason alone is why your arguments about how bad different drugs or drunkenness are don't really matter. What matters is that the employee performs well and can pass all the tests on a state or federal level (depending on the size and type of company) that could be done. 

It's not about being logical, it's about following the rules you can so that you can break the ones you have to. I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying that you can argue logic all you want but if it doesn't change the reality of the political landscape that companies operate in, nothing else will change.

kinsey-3,australia,1388652847.0,"MDMA can have beneficial uses, just add Cocaine and Heroin can.  The thing is, that those benefits are outweighed by the significant damages it can do to your body. 

I have no moral issues with people taking drugs like MDMA, but I do recognise the health risks with taking it. I have tried it many times, and yes the experience it for the most part fun, while it lasts. The thing is, that for everything it gives, it takes away tenfold. The people I took it with regularly tested for purity/additives with testing kits and applied other harm minimizing strategies. Even with this in mind, thr side effects felt in the proceeding days, weeks &amp; years amongst people who have taken it is genuine. Ignoring the risk of heart rate &amp; dehydration issues whilst high, the drug destroys receptors in your brain over time that distribute serotonin.  This makes it more difficult to transmit feelings of happiness &amp; joy in your brain over repeated uses. Many users feel the need to keep increasing dosages to chase that ""first pill"" high again because of this. The side effects for long term mental health damage are exponentially increased if the person is quite young and their brain is still developing.

Even if you dismiss my first hand experiences and those of many others I have known to have taken MDMA over multiple uses, then at least consider why it is not used in a clinical setting. We took MDMA under the safest context, by testing it appropriately, not mixing it with alcohol or other substances, but still felt the side effects. "

But then I think the real definition of a 'fight' must be addressed, as to some, a push and a shove is a fight, but no real damage is done to either party (except maybe pride/ego), and *those* sort of physical confrontations did happen loads. However in all places that I worked people understood that getting in real fights (punches thrown, bones broken etc.) had real consequences (criminal records, jail time etc.) and so fights *very rarely* broke out. I'd say that this was likely the same case for most civilised places, and my observations were that it was only really the uncivilised, oafish or over-compensating humans who actually started real fights."

For me, love isn't something you just ""fall"" into. Love isn't a just a feeling, it's an action, it's something you do. When you say ""I love you"" it's something you're saying that you do, not just feel in that moment. Ever wondered why previous generations generally stayed married once they got married? And were married 40-50-60 years? They weren't in love when they first got together, they made the choice to be committed to a person based on what they brought to the table, such as being able to cook, clean, have children, steady job, etc. And they fell in love *later*.

&gt;It's one more thing that has to be carried (and we're talking about a soldier who can't carry as much her male counterparts) and it's a pretty major inconvenience when it comes time to change it. 

Nope. 5 seconds. In and out. Also:  super light and made of cotton. Ones without applicators take up as less room than a pink pet eraser.  For one medium to heavy period you would need about 15. BUT there are menstrual cups that are reusable. No waste. Except blood. Which is something a soldier should be able to handle.

&gt;Some soldiers are expected to be out in the field for weeks at a time (during wartime they might stay out for months), where there's not likely to be bathroom facilities of any kind. Do you really expect women to just drop trou in front of a bunch of males to change their pad/tampon? 

yes. If they are willing to die for their country I bet they are willing to change a tampon in front if dudes for their country. Also poop in front of dudes, which would take way longer. And smell funnier.

&gt;And do you really expect a group of soldiers, whose lives often depend on how quickly they move, to constantly stop for a tampon change for their various female soldiers?  

Do soldiers never stop? I'm sure that they need to eat, drink water, pee, poop, reload, sleep, scratch their assholes and masturbate whether thy were male or female. My guess? The men wouldn't even know. My guess? These considerations would be taken into account for each deployment.

Yes, men have greater strength, but you are forgetting that wars are not won on brute strength alone. They are also won by hearts and minds. Strategy. Quickness. Stealth. Marksmanship. Markswomanship (joke). speaking the language. Understanding culture. I'm not saying that women are better at these things, but I'm saying that there are parts of military duty where women can match men, even if there are parts where they can't. And if a person is wiling to fight and possibly die for their country and can do so, let them.

I was already planning on moving to that side of the world, so began the process before I actually met him. This meant getting my Australian citizenship. I was born Ukrainian - the Ukrainian passport does not allow me to take advantage of the Working Holiday visa program, which is what I originally came to Sweden with. Even before I was set on Sweden specifically, I did some research and saw that many countries participate in this program and it would allow me to see what longer-term life was like in whatever country I chose. I was also running a business and saving money like crazy at the time in preparation for a big move. By the end, I had enough savings to live in another country for about 6 months on my own. With the bill splitting, I had enough for about 12 months.

I never got comfortable though - it was tough, being in another country without a job and knowing that you're slowly eating through your savings. There are so many talented developers here, it's not like you can just show up and stumble into a job. Expenses like warmer winter clothes etc came up. I originally wanted to find work _before_ moving out of Australia, but I was still semi-entry-level in my chosen industry (game development) and it was highly unlikely that anybody would hire me from the other side of the world. I saw that I would have to move and _then_ find work. It was risky, but I got very lucky and found a job in a bit under 2 months of living here.

For about a year before the move I also shut myself away in my house and taught myself to code by making my own games. This contributed greatly to my portfolio and I know my employer looked at my development blog (it was mentioned during my interview). 

Good luck with your move! For me it's definitely been worth it. Save as much as you possibly can before your move. Moving with no job is fricking scary, that monetary safety net does help so much. "

I only remember one time he wrote something that seemed like he sincerely regretted what his actions and how he hurt people, rather than some lame forced acknowledgement that things were ~unpleasant~ to get people to back off of him; any statements that came before that one were frustrating, not remotely apologetic, and often just made things worse. [This was back in September shortly after PAX](http://penny-arcade.com/2013/09/04/some-clarification), and since then I didn't hear of him doing anything stupid and nasty.

 IMHO, if that September statement were just a PR move it would have been written better and probably not even posted by Mike himself. It reads to me as honest through its flaws, including/especially the fact that this is a guy who is clearly in a new place and doesn't really know how to apologize for something he's probably fairly recently started to grasp. 

With the announcement posted yesterday, a lot of people are still going to dismiss him and although I cannot blame them I do not agree that this is PR or another useless non-apology or whatever and that he's just going to turn around and do/say something inexcusably shitty again with no second thoughts. He just publicly acknowledged he grew up into a bully, and that he couldn't let himself be one anymore - that's a hell of a statement to make, especially since he's speaking as someone who grew up a victim of bullies and therefore hates them.

Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if he fucks up again in some way someday in the future, as everyone does, but I would expect him to handle things in a totally different - as in much, much better - manner. Time will tell if I'm right, and I really hope I'm not proven dead wrong."

Gobizku,wicked_edge,1388654222.0,"In general, I'm not impressed by many soaps.  They're harder to lather and more susceptible to hard water than creams.  Additionally there are a lot of excellent creams out there.

Of the ones I have tried, Barrister and Mann soaps stood out to me. They're a bit different to lather because they are thirsty soaps.  They will perform okay with normal amounts of water, but it gets really slick with a bit more than you'd normally expect, gives a great shave, and the scents usually open up a lot too.  In particular, the cheshire soap smells amazing and it moisturizes your skin to the point where an aftershave isn't even necessary.

Also I don't know if HTGAM synergy soaps are artisan, but they're excellent as well and certainly worth checking out.  Not many companies do pipe tobacco (cavendish) scent, so it really sticks out as something unique to me.

Doing this is a two-way win for you because 1) you're asserting a better sense of self worth for yourself because why pine after someone who isn't attracted to you?

RougeCrown,Android,1388655116.0,"From a design perspective, Touchwiz borrows quite heavily from iOS. They want to have an exuberant ""humanistic"" feel to their whole skin, which explains:

1. The leathery, skeomorphic Samsung app designs
2. The nature-inspired widget, showing grasses and stuffs
3. The big, squarish icons that look like they belong to iOS (stock SMS, stock dialer icons)

The problems with Touchwiz IMO are two fold. 

**First:** it clashes with Android's vision. Ever since Android 4.0, Android has opted for a more digital look for its application, iconography and typography design. If on one extreme, you have iOS that used to be extremely humanistic and skeomorphic, and the other extreme is windows phone 8.0 which is extremely ""digital"", Android falls nicely in between. Its icons are still 3D, but it's a flat, modern kind of 3D. it is still human, but a very digitally advanced version of it. Samsung's direction falls more in between Android and iOS, which really just clashes with everything else Android is trying to achieve in terms of looks. 

**Second:** even while Touchwiz has a vision for itself, it FAILS to do so. A lot of things are inconsistent, lazy, and down right hideous. For such a ""humanistic"" approach, having such a boring, outdated messaging app is jsut downright unforgiveable. Come on, fucking BLACK background? with YELLOW rim? and GLOSSY sms bubble? Holyshit! The best application that they designed is the Samsung Note app, but that's about it. Dialer is butt ugly, sms is ugly, pull down notification icons are downright HORRIBLE. In just some applications, you have already seen **3 fucking main accent colours** - blue, green and yellow. Your designers need to be fired and your vision needs to be more consistent if you want to make a statement for your device.

For now it's just a poor rip-off of iOS' older look. Yes I said it. 

TLDR: inconsistent vision and amateurish execution. "

Does the concept of sharing your thoughts unprompted make you uncomfortable? Or do you just think everybody says too many stupid things too often and you don't want to partake?

I'm a fundamentally quiet and slightly insecure man because I grew up like that, mostly observing and not participating. I have, however, managed to work through my issues and I can safely say that being quiet doesn't have to be a constant. Everyone has a **lot** of things to say, including you. You just need to figure out under what circumstances you will talk openly. Alcohol helps. It's also a lot harder in groups, I am also so much more sociable 1 on 1 and that is fine.

In essence, what I'm trying to say is figure out what situations make you feel open, comfortable and talkative, and then try tu put yourself in those contexts as often as possible. And try not to doubt yourself too much during this process."

Most of the users I knew who took low to medium quantities of tested MDMA on a semi-regular basis have later ended up with long periods of: anxiety disorders, major depression episodes, self harm, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.

NuttyFanboy,relationships,1388655393.0,"Okay, I'm going to write something that is probably going to come across  as harsh or even uncaring, and probably not the stuff that you want to hear.

*You're in no place to want a girlfriend*. 

Read that? Understood it?  
You're miserable right now. I get that - but I can guarantee you that you wouldn't find happiness in a relationship. If you should manage to con a girl into one, here's what's going to happen:

* You're going to be happy while around her.
* You're going to be unhappy while not (which is likely the majority of the time)
* You start to think and to believe that the only reason you could ever be happy is being around her. You start to try to spend more and more time with her.
* You begin to be so desperate for her attention that you turn into a grade A clinger, unable to function without her at your side, and requiring constant contact if you're not in physical proximity. 
* She breaks up with you over the clingyness and you crash and burn harder than the average dumped Joe because your only source of joy and entertainment is now gone, and all that's left is a black void that reinforces your notion of being a loser. Because, how couldn't you be a loser? After all she dumped you.

**So here's what needs to be done.**  
Drop any notion of dating or relationships in the short term. You're not there.  
Sit down and think. Hard. Long and thorough. Think, what is it about your life that makes you miserable (and don't say depression - that's circular reasoning). Identify a few problems that bother you. Then go about to fix them to the best of your abilities (and yes, I know it is easier said than done with depression and the corresponding lack of drive. Been there, done that.)

I suspect once you start tackling the problems - and see successes! - you'll start feeling a fair bit better about yourself.
Then you can consider dating again.

If you do it now, any relationship you enter is just a bandaid that covers up the larger issues and prevents you from getting better."

I mean, just look back on the history of psychology/psychiatry a bit... It's come a long way in a very short amount of time, but there's still so much left to do. There isn't enough education and awareness out there, so it leaves a lot of people pretty uneducated. There are all sorts of shitty attitudes about it all being in our heads, and it's like, yeah, that's the problem! Just because it's not something that can be seen as easily doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.

I also think that a lot of people are just kind of scared and confused and don't really know how to help, so they just deny its existence instead. 

I don't think that everyone who has shitty attitudes about mental illness is necessarily coming from a malicious place, but in the end...it really can be quite frustrating.

I do wish that the taboo and stigma would be lifted. It would really help a lot of people to openly seek help and support. "

MoustacheSanctuary,AskFeminists,1388655672.0,"as for being accused of being the abuser, it's not a studied field, but it's actually (at least partly) the work of feminism in some places.

back in the day when mandatory arrest laws for domestic violence were being pushed through the arrest rate for men rose but the arrest rate for women skyrocketed. The primary aggressor was defined as the person who started the violence, and that was just as often women.

that didn't sit well with a lot of feminists at the time and they came up with things like the Duluth Model that pretty much defines the man as the aggressor and the woman as the victim regardless of the circumstances. If a woman hits a man it's preemptive self defense almost by definition. It's a bit of a hyperbole but this quote from the Duluth Model's website:

&gt;Many women who do use violence against their male partners are being battered. Their violence is used primarily to respond to and resist the violence used against them. On the societal level, women’s violence against men has a trivial effect on men compared to the devastating effect of men’s violence against women.

turns into:

&gt;sir, she hit you so you're a monster and you're going to jail.

(also notice how they completely marginalize male victims)

While adding oxigen to a fire might be a bad idea, removing it would render it into nothing. So is oxigen very effective against fire or a really stupid idea?

I would just handwave it. Increasing the gravitiy against a speedster might be way more effective than increasing the gravitiy against a powerhouse, while using o2 based attacks against a fire user might lead to a crispy death...

Also: use a system that has rules for that kind of stuff. For Example Mutants and Masterminds. The gravitiy thing would a weakening effect or an affliction, depending on how you design it. While a Powerhouse might not get mouch from it, a speedster could be done for good by something like that.

So do I. I also value my personality over my car, yet I still drive my car because it's useful and fun.

&gt; vaginismus

Doctor/therapist.

&gt; Not going to have sex before marriage.

Great strategy: you'll marry a person without even knowing if you're sexually compatible. You'll buy before you try. This is one of the main causes for divorce and relationship failure.

Moreover, you're missing out on the fun, big time. Sex is healthy, fun and makes you live a longer, happier and fuller life, as demonstrated by scienific progress since the 20th century. There's nothing, absolutely nothing to gain from abstaining from having sex, and you're missing on one of the great things about life.

&gt; I'm just afraid that I'm going to be forever alone because no man is going to want to wait for me.

Exactly. Most guys don't want to make the two mistakes you're making: committing for life without even knowing you're sexually compatible, and missing out on the fun for absolutely no reason. You'll have to seek a choirboy or start enjoying your life and as an added benefit know a person before you marry him. Oh and the ultimate goal of life is not marriage BTW.

Answering your question, I wish people who want to stay virgin till marriage wore some sort of pin about it so whenever I'm looking for a hookup or a relationship, including a serious one, I can easily avoid them. I wouldn't touch you with a 10 metres pole because not having sex is no fun, and I can't be in a relationship, much less commit, to a person I don't even know if I'm going to like in bed. There's no way in hell all frozen over and full of rainbows that I'd have a relationship with you with that conviction, even if you're the smartest person in the world, are 50% hotter than all top models, write Linux kernel modules and run an animal shelter.

Like ~60% versus the Bucks (a horrid defensive team), ~43% versus the Bulls (great defensive team), ~51% vs the Pacers (a great performance against a great D, will give him that), ~45% vs the Spurs (great defensive team).

I'd argue it's *more* true of LBJ. The dude will score 27 on 8-12 shooting against the shitty teams of the NBA and play *much* more human against the good defensive teams (i.e. he'll have good or great performances but not these absurd/historical ones). Which makes sense, of course a good defense will stop a great offensive player. But I actually think Durant is *much* better at shredding any defense thrown at him  now than LBJ. (Check out what he did in the 2012 Finals against an excellent Miami defense. And yes he has Westbrook on his team... LBJ has some of the best 3 point shooters in the game as well as the best active 2-guard in the league.)

Bjorn_Bear,AskMen,1388656935.0,"The first thing I'd really like to say, I think people who point out another person is quiet are rude as all hell. It's the same as me turning around to someone and telling them they're loud. If someone is a quiet person, they don't want that brought to the attention of the group around them. That puts more pressure on them, which in the first place, is obviously the problem.

I'm the same as you, I'm really quiet. I'm not anti-social, I'll go to events if I want, but I don't talk to many people. I prefer to listen and chime in whenever I need to. You really shouldn't worry in the sense of a social aspect of being quiet. The good friends you have will know you, know that you're quiet and won't judge you on that. Anyone who thinks your quietness is an issue, well, they're not worth your time.

I will say though, it's annoying being quiet at times too. Because, in the dating scene, it does become more difficult sometimes. You just need to have a lot of patience in it. The right girl will eventually pop up and hell, it may even be someone right under your nose.

The story of how I met my girlfriend, whom I'm in a healthy relationship with of almost 3 years. I went to school with her for 2 years before I even said a single word to her. I had heard her talking before, I found her attractive, but it was like the second I started talking with her, I was all game. You might be quiet, but here's the best tip. Eye contact. Stare into their eyes like no tomorrow, you'll sell most of them on that. That's exactly what I did with her. And I just made it known, I was interested in her in a more romantic sense, I wanted more then just a friendship out of it. Admitantly, there were parts that took guts, plenty of things that involved me talking when I wasn't comfortable lol. 

As for the girl who cheated on you, I'm really sorry. It's never happened to me, I hope it never does. It must sting like a bitch and I respect you for being able to get through that. Especially how you pull some what of a bright side, in that she didn't seem like the love of your life.

So, are you screwed? No way, you're going to be great. Just have patience, stick to your own personality and don't let people change it for you. And, if it makes you feel better, even though two wrongs don't make a right, turn around to that girl who called you quiet and tell her she's loud :D."

Emjoyable,MensRights,1388657108.0,"&gt;it's not quite as easy in a squatting position. 

I personally think its easier squatting. Your vaginal canal is straighter and the trajectory is easier. That's the position the human body was designed to be in when accessing that part of the body. Women are actually supposed to give birth while squatting. 


&gt;You're also forgetting that a soldier wears a large amount of gear.  

True. But what about peeing and pooping?  This is a natural function that doesn't always run on a schedule. I'm not saying it's not a problem, but I think that the army has overcome other problems that were more complicated.

&gt;And bulky as hell.

Eh. OBs are super small. No applicator. applicators are the bulk. Plus if the army made tampons I would finally get the camouflage tampons I've always dreamed of.

&gt;Except you have to clean it, right? 

Not sure. Interesting to find out.

&gt;Tampon changes add considerably to the number of 'pit-stops' that would need to be taken.

 I disagree. These ""pit stops"" could be integrated into others.

&gt;How long can a tampon stay in? 

For me? Heavy day? With a tampon and a pad as backup? 4 hours. Light day? Up to 12 hours. Here's the thing, when women work out or are involved with heavy strenuous excersize (like what I would assume infantries do) our periods lighten and even stop altogether. I believe this is our body trying to keep us from having babies in extreme conditions. 

&gt;they don't always last as long as you need them to, do they? 

True, then you leak blood. That's why you have a pad or panty liner for back up. Ah, but now you are going to say ""more stuff means more weight!"" A months supply of this stuff is less than a pound, I guarantee you. 

&gt;start stripping away necessities to save weight and that soldier becomes a liability. 

I don't understand how women would take away necessities. i've seen loads of videos where soldiers have taken ipods, magazines, other nonessential shot with them. 

&gt;There are many, many roles in the military that women car excel in, infantry is not one of them.

This may be true. What I'm saying is there are possible answers to all of these questions you are posing. And I do think the questions you are posing should be addressed. 

We shouldn't throw people in untested. There should be tests and trials. Lets see what women can do.

Women, right now, are at the dawn of our capabilities. For thousands of years what was important for us was to get a husband that would support us and have children that would support the family. So, being pretty and seductive? Survival techniques. We were not allowed to support ourselves in a meaningful way. Yes - there are exceptions to this rule, but not many. We've had the vote for less than a century. There are places in the world where WE CAN'T DRIVE. So. Give us a chance. Let's see what we can do. 

Also, I encourage you to look up instances where women passed as men in the Civil War. I'll go find you some links. That was a long haul war. And they hid everything about their femininity from other soldiers so that they could stand up for what they believed in.

And thank you for taking time. Your questions made me think :)

I would love a female soldier AMA.

CalvinDehaze,AdviceAnimals,1388657312.0,"""White"" isn't a culture. ""White"" is a conglomerate of different European cultures that formed into the American culture, which we're all a part of, regardless of race. I'm sure if you started an organization for Dutch people, or Irish people, no one would bat an eye, because those are defined cultures.
  
Imagine if you lived in China. You would learn the language and the customs, but you'll never really be Chinese. You're going to school in Beijing, and you meet another American, then another, then you realize that there's a few Americans at your school. You're all assimilating into the Chinese way of life, but you're still Americans at heart. You form an organization so that all the Americans at your school can have a place to be with other Americans. To talk about your experience in China, how it contrasts to America, and to give each other support. You find that it's easier to relate to another American because they understand where you're from.
  
Now switch Chinese with American, and American with Mexican or Black, and you can see why those organizations are needed. Minorities never feel like they're a part of the larger society, because their cultural background is different than the majority. They can try, and they do, but even 3 or 4 generations in, they're still a cultural divide.
  
I've had this argument on Reddit a lot, and this is the only way that I can show a white person what it's like to be a minority. You don't see a need for those organizations because you're looking at the world through your eyes. You're in the majority. You don't have to adapt to another culture, or have to deal with the fact that you were raised one way, but your current culture is another way. The United States of America was built for you. Not for Latinos, or Asians, or even Black people. We've only been getting used to calling this land our cultural home for a couple of generations."

letsburn00,science,1388657466.0,"Getting a stream to a high temperature, keeping it there and then dropping it back to ambient actually doesn't need that much energy. Since you can have the outgoing stream run counter-current with the incoming stream in a heat exchanger. The reactor itself you can insulate very heavily.

If all that is needed is to get the algae mix to 350C then that wouldn't be difficult at all, as long as the process isn't especially endothermic. The [actual paper](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/259171819_Development_of_hydrothermal_liquefaction_and_upgrading_technologies_for_lipid-extracted_algae_conversion_to_liquid_fuels) on page 4 shows the need for Natural gas as a feedstock, mostly as a H2 source. This shows that the tail end of the process is similar to oil sands, which also needs natural gas to help  lighten the product.

In a modern cracking unit you can pretty easily run the following operation.

1 Heavy oil + H2 = 2 light oils.
The other way also works of course, and places with a lot of natural gas can make plenty of gasoline, but have excessive H2. Well designed refineries and industrial parks will balance the producers and consumers of these feedstocks. Sometimes in the form of Syngas.

Getting a supply of useful heat often isn't that hard too, they say the process creates solid waste, which is probably burnable. Given the algae isn't a fossil fuel, burning the waste is simply a way to make the process more efficient. Then send any ash to the algae farm after you grind and acid it to allow the nutrients to release.

In reality, most of this will be made obsolete if we ever develop batteries with the density approaching gasoline. Since if you can do that then it's more effective to just sent the algae/bamboo/whatever directly to the incinerator and generate electricity that way.

cloudynights,childfree,1388657716.0,"From what I can tell, it's a lot more that the parent didn't do anything to at least get him to stop talking about the OP.(The OP states that the kid was loudly talking about them.) The dad should've told him to leave her alone when the kid first started talking about the OP loudly and said something about his mar's age - because the OP probably showed signs of disinterest and being uncomfortable. 

I don't mind small waves and saying Hi, even more so if the kid is very polite about it. But when I'm obviously reading or preoccupied @ somewhere I can relax - like the library, or at starbucks..if a kid starts loudly talking about me or gets super close and tries to talk to me while I'm preoccupied..of course I'm going to be annoyed. Even in a public space, people have the right to not want to communicate with someone, even if it's a child.  I just because I'm annoyed doesn't mean I do not understand that children can be a bit..in your space - I do, but I also understand that parents should tell their children to leave the person alone if the person they're trying to interact with isn't interested. What would happen if the kid did that with someone with ill intent towards them, while the parent didn't pay attention?

Basically, this post captures what the comment in question was trying to say as well. 

You can't relentlessly self improve and expect girls to gravitate towards you. 

You can't *NOT* self improve and expect it either. 

There is a healthy balance. Set goals. Self improve, but ALSO MAKE TIME TO GO OUT AND SARGE. 

Practice is heavily emphasized in this sub. You have to go out and do things. Put it all into motion. Have fun. Gain experience.

Seddit's opinion, and my own, is that the commenter is correct. Improve yourself, THEN GO OUT AND ACTIVELY TRY TO DO SOME PU'ing. 

Come back, improve yourself a little more, and repeat.

Orelle,infj,1388658750.0,"Aah, this reminds me of the Incubus song, ""Make Yourself."" 

I've created myself through finding strong role models, unfilled needs and unresolved harms, big and small. When I find someone doing something particularly helpful or inspiring, I try to learn as much from them as I can. I also pay attention when something great or helpful could emerge from a situation, but doesn't — either because it is missing from the environment or not functioning properly. If I can help restore that absent resource, I will. 

Overall, that process of observing, learning and assisting makes me content. I thought I was an INTP for awhile because of this, but I'm not so much a problem-solver as I am a catalyst for problem-solv*ing*. I've embraced that, though I still strive to be a critically thinking do-it-yourselfer as much as I can in life. 

I can't stop doing because I find no pleasure in completing a goal if I'm not progressing toward a new one. There's nothing as depressing or deadening to me than that. Sometimes I burn out because of this cycle, but I remind myself that the times I become most nostalgic about are always the busiest. 

I have a painfully simple ambition: I'm trying to give more to the world than I take from it, trying to do more good for it than harm to it. At this rate, I'd be OK breaking even, as if I were never here. But not so much. I know the saying goes that people won't think this, but I may very well lay in my death bed wishing I'd worked more.

However, anarchists are against oppression, and thus would like to see an end to cis/heteronormativity as this is a social/cultural oppression.

Anarchists generally don't care what you identity yourself as, as long as you're happy with yourself and your identity, and anarchists believe that this should be people's general attitude.

Europeans might have been indirectly responsible, but the Hutus were *directly* responsible. I know you don't mean to absolve the Hutus of blame, but this kind of brutality and dehumanization is still an example of black people being able to be just as brutal as she thinks white people inherently are.

Senior year, we get the idea to start getting the crowd as excited for the games as the seniors are. So naturally, we start going to the football games shirtless with body paint on our chests that spells out our team. We sometimes even had an explanation point and the word ""GO"" because more people wanted to join.

We got the crowds very excited, and the team as well. We did more to hype the fans than the cheerleaders. in fact, the cheerleaders started waiting for us to start cheering so they could follow along in the later games.

One game it was a windy Friday night and we still went shirtless anyway. The temperature went down to thirty degrees Fahrenheit, and we were still being loud and reckless and giving the other team hell.

That year we won the state championship, the first time in our school's history. I like to think a part of that championship goes to the shirtless cheerleaders in the stands who motivated the team every step of the way."

Japan is also going through an extremely politically conservative phase right now which is riling up the nationalistic fervor. As to why it's directed at the Koreans and not, say, Americans or Aussies, it's hard to say but I'd guess the media probably has a lot to do with it as well as the general feeling that the things Japanese soldiers and scientists did during the war keep getting brought up.

All that being said, I as well as my Chinese and Korean friends living here in Japan haven't seen any of this personally, so I'm inclined to think of it as a combination of extremely vocal minorities and Japanese culture's generally slow-changing nature, since almost every Japanese person I've met has been quite lovely.

Barring all this, I've had some serious plantar issues (sagging feet, no arch whatsoever) in both feet, and I found that relieving the achilles tension during 'off-time' worked wonders *for me*.

CaspianX2,politics,1388661058.0,"&gt;  Obamacare did a lot to increase demand, but did nothing to increase supply.

Firstly, it bears mention that one part of the bill, five pages long (section 347), does work to decrease demand by discouraging readmissions. To quote the [Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation](http://www.innovations.cms.gov/initiatives/Partnership-for-Patients/CCTP/index.html?itemID=CMS1239313), ""Nearly one in five Medicare patients discharged from a hospital—approximately 2.6 million seniors—is readmitted within 30 days, at a cost of over $26 billion every year."" That's a good place to target for savings, sure, but if we discourage the practices that cause these readmissions, that's a lot of patients that need never return to the hospital, helping with the demand issue in a way that *doesn't* deny care to those who need it.

But what about supply?

&gt;It didn't offer any scholarships for medical education.

You are so very, very, very, very wrong. Are you ready for this?

Section 5201 alters the federal loan program for make student loans for medical students easier to get and easier to pay off, especially if the student in question actually works in the medical profession. This should make a career in the medical field more enticing.

Section 5202 increases loans for nursing medical students.

Section 5203 sets up a loan program for pediatric medical students.

Section 5204 sets up yet another loan program for medical students, giving low-cost loans on the condition that the student in question work in the medical field for at least 3 years.

Section 5205 broadens the type of medical professionals that can apply for a loan forgiveness program.

Section 5206 awards $60,000,000 in grants for medical scholarships.

Section 5208 awards $50,000,000 in grants for nurse-managed health clinics.

Section 5209 lifts the cap on the number of people that can be employed in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which enlists uniformed health professionals to respond to crises like Hurricane Katrina.

Section 5210 establishes the Regular Corps and the Ready Reserve Corps, which is similar in focus to the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps

Section 5301 awards grants to public or nonprofit hospitals and medical schools to develop training programs (with financial assistance) for family medicine. The first year of grants is $125,000,000, with successive years to be determined as needed.

Section 5302 puts $10,000,000 towards training programs for workers in nursing homes.

Section 5303 and 5304 put $30,000,000 towards training programs for dentists and other dental professionals.

Section 5305 puts $10,800,000 towards geriatric professional training programs, as well as an additional $10,000,000 in grants for educators and professionals.

Section 5306 awards $30,000,000 in grants to students in social and psychiatric health programs.

Section 5309 creates unspecified grants for nursing schools to increase the number of students.

Section 5311 extends and increases the nursing loan program, and creates a program to forgive nursing school loans on the condition that the student work in that field for at least 4 years.

Section 5313 awards grants to states, public health departments, and free clinics for community health workers and outreach health programs in areas with less health care.

Section 5313 establishes the United States Public Health Sciences Track, which is to train and award 850 degrees per year in various medical fields.

Section 5316 establishes a training program to train and employ nurses as primary care providers.

Section 5402 increases the limit of some educational loans and scholarships for medical professionals.

Section 5403 spends $625,000,000 on programs that bring minority and disadvantaged students into health professions, as well as an additional $25,000,000 (and ""such sums as may be necessary"") for increasing minority education and faculty.

Section 5501 increases Medicare payments to primary care doctors and surgeons by 10%.

Section 5503 changes the ""applicable resident limit"" for hospitals to allow doctors to be better distributed to hospitals they're needed at.

Section 5506 makes it so that when a hospital closes, other hospitals in the area can have their ""residency cap"" raised to employ the medical staff who worked at the closed hospital.

Section 5507 awards $425,000,000 in grants to states and schools to provide financial aid to low-income students, and fund training programs for home care aides.

Section 5508 awards $125,000,000 (plus ""sums as may be necessary"") in grants to teaching health centers for new primary care residency programs. It also awards $230,000,000 in grants to teaching health centers for new graduate medical residency training programs.

Section 5509 sets up a test program where 5 hospitals are reimbursed $200,000,000 for nurse training.

... basically, what we're looking at is hundreds of pages (roughly one-fifth of the bill) and a hefty chunk of money dedicated towards making medical school more financially feasible for medical students, encouraging medical schools to bring in more students, expanding medical training programs, encouraging medical students to remain within the medical profession after they graduate, and ensuring that hospitals are better able to accept those medical professionals when they need them.

**tl;dr**: To say Obamacare did *nothing* to increase supply is not only staggeringly wrong, it's ignoring a fifth of the actual bill."

Capetorial,AdviceAnimals,1388661476.0,"Morals and all those who follow them are broken and should be exterminated for being wasteful flesh. Only net gains make sense. Allow me to give you a scenario:

I donate 2 blankets, $5, a can of beans then work an hour at a soup kitchen. After that, I proceed to find the first homeless man I can find and deliver a leg sweep, followed by my mounting of him and delivering 2 quick, painful though not fatal blows to his chest and 2 to his face - leaving no injury that will last for more than a couple days, even with his decreased healing abilities. This is, being a scenario, is in full context. It's not like the volunteer work was court ordered or the homeless guy robbed me or some shit. No tricks.

Am I moral? Absolutely, my benefit to homeless kind was a net gain. But no, I'd be called cruel and hateful. My work wouldn't have justified it. What if I donated $3000, 50 blankets and 50 hours, every year in addition to beating the crap (again, same level of injuries - it's really just a lot of pain) out of 3 homeless dudes a day. Then I'm even more in the positive! But noooo, you see the negative! Morals make 0 sense, they're miscalculated as a rule and no one has any idea what the fuck Karma (in the moral and/or spiritual sense) is. Oh, but if you've never done anything for anyone and just scraped by being a 'friendly guy,' the most generous thing you gave out for free being a smile and one day you trip, fall, break an old man's hip and, of course, you pay his medical bills but did you also compensate him willingly for the suffering and lost time by your opinion? No? Then you're morally fucked if we count the points here. Of course, we are assuming you are financially able to do this.

In short, if you think morals means a damn thing, you're a fucking moron and you need to check your deeds.

My post wasn't about morals, it was about wasting time, everyone's. You'd be wasting his time by sending him to jail, wasting your time, wasting state resources and what do you gain? A chance to be discovered and sent to jail yourself? That's a shitty reward."

Death_Urthrese,summonerschool,1388661656.0,"i know this might be a bit late but i look for leblanc threads every now and then, thinking maybe i'll learn something i didn't know.  

anyway i read through all of the comments and i have to say that although i am a fan of your videos i of course have to disagree.  i think perhaps it might just be your wording though.  

you recommend the OP just not learn Leblanc if they want to win but he's looking for tips on how to get better with Leblanc and that's what playing this game is about, just getting better.  i agree that it is very hard to carry a game with Leblanc compared to another more common mid lane like gragas currently but i don't believe she's a bad champ at all and definitely not a weak pick.  it's true Leblanc has trouble in team fights but not if you know how to play her.  her motto is patience and it's because you need to know when to use her spells, you can't throw them out like every other ap mid.  she's also the only assassin in the game that can take even a tanky champion down in less than 2 seconds if done right.  it's just a matter of building her right and knowing who you can get.  

her win rate is low, the OP i'm sure knows this and it's because she is very difficult to play that's not to say Leblanc isn't worth learning.  in most of my games personally i'll end them around 30 minutes.  her harass is so strong and it's so easy for her to turret dive and get out that most people, especially low elo, will not be able to react to in time.  she's also great at putting out fires.  if a lane is losing she can easily go in and kill the person in the lead and get out in time.  on top of it her mobility makes it impossible for anyone to run and super easy for her to get away.  

all this being said, i've been playing Leblanc for a long time in order to learn to carry with her.  it is much easier to carry with picks like gragas but i can say that no one is stronger and faster at killing someone than Leblanc and i can't think of a champion more fun to play than her.

i'm curious though, as you're a diamond 1 player.  do people just play her for fun in that elo?  what about players like link and hotshotgg?  are exceptions made for those leblanc players?  "

Divorce is up, they're 'lonely', too busy to have a relationship etc. Women like to dress nicely, especially at family reunions.  Maybe the 'trend' is their because they seem identical, but how else it is to happen? The setting, location and even dialogue is pretty much template standard, it's just the details that change.

ElDiablo666,Shitstatistssay,1388662124.0,"I'm sorry that you think the world is composed of poeple catching fish by themselves on an island. It's not. Wealth is not individuals accumulating dollar bills outside of a society by themselves and money is absolutely not the representation of anything like that. Is that what you really think? Like, when you look at the world today and you see massive corporate conglomerations penetrating every aspect of life, controlling as much as they possibly can, depriving their employees of every cent they can, you see Joe on an island catching fish with a net?

I know you're not stupid. I'm assuming you were trying to say ""one can accumulate things on ones own and I have shown that here"" but that's not at all what I'm talking about. I'm talking about tyranny. Let me explain what I mean.

&gt;the poor of this year are better off than the poor of last century

This is the worst argument one can make for systems of terror and tyranny. There's a great Chomsky clip where he responds to someone who, like you, falsely believes that having it better than someone else in the past means a system of institutions is acceptable. Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5pJR45HNEM&amp;t=1h28m30s

It's worth considering that wealth accumulation is not only completely dependent on other people, it's wrong to do so because of that fact. Human beings deserve to be free, that's why I'm against the state. The problem is that we have much much bigger problems than the state right now and we're drowning and this subreddit is debating the lifeboat's merits.

Happy new year, cheers to you too."

From the view of man this untrue because we are conscious. We can choose the path. We have the ability to see the consequences of our actions and contemplate on them. Therefore, we can choose if we follow the law and live by it within the order of things, or we can choose to go against the law, and provoke nature to eliminate us.

Nature must also create errors, it is part of it's plan. Man can decide if he is an error or not. Regardless, nature will go on with or without him."

Yes, they could definitely dress better, yes they needed to improve their grooming a little, but by far what most needed fixing was their confidence, self esteem, and ideas towards women. That, in my opinion, is much easier to fix than a glaring physical issue. "

ncc1776,orlando,1388664455.0,"&gt; That sounds like a terrible idea. Most transit systems require higher population density in order to work well.

Which is why less capacity would coerce people live closer to work, and since commerce typically groups together, people will group together, and voila, population density!

&gt; At best what can be done is to expand areas around sunrail stations to have much higher residential/business densities than normal. The problem with that is that those areas will become more expensive to live in and the cost of living in Orlando will rise.

I can see transit oriented design (TOD) working extremely well in this area, if people allow it. Yes, those areas typically have an increased cost of living, but normally the benefits outweigh that negative. Miami has been focusing somewhat on this and despite the higher cost of living, they're still seemingly attracting people to live near where the transit is. "

mundabit,TwoXChromosomes,1388664472.0,"The type of foreplay can be every important, female arousal is more than just wanting it, Just like a man has to be erect, the woman also has to be physically prepared.

This may require dialation, the act of using your fingers or sex toys to work up from something that easily, comfortably and pleasurably fits in her vagina and moving on untill you can fit your penis. The easiest way is to just start with fingering, if she is very tight you may need to start with your pinky finger. Most people stop foreplay after 2 fingers have been comfortably inserted, but if you are very thick you may need to try three or four.

Relaxation is also very, very important, the pelvic floor muscles surround the vaginal canal and any tension will make penetration impossible. Its important to be in an environment you feel safe in and be in the right mood. Massage, a warm bath, meditation can all help, but so can warming lubricants or vibration. 

One trick to forcing the pelvic floor to relax is to first use the bathroom to reduce stress, but then, when you are trying to penetrate her, she needs to let her muscles go as if she was going to have a pee. What often happens in women is that the nerve signals of arousal and the nerve signals of needing to pee get crossed, its very common, and a lot of women might know what I mean when I say ""i am I horny? or do I need to pee?"" the reason is because the clitoral nerves detect both sensations. If you are aroused, but part of your brain thinks it needs to pee, you may involuntarily clench your muscles (because you don;t want to pee during sex). So peeing before sex allows you to shut that part of the brain off consciously by saying 'I *just* went, I don;t need to pee, let go""

There are some medical conditions that can prevent penetration such as vaginismus or pelvic floor dysfunction, If you and your girlfriend are repeatedly having trouble achieving penetration she might want to look into these conditions and chat to her doctor."
