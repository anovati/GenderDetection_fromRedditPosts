It wasn't just imagined, we had the whole conversation and everything, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and that was that.  About a month later it was right before Christmas and *POOF*, he disappeared.  I called once and left a message, texted once, never heard from him.  A few weeks later he sent me this lame email about how he realized he wasn't ready to be in a relationship but that he was going on dates with other people and didn't have nearly the connection that he had with me, blah blah blah.

A guy friend told me that some guys do this because they feel like it's nicer than breaking up with you, because they don't want to be the ""bad guy"" who hurts your feelings.  Interesting."

avantvernacular,FeMRADebates,1390575676.0,"Excellent post, very informative. 

I had a few more curiosities about comparisons of French legal discriminations and that of the US, where I live. (They seem disappointingly similar, but ""the devil is in the details"" as they sometimes say in the states)

But first a disclaimer. I know virtually nothing about French law, so forgive my ignorance. (The only things remotely close to any experience with it is that I almost got arrested in New Orleans once, and one time I got fined €50 Euros on the subway in Paris.)

You made the point about you wanting decrease incarceration personally for men, in contrast to most MRAs wanting to increase penalties for women.  Personally I feel we need to meet somewhere in the middle. 
I generally do not like projecting opinions onto others suspect the reason for the ""typical MRA position"" is due to the frequency occurrence of appallingly low sentences for for heinous crimes when committed by women.  I have a few examples in my comment about sentencing discrimination in an earlier thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/1vow7t/mens_monday_what_should_be_done_to_fix_mens_issues/ceui6gz). Does the French legal system have a similar trend, or is this unique to America? If not, should  such a trend for extremely low punishment emerge in French courts, would it alter your opinion? 

Second question is about a condition of judges and corruption. In the states, we (sadly in my opinion) sometimes have scenarios where rather than relying on state run prisons, the state hires out contractors who run private prisons for profit. Private prisons ate usually paid by prisoner, so more people in prison means more profit. 

On more than one occasion, judges have been busted for taking bribes (or sometimes ""campaign donations"") from private prison companies. (See examples:  [""kids for cash scandal""](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/06/private-prisons-oklahoma_n_4548883.html) My question for you is: does France also use private prisons like the US? If so, are there similar corruption issues? If not, are there other corruption issues that affect incarceration discrimination? 

P. S.  We appreciate the help back in 1776, also the statute of liberty looks great and is a huge hit, so thanks for that. Sorry about the NSA spying thing, nobody here is happy about it either.

Thok was only about 15 yards from the group, so I drop into kitty form, hit dash and .... I am running against the wall, directly behind the stack of ranged and healers.

For the rest of the raid night, my GM was yelling my character's name. Any time anything changed in the fight, all he yelled was my name.

codayus,sex,1390575987.0,"&gt; So, my girlfriend recently decided to look up cast-a-willy on Google and now she legitimately wants to get a mould of my dick to use as a vibrating dildo.

That's really normal.  Tons of girlfriend's do this, or would at least be interested in it.  She's 19, she's an adult, no doubt she has a healthy sex drive.  Of course she wants to get of off, and a dildo shaped like your boyfriend's penis is kind of romantic.

&gt; We've never had sex and she's a virgin. We've been together for over two years now and she wants to wait until marriage.
Basically she wants to try it out before we get hitched. 

Now *THIS* is really fucking weird.  You might want to explain this.  Why aren't you having sex?  Is she religious?  Medical reasons?  Because that doesn't really seem very healthy to me.  You've been together for **TWO YEARS**!

(Also, I have this weird idea your girlfriend might want the dildo not because hey, she's 19 and vibrators are awesome, but out of some weird idea that she can tell if you will be sexually compatible from this.  Someone needs to disabuse her of that notion quick if so, because that's not how it works.  Sexual compatibility is a huge, *HUGE* thing, but it's not talking about whether the penis fits in the vagina.  On the other hand, maybe she just really want to feel you inside her, even by proxy, in which case it's kind of cute, but uh, why not just have sex then?)"

Geohump,atheism,1390576203.0,"No, all the posed argument demonstrates is the absurdity of paradoxes. Sorry.

FYI - My comments were not directed to defend the idea of God, simply to say that the paradox approach to debating the issue is not a good one. As i said before, there are better logical attacks available, and they should be used.  The problem of theodicy for example. 

Your points in your response start to do a little better but in the end they are relying on paradox as well so they fail also.   Anyone can generate a paradox. The only thing a paradox can prove is that some part of the logic of the paradox is bad or false.   Please read up on Zeno's paradoxes.  His most famous one is where he proves that when an arrow is fired at a man who is moving directly in line with the arrow's flight, but away from the archer, will never be hit by the arrow. 

Your claim is that God not being able to kill itself means, that the claimed self is not omnipotent.  But that means that you have to assume that God is alive in the some organic sense. And that claim is not known to be true (or false).  If it turns out that God is the Universe, then God is not a Creature, but a pattern, or is simply existence itself. And so can never be defeated or killed. 

Paradoxes are fun, and can be useful, but most of the time they are just wordplay.  Examples: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes"

Entropy is good for saying ""there is no way even in theory that they could do this any faster than this"". But there is still the practicality of knowing the strategy beforehand for the guesses.

It's a case where the proportion of couples in which the baby's father is uncircumcised who opt to circumcise their sons for non-medical reasons is underwhelming because the cost to benefits ratio of circumcision is high.    
    
Men and women who have a strong opinion for circumcision without religious reasoning tend to follow the logic that it's 'cleaner' and I would argue that this is a culturally influenced view that is more common in cultures with a stronger religious influence where the practice is already common.

SpiralSoul,progrockmusic,1390576464.0,"Oh gee, I have a really broad music taste. Everything from [Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM) to [:wumpscut:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH8kWk-hy3c).

I listen to a lot of classic rock like Queen and Zep and a lot of classic metal like Iron Maiden and Metallica. I'd say that Queen is probably my favorite non-prog band.

I used to listen to a *lot* of power metal, like Blind Guardian, Iced Earth, Nightwish, Rhapsody of Fire... I've gone off that quite a bit in the past couple years, but it's still there when I feel like it.

I'm slightly into black metal, industrial (saw some of that in the OP, nice!), even some hardcore punk, but I'm not exactly a connoisseur of any of those. I also have several soundtracks of musicals and films; my favorites are Jesus Christ Superstar and Les Mis.

Then there's a bunch of alternative, alt metal, and just miscellaneous bands. Linkin Park, Disturbed, Slipknot, Avenged Sevenfold, Queens of the Stone Age, A Perfect Circle, Death Cab For Cutie, the Protomen, the Megas, and Rage Against the Machine are all in my library.

Anyone into comedy music at all should check out [Tim Minchin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVN_0qvuhhw), he's the best."

No woman should be afraid to ask for oral sex (neither should a man).  Oral sex, for most people (not all) is a healthy and necessary part of their sexuality.  Sometimes all I want to do is eat pussy.  I want to give her (as you stated) the intimate act of sexual pleasure without her worrying about needing to have actual sex.  You'd be surprised as how some women just want to cum, just like men want a blowjob and cum.  We don't always want to go through the motions of sex - we just want the end result.  Knowing that, I give this to women when I feel the need is certainly there.  A hard day of work, traffic was bad, issues with friends/family - and many times just because!  There doesn't have to be anything wrong.  I get down there, eat her, then we kick back and enjoy whatever we were gonna do. 

So I hurt for you that some guys have not been so nice to you.  Honestly, they were douchebags for that.  Don't take their mean statements to mean other men think and behave like that.  We (all) don't.  You *will* find a man that truly enjoys eating your pussy and you will LOVE it!

Geohump,atheism,1390576762.0,"&gt; It's pretty difficult to make a ""serious objection"" to the 'concept' of god, when such a concept is so poorly described by people who claim they understand it.

This is an excellent point. And its one of the chief problems of all religions.  If something is never defined, it can't be pinned down and found to be defective.  FYI - I'm not defending the idea of the existence of God in here, just pointing out that OP's argument is not a good one. There are better one's available that should be used. 
&gt; 
&gt; It seems the OP's argument is a worthy counter-argument to people who define their god/s as omnipotent, omniscient, and ""immortal"".

No, because it assumes certain things about the nature of life.  If it turns out that God is the Universe, then the kind of life that God has is not the kind of life (organic life, for example) that can be ended. 

Please read what I said above about paradoxes and Zeno's paradoxes as examples.  (actually it may be below :-) )

&gt; 
&gt; If you define your own god/s differently than the OP's opponents have done, no small wonder you disagree.
&gt; 
&gt; I respect that, but if I am correct, please provide a definition of your own god/s, and perhaps the conversation can continue.

Thanks, but I'm not here to debate.  I will point out problems in arguments that I see, or will try to learn more about ones i don't understand, but the simple flair label ""theist"" doesn't mean I'm hear to defend anyone's idea of ""God"",
especially the God's proposed by most human religions. They are largely ridiculous.

I don't consider Sydney my hometown, I've lived here so long, but it doesn't have the feel of somewhere I grew up and have a strong attachment too. 
India meant millions of friends and relatives always around your house, but living there was a mess in many ways and I am so thankful I didn't have to go to high school there. Sydney has been great (after the initial period) and I know the city damn well, but being immigrants mean that growing up was very lonely in comparison to before.

No. Using *only* solar power is unrealistic.

BullsLawDan,videos,1390576949.0,"&gt;I forgot to ask this, but why is questioning the ""official story"" insane?

Well, calling it the ""official story"" is a bit of a misnomer.  It's a tactic used by conspiracy theorists to play off of the anti-government sentiments of Americans.  Americans are generally mistrusting of government and saying something is an ""official [government] story"" immediately makes people cynical.  The reality is that there are many organizations and people, both government and non-government, who have studied what happened, and have come to the same conclusion.

And it's insane to ""question"" it, once a person has reviewed the available research, because there is a gigantic mountain of evidence confirming that generally accepted account.

&gt;Does it seem truly impossible that something catastrophic like this may not have been perpetrated by the people we were told it was? Is it totally wacky to think that an attack on American soil could have been planned and acted out by American sources?

Well, this is irrelevant.  That fact is that **this** attack on American soil was committed by 19 (or 20) terrorists of middle-eastern origins, without any input or cooperation from the ""government"".

A comparable example: Let's say Jack White decides to change his sound, and re-tune his guitars, and use different effects pedals, so he can sound exactly like U2.  He comes out with an album of songs that sound that way.  Now, before you look up the artist on the internet or whatever, is it ""insane"" to say it sounds like U2?  No.  However, once you look it up, and see the news articles about this new Jack White album, and how U2 says they like it and are appreciative of his new sound, and he wins Grammys for it, etc., it is ""wacky"" to think that U2 were the real artists behind that album.  The fact that it sounds like U2 is, at the end of the day, irrelevant.  It's only what **actually** happened that matters.

&gt;Especially after we have documented proof that said government had sketched up plans to do so in the past?

I gather you're talking about Operation Northwoods.  Here's why that's irrelevant to 9/11: The people who designed that operation discarded it, and anyone who was in a position of leadership at that time (the early 1960's) was retired if not dead by 2001.  So you can say that ""said government"" made those plans, but what you're not realizing is that it's not ""said government,"" it's an entirely different government a half century later.  A ""government"" is nothing but the people working in it, and ALL of the people in question were long since gone.

&gt;Just wondering what part of being skeptical was iinsane.

""Being skeptical"" is not a problem.  I was skeptical myself, ten years ago.  However, once a person reviews all of the data surrounding 9/11 (and we've had plenty of time to do so), it is only mental illness that would allow them to *remain* skeptical regarding the generally accepted account of events."

I disagree with that interpretation of Christian Hoff Sommers. And I'm not sure why you think that bringing up boys issues is an attempt to invalidate girls issues.

Boys and men are doing worse overall in education in comparison to girls in terms of school grades, graduation and college degrees. (If you would like me to PM you with a bunch of articles about the education gap stats, I'm more than happy to).

She was focusing on education in the west, where boys are doing worse than girls and the gap is getting bigger. I'm sure you agree that education is an extremely important subject in regards to social issues.

IME of talking to feminists, the majority of them are unaware of the education gap, and when I bring it up figuratively shrug their shoulders. I doubt they would have that attitude if girls and women were doing worse than boys.

have a single conversation with my mother without getting into a fight (but I can get along with the most belligerent, stubborn, untrusting, or all around difficult patients, and have them calm and cooperative and agreeing with me within 10 minutes)
get through the movie titanic without bawling my eyes out (but I can watch a person die literally right in front of me and pronounce them dead without losing my composure, even kids).
cook (but I was great at my old microbiology lab job and I'm good with a scalpel in my hand)
sew (but I am great at suturing skin)
sit through an hour long lecture or class (but can easily stand through a 12 hour surgery without breaks or changing position)
touch dirty dishes, garbage, the toilet, or my own asshole (but have no problem problem going elbows deep in a person's abdomen and getting covered in their blood and pus and shit)
can't manage my own life (get overwhelmed with simple things like housework, remembering to take my meds, online banking, and email), but have no trouble being responsible for an entire ward of very sick patients on my own with little to no backup.
don't have the patience to read a book for pleasure (but I can sit down and memorize a 700 page textbook in four days and three nights without sleeping or taking study breaks)

tetrisattack,changemyview,1390577053.0,"I'm no expert, but I have to think that most people who search for ""boobs"" are actually looking for boobs.  That means that Google now shows the *least* relevant results for a really popular search term. 

That's the scary part here.  Google didn't like something, so they made it harder to find.  I'm sure that many porn sites went out of business because of this.  And who's to say that Google won't do the same to competitors, anti-Google websites, or anything else they don't like?

It looks like you have a stubborn bone that needs some fuckin adjustment, and to learn to trust your girl, despite having bad friends. She is her own person and will not necessarily be who her friends are, and she may decide to change friends on her own when maturity comes round. If it does. You owe her an apology and some research on your behalf about healthy relationships, communication, and trust. You need to share what you learn with her and decide together if you two can commit to a plan, a list of things to do, to heal your relationship.

In the beginning, you have very basic equilment and are very vunerable, but as things go on, you research things and can salvage alien tech to upgrade your own gear.  If you like games that can be really tough if youre inept but fair if you think about what youre doing and enjoy strategy games and science fiction, i would definitely recommend it at this price.

The second to last call they told me to call back when the account was unbanned to get credited.

At that point I sorta lost my shit on the poor CS person before I had them escalate the call so I could yell at their supervisor. 

Sure enough I get that guy on the phone and he was a total dick about it from the get go. He was a knowitall who proceeded to try and explain to me how I wasn't owed any extra credit for their mistake, because ""You could still create a new account and play your games, so you didn't really lose anything"" I pointed out to him that it was not the case with my Vita at all, and that I was not able to access any of my digital games, or my PS+ that I had paid for.  I also reminded him that I was promised full restitution of what I lost and that it was notated on the account. 

He chose instead not to honor the notes and said he didn't believe I was due any more credits and if I felt differently I could email the company and they will, ""look into it"" 

He might as well have said, ""fuck off and go away.""

I mean, we're still talking about something from a memoir and not a mandate. This article takes a quote from a book. We don't know the context at all. I'm certainly not hunting down his book to see how and why the topic came up. I can see how this principle would upset people and that's completely justified because I don't like it either. I still think it's ridiculous that so many people take words he said, not knowing the context, and throw judgement and hate at him. Seriously, everyone is so quick to jump on the wagon and say he's a sexist pig. What is these quotes were taken from his discussion of his personal struggles with the principle? We have no context to suggest otherwise because the author has only given his or her views. But it's so much easier to just be angry and tell me I'm wrong for trying to understand the other side and have a little faith in someone until I'm absolutely sure of his intentions. It's really disappointing to me actually, to see this much negativity here because the thinking is black and white. He said X so he must be totally against women and equality. If the roles were reversed, we would be pissed as hell if someone did this to one of us. It's like the abortion issue. If someone took a quote from a woman saying the government should allow a woman to choose what happens to her body, she's forcing the government to condone killing babies. It's an absolutely false statement and it would make our blood boil, but we've just done it to someone else. He made a statement about Christian marriages and the wife's role and we've extrapolated to all women. How is that open minded? How does that promote any hope of a dialogue to work through the social issues or society is plagued with. We hit the ""he's a sexist demon button"" and the conversation ends. 

One last thing. Throughout this entire discussion I've had with multiple people, I've stated that I don't agree with the principle. I've stated that disagreement is definitely warranted, but unbridled rage toward this man is not, especially when the facts are being presented by such a biased article making sarcastic appeals to emotion. I can understand people misdirecting their anger for him toward me in their responses. What surprises me is how harsh people have been. In large part I agree with a lot of people here. This is one of the few things I really disagree on (the anger part) and I added my opinion to the discussion. Not you specifically, but I've had some really condescending replies from several people.

I keep track on a day-to-day basis. Since I bring only a few guns to the range at a time, and I have a practice routine that I follow almost exclusively, it's relatively easy to keep track.

Yesterday, for example, I shot 30 rounds through my TOZ-35 freepistol, 60 rounds through my Ruger Mk.II, 60 rounds through my Hämmerli SP20 (in .22), and 30 rounds through my S&amp;W Model 41.

It also helps me keep track of when I've visited the range...and has helped justify renewing the annual membership to my local range every year for the past seven years (if I visit the range ~twice a month, it's worth it over paying hourly; I've visited the range 1142 times in the past seven years according to my spreadsheet). And I know that I've put almost a quarter-million rounds downrange in the past eight years. Dang.

You can, when you're ready to talk to her, start off with asking if she's alright with you sharing something about a past relationship.

If you really do trust her then you should be able to trust her with your past.

dotyertees,movies,1390577264.0,"My understanding is that he's only rather recently adapted to going to conventions. I saw him at Celebration VI and he looked genuinely surprised that anybody wanted to see him.   He does get a *LOT* of flak for his role in that movie, and when one is young it's hard not to take a lot of that stuff personally.  People were vicious about his role-- but he's just a kid, a kid that gets the brunt of the blame as to those movies sucking.  However, as somebody pointed out, those movies really just sucked if you were a fan who had waited 20 years for the story. Kids loved it all.   I feel that he fulfilled his role as a child actor and then got the brunt of nerd rage directed at him(seriously, couldn't we aim all that at Jar Jar? I didn't mind mind the other Gungans, but Jar Jar).  

Think back to that unpopular kid that got picked on by the older kids at school.  Magnify that so that it's more like a billion people in that one kid's face.   I feel bad for Jake.  He's actually a nice kid, and overwhelmed by what the movies did for him.  He was probably hoping to get into something else after Star Wars, but now it's all that he's got. I wonder if he's even too anxious to try for another role after being blamed for killing Star Wars."

 it shouldnt be able to invade the privacy of its own citizens, *but that's what it's supposed to do in other countries*

ihasapancake,AskReddit,1390577302.0,"I would try to find ways to inject that money into my country's cultural life.

For instance, I've always wondered about what it would take for one person to be able to change some aspect of the cultural and/or artistic scene in his country/region. Like, what would happen to the status of poetry if some insanely rich person decides to buy up all the poetry in his city? Would that be enough to trigger some kind of response with publishers and governmental interest in cultural allowances? I sometimes imagine walking into a store that sells poetry, and buying the entire stock of some young author's work. I figure that the store would probably simply restock it at first, without giving it much notice. So then the next week or month I'd come back, and do it all over again. And again. And again. I'd personally see to it that this young person (whose work I admire, of course, not just any random name on a bookshelf) gets a decent amount of reprints on his first or second collection of poetry. I often wonder about what kind of direction our lives would head into if something extraordinarily positive is done to us behind the scenes. Like, what would happen to this young poet if I somehow manage to get his work published over and over and over again without telling anyone? His carreer could take off, and he could get book-offers left and right. Or ... he could turn out to be a one-hit-wonder and never write anything halway decent again. That's also possible. But still ... There are so many young artists that spend way too much time worrying about money and not getting kicked out of their rat-infested flats. If I could support them a bit more, I really think some of them could have it easier and have more time to work on their ideas. And I'm not even thinking about giving a bunch of artists tens of thousands of euro's so they'd never have to work again. I doubt that'd lead to much good. But just something. A few months back I bought a photograph made by a local young artist. I asked him how much he wanted for it, and he had no clue what to say. He was slightly embarrassed about getting anything in return for his work. So I gave him 70€, and it turns out it was the first thing he'd ever sold to someone. I don't want to pretend that I've somehow changed his life in a drastic manner, but I do like to think that buying his first work maybe gave him some encouragement to keep working on his art. Whether or not he evolves as an artist is really up to him, but some financial encouragement along the way probably helps to keep you motivated (and less hungry). So that's pretty much what I would do. Spend it on ideas, art and cultural initiatives, in the hope that someone uses the money to create opportunities for himself and others.  "

sharshenka,changemyview,1390577327.0,"This is an extremely interesting solution to a big problem, but I think there are some flaws in your implementation.

Having lawyers listed on a website without indicating their record isn't a free market solution. If you can't get more business by being good at your job, there isn't as much incentive to do your work well. Good lawyers would move away from trail law, and bad ones would ensure they get work by filling the specialization gaps. 

Having the state pay all lawyers and maintain the listing site opens the system up for corruption. ""Hello, best lawyer in the field, you should take this jaywalking case instead of defending this guy I hate. It would be a shame for your specializations to accidentally be deleted.""

The well connected will still find out who the best lawyers are through word of mouth, where the poor will be shooting in the dark.

You suugest changing transcripts to remove class, race and gender markers. This is extremely dangerous. If the accused answers a question, ""yes, I reckon"", does that become ""yes"", ""yes, I guess"", or ""that is my assumption""? A transcriber could accidentally or intentionally present a wildly different response to the jury.

If testimony is presented in anything other than the accused's own voice, the jury will build a mental image of them anyway. Think about when you read or listen to an audio book. Even if you aren't presented with a description of a character, you don't just imagine a blob. Jurors who feel like the defendant is guilty will form an unsympathetic image anyway. 

All of this goes out the window if part of the evidence is some sort of audio or video recording.

Maybe a better solution would be to maintain a pool of professional jurors. They could be trained to accurately read body language, educated in the law, and ranked by fellow jurors on impartiality, reasoning, and tested on logic and comprehension. Each jury could be assigned based on the demographics of the area where the accused lives, thereby ensuring that they are his/her peers.

Of course this has MASSIVEpotential for corruption too, but seems easier to manage than a transcript system."

* It is ineffective. The stamping wears off in a fraction of the life of the gun. Even the company that has the patent on the technology admits that it is not currently robust.
* It is easy to circumvent - you can replace the firing pin on a gun.
* It is easy to circumvent - you can damage the end of the firing pin to mar the stamping without causing the gun to fail (Dremel, sandpaper, etc).
* It is easy to circumvent - it is a lot easier to collect expended brass than it is to collect the fragments of bullets left with traditional ballistics testing.
* It adds considerably to the price of firearm manufacture.
* There are already existing ballistics tests that do the same thing just as well.
* The law as designed in California is built to funnel business to a particular company in California, making the law somewhat crooked.

Essentially, it's a giant waste of money that exists only so that some California politicians can feel good for themselves, cause problems for firearms manufactures by trying to press impossible or prohibitive requirements, and funnel money into friends pockets, with no real net benefit."

It's really not too much to ask of your romantic partner to not to try to have sex with you at any particular time. You are allowed to say ""no"" without being made to feel like they will just go find someone else. If they do, it's their inability to stay faithful. It's not a poor reflection on you.

I actually don't think that voluntary celibacy is too extreme. There are many people who do this, not just monastics, and they still have romantic partners, who often are people who do the same. The asexual community is an example of this (although asexuality often isn't ""voluntary"" like hetero- or homosexuality isn't ""voluntary"" either). 

If you feel that celibacy isn't right for you anymore, that's fine.

PirateCodingMonkey,askgaybros,1390577988.0,"are you agnostic? atheist? do you still believe there is a god, or great spirit, or whatever? or are you not sure what you believe or if you should believe?

i struggled for many, many years with being both a Christian and being gay. i prayed and begged for god to remove the temptation from me. finally i realized, being gay is not a sin. in fact, the verses that people use to bludgeon gays don't apply to Christians, anymore than the verses that talk about eating shellfish or wearing clothes made from two different fabrics. if you are living under grace, you are no longer bound by the law, and don't let anyone tell you that you are. if you try to live under the law, you are responsible for every, *every* part of the law. you can't pick and choose what you do and do not follow. if someone says to you, ""you are gay, therefore you are a sinner"" ask them when the last time they ate shrimp or clams. ask if they have a separate bathroom for the husband and wife, because when the woman is on her period (and for a week after) she is unclean and he is not to touch anything she touches. ask when was the last time that they sacrificed a burnt offering?

but let's say, for the sake of argument, that being gay is a sin. so is lying. so is gossip. so is taking god's name in vain. so are thousands of other little things that people do everyday. sin is sin. lying is no better and no worse than killing someone. it's all the same in god's eyes. it's only man who says that one sin is worse than another.

so ""all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god."" but if we live under grace, it is as if we have not sinned. so, one person lies. he has sinned. it doesn't change the fact that he is under grace. so you are attracted to other men (which is not a sin, but again for the sake of argument let's say it is) you still are under grace.

however, and here is the most important thing, none of this applies to anyone except the person who believes. so a preacher talks about ""being gay is sinful"" - if you are not a believer, who cares? if you don't believe in god, what does it matter? a muslim believes that eating pork is a sin - it doesn't mean that i, who am not muslim, have to give up bacon. it is a personal choice and not one dictated to anyone else.

so, yes, i am a believer, i am gay, and i enjoy having sex with the men that i have sex with. if i am sinning, i fall back on grace, just as i do if i fail in other areas of my life. however, i don't believe that my attraction to other men is a sin, based on what i know and believe. finally, what i say to anyone who tells me that i am sinning because of my sexuality, ""how can you see to remove the speck of dust from your brother's eye when you have a plank in your own eye. remove the plank from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's."" as soon as they get their house in order and stop sinning, then they can judge me. until then, i have nothing to answer to them for. i answer only to god."

869689698,worldnews,1390578105.0,"Whether or not it is an intended consequence, a mass banning of circumcision in Europe will result in an exodus of millions of Jews and Muslims from Europe, whose culture has been officially outlawed.  If this were to come to pass, I believe the event would be looked back on by historians as a modern ethnic cleansing, akin to the Spanish inquisition.  In Middle Ages Spain, Jews and Muslims, weren't banned from living in al-Andalus, they simply had to relinquish their traditions and beliefs and they could stay.  500 years ago, people with your mentality would have cheered as the heretics burned at the stake.  Why couldn't these barbarians simply accept the prevailing and infallible culture of the land?  Secularism while often good, is not infallible, it is not objective truth in the purest sense, it is also infused with the culture of native Europeans going all the way back to pagan times.  This dogmatic interpretation of secularism and its imposition through common law goes against the spirit of freedom.  The economics of human interaction would eventually eradicate the practice of circumcision over time, if it were truly so terrible.  To ban it outright only demonstrates weakness, intolerance and cowardice in my opinion."

tallavery,aspergers,1390578184.0,"My eldest lost interest in school about the middle of her junior year in HS. Quit going to classes, and instead roamed the woods and mountains around town. She started lying to me about where she was and who she was with. She wasn't doing anything ""bad"" ... just sort of opting out of any responsibility. I took her out of school and shipped her off to my folks' house where she took her GED and immediately enrolled in College. She earned an Associate's Degree, double major, with honors. She was accepted into a respected University and made the rowing team there. A little more than a year later, she lost interest in responsibilities again and dropped out. Of course, I was devastated.

She spent the next three years trotting around the globe with nothing more than her backpack. Got lost in Spain for a few months, but finally made it back stateside. Backpacked from Seattle to the Great Lakes, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Texas and called me from Indiana, saying she was ready to come home again.

During all of this time spent careening around the world, she was picking up amazing volumes of information about wild plants and medicine. She is now a walking, talking encyclopedia of natural healing. She becomes a treasured member of each community she lands in, and has friends and admirers all over the world. Of course, she is a bit confused by all the fawning, but finds great satisfaction in helping people become healthier using plants they can find growing wild right where they live.

She is working towards going back to school, finally ready to pursue more formal education. She's reached a point where she wants that piece of paper granting her legitimacy in her field. She came to this point on her own, and I'm certain that had I pressured her to do it earlier, things would not have turned out this well.

She will do just fine when I am gone, and it feels a little weird to know that. Her version of success is far different than what the conventional middle-class American expects. I'm more than ok with that."

ibbity,AskWomen,1390578219.0,"I wasn't taught to be sweet or submissive or ""nice"" like a lot of women are. I wasn't expected or trained to conform to feminine stereotypes or roles. My parents had the idea that it was more important to encourage us to be successful and well-rounded *people* than to put us in boxes because of our plumbing. My sister turned out pretty typically feminine anyway, but she doesn't have the too-nice/submissive issues either because she's naturally outspoken and aggressive, lol. My brothers have some typically masculine features in their personalities but they're also pretty cool with doing feminine things too. We all shared toys and chores and expectations as kids regardless of gender---ability was more the basis of who did what. 

I think it was a good way to raise kids. If I have any, I'm planning to take the same tack with them. I've had a lot of trouble over the years struggling to get along with other women and to fit myself into society because I don't fit into the ""woman"" box very neatly, but I don't consider that a flaw in myself or my upbringing so much as a flaw in the way most people expect that what's in your pants should determine what you're like and what your interests are. 

I don't seem to attract very much inappropriate attention from men, and I think that's at least partly due to my projecting a less girly/meek demeanor than a lot of women are taught to. I've never had a problem standing up to *anyone* who gave me trouble, though. I inherited my dad's formidable temper and chronic inability to take shit from anyone, and although I was taught self-control and the idea that taking my temper out on people is bad, I wasn't told ""that's not ladylike, you mustn't ever be angry."" I can't actually recall my parents EVER using the word ""ladylike,"" lol."
Handyland,science,1390578220.0,"&gt;Because what is considered attractive is not related to weight except at the extreme.

I don't think this is logically consistent.  If weight is a factor in attractiveness anywhere, then it is everywhere.  If we have someone who weighs 600 lbs (and assume this is 'at the extreme' and unattractive) and they lose 50 lbs, they're still very overweight, but likely more attractive on average.  Likewise for someone very underweight.  [It's a continuum.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_fallacy)  There is a sweet spot somewhere in the middle where they are statistically most attractive; a sweet spot heavily muddled by the fact that we're talking about 'weight' when we should be using the word 'fat'.  Muscle is also weight, and vastly changes the equation.  Two people can be the same weight but have very different body compositions, and therefore be not as attractive as one another.  Their proportions is the third (and the genetic) variable that also messes with finding a hard and fast sweet spot of weight.  My point, however, is that weight (and I really mean fat here) is definitely related to attractiveness.  And so is muscle weight, and so is the makeup of their frame.  And this is why I find the idea of being obsessed with ""weight"" as a general term so damn stupid.  If we are worried about our bodies, we should be thinking of weight in relation to both height and body fat percentage, and include a decent margin of error for individual discrepancies in frame.  It isn't hard to find examples of fitness before/after pictures where a girl actually gained ten or fifteen pounds and looks much better, despite the female obsession with losing weight.  We really need our PE classes to be teaching these things...

&gt;I'm arguing that certain traits actually are obviously more attractive but that the idealized weight that is the current decades long trend is not indicative of this anymore than Rubenesque-ness was biological. These are fads like pale but tan skin.

These trends you discuss are interesting, but I think you're making them out to seem a lot more arbitrary than they are.  The Rubenesque figure was a symbol of health because the owner of said figure was not starving, and could afford to eat well.  Likewise, the old pale skin ""fad"" meant they did not have to work outside.  Nowadays, tan skin means you can afford leisure time and can take tropical vacations.  Similarly, being fit indicates having the time (and motivation) to devote to working out, something less available to the impoverished.  They're too busy working two jobs.  We don't fetishize random traits, we find success and health attractive.  It's just that the indicators that display those things have changed since Rubens' time, and like you mention, change across cultures.  But it has always been the case that traits pointing to the potential for genetic success are what are most attractive."

codayus,AskMen,1390578371.0,"&gt; Why are you assuming men are the higher-paid member of the couple?

Did you even read my comment?  I'm not.  I actually specifically wrote my comment to be gender neutral.  Eg, ""If one person focuses on their job [...] If the lower paid partner works instead of staying home, and then you use their income to buy services on the market.""  I repeatedly used ""person"" or ""their"", not ""man"" or ""she"".

(Incidentally, my mother made more money than my father—and as she likes to point out, had more people reporting to her too—when she took off to have me.  Unfortunately, it doesn't matter which part of the couple is higher paid; only the woman is going to be pregnant.  Biology, yo.)

&gt; Your entire post is an argument for why one person should stay at home, not for why men might want a stay at home wife.

Holy shit, it's like you **READ MY COMMENT** or something.  How did you crack the code?  /s

&gt; Additionally, your ""practical answer,"" is only at all applicable if the lower-paid of the two makes so little money that services like daycare and eating out will take up a large chunk of their paycheck.

Exactly.  But as Elizabeth Warren as pointed out (seriously, she did a bunch of research, wrote some papers, and a pretty popular book), that's pretty much everyone.  Daycare is shockingly expensive for anyone who hasn't actually priced it, and that's just the start; the incremental expenses and opportunity costs of a second income are vast.  (And don't forget the high marginal tax rate on a second income since you're generally taxed as a couple.)

&gt; For example, your mom made a lot of money in IT and your dad, I assume, made even more money since he ended up being the breadwinner.

As noted, nope.

&gt; Couples like that lose a TON of money in earning potential if one person stays at home.

True.  But most couples do not include two highly paid VPs in IT for a major national bank, so I'm not sure thats generalizable.  And again, they made the tradeoff to have her stay home, because *even all that earning potential didn't make up for the costs* (at least once they had me), so I'm not quite sure how you think this argument works."

While exercising is obviously beneficial, people can, and usually do, lose weight in a coma because they're only fed what the body needs (an extreme, but valid example). Older women in comas are not out jogging, yet the weight comes off.

A thought exercise:

Would an older woman lose weight if she literally ate nothing? The answer is clearly yes, and if you argue this point you're just wasting everyone's time.

So if she's eating nothing and losing weight, that must mean there is some range between what she's currently eating and eating nothing where she would be losing weight. 

Obviously I'm not supporting anorexia for weight loss, I'm just using that to show that ""it's impossible to lose weight with diet alone"" is a silly and patently false mentality to have.

If you go to the range, pick up some spent casings lying around, and scatter them at your next crime, some other dude is going to get in trouble.  The imagined efficacy of this new law is going to unreasonable amount of burden on the framed individual to prove his innocence.  There will likely even be strong push to see him convicted in order to justify the efficacy law.

Just like how you can use a stolen gun to commit a crime, you can use a stolen firing pin, and forensics will continue to have to do their job as normal.  But, it is not as if they are going to abandon their methods for matching gun to bullet, anyways.  So what is even the point of this law?

Hell even a legal gun could be used to commit a crime now, just swap out the barrel, firing pin, extractor and magazine and you have a firearm that fired the casings in question, but have zero evidence to prove that the shots were fired from that particular weapon.  The new law will not change that.

All this law is designed to do is to create more red tape to dissuade individuals from owning firearms.  It is a completely unreasonable request at that.  Since this technology doesn't really even exist yet to produce these types of firearms, it is effectively a blanket gun ban in the state of California on the sale of new guns."

the biggest thing now is that stores are competing against Amazon and Barnes&amp;Noble. when i was doing it, the internet was just taking off, and so there wasn't as much competition online. if i were doing it today, i'd focus more on providing the things that online stores can't. hosting game-days, renting out games in the store, having a place where people can gather and feel comfortable. the game store i frequent now has a nice selection, but the gaming area is awful. it's dirty, the chairs and tables are terrible - some of them have broken when i sit on them and i'm not a big guy! if i weren't a gamer, i'm not sure i'd go there.

the big thing is, you will not get rich running a game store. you have to do it because you love it. and hopefully have another source of income because while the margin is ok, more people go into stores to see what the games look like and then buy them online for 10%-20% less."

I remember when I was younger, and had EXTREME lack of confidence (I couldn't look ANYONE in the eyes), that is when I would get creeped on the most.  Now that I am more confident, and I walk around with my head held high and I look people in the eyes, people don't bother me NEAR the rate that they use to.

If someone's getting close to a space victory, go siege their cities and send your fast-movers to pillage everything around their capital.

Skyrim - the newest, is also really good. I think it's better than morrowind, but many disagree. I am fully convinced that it's a better game to start with, as an introduction to the universe (with the way quests are organized and such - morrowind throws you in at the deep end, and then it's sink or swim, where skyrim points you towards your target: ""This is the person you're looking for! Talk to him!"".)

Oblivion is my least recommended. The leveling system is crazy, the ""oblivion gates"" quests become monotonous, the dungeons all look alike.

In the end it's a matter of personal preference, of course. But start with Skyrim."

      share

With the group for several years Logitech keyboard is Wisely When a reporter before buying the product, has recently been playing cards going to let me not go, so I decided to buy a nice new keyboard continues Zi, and my first lock is "" mechanical keyboard ""This option, which was originally looking for a wireless models, but it seems rare so give up! 
As for why it chose to use a mechanical keyboard? I think this should be the blame on himself early in the use of computers, it is like a semi-mechanical keyboard Acer, that sounds like a typewriter very attractive to me, although some people will find it noisy, so in the past been asked not to use the office , and this is to buy a home for personal use, so I finally went to the mall to pick up this Guanghua Ducky Zero DK2108 (blue axis) home.








Wisely not an expert master of the keyboard, while recognizing the two leaders in this area, but did not dare to disturb them they only have read the article, but after considering the budget Ducky decided to choose this brand. Although it is made ​​in China, but I feel pretty full, focusing on good texture and looks very durable; while its material is also great-layer PCB design with a metal plate, but inside is a Cherry MX mechanical axis and for laser engraving technology ABS keycaps. Enter the keyboard itself is a font designed with Windows Key Lock function, with the computer and keyboard shortcuts to adjust the volume, as well as USB interface output N-Key Rollover. Replace the accompanying WASD keycaps and pull the key that lets users replace the use of their own. This is the bottom Ducky Zero DK2108L, right and left sides of the back of the keyboard height adjustable support frame; USB interface is used, but do not have gold-plated connectors. Side of the keyboard design is also very good, slightly curved looks very solid feel. Printing for laser printing keycaps looks quite conspicuous and clearly heard with a long time will be black, but Wisely habit comfortably, so it should not dare to pose a problem. The keyboard itself has five illuminated keys, respectively, Caps Lock, Scroll Lock, Number Lock, F10, F12 keys, light where it is taken two-color molding the way, so the production itself is illuminated keycaps. Ducky Zero DK2108L the F10, F12, respectively lock the Windows key and switch the USB N-Key Rollover function, which must be done with the right trigger to use the Fn key. Unpacking currently use are pretty customary, although the use of the kind of cheap feeling keyboard, compared with the past are very different, obviously the keyboard back and I feel like the sound is back, in terms of materials and functional also very real, if it is the game players need to lock the Windows key feature, it is also very cheap choice.

Kanye's made huge contributions to the genre and outside of hardcore hip hop heads, a lot of people don't recognise it.

At the same time as this, he's been hugely influential and stayed successful both commercially and critically. It might seem blasphemous to some, but he reminds me of the Beatles in that respect.

On the other hand, Nas is generally seen as one of the GOAT rappers but i don't feel like he has the discography to back it up. I mean, he did Illmatic but what has he *really* done since. I know some people will point to It Was Written, Stillmatic or whatever and those might have their fans, but those releases weren't really that significant.

In addition, lava pours are staged at the SU Comstock Art Building for classes, student groups, and the public.

You should mount your HDDs right next to an intake if possible, so they meet cool fresh air.

[Current generation Intel CPUs are specced with a on-die temperature profile that ramps from 80° C at idle to 100° C at TDP.](http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/4th-gen-core-family-desktop-vol-1-datasheet.pdf#page=74) However, these CPUs will suck down quite a bit more than the TDP, particularly if your workload fits in cache and uses AVX2.  Due to that fact, and because I haven't yet figured out how to read the thermal margin, I conservatively assume that 80° is a safe bet at any load.  I use the stock cooler and keep it at the inaudible minimum speed (around 1040 RPM) until 70° C, and then ramp to full roar at 85°.

Your video card's BIOS should be able to take care of itself, but if it gets too loud you might consider putting in a side fan to give it cool air directly at its intake."

If these were a handful of people, then this would be understandable- but nobody ever stands up and says ""how dare you say that?"" In the US, if someone told his group of friends ""fuck these damn blacks"", he would be publicly crucified. In Israel, if somebody says ""fuck these damn arabs"", nobody would care, and if anyone stands up to him he'd get shit for it, like it's somehow cool to be racist. The term עבודה ערבית didn't emerge from ""non racism"". When was the last time you saw an arab on Israeli TV in a role other than ""token arab dude"" or ""bad guy?"" When was the last time you saw an arab in a commercial?

Here's what I think is the kicker- How many parents around you, completely secular jewish parents, do you think would allow their daughter to date or even marry an arab man?

Don't start rambling on how better we are from the arab world, on how first-world western we are, and then, when compared to other western countries, choose to suddenly compare yourself to the surrounding arab world instead of the nations with the standards that you supposedly hail so much.

I'm not TRYING to be crass here. But, like, I've had two pet rats before. They both got covered in rumors. I was probably 16 or so. I told my mombefore school one day ""something needs done with the rats. I don't need to know what it is"" and when I came home they were gone. I don't know what she did. I was kinda sad I had to get rid of them, but they were ""just rats"". I can somewhat understand maybe getting more attached to a cat or dog or something if you had a bond with it. About a year or so ago my mom bought a chihuahua puppy. When it was a few months old a cat scratched its eye, and my mom paid like $1000 to fix it, had to put drops in its eyes every 20 Min around the clock, missed work, etc. her reasoning was ""she's young, she still has a long life ahead"" but to me it was like you only had her 2 months, and you already have 3 dogs, is it really ""worth it?"" especially since she doesn't even train her dogs,let's them wander the woods and road, shit on the floor, scratch nd bite people. personally, I have children I have to take care of. I'm just thinking how much stuff for my kids I could have used that money for, if I was faced with a choice of vet bill like that. I dunno...that's just my feeling on it.

screenmagnet,AskReddit,1390579629.0,"Well we met up for casual sex. I went back to his apartment, we fucked, I stayed the night, and then I just didn't go home until 3 days later (it was over the holidays, so neither of us had to go to work). When he finally dropped me off at home, we had the 'what is this' convo during the car ride, and I stepped out of the car as his girlfriend.

Initially my intention was to keep him around as a fuck buddy while I dated other guys I met on serious dating sites. I was looking for a boyfriend, and I wanted to break my previous habit of jumping into relationships with the first decent man I found because of loneliness and horniness. The first night I met my now bf, I thought he was the hottest man I had ever seen, but I didn't think he was boyfriend material (he struck me as a not-too-bright douchebro player type). I wanted to have sex with him the second I laid eyes on him. And then he gave me the best oral I had ever had (first time a guy actually made me cum in bed without me having to touch myself) and he was even better looking naked than he was with clothes on (which I didn't think was possible). So I stayed the next day for more sex. But we had some actual conversations between all the fucking, and gradually I realized that what I had initially interpreted as dudebro dim wits and player aloofness was actually extreme shyness and introversion on his part.

I'll be honest, even by that third day when I agreed to a relationship, I mostly did it because he was ridiculously good looking, had his shit together, and treated me well. I still didn't think he was smart enough for me and I wasn't sold on the long term outlook. But he kept continually impressing me with his intelligence and by how well he treated me (he took me on a lavish vacation just six weeks in), and before I knew it I was in love and really saw a future with him. 

I had such low expectations of him when we first met, so the tiniest things he did would impress me a great deal (like seeing him read the financial news, or use a spreadsheet to track his investments, or use command prompt on his computer, or talk about the candidates in the local election...lol wow I really thought he was dumb as a box or rocks, didn't I?). I just completely misjudged him, and even now, four years later, I catch myself being surprised and impressed when he says something really intelligent or shows great maturity. I know that sounds completely awful, but I swear it is not just me. He has a habit of downplaying his smarts and talents and maturity, so EVERYONE in his life has always has low expectations of him. He even admits it himself. The happy go lucky dudebro persona he projects in public is almost his way of making sure he is universally liked while keeping people from getting too close.

Wow, this turned into a novel!"

Before my mum, brother and I moved out, the house would be left with the doors and windows literally wide open in summer with screens and computers visible through the window with no one in the house for hours at a time, as far as we know we never had a single issue.

Close friends of the family would know that the house was unlocked and were free to just walk in if they were in the area, they were encouraged to help themselves to a tea if we weren't in."

Dajbman22,AskMen,1390579689.0,"I chalk this whole thing up to the variability in human attraction from person to person. I personally have ""standards"" of what I find physically attractive and not, but I seem to have a very wide range of different facial and body types I actually find physically stimulating. This isn't about ""settling"" or ""looking past imperfections"". I honestly find a lot of attractive features in women who would normally just blend into a crowd. If you just are naturally more narrow in the features you find actively attractive, you're best off not ""settling"" and feeling an underlying disappointment in your romantic partner. Just make sure you are ok with going longer before finding a good match, and you are 100% sure your limited scope is purely intrinsic, not out of some kind of social pressure or insecurity (in which case you're shooting yourself in the foot). 

TL;DR: you like what you like, and guys who aren't as ""picky"" as you aren't necessarily settling from their perspectives either. "
sleepyj910,Parenting,1390579691.0,"Once I turned 30 I had this feeling that felt like this:

'you've done lots of interesting things in your 20s...but I feel like most things I could do now aren't that interesting to me nor do I have any desire to accomplish much else...except raising a child which of course would be ridiculously challenging and fun.'

And so it is.

So basically, I wanted kids because it's a part of life that was completely foreign to me, and I want to experience as many facets of life as possible while I can.  Mid-life crisis maybe, but at 30 I also felt 1000% more confident than I was at 23.  So the thought of children was no longer intimidating."
ANewMachine615,AskReddit,1390579696.0,"Right, but that *is* a fad diet. An actual diet is ""eat fewer calories while hitting these nutrient goals.""

Why is hotter better?  What is it about having a hotter partner that makes you happier?

I wanted a woman who felt like an equal who I could grow old with.  Someone who shared my values and humor and with whom I could build a life of joy with.

I see by 300 insanely hot women every day. I've only ever met a handful of women I could see myself spending the rest of my life with. Finding a good match in that respect always seemed much rarer than finding a hot girl.

I'm of the opinion that a petri dish with a fertilized egg is not a human, and that preventing that egg from developing is not murder.

But who's to say that this bunch of cells is not alive - or not conscious - or not human, and another is - and which is correct to allow abortions of and which isn't. For me, the root of the arguments comes down to what is alive, and what is human.

As for condo fees...what a clusterfuck those things are. The builders keep them low just to sell the units and then in a few years when the builders are done with the place and the resident-run condo board takes over, they realize the reserve fun is low and have to raise the fees (sometimes by 50%++) or levy a one-time special assesment of $Xxxx to top up the reserve fund

Umm, who would have thought a condo with a pool, gym, media room, concierge, roof top patio etc... would cost so much to maintain

A condo, unless you are old* and/or rich is such a bad way to get into the housing market.

This kid could either go to a foreign country whose language he doesn't know or stick around in a very good environment being mentored by the player he looks up to (fellow local guy Matt Besler, he's said as such in interviews). Maybe his mom didn't want him to leave home or maybe he doesn't want to himself. Luis Gil turned down Arsenal at the same age to stay closer to home. We can't assume.

Wuffles70,fatpeoplestories,1390580117.0,"Hoooo boy, that's a big can of worms... Before I explain any of this, I want to make it very clear - this is a mental disorder. I *know* it was nuts and have devoted a lot of time to wearing these particular neuroses down because I didn't want to live like that forever. 

People with selective eating have really strong psychological blocks that prevent them from eating a lot of different foods. ""Safe"" foods, for someone with selective eating, are the foods which they deem OK to eat because they're familiar and they don't perceive them as harmful. For me, that was mostly simple carbs and, when I'd worked on it a bit longer, a particular type of cheese which had to come from a particular supermarket. So I'd have cereal (as long as we had the right type) or buttered toast in the morning, cheese sandwiches for lunch, plain pasta or a jacket potato with some butter or cheese on it for dinner, otherwise I couldn't eat it. Every day. For *years*. If an ingredient was prepared in a different way (say, mashed potato instead of baked), it was not safe. If it was the wrong brand (say, of bread) and therefore different and from a source I didn't trust, it was unsafe. The most common 'unsafe' foods are apparently vegetables and meat, so that gives you an idea of how unhealthy this is. 

The common advice people give for children who are just kind of fussy eaters is to just put what they are expected to eat in front of them and tell them that's what they're having and reserve it at the next meal if they refuse to eat it until they do. If you don't give them snacks between meals, they will eventually get hungry enough and eat it. My Mum tried that when I was about 5 or 6 and I just didn't eat for three days. It wasn't a case of me being stubbern, it's that this tactic doesn't work on a child with selective eating because that child does not see the meal you are putting in front of them as food. They see it as something that is revolting, harmful, that will hurt them if they eat it. Same thing goes for tricking kids into eating something they don't want to. Later on, when I'd got as far as eating hot dogs, my sister got fed up of my weirdness and snuck some coleslaw into it when I was in the bathroom. She figured that I'd eat it, see it wasn't so bad and it'd break the cycle - what actually happened was that I took one bite, threw up and was too tense and scared of my food having something 'bad' in to eat anything else for the rest of the day and checked my hot dogs for foreign substances forever more. I like coleslaw now and I'll still catch myself double checking on occasion!  

What tactics like that will also do is they run the risk of the person with selective eating no longer seeing that food as 'safe' because in their eyes, it's been contaminated, or, it will make them gradually believe that they don't have a safe and reliable source of food because they never know if the next meal is going to be something they can eat or not. In cases like that, kids with selective eating will horde or steal food in a manner similar to kids who have come out of homes where they suffered neglect. That's where the water biscuits came in - I was given my own 'stash' when I went to boarding school in case I couldn't eat what was being offered to me so I wouldn't internalise the idea that food was unavailable and start up with behaviour that could get me into trouble. As it was, I would still end up taking bread rolls from the cafeteria ""just in case"" and, even now when I am generally described by others as a 'foodie' and am generally fairly adventurous when it comes to trying new things, I will get really anxious if I'm going on a train or bus journey and I haven't brought any food. 

**TL;DR: Fussy eating can be a mental disorder - I'm surprised I didn't get scurvy.** "

With that being said the fully approach and straight ball is kinda funny and entertaining.  When was the last time you have an funny conversation talking a about a particular ball's RG or the layout or what makes up the cover?  It's the same in car chase movies, do you ever hear anyone say ""Turn the traction control off"" or ""This chassis was made for from materials to make it strong and sharp""?

In other words it's not suppose to be taken that serious, a lot of those movies are old by now.  Imagine if they were a lot more about the science and numbers and physics behind bowling and less about other things.  Then those movies would be nothing compared to what they are now.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a big bowling nerd but bowling nerd stuff and Hollywood just don't mix."

- Have them lay side by side. Eat one pussy for a while then switch to the other. Finger girl B while you eat the pussy of girl A. If either girl is near orgasm, DON'T SWTICH! Make her cum, then switch and make the other cum.

- Still on their backs side-by-side, fuck girl A while fingering girl B. Switch. Again, if either girl you're fucking is close to cumming, do NOT stop! Fuck her and make her cum.

- Bend them both over. Fuck girl A - finger girl B. Switch. Remember about making them cum.

- If on a sofa, position girl A on her back and fuck her. Have girl B sit on the back of the sofa and above girl A's head and eat her pussy.

**If they're into it...**

- Bend girl A over and fuck her. Have girl B position herself to have girl A eat her pussy. Switch
- Fuck girl A on her back while girl B rides her face (getting her pussy eaten). Suck girl B's breasts while you fuck girl A while she's eating girl B's pussy. Switch.

- While fucking girl A, have girl B get under you and lick your cock/balls while you're fucking girl A. Switch.

- On her back, eat girl A's pussy while girl B sits on her face (girl A eating girl B). Switch.

**At no point should you...**

- Fuck either of them in the ass then move to their pussy. Stick with anal if you're doing anal. Switch condoms if you're moving to pussy.

- Fuck any girl then move straight away to fucking the other unless they are okay with it. If you all are STI free then it should be fine, but fucking any girl and having her pussy juice on your cock is a health risk to the other girl if you don't know your STI status.

- Cum in any girl's pussy unless you're sure she's on birth control.

**Do...**

- Wear a condom.
- Try your best to make each girl cum at least once.
- And most of all have fun!!

PirateCodingMonkey,askgaybros,1390580402.0,"have you made plans to get together again? if yes, then just text him like the day before to confirm that it's still on, then leave it. if not, send him a text to set-up the next date.

on your next date, talk to him about your concerns about texting him too much. he may be fine with getting your texts, but doesn't have time to respond. or he may have another preference for communicating - maybe he's someone who prefers to talk on the phone or exchange emails. find out from him.

&gt; he tends to reach under my shirt and touch the bare skin of the back of my waist when we hug and kiss. Could that also be a sign for something?

that's a sign that he thinks you are attractive and wants to feel your body. i love to feel a guy's skin on mine and it adds to the intimacy of the kiss. could it mean more? possibly. like he wants to get you naked for instance. but definitely it means he wants to feel your body."

The best case scenario for my daughter is that he turns out to be a good dad, she turns out to be a good stepmother, and we all settle in to this reasonably smoothly.  I'm trying hard to keep that in mind and not let my feelings of hurt keep me from working to make that happen.

I've got *one* semi-OKish shot of Orion as a whole, and even then I cringe when I view it at 1:1 because the stars are blurring. I didn't think you could get something that detailed with a 'normal' (albeit massively high-end) lens. My 300mm is about the lowest end you can get ([Canon 70-300mm f/4-5.6](http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Telephoto_Zoom/EF_70-300mm_f4-5.6_IS_USM/)). Aren't most telescopes 600mm or greater?

Do you have any advice for this sort of shot? Finding somewhere lacking in light pollution around here is hard enough, but if i'm at 300mm on my lens are there any tips you can give to maximise what I can do (I know both the glass and camera aren't anything close to what you're working with, and the user is still a newb too)? I manual focus using the LCD at 10x magnification to try and get the least blur, but at f/5.6 I need a relatively long exposure so might get some trailing and/or blurring, especially as it tends to be windy around here. If i'm mounted on a solid tripod would you recommend turning IS off for a crisper shot, or leaving it on to deal with wind buffeting? I recently read suggestions that IS should be turned off when tripod mounted for a crisper shot, which surprised me. Surely if you're firmly mounted IS is just not doing anything, rather than making your shot *worse*?"

ButterMyBiscuit,WTF,1390580753.0,"&gt; The minimum number of calories a woman can take is 1,200, below that it's starvation. I have been consuming 1,200 

That's where you're going wrong. That's like saying a 5'2"" 100 lb male should be eating 2000 calories a day on average just because that's what the average man should eat. That's silly, he'd gain weight like crazy. Conversely, if an average man ate as much as this small guy should be eating, he'd lose weight.

Your quoted bit is true of the average woman. If you're particularly short, or older (i.e. lower metabolism), or multiple other reasons, you might need less calories, meaning your minimum safe consumption of calories is lower. A lower metabolism just means your body is using less energy, meaning you don't need to take in as many calories. Everyone's optimal calorie breakdown is different and down to a variety of factors.

I guess what I'm trying to say is if your metabolism is lower than average, you need to eat less than average.

For my own point, I'll talk about me and one of my dearest friends.

When I was a kid, I never weighed more than 20 kg, but I ate like a football player. People joked and constantly wondered where I stored all the extra calories. I can tell you two things for certain:

&gt; My dad fed me lots of veggies and home-cooked food, but it was usually half-burned and drowned in olive oil

&gt; I was super energetic, and ran around everywhere A LOT. I was also crazy strong, and I could pick up my (four years) older sister's male friends easily. The doctor told me I had very dense and heavy muscles which made up for most of my weight

And even when I passed puberty, my weight was still consistent. I was about 110 pounds and 5""4. Even when I stopped running around and lazed about my weight never changed. Some people say I got my dad's genes, because he is pretty thin. I can't say for sure.

Now, my friend. She is the nicest, sweetest, smartest person I know. She's also a bigger girl. I would estimate 5""3 and 150-160 pounds. She has been trying to lose weight forever. She's been on a permanent diet since she was 12 or so, eating small portions of mostly veggies and meat, has played soccer for 5 years, continues to work out harder than I ever would every day, and still her weight has never changed.

It makes me depressed sometimes, for her, how she can never attain the body she wants, despite working really hard for it. "

That's not automatic.  First thing would be to complete the FAFSA.  Then go to your school's financial aid website and look to see what scholarships/grants your school has and what the application process for those awards is.  At my school, there was a school-specific scholarship application which had to be completed in addition to the FAFSE, along with a couple letters of recommendation.


I received money from Pell Grants, and a couple school-specific scholarships based on my GPA and major.


&gt; I'll definitely be trying to work at the same time, but I won't sacrifice my grades for a min wage job if it comes down to it

Also look at your school's ""student employment"" website.... see if there's an on-campus job which looks interesting.  They're more likely to tailor your work schedule around your class schedule than off-campus jobs will be.

Vegemeister,buildapc,1390580907.0,"RAID stores data on multiple hard disks.  This is done to improve performance and/or mitigate the inconvenience of hard drive failure.  

Except for RAID 0, all types of RAID allow your filesystem to keep working after a disk fails. The failed disk can then be replaced without having to bother with reinstalling the operating system and restoring from backup. (With proper configuration and a delicate hand, you can even do it without turning the machine off.) RAID 1 does this by storing the same data on two or more disks.  RAID 5 and 6 use [erasure codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code) so that N disks may be combined into a single volume with N-1 or N-2 times the capacity of a single disk, and the ability to tolerate 1 or 2 disk failures.

RAID 0 splits the data into chunks and stores each chunk on alternating disks. You get double the read and write speeds and twice the space.  You also get nearly twice the failure probability.  The foolhardy use RAID 0 for their system (""C:"") drives, but really it's best reserved for data that you don't actually care about keeping."

The issue with marriege is one of politics and the only reason the west seems more tolerant is because there are liberal advocates that condemn discrimination. The same type of people argue over here for conserving traditional values. 

You are not more accepting you are just more censored. I use the gay adoption issue to point this out. Because there is no argument that on average a child raised by gay parents is in a bigger risk than any other couple, i.e. dysfunctional couples will screw up a child and that is likely to happen regardless of the gender of the partners. 

And I would argue because of contextual coercion that leads to many heterosexual couples forming or staying together despite obvious incompatibility, the % of unhealthy relationships is higher for heterosexuals."

dotyertees,AskWomen,1390580966.0,"The reverse situation happened with me and a gentleman friend of mine.  We had started spending lots of time together, and I developed a small crush.  I came out and said I had, and I wanted to know if it was returned. He said he thought of us as good friends, but that was all.  I was actually relieved as that meant I knew where I stood with this guy and I had no reason to stress out about anything.  We've remained great friends.  

The only change is that now I have a standard based on how he treats me.  For example, if a dude wants to have more of me than a friend, he better treat me better than my gentleman friend.  It's a good standard. :)

Edit: After reading a few of the replies, I wanted to clarify a few things.  Gentleman friend is single, and some of our mutual friends had already put us as a ""couple""(in fact, we're still correcting a few people) because we do get along so well and we do spend so much time together. I was not obsessing, I actually had no idea if there was a possibility for something more than the high quality friendship we were enjoying. To be honest, the idea of messing up that friendship really made me anxious, so for me, it was better to see if something more was possible.  I don't think we've wavered in our bond, if anything, it made things simpler: I know I don't have to worry about him trying to take advantage of me. 

Now, I have had male friends approach this with the attitude of ""you dated X and broke up, now it's my turn."" That sort of attitude has put some stress on those friendships and there's a part of me that knows I can't ever fully trust that person. They've already viewed me as an object(rides and games have turns, people do not), so I have to wonder how much they really know ME as a person.  I've also had some of my friends say they wanted more and I've declined.  Sometimes this works out okay, sometimes they drift off and find another girl that's more into them than I was.  I've only once had it go wrong.  I prefer honesty and directness, and if I'm confused, I do my best to ask in a courteous manner and move on.  "

Once I actually went to the emergency room. I've known other people to do this as well. Unfortunately they charge you some like $500 just to walk in the door. If you're feeling suicidal then definitely get to the ER. A psychiatric emergency is just as much an emergency as any other (and yes I know you're not crazy just crazy from the pain.) Can't get there on your own? Call a friend, call a cab, call 911. 

One of the frustrating things about migraines is that things that prevent them or things that treat them lose efficacy over time so you have to find a new preventative/treatment. Something that might have once stopped the headache cold in its tracks will no longer have much of an effect. So try something new.

Amusing story: In high school I had a migraine and the teacher sent me to the nurse. The nurse, being a stupid cunt, thought I was pulling some kind of stunt to get out of gym class (even though I had just come from French class) and sent me back to class. Then the teacher sent me back to the nurse. Walked into her office and promptly puked all over her desk. I told you I had a headache bitch! Really, people just don't get it sometimes."

brotherbock,triathlon,1390581145.0,"Riding a bike is like grappling with an empty gi....wait, that makes no sense :)

You should have a lot of power from BJJ, and likely some muscular endurance as well--being able to exert muscles for extended periods of time without letup. What BJJ won't likely have given you is the cardio endurance.

With that in mind, and of course depending on the race, I wouldn't spend a lot of time at first on hill training or speed training if I were you. I'd spend most of my time at first getting out for LDRs--Long Distance Runs/Rides. Set a good pace (train at speed, endurance is pace-specific), and go. Once you're able to bike the 56mi, and separately run the 13.1, without falling over dead, then start working on more speed/power. AAAAAND bricks. Ride, get off the bike and run immediately. You don't really have to be able to string together a 56mi/13.1mi brick before the race--most triathletes I know have never actually trained at the race length before their first race at that distance. But you need to be able to make your legs work for running after biking at speed.

Swimming is another animal for where you are at. Honestly, I would focus on being able to swim the required distance *smoothly*, without gassing yourself, so you are fresh as possible for the bike and run. Don't worry about trying to fly through the swim. Smooth, steady swimming, the whole distance plus.

And then, as a good BJJ roller, during the race if you're struggling, just get angry at it and refuse to let it beat you :)"
slapdashbr,buildapc,1390581148.0,"Yes. The 270 (no x) is a slower version that uses less power, the 270x is a slightly faster version. They all use a fully-enabled Pitcairn GPU (1280 stream processors). The 270 has only a single 6-pin connector and is rated for lower power use, which comes at the cost of not being able to overclock nearly as well, but is $20 cheaper. The 7870 and 270x have essentially the same core, although the 270x models might be a little better on average thanks to manufacturing improvements over time. The 270x is also specced to have somewhat faster VRAM, which does improve performance in a lot of games, but often you can overclock the VRAM fairly easy on the 7870 to similar speeds. Only a 400 MHz effective difference, meaning the chips are only rated for 100MHz higher base speed. For the low price you can get the outgoing 7870, it is a great buy while it is in stock. They will stop making that model (or they have already) once they run out of parts like the fans and coolers designed for that model, as they transition to making only r9-270 and 270x boards. In fact it had been sold out mostly everywhere (thanks, litecoin miners). I'm a little surprised that there are any in stock again, although they may have had a bunch of the other parts already produced or ordered that they want to use up. "

Blacksheep01,worldnews,1390581186.0,"&gt; Because it is painful (and who knows what kind of subconscious psychological damage intense penis pain does to a child).

I'm going to have to jump in here and call BS. If you had this done at 5-years-old or something, yeah, you might remember it and it could cause psychological damage. But in the non-Jewish US (of which I am a part) it has historically been done right after birth and thus no one remembers the pain or that it even happened.

Let me ask you, how many memories do you actually have from your life between the ages of 1 day and 1 year old? If you can remember any of it, you are lying as experts agree memories do not even ""begin"" until [closer to 3-years-old.](http://www.nbcnews.com/health/how-far-back-can-you-remember-when-earliest-memories-occur-962749)  So there is no ""subconscious damage"" occurring, I frankly do not even recall existing on day 1 of my life.

&gt;Because some men will grow up to feel robbed, violated, betrayed, by their parents, by their culture, by the laws that failed to protect them.

Once more, growing up in the mostly circumcised US, I had no idea uncircumcised penises even existed until I was 12 or so. When it was later described to me, I couldn't even imagine it, I was told ""flap of skin"" and all I could imagine was some tiny little end piece of skin that just covered the end of the urethra. It wasn't until years later that I actually saw one and my initial reaction was ""what the hell is that?"" This is how foreign an uncircumcised penis is here.

I can assure you this was the experience of everyone I grew up with as well (internet didn't even exist until my age group was 12, so no one was seeing anything online until older). Thus you can imagine none of us felt ""robbed, violated or betrayed"" because we didn't know there was any other penis type.

I have never felt any negative effect on my life because of it, I'm an employed, married adult now and sex has never been unfulfilling, so I struggle to grasp this concept of ""betrayl"" and ""psychological damage"" I see trotted about so much. Considering this has been the life of myself and many of my peers (many now have children also), I have a hard time getting so worked up about all this because frankly, no one feels damaged or even cares in most of the US."

ANewMachine615,AskReddit,1390581302.0,"Right, and I understand that. That's exactly what I think makes it a fad diet. Instead of teaching you what's high-calorie and what's not, it just says ""these foods are always OK, and these other foods are never ever ever OK.""

To compare: I've been tracking calories for a little over a year now. Hitting my caloric goals is second nature, so I've started to focus heavily on secondary ones -- getting up to my protein goal, and keeping my sodium lower than the goal. This tells me that things I thought were low-sodium, like lunch meats, are in fact packed with it. I'm learning what's actually in the foods, what my nutritional needs and goals are, and how the two match up.

If I had been doing keto or paleo or whatever, I'd be wondering why my blood pressure is still high when all I eat is turkey. It stands in for actual understanding of your diet, with relatively easy to follow rules (and yes, it's easier to say ""I will never eat X again"" than it is to say ""I will eat half as much X as I used to"" -- trust me). This makes you less able to deal with variations, which are inevitable in everyday life. However, it's easy to understand and implement, so it's relatively easy to see the progress you signed up for. That's what makes it a fad, IMO."

For darker you could do Sumatra (it has an earthy taste to it which I'm not a huge fan of but its fairly popular)

if you want to be bold go for an italian roast or french roast (intense smokey flavor, which I admit doesnt sound super appealing at first but i absolutely love it)

If youre looking for a more 'fruity' cup a dark ethiopian (i think its ethiopian but its been a while) is very good. That and the New Guinea roasts were my 2 favorites when working at Philz

Id stay away from the latin beans though as those tend to be.more acidic, light roasts and are definitely more sour.

Also if youre looking for dark roasts I wouldnt go to Starbucks...I'm a snob when it comes to coffee shops but their dark roasts are like a 'medium heavy' roast at Peets.

If youre on a.budget, the extra dark roast from Trader Joes is pretty good too

Edit: the only coffee I'd say was ""burnt"" is a spanish roast (step past french roast), and i havent been able to find that anywhere"

Dungeoness,MMORPG,1390581397.0,"Healing in games like Tera (and the upcoming Wildstar), that involve a lot of movement, position adjustments and aiming, are a bit too polarized in terms of enjoyment for me. 

If everyone you play with is smart, mindful and a team player, it's an action packed blast of a time that healing classes usually don't get to experience. This tends to be the case when you are max level and/or run content only with your guild/friends.

If you don't just play with friends, static groups or your guild, you alone are basically forced to mitigate the dumb of the entire party.  In addition to the already established necessity of keeping the tank alive, often when they've misused or ignored their defensive cooldowns, you now have to chase around twitchy, derpy DPS players that strafe and run around constantly - until it's time to dodge that red shit on the ground. Now they're under 30% health and, yep, back to running around like idiots. This makes aiming PBAoE and cone based heals more difficult than perhaps it should be.

I love healing, and this is obviously just my opinion, but action-based games + the current MMO community can = a healer's nightmare."

* You really shouldn't have to buy units unless an AI surprises you with a massive army

* Land TRs are worthless when you could have sea TRs. The reduced gold maintenance on roads is decent, if you're wide it can provide several dozen gpt.

* You shouldn't buy factories in your first few cities unless they have really bad production, the gold cost is simply not worth it considering the turns it takes to build them. The +1 science per gold building is almost worthless.

&gt;All evidence against him has been shown and the jury is about to decide whether he is guilty or not. The man's lawyer exclaims to everyone that the wife shall burst in through the doors of the court in 30 seconds.

Aren't women who wish to wear tefillin entitled to the same courtesy? From where I sit, it really is as simple as that.

That's incorrect. For an efficient inclination change, you want your ascending node and descending node to be as far away from the planet or moon as possible. But if you're already in a low orbit, I'm not sure if it's overall more efficient to actually boost yourself up really high before making the inclination change, since then you have to spend all that fuel returning to your intended lower elevation. It would be a good experiment to run! E.g., starting from the same quicksave in Kerbin orbit, trying a few different inclination change maneuvers, including some that boost the orbit higher first."

2. Leave this marriage and struggle with your life for a few years and obtain personal happiness via independence and self-growth.

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1390581709.0,"Kimchi fried rice. I love to cook up rice, see what leftovers there are and just fry them together. 

My basic recipe, also, measurements are suggestions/ guesstomates:

- 1 cup rice, day old proffered but fresh rice is fine
- 1/3-1/2 cup roughly chopped kimchi - 
- 1/4 cup edamame (removed from pod)
- 1/3 cup left over meat; you want something you can shred like chicken, port, or cow.
- 1/2 cup Left over veggies, I like carrots and broccoli 
- OPTIONAL - An egg

Tips I use mild kimchi which isn't spicy, but pickley and earthy. If I want spice, I coat it in a small bit of sriracha sauce, but careful when you cook the kimchi like that - it makes your eyes water! 

Heat up a wok, or a large non-stick skillet and put about a teaspoon of sesame oil in the pan, when it the oil is shiny, it's hot enough. Dump in your meat and kimchi and saute until the kimchi is slightly toasted on the ends and or ever so slightly translucent and the meat and vegetables are warmed through. Remove from pan and set aside. 

Put in another table spoon of sesame oil, and pour in the edamame and rice along with a heavy sprinkling of salt. Stir the rice constantly until it is a golden brown color. Note, if it is brown-brown like what we get in restaurants, it might be hard to achieve so I don't go for it. Mix in your other ingredients and cook to warm them back up, then remove from heat and serve. 

Not, tradition says put a fried egg on top, but I prefer a poached egg.

For me personally, I love junk food, and it's actually easier for me to force myself to work out every day than it is to eat healthy. While it doesn't sound like that's your problem, I still think that working out a bit combined with a healthier diet is the way to go. "

You need to go to a different doctor and ask for fluconazole pills for both you and your girlfriend (it may be available OTC depending where you live). The pills typically come in 150 mg. Generally for an uncomplicated yeast infection, one pill, taken once is enough. But since this sound like a recurrent issues for you guys, you might need to take one 150mg pill every 72 hours for a total of 3 pills each.

By the way, are you absolutely sure this is candida? Have you both had cultures done and been told the results? It's not that common for a man to have a true yeast infection (some men get itching after having sex with a woman with a yeast infection, but this is a reaction to her yeast, and most of these men do not actually have a yeast infection themselves). If you, as a man, have a true culture-proven, symptomatic yeast infection, or if the yeast keep reoccurring despite treatment with the fluconazole pill, then you should also get tested for risk factors for recurrent infections (HIV, diabetes). You both also need new cultures done to make sure it is candida and not a different fungus, and to rule out other coinfections such as BV or trich.

Also, according to my sources, you don't actually need to abstain from sex during treatment. Although this doesn't quite make sense to me. "

Esrore,soccer,1390582098.0,"Actually Geoff Cameron only strengthens my own point. Geoff Cameron didn't go to Stoke until he was 26, so the entirety of his youth development happened Stateside, through MLS.

Those clubs might have a better track record, but that doesn't make it a better situation for Erik Palmer-Brown. SKC has had a very solid track record of developing defensive minded players. They developed Honduran international Roger Espinoza who Wigan signed from SKC last year (and also played in that fateful FA Cup win). SKC also developed and saved the career of Kei Kamara who played at Norwich last year successfully and is now with Middlesbrough. Graham Zusi, Matt Besler, Chance Myers, and Seth Sinovic, who've all been recently called up to the US national team also developed in KC. Staying in Kansas City allows Erik to develop at a low stress environment where isn't going to be expected to be worth a million dollars. He can stay with his mother, still see his friends, not have to learn another language, develop under a coach he knows (and is a known developer of defensive players), and develop with the player he models his game after. Its a very good set up for Erik, he gets to stay with a team that has high hopes in his future and will make his specific development a priority. He won't be just another academy prospect.

Geoff Cameron is evidence that EPL worthy talent can develop in the US system. As it looks right now, the starting CBs for the US at the World Cup will be players that developed in MLS (Gonzalez and SKC's Besler).

If EPB can pick up Matt Besler's astounding read of the game, along with his own big frame, he has a good chance of turning into a heck of a player."

On a serious note, I was thoroughly disappointed with a piece I read by the usually wonderful Sir Max Hastings, in a semi-recent edition of BBC History magazine.  It was titled ""Why Britain had to Fight the First World War"" and set out the argument that Britain was morally obliged to wage war to uphold the established and accepted ethical standards of the Empire.  He cited in particular the massacres of Belgian civilians by the Kaiserwehr, largely glossing over the commitment to the war which Britain already had by that point. "

Everyone gives a ton of newborn and 1-3 month sizes in clothing and it's useful to get clothes in 3-6,6-9, and 9-12 month sizes.  No one seems to realize how little time is spent in newborn size. 

Also get something for mom/dad. These people are going though a major life change. It's stressful. A giftcard to a restaurant, a movie, or a spa can be greatly welcomed. Everyone kind of forgets about YOU when your pregnant and they focus on the baby. So a little something for them is nice. "

A lot of these people are one-sided too. They want respect, but they don't want to show respect, and live in their own reality where they think that the world revolves around them or any one human is rules this world so you have the upper hand. I will never get the mindset of those who want respect but don't respect others, but get made when they're disrespected.

Self-love does not need to be arrogance. After awhile people get sick of your shit and you're going to start seeing shit crumble around you once everyone is starts to pull out on you and letting you crumble under the weight of you own big head."

JustWordsInYourHead,relationships,1390582248.0,"&gt;Does a relationship stay the same if you lived together prior to marriage?

That's a loaded question. 

If there were no one else in the world other than you and your partner, your relationship probably will not change, although that would depend on how you and your partner actually view marriage.

Even if the two of you both agree that marriage doesn't really change the status of your relationship, the people around you who you two would invariably interact with every single day (co workers, friends, family members) may or may not come to view you differently now. Now instead of a ""guy in a relationship"" to them, you have become ""married guy"" to them. Whether the people in your lives have differing opinions about whether that makes you ""different"" to them or not is anyone's guess. 

And how you view your own relationship could potentially be influenced by how the people around you view your relationship. 


Long reply short: this is a loaded question that only you can answer for yourself."

Well, the paid repair is a great option, since our service center will take that thing apart and replace everything with new stuff. So a repaired old console can live up to two or three years minimum. Third party fixes are often not recommended because they can look what's wrong with it but they can't replace a disc drive or whatever might be wrong with it with Microsoft products. They would use third party products and can't assure functionality.

My birthday was a Thursday and I really just wanted to take a half-day off from work and relax and do nothing, but my friend convinced me to get a thing started with going out. So I booked a few tables for friends at a pub and then found out my friend was sick, and I didn't really know a lot of the people who were invited. I was alone for about an hour and felt super shitty, I was quite upset and just really wanted to go home, but then people started showing up and it was so much fun. First birthday away from family, so it was a success.

PS: Happy birthday!"

Try all of the different mood stabilizers until you find one which works out for you and that you can handle the side effects. Then you could try an antidepressant on top of that but only after being stabilized.

You don't have to accept any med's side effects, if you can't tolerate a side effect, you just quit and try another medication. You have to be insistent to your psychiatrist about the fact that it's just not working out for you.

I was given seroquel recently and it made me like a complete zombie, there's no way I could live like that so I'm seeing my psychiatrist Monday to ask him for another mood stabilizer."

sleepyj910,Parenting,1390582466.0,"I'm only a year in so I'll speak to that mostly, but your ability to travel with children depends on your own disposition and tolerance of chaos.

My wife and I have driven around the country with our little one, and are willing to tolerate the slow pace and constant stops and erratic sleep schedule.  We take her out to eat lots of places, and through experience have learned how to keep her happy, but the learning process can be frustrating, and you have to have the ability to abandon your plans.

But my brother also has a child and he is very routine based so traveling is a nightmare for him.

At least so far, my daughter has consumed my life.  Everything else I care about has taken a backseat, not always out of necessity, but simply because she is so fascinating and needy and I'm exhausted too.  Many days we are psyched to put her to bed and relax our minds because toddlers aren't just going to play with their toys alone, they want to play with you, and it's a lot of work staying 'on' for them.

And of course, your partner and you need to be really strong communicators because you'll be tired and stressed.

So from my experience children are very challenging and very rewarding.  It's like going off to college...a new world appears with new challenges and it's scary and exciting and fun and stressful.  And the students who are committed to their purpose their will succeed, and I think parents who are committed to the goal of raising strong children will succeed."

Blacksheep01,worldnews,1390582496.0,"&gt; Just because you have no issue with pointlessly inflicting pain on children because they won't remember it doesn't mean others don't.
You have less sensation in your penis. You simply aren't aware you do because you have nothing to compare it to.

You are missing the entire point I was making. The poster I replied to suggested we all have psychological damage from circumcision and a general sense that our lives are not as good as they could have been.

What I indicated was neither of those statements are true, because A. no one has memories of the first year of their life so this ""pain"" cannot be remembered and thus there is no psychological trauma and B. As most kids growing up in the US don't even know what the hell circumcision is, there is no sensation perception that is missing (how can you compare things you have no hint even exist?) and it doesn't figure in to peoples psychological profiles about themselves or their sex lives. 

It's like saying ""quick, compare yourself to the alien race of starcluster 4573, don't you feel inadequate to them?"" Answer ""I've never even heard of this alien race, what the hell do they even look like?"" This is the level of perception most kids in the US have (or at least had in my time of growing up) about uncircumcised vs circumcised penises."

It's not like one day I'll stop being a parent just because my kids are 50, it's something you do your whole life and changes as you and your kids grow older. So much to think about. 

I definitely don't want to feel needed by my children otherwise that would mean I've failed to parent them into independent adults. But, at my immature age, I do think of how lonely my partner or I would be if either of us died first. Kids are no guarantee of companionship in old age, but I imagine my partner alone without much family or friends and it scares me.

I am also very good at macgyvering tools, as we don't always have the exact tools at the exact time for the exact treatment.

Take a first aid class. Know CPR, and learn basic triage and the order of things you need to stabilize for the best chances of survival of your patient. Read an anatomy book, or at least look at an anatomy 'map' so you know where all the vitals are - especially organs and blood supplies.

JustWordsInYourHead,relationships,1390583012.0,"1. It says a lot about your relationship (or her) that she was so reluctant to have this discussion with you in the last **four years** of your relationship. Why has the marriage talk and family talk not come up? Why has she internalized these questions she had about the status of your relationship until they came out in a torrent of tears? 

2. Her idea of ""having a baby will cure my depression"" needs to be addressed by you. Not in the way that you've already done by saying ""that's not it."" You're invalidating her feelings. As soon as you do that, she will stop listening to you. Instead of arguing with her about what is causing her depression, **you should be helping her understand that having a child to fix her own emotional issues is A TERRIBLE REASON TO HAVE A CHILD.** What happens when her depression continues after having a baby? Will she come to resent the baby? That's dangerous territory right there. 

3. You need to think long and hard about where you actually stand on marriage and babies. Telling her that you're very interested in marrying her and having a family with her is not the same thing as taking action. **Action speaks louder than words.** So if you a truly interested in marrying this woman, what has prevented you from proposing marriage before now? What is preventing you from proposing marriage now? You say that you want to marry her, but your actions (continual delays) show otherwise. 

I hope this breaks things down for you to help you understand a bit of her perspective as well as help you decide a course of action."

This is about pandering to a public that is not very knowledgable about guns for political PR points. Just like ""assault weapon"" legislation or high capacity magazines laws its just stuff that makes it seem like something is being done. For law abiding gun owners it is frustrating because there is definitely the sense of being made into bad guys for simply practicing a constitutional right and cultural tradition. 

The fact is that most gun deaths in the US are suicides (I believe it is around 2/3) and the vast majority of deaths are from handguns (not ARs/AKs with high capacity magazines). So how exactly would micro stamping work to curb crime? How would micro stamping affect the millions of hand guns currently in circulation in CA? Guns don't simply go away they stay in circulation for decades. Would manufacturers like Hi-Point find cheap ways to stamp an already cheap product? 

It just political bullshit. Why do you think law enforcement would be exempt? It might have something to do with political support.

We are currently moving from a legacy home built system to a new Cots (Commercial off the shelf) system. The biggest issue we're seeing is that when it was just the asset team tracking and keeping everything 'up to date' it was horribly inaccurate. I blame this on the people/management and not the tool.  With the new system we're using various tools to do regular audits/updates to the core records entered/maintained by the asset team. We pull data from Active Directory, SCCM, Absolute Manage (Macs), and our network discovery/management software.   
  
We currently have about 1700 general use or academic lab computers across 30 or so labs.  For various reasons each one is a separate OU in AD. The lab management team is responsible for making sure that everything where it should be.

I forgot what it's called as well, but I do remember a similar phenomenon. It's called the [Cross-Race Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-race_effect).

The way to frame it here, assuming you appear different from others enough, would be that the people around you are using a different style of cognitive recognition for you than they would natives of the area. For people similar to them, individuation thinking. For outsiders like you, categorical thinking.

You're brain might not have adapted to them yet. It hasn't gotten used to individuation of them yet, and there's too many of them. Makes it a bit more difficult for you to remember or distinguish people.

A good example is a few years ago, maybe a year or two after the Paris riots. France enacted heavy religious based laws. They did surveys in Germany, France, UK and US. Most of Europe saw them as non invasive with UK having more problems with it than their continental compatriots. But the US group ha like a 12% approval rating. Because even if you get the most conservative southern dude , he'll still say ""this country was founded  on religious freedom and I'll be damned if I'll let the government tell anyone what god they pray to.""

My whole point is that Europe tends to have this holier than thou attitude over us in the New Workd, and on economic equality, healthcare and other issues you have the right to. But with race it's like a kid from Vermont thinking his state is do much more tolerant than Georgia.  Where Vermont has 8 black people who all go to to UVM and Georgia has this complicated long history and a 50-50 black white population.

The confident girl, though, will probably grab my attention first (I am very attuned to personality and body language). If both were in the same room, and I were out to approach a woman that night, I would probably go for the confident one by initial instinct, as I would pick up on her outward social body language (which I do find pretty sexy). Chances are I would pick up on whether or not we had good chemistry much more quickly than with the shy girl.

That being said, in my experience, I have flirted and made out with a number of confident girls, but my only two serious relationships have been with shy girls, who it took some getting to know and a bit of effort on my part before anything happened with them.

I've also learned the hard way that leaving Kerbals on external command chairs on space stations while docking to that station sometimes results in a high-speed ejection for the Kerbal sometimes, thanks to the fickle Kraken.

But it was not only liberating, she actually appreciated it too. And our relationship actually improved, even though it wasn't enough to save our marriage, if that makes sense.

The best thing you both can do for the long term is to represent yourselves to each other honestly. Sometimes that seems like it will lead to unhappiness or conflict, but the alternative is to create a piece of interactive fiction between the two of you that is designed to hide the truth and keep everyone ""happy."" And when you are living a fiction, the happy relationship is fake. It doesn't actually exist. So even if the truth is uncomfortable, it is better to be able to see those thoughts and feelings, because they already exist either way, and if you can see them you can deal with them, and if they are hidden behind a happy fiction, there is no way to see if you really love each other, or are both just creating a fiction where you do."

Now as to limiting the pain.  You are going to hurt him, but that is a part of life.  You need to break up with him like you are ripping off a band-aid.  Quickly and all at once.  When he inevitably asks why, don't point out his flaws, just that this relationship isn't working for you anymore.  Do not get into him objecting and you overcoming his objections.  When that starts just reiterate once that it isn't working for you anymore and let him know that you won't be talking to him anymore. Then say goodbye and hang up.  

Then NO CONTACT! This is for his sake.  He won't heal for a MUCH longer time if you stay in contact with him.

The game that comes to mind is Wing Commander 3. In the final mission series, you would land at hidden outposts on a suicide run to Kilrah. Now that game forced the wingmen you took with you to die on the final mission, but XCom doesn't have to necessitate that. You'll probably lose some folks anyway. Anyway, the mission series gave the feel of a suicide run, even on replays. The first time you play XCom, assuming you're not save-scumming, some of that feel is present.

Theungry,AskMen,1390584059.0,"&gt;your premise is that ""SAHW = American dream"" and ""American dream does not comply with my existentialism"" ergo ""SAHW= negative connotation to me""

My premise is that I don't want to be a provider/patriarch.  I don't want those types of relationships.  The rest is explanation.

&gt; By making a value judgement on the worth of your partner in the context of the larger American dream status, you are still being controlled by the ""American dream"".

Quite the opposite.  I follow my own personal values and discovered after the fact that ""The American Dream"" was subversive to following those values.

&gt;It's sorta like saying ""I don't want to listen to popular music because everyone else does"". Well you're kinda calling them sheep, and yourself the anti-sheep. 

You're imagining I am someone else.  That ain't me.

&gt;I specifically asked that question of you because I wanted to know your answer. I wanted to know if your loving partner stayed at home and wrote inspirational things just for you both to discuss and for no other purpose, is that still a SAHW?

In that context, no, that wouldn't fit the connotation I hold with a stay-at-home wife.  I was remarking in the broad sense of the expectations that come with that terminology.  Regardless, as I don't want to be in a sole provider relationship with a life partner, I would avoid this situation (though it's moot since I am already 10 years happily married).

&gt;My goal here is to broaden your (seemingly but I could be wrong) narrow definition of what a SAHW could be or do. Your characterization of a SAHW seems to be a vapid woman who couldn't bring value to your life, but if that was the case, why would you marry her?

I think maybe you either don't know what existentialist means, or you think I don't know.  I don't take anything at face value or short hand when I'm making a real life decision.  I habitually analyze everything based on specific values and consequences.  While I may use brevity for the sake of communication, it is not the way my mind works.

&gt;Assuming you marry someone (like this artist you are dating edit:married to) who was an excellent partner who made your life better every day, and had even more energy to devote to doing that if she didn't have a job which gave her income, would you still want her to have a job? If so, why?

10 years happily married, with a great kid to boot.  I would be wary of this situation as even though it seems intellectually engaging, it creates a power imbalance of dependency and that persons life is defined by being my partner.  I want a partner who's life is complimented by partnership with me, not defined by it.  I am highly  attracted to independence.

&gt;And I'm also engaging with you in the hopes of getting you to take a look at WHY you instinctively had a negative connotation with SAHW and see if it can be articulated without context of ""American dream"".

I can talk about ""why"" all day.  I must again repeat: I think maybe you either don't know what existentialist means, or you think I don't know.  I spend a significant amount of my mental energy every day on the deeper exploration of ""why"".

&gt;What inherent property of a SAHW do you personally find to be negative?

In short, the power imbalance of dependence both in finance and identity.  There can certainly be exceptions.  We could sit down and write a fictional narrative where a wealthy agoraphobic free spirit and I fell in love, and her greatest passion was staying at home and studying, and we could build a life together.  That's not really what this discussion about.  In practical and common terms, a SAHW is not something I would want in my life."
Gollygoshdarnscurvy,Cooking,1390584061.0,"First of all, don't use a whetstone on kitchen knives.  Putting an edge on a kitchen knife is a specialty skill, and you are likely to ruin it.  None of those ones where you pull the knife through a slot edge with diamond dust or anything, either.  Horrid.  Honing is what you do with kitchen knives, which gets the edge back into alignment without actually removing metal.  

Secondly, and I know I am now that person who whines instead of answering the question and that is annoying: you don't need something specifically Asian.  There is nothing inherently better about Asian style knives to cook Asian food, unless you are doing some really specialty things on a regular basis.  A chef's knife, a paring knife, and possibly a bread knife if you bake are all you need.  For a ""one true knife to last forever,"" I'd highly advise a chef's knife.

JustWordsInYourHead,relationships,1390584078.0,"Hello! 28 Woman here! Thought I'd share some cool tricks with you about how to manage your personal happiness. 

I separate my personal happiness into 5 major areas so I can use the ""divide and conquer"" tactic to maintain a good level of personal happiness:

1. Self (self worth, self esteem, etc.)
2. Personal relationships (friends, family, lovers)1
3. Education (am I learning as much as I can?)
4. Financial Stability 
5. Career 

Because you're 15, your list might look different, like you said, your life now consists of parents, friends, and guys. So put these items on a list and evaluate your satisfaction with those areas. 

Then, identify which areas of your life you need to improve on the most and which areas you can but in the background for a little bit. Which area of your life do you think deserves most of your attention right now? 

It's easy to feel bogged down with ""nothing going right"" when life throws you a bunch of curve balls all at once (like being the only kid left on the losing end of Dodgeball). Right now your focus is divided between all the things ""not going right"" in your life. So sharpen your focus on one thing and take them down one at a time. 

It's a cool trick, and if you learn how to use it well, it's a trick you can carry with you well into adulthood. ""Being organized"" doesn't just apply to your work or your school--you can apply the same type of organizational skills to managing your own life. 

Best of luck!

IMO, to make a traditional wedding feel unique, you simply need to make it ""you.""  Your theme, your decor, your attire - do stuff that screams ""KorbinWaters94!""

ANewMachine615,law,1390584237.0,"&gt;But now as I grow more aware social injustice around me, I want to make it better. I feel becoming a criminal justice Judge would be my place in improving society.

Aimless mid-20 year olds do not make it to judgeships. Y'know who becomes a judge? Well-connected people, or the exceptionally gifted and driven. Actually, you normally have to have a bit of both. It's the elite of the elite, seriously. Do not go into law to become a judge, and do not try to become a judge to rectify ""social injustice."" That's a quick and easy recipe for a bad judge. You're supposed to be impartial, not a champion of the downtrodden.

As for why I did it: originally, for the money. Once I realized that there is no money left in law (since BigLaw was collapsing, and jobs were non-existant) I did it because I enjoyed the work and wanted to do it every day for the rest of my career. Note that this second part is really why you want to go into law. If you do it for the money, well, good luck being part of the 1% who actually get high-paying legal jobs out of law school. Want to defend people like you're Atticus Finch? Have fun pleading out thousands of DWIs for the rest of your life. Want to be Jack McCoy? Have fun pleading out thousands of DWIs for the rest of your life.

The simple fact is that unless you like the core work -- researching, reading, writing, and a ton of paper-pushing -- you're gonna hate being an attorney, and if you hate being an attorney, you'll likely not be terribly successful at it. You can have those other things as secondary goals (I love helping out the legally clueless and vulnerable) but recognize that this will be a tiny minority of the stuff you do, unless you're one of a tiny, tiny share of attorneys."

I'll make use of LL Bean's generous return policies if a garment starts to fray or break down within a year or so of purchase, but I know they can handle it-- they charge prices high enough to be that kind of company. Amazon is the discount bin of the internet, though, so I don't think it's reasonable to wreck their whole profit margin just because 2% or so of orders get momentarily delayed.

I rarely *need* two-day delivery. If something shows up a day late due to circumstances beyond anyone's control, I don't see a need to try to profiteer from the situation. The most I've ever done was to return an item as no longer being needed due to its late arrival-- like, if it was urgent enough to require me to go to a brick-and-mortar store rather than wait one more day. Amazon waives return shipping charges if this happens, but they also get to re-sell that item, so it's more of a win-win than having the customer just pocket the late item and then ask for more cash on top of it."

Off duty, I decompensate. My house is disaster, I never fold my laundry, my socks are always mismatched because I just grab them out of the bin and go.

I think the people creating content are doing so as an artistic endeavour and those responsible for distribution and licensing, are morally bankrupt arseholes who need to relinquish their grip over art before they choke any more life out of it.

I pay $13 a month for my primary usenet provider and I pay excess on top for 3 different block providers. I can however manage my media how I'd like and automate its retrieval from the internet.

This isn't Netflix' fault necesarrily, they're doing all they can but until they can deliver a product that isn't geoblocked from my country and production companies start loosening their grip over licensing agreements, i'll continue to pirate that media and the money they would have received will go to my newsgroup providers.

FWIW, I obviously agree with everything you said there ;) but would add that the people ""keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive"" because God said ""make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed"" [Is 6:9-10], and that what is needed, is ""a new spirit"" and ""a heart of flesh"" [Ezekiel 11:19], which is of course ""faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God"" [Ephesians 2:8].  So it is not enough to merely hear the message of ""his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature"" [Romans 1:20], which ensures ""they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die,"" yet still ""they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them"" [Rom 1:32] unless God takes out the ""heart of stone"" and replaces it with a ""heart of flesh,"" because ""he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills"" [Romans 9:18].

I did not do that as smoothly as you did, but, to show you how a fundamentalist can turn into a Calvinist while still loving Scripture. :) Thanks for the patient answers!"

&gt; ""The interest of the second order, that of those who live by wages, is as strictly connected with the interest of the society as that of the first. The wages of the labourer, it has already been shown, are never so high as when the demand for labour is continually rising, or when the quantity employed is every year increasing considerably. When this real wealth of the society becomes stationary, his wages are soon reduced to what is barely enough to enable him to bring up a family, or to continue the race of labourers. When the society declines, they fall even below this. The order of proprietors may, perhaps, gain more by the prosperity of the society than that of labourers: but there is no order that suffers so cruelly from its decline…

&gt; ""His employers constitute the third order, that of those who live by profit.  it is the stock that is imployed for the sake of profit, which puts into motion the greater part of the useful labor of every society.  The plans and projects of the employers of stock regulate and direct all the most important operations of labor, and profit is the end proposed by all those plans and projects.  But the rate of profit does not, like rent and wages, rise with the prosperity, and fall with the declension, of the society.  On the contrary, it is naturally low in rich, and high in poor countries, and it is always highest in the countries which are going fastest to ruin.  The interest of this third order, therefore, has not the same connection with the general interest of the society as that of the other two.""

How people can profess to know so much about the business and not have the know how to know how an angle is going to end is an anomaly. Daniel Bryan never turned heel. He wasn't going to be buried, they were playing you. If you were such a smart fan, you'd know that they did the exact same angle with CM Punk in ECW. I understand wanting to be emotional about an angle, that's great. But if you were actually a smart fan, you'd know to sit the fuck down and shut up. Just watch, listen, and learn. It's the same thing they tell green guys actually in the business to smarten them up. Calling yourself a smark and then not practicing that simple stuff is beyond me. I don't wanna be a smark anymore. I wanna be a smart fan.

3. TNA isn't as horrible as most of you think it is and the jokes are getting old. It's like this. Imagine being an A plus student as a teenager, but you're also a total spaz. You just knock things over and fall all over yourself and nobody lets you forget it. So you graduate and a few kids from your school know you and point out how much of a spaz you were, and you keep insisting you're not that guy anymore. So you keep trying to change and everybody still thinks you're a spaz. But you're not anymore. You've cleaned up your hygiene. You're distinctly you. If you don't see the allegory by now, can't help you.

Ineffectiveness is on a different scale. Seatbelts are substantially effective, just not perfectly so. Firearm forensics databases have so far been almost entirely ineffective.

Circumventing seatbelts brings a direct and immediate risk to the person doing the circumventing. Circumventing microstamping brings no risk to the person doing it, and possibility of significant gain if someone does intend to commit a crime, providing very different motivations.

The low cost was a claim made by the microstamping manufacturer prior to the bill being passed, but has not played out like that in practice. Per http://nssf.org/factsheets/PDF/Microstamping.pdf, the costs for the manufacture and regulation would be more like $200/firearm - this is greater than a 50% increase for many handguns. Seatbelts are more on the order of 1% of the cost of a vehicle. The very low number "

boolean_sledgehammer,AskMen,1390584861.0,"The best way to ""act confident"" is to actually **be confident.** You can only develop confidence by cultivating a healthy sense of self-worth and fully understanding what your own values and abilities are.

This takes time, and it is a process fraught with a great deal of trial and error. You can fake it if you want, but ultimately people will see through the disguise when your actions don't match your words. People generally have better bullshit detectors than you think, and it's easy to see when someone is putting on an act.

Being confident means that you are more invested in your perception of yourself than other people's perceptions of you. It means you're willing to risk the vulnerability that comes with unapologetically putting yourself out there. It means that you aren't heavily invested in what other people think of you, and you do not require their validation of who you are.

The best way to communicate this is to be completely outcome-independent. This means that when you approach a woman, the result ultimately shouldn't matter to you. If you get rejected (and you will), then you simply recognize that there are plenty of other women out there. Rejection is actually a pretty good filter, it immediately singles out the women who have no interest in you and aren't worth any further time and effort. 

That's it in a nutshell - being confident means being more invested in how you see yourself than how other people see you."

balathustrius,mead,1390584871.0,"To clarify some of what Mars is talking about, it's become the vernacular to say the last 2 digits of a gravity reading as however so many points, but I think of gravity (for example) as one-point-one-oh-eight (1.108) and the last two digits as .008 points. That's just internal dialogue, though, because SG is a ratio measurement. Talk of points in the first place isn't quite right.

One pound of honey per gallon of mead or must generally adds ~.035 to the gravity reading. Mar's equation tells you how much honey to add to raise the SG by .010, under that assumption. I was ballparking it in my earlier comment, due to what I said about adding honey in steps, which I do because it *does* deviate from typical sugar and water content.

Unfortunately, when us introspective noobs come across someone who has undertaken a practice like voluntary celibacy that gives them insight, we have the tendency to take it too far and milk the person for all they are worth. It's almost a form of dehumanization that we don't realize we are doing. It's very similar to how people treat celebrities and famous artists. We love the *idea* of them so much that we are willing to invade their privacy by following them around and expecting them to perform on our command like circus monkeys. We forget that they are real people with human needs, and that sometimes that need is to just chill and be lowkey. There's nothing wrong with needing to be alone to recharge. We just have a tendency to forget that other humans don't exist just to perform for us.

And, no I honestly don't think you chose her infidelity for her. I just think you and her had incompatible sex drives. There are women with similar sex drives who want to have sex at about the same frequency as you do, or are at least willing to not force their partner into sexual ultimatums just so they can get off. There really are people who will respect you enough to not cheat on you just because you say no to sex. Hard to believe given how much emphasis we put on sex, but it's true.

Hormone levels, access to food, carcinogens -- all can have effects on your genetic expression. The X-gene is particularly susceptible to psychosomatic epigenetics, so your mind can often impact it -- this is why so many mutants manifest their powers in times of great stress, despite the relevant gene existing in them since birth.

I hated knowing that I was the worst asshole to the most amazing girl I've ever known, that it was entirely my fault I missed the past 5 years of her life.

We've since reconnected, and talked everything out, which was probably the best thing to happen to me in 2013.  It finally allowed me to start forgiving myself.  Either way, I'm never gonna get those 5 years back."

shinerdawg,explainlikeimfive,1390585155.0,Depends on which chapter you file. For example a chapter 7 would liquidate all of your debt (barring student loans I believe). Essentially the creditor would not be allowed to pursue you for the amount owed as per the Discharge you are no longer liable or responsible for the debt. A chapter 13 would be a reorganization of your debt and you would most likely be placed on a payment plan that would eventually satisfy the majority of your creditors. Most Ch. 13's are paid through a Trustee. I'm not a attorney or expert but have worked with both of these filing's in my line of work. That's just a basic rundown of the two most common types. There are Ch. 11's and 12's as well but unless you own a business/corporation or a farm those would not be relevant. I'm not an expert so talking with BK attorney is your best bet. It will most certainly hurt your ability to get credit for quite awhile.

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1390585169.0,"*  I created a ""wedding planning"" group on FB for my friends who have recently been married, are engaged, or who are planning to get engaged soon.  This is a great way for us all to discuss general wedding stuff, specifics about our weddings, and get feedback from other ladies.  I've kept it females only, because not all of the people in the group are personal friends of mine, and sometimes folks will post about lady-specific stuff and I want them to feel comfortable.  **This works well for me when I want to squee out about something wedding related on social media.**

*  My friend created a group on FB ONLY for her bridal party, DOC, MOB, etc for wedding specific stuff.  This way she could ask us about dresses, decor, honeymoon advice - anything about her specific wedding, and get information from the people who would be helping with that wedding.  **This worked very well for her**

*  I've created a ""List"" on FB called ""wedding guests"" and tried to post statuses to just that list, but then I found out that when you create a list and post to it... FB shows those people who is in the list.  If it just said ""rockspeak shared this to ""Wedding Guests"" that would be fine, but it says ""Rockspeak shared with with [insert every fucking name on the list].""  That wouldn't be an issue if we could invite every friend from every circle but that's not the case and I didn't want to create drama, so I stopped using that list.  **This did not work very well for me.**

*  Occasionally I'll post something on FB in general, asking for recommendations for wedding-related stuff.  I may ask for info on travel agents or honeymoon destinations, or bakers in my area.  People do some assuming and judging in the comments, but the goal is generally achieved:  People give me personal recommendations for vendors they liked, and it saves me on some research, pouring over TheKnot, Yelp, and Google.  **This worked well for my needs, but I do NOT use it when I want to talk about specifics of my wedding.**

I've sent out my STDs and I keep my wedsit updated with news.  I have an announcements section that posts to my cover page, so folks who have that URL and check it will see when we select a vendor or make some other important wedding decision.  

Otherwise, I just rely on texting/messaging my friends and family when I need advice or want to share.  

I haven't had many issues with people posting on social media and asking about the wedding, or inviting themselves; however, if that were to happen, I would simply delete their public comment and message them, stating ""Hey, I saw your post on my wall (or whatever) and I deleted it; not everyone on my friends list is invited, and I don't want to hurt any feelings by talking with a guest in a public forum.  It's nothing personal, and I'm excited too!""  Or if someone invites themselves:  ""Hey, I saw your post but I deleted it; we wish we could invite everyone, but not all of our FB friends are invited, and I wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.  In fact, aside from family and close friends, we're still trying to find room in our budget to invite more people.  I'm not quite sure if we'll be able to invite you (and your SO) yet, and I'm so sorry; as soon as I know more about the size of our venue and our budget, we'll know how many more people we can invite and I'll let you know!""  

It depends on the type of comment and the person, but in general that's what I would say.  I'm glued to FB and am constantly deleting comments and messaging people to let them know why; I will NOT let someone hijack something on my page just to be incendiary to my other friends, or mention something that makes shit awkward for me, so I delete the comment and message that person.

**Edit**  Outside of social media, people ask about the wedding a LOT.  Like people I can't fathom would think they were invited (Someone I see twice a year at a party out of town?  Someone I see at random beer events, but only recently learned their name?).  I think people just like to talk about weddings.  A little rule of thumb I use is:  If I don't have that person's phone number... they can't possibly think they're invited.  If I *do* have their number, and occasionally call or text them... they might think they're invited and I'll have to keep that in mind when discussing wedding stuff.

**Edit 2**  I did have someone ask me via message on FB if he was invited...  I thought he was joking.  He's a friend of a friend that I've **never met in real life** that doesn't even **live in my state** and he seemed genuinely disappointed...  We chat fairly often on FB, and I helped him out with a bad break up... but to think he was invited to my wedding?  I told him it would be super awkward to MEET someone at my wedding (and our mutual friend isn't even invited) and he said he would come down to visit and meet me before then.  Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiittle creepy."

mmp31,politics,1390585336.0,"&gt;It would generally take many years to accumulate enough data to show the economic impact of a political policy, other than saying stuff like, ""Hey, this gives money to poor people, and therefore obviously leads to poor people having more money.""

Absolutely false. When the banks were bailed out in 2008, the effect on the economy was immediate.  It does not necessarily take many years to demonstrate the economic impact of political policy.
 
It's also far more complex than you're making it out to be.  You can't give poor people money without taking it away from somebody else first. Simply giving money to the poor is meaningless if you're taking more away from them than what you're giving them.

What you're basically saying is that you don't know whether or not Obama's economic policies have done anything to slow or reverse the growing wealth gap.  All you've offered is your baseless opinion.

&gt;That said, there's also the even vaguer counterfactual: has Obama's policies been better than those of a theoretical Republican during the same timeframe? If you charted the Bush presidency for a few more years the answer is probably yes, but you probably wouldn't accept that as proof either.

That's because it's not proof, nor is it counter-factual. It's just you speculating."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390585516.0,"&gt;He played a very important role in my life and neglected me because of other women.

But he's not representative of all men.  That was *one* person.  Eventually, you'll have to let that go.  I understand - my SO was in an emotionally abusive relationship, and I know it can be hard.  In the beginning, I was very supportive and understanding, but I had to keep reminding her that I wasn't her ex and that she needed to realize that.  It's okay in the beginning, I totally get it, but eventually, I can't keep being compared to him and have her constantly think I'm an asshole just because of someone else.  That's not fair to me, and it's unnecessarily stressful on her.  There needs to be established trust in a relationship, and in order for it to work, you need to be able to assume the best of your partner. It's not fair to either person to do otherwise- and yeah, that can take time, but within reason.

&gt;Somehow he managed to ingrain these lasting thoughts that women are replaceable objects and that true love doesn't exist. 

Do you honestly believe that?  I don't mean that in an accusatory way, I mean deep down, don't you know that's not true?  He's out of your life, so stop listening to him.  You're not replaceable.  If things work out, sure, you might not last, but saying you're replaceable is akin to saying your parents are replaceable.  Sure, you can emancipate yourself and get adopted by another family, but you don't do that every time your parents piss you off or if you see a family with other traits that you like.  It doesn't work like that.  And true love?  What does that even mean?  Love exists, sure - maybe not that there's only one person out there that is right for you, but that doesn't mean you can't be completely and totally in love with someone.  It just means every person has the potential to find someone else if their current partner doesn't work out - but guess what, as of right now, out of all those people, *he chose you.*  

&gt;I know deep down that my fears are unreasonable, and can manage to suffocate them. 

Don't suffocate them - work on getting rid of them.  Work on realizing that they aren't logical and that they're the work of a manipulative ex that shouldn't be listened to.  

&gt;Even though I know I look good (not GREAT or anything, but I am fit) and I'm not stupid, I still question myself a lot.

But *he didn't*.  He decided that he wanted to be *with you*.  You should stop questioning yourself at that point.  Still strive to be the best that you can be, but don't question his love for you, that's not fair to him, and it puts undue pressure on you and the relationship.  If you keep telling yourself you might not be good enough, then eventually you're going to end up convincing him that it's true.  

&gt;it feels like life is a contest sometimes, where I have to compete against people constantly.

Sure - a contest to find the SO that you want, the job that you want, the house that you want, etc.  I can definitely get behind you there, we're always competing for something.  But here's the thing - you on the SO front, you already won.  There's no more competition, it's over.  You don't have to compete with other women anymore.  If he's any sort of decent boyfriend, he's not comparing you to anyone.  Sure, a hot body is always going to turn heads, and there's no stopping that, it just happens.  But it doesn't mean anything.  It doesn't mean he wants you less or wants you more, he just thinks they look good, and it ends there.  

&gt;I hate losing.

Well that's fine, because you won.  Now you just have to understand that and start acting like it.

&gt;My worst fear is that this guy is going to take everything I gave to him, and throw it away to rot like biodegradable waste. 

The way I see it, to be afraid of something like that is to not have faith in yourself, your relationship, or your SO.  Would you just randomly throw everything away?  I'm assuming your answer is ""no,"" so why would you think your SO would? 

&gt;I feel like I lose my identity when I fall in love like this

That's something you (and a lot of people for that matter) have to work on.  A relationship shouldn't *really* change who you are.  You should still be you.  Work on that.

&gt;the vulnerability part is the worst.

It's a bit scary at first, but you get used to it.  You just need to understand that there are certain things you can't control, and not to worry about them until something happens.  Otherwise, there's unnecessary strain on everything.  I mean, think about it - let's say he's going out to the bar with his buddies, and you think ""but what if he cheats?""  Okay...what are you going to do to prevent it?  Go there and watch him?  Prevent him from going?  There's really nothing you can do, so you just have to assume the best.  I suppose you can worry, but that doesn't get you anywhere.  There's really nothing you can do short of controlling or spying on him, so you might as well assume he's the good person you thought he was when you decided to date him.

&gt;I guess I know nothing of men. Nothing.

Men are all different.  There are some things that may be common, but for the most part, every person is going to be different in some way or another.  The mistake your making is thinking every man acts the same or like your ex.  Stop comparing us to each other and judge each one of us based on our own merits. You'll be a lot happier that way, and so will the people you care about.

s54b32dd,investing,1390585618.0,"&gt;They love to spend money

Reddit loves spending money on themselves/their community/""the less fortunate"". It's the classic donation vs. taxation argument. People are generous with the platform because they aren't having the monetization shoved down their throat, and they derive a pleasure from perceived assistance.

&gt;smart companies are already able to translate Reddit into cash

Yes, reddit allows people and companies to promote things. However, this promotion comes at the cost of time and involvement, rather than monetary cost. The community doesn't like blatant advertising/shilling, and an AMA where the person in question doesn't invest energy or seem to care about the community is not typically well received. An AMA is no guarantee of money, because it's very difficult to control the message/shape the conversation; the key here is that the community is expected to control the flow of the conversation, which can potentially severely limit the marketing potential of the medium.

&gt;they have a short memory

This is debatable. I'm sure that there are still people upset over Woody's AMA for Rampart, because I'm one of them. And I know I've stopped buying EA games because of the way they treat their customers (which I was somewhat oblivious to prior to spending time on Reddit). Point is, everyone is different in their convictions, and the nature of a large, diverse population is that you're going to encounter divergent opinions on topics. It doesn't make people hypocritical or goldfish memory equivalents, it simply makes them different people.

*If* Reddit were to try to monetize the platform, they would have to be incredibly careful about how they do it, because there are other platforms that people will flee to if they don't like the changes. None has quite the cache, maturity or original content that Reddit does, but that would quickly change if the people using this site were to leave.

Reddit really needs to look to the Digg case study here if they have any plans of attempting to monetize (beyond what they have currently) in the future. The real asset of this site is the community, and the community is not tied here by any unbreakable bond (connection to real life friends, a unique communication method, or a unique platform with which to build your voice. [My understanding is that tumblr is still operating at a loss; they only made $13 million for Yahoo! in 2013, while ""keeping the lights on"", so to speak, cost $25 mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr)). Reddit hosts the ability to communicate and be heard amongst a mature viewer base. No doubt it's a unique niche, but by no means is it irreplaceable.

My guess is that Reddit would be heavily overvalued in any IPO due to its huge userbase. Reddit does not require personal information to create an account; there's no value there. The user base is heavily pro-communication, anti-monetization (again, look at Digg if you think this may not be true). There is no strong ""cool"" factor to this model that does not get lost in monetization (Twitter is still cool despite monetization; Facebook is quickly losing that status, because ""cool"" has to be somewhat exclusive, and needs to be interesting; it's no longer interesting or exclusive). There is a huge user base, but there's not the same real world connection/social impact element that affects people in their everyday life.

Reddit is incredibly difficult to monetize. They essentially need to rely on their user base's generosity/donations to keep the lights on, because if they make a strong move to monetize, the user base will evaporate. People that don't really ""get"" reddit see a golden goose; people that have been around long enough to see the rise and fall of a couple different user-driven online communities understand that monetizing this platform is a tricky and heavily image-influenced task; essentially, it would only be accepted by the user base if the advertisers/partner organizations/monetization is an extension of the current site, avoids people's concerns over privacy violations, doesn't incite ire over sponsor business models that don't mesh well with the user base's general opinions, and doesn't affect the content itself.

Monetizing reddit is a job I would not envy."

Don't be an idiot. 

This is /r/purdue, not /r/indiana or /r/indianapolis (both of which I am subscribed to). Everything that is posted here is contextual to *the University*. Even if something pertains largely to the state, we are still in a thread *specifically about the University.*

I'm having a tricky time finding the threads, but there have been a few in recent memory about students who got caught partaking in the dorms and are wondering what to do. The *simplest* rule at Purdue regarding anything drug related is ""Keep it the hell off campus."" 

We're an *academic university*, not the state of Indiana. The state could decide to make alcohol legal for anyone under 21 and the University would still be within its right to maintain its ""No alcohol on campus"" rules.

If cannabis was legalized (or decriminalized) in the state of Indiana, I guarantee you'd still see about 3-4 threads a semester about some idiot student who got caught partaking in the dorms and trying to figure out how to not get expelled.

Whether or not something is legal will have no major effect on the University, because Purdue makes its own rules. If the University wants to keep cannabis against the rules on campus, that's their decision and the students don't get a say. 

It's not fucking rocket science."

ClearArmor,news,1390585699.0,"I believe you do miss my basic premise, and because you are not thinking through the consequences.  Your answer is based on idealism and not practicality.

You make the mistake of believing that former inmates govern their future behavior by recalling the bad results of their past.  Total nonsense.  If that is the case, why do most most inmates end up right back in jail?  If you answer that it's because jail is plush, then I can unequivocally tell you that you have NEVER been in jail.

Almost all of those in jail will return to society at some point.  A man denied dignity and/or comfort will become more prone to violence during his incarceration, not less.  Would you want someone who resents society, is embittered, and has a chip on his shoulder living next to you?


When your child or brother goes to jail, do you also want them to be denied all basic human comfort, right?  Screw them, they're all horrible people deserving of nothing?  Think again."

Nacke,Christianity,1390585701.0,"First of all i wan't to start this off by thanking you for asking me things on this subject. It really get's me thinking and i love it ;) 

Anyway back to the topic! I have a hard time to understand what you are trying to say. English is not my main language. I am sorry for that. But i just want to make some things clear that i dont think you have understood yet. 

First of all, sin is nothing that god threw on humanity just to make us worship him. In fact he didn't wan't robots doing whatever he wanted and therefor the first humans got the decision. The only thing that can  seperate us from god is sin. So in the paradise Adam and Eve had the opportunity to eat from a tree of sin. But they were stricly warned about it. Still after some time humanity fell for the temptation. And since the only thing sin leads to is death, at that moment we should have always been seperated from god. But since he loved his creation so much he spared humanity but sin have since then roamed freely in our world since. So this jesus thing. That was the most amazing gift ever. And i can't say that the bible says that you specifically have to worship and praise Jesus to be saved. I will quote **Romans 10:9** again. 

*Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.* 

You just have to believe that Jesus is lord and truly believe is was raised from the dead and that's it. So this is a second chance that humanity really didn't deserve. So god is in no way evil. We still have the choice. No one are forced into praising him. 

So the other thing i wanted to say is this. Why do i, and so many other spend hours in church, and worship and such? I can't answer for everyone but i can answer from my own and some of my friends experiences. After just taking the step and believing in the entire salvation thing, something really happens! You view the world differently and just the name of Jesus spreads this happiness through your body. So the worshipping is something i want to do since i think god is so amazing. And there is no feeling like the one when you are a big gathering just worshipping together :) 

It is possible that this wasn't even close to answering your question. I am sorry if that is the case since i didn't entirely understand what you ment. Feel free to tell me if so. "

taonzen,freemasonry,1390585707.0,"I have this idea that I'm developing, that Masonry isn't *a* fraternity; rather, it's a mashup of *several* fraternities. You've got the guys who join because it's historical, or maybe because they are following their grandfather's legacy. Then you've got the guys who are interested in the esoteric side, and for whom Masonry is a stepping stone to other things, including (God help us) possibly even the Rosicrucians. And you've got the hipster curious, who are joining because of the Nick Cage and Tom Hanks movies, along with the History Channel shows. Then there's the community service minded, who could have easily joined some other group, but did not. And you've got the ~~waffle chicken~~ pancake breakfast / fish fry guys, who simply enjoy the community and hanging out. 

[Does this remind you of anything](http://www.wordfocus.com/word-act-blindmen.html)?  There's no reason that's better or more pure than the others. Freemasonry doesn't have a mission statement. That's good in some ways, but it also makes it difficult to focus on any one aspect, so it too often happens that the spokespersons are whoever happens to be interested in speaking up. If it's the 75 year old ~~waffle chicken~~` pancake breakfast guy, then that's the video that is going to get made. "

I *do* have a question for you, though. I'm 22 and going to be getting my master's degree in social work. I have been working on myself for quite some time (have been making major life changes since 19). I want a family more than anything, and very much so will strive to be the best parent I can be once I do have children (currently single, so we're thinking probably way ahead in the future). Hypothetically, what if we met, became friends, and you fell in love with me? I'm serious. What if every aspect of my personality meshed so well with yours and we fell stupid in love and the *only* thing that you didn't ""approve"" of was the fact that I'm getting my master's degree in social work and that my career motivates the hell out of me? I want children one day. I also know that to be a good parent takes a whole lot of freakin' hard work. I don't know if it is realistic or fair to say that career-driven women are setting themselves up for an unhappy life (not to deny you a right to preference). Let's face it, nowadays *everyone* my age, including women, are getting asked ""Where did you graduate from college?"" or ""What is your major?"" and ""Which university do you go to?"" All.the.time. How is a woman expected to grow up being asked those kind of things and not feel like somewhat of a ""failure"" when she doesn't have an answer to them? There's a whole lot of pressure from that. It is a bit expected, really.

Take a previous post of mine from /r/AskWomen - I posted, ""Did you feel lost in your twenties?"" and one of the first responses I got was something along the lines of, ""This is a time in your life where a lot of things are changing... you're graduating from college, starting your career...""

rm999,IWantToLearn,1390586007.0,"This is not usually a popular opinion in intellectual circles, but I think you should question why you want to understand news, and tweak what you do based on that.

Why? [This Guardian Article](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli) (somewhat ironically) makes a great case that news is not helpful and can actually be harmful to your life and your understanding of the world. If you just try to consume large amounts of general news, no matter how objectively, I think the Guardian's arguments will be absolutely true. Knowing deeply about all the civil wars and elections and coups in the world will give you a warped, useless sense of what the world is and why it operates the way it does. 

My advice would be to pick some topics that interest or impact you, and read up on them a lot. And I mean this universally - it goes for both news and non-news; a little deep knowledge almost always trumps a lot of shallow, incorrect knowledge. Personally, I like to read up on technology news (especially the politics of intellectual property and the justice system) because it directly affects me as an engineer. I also like to read up on Indian news because I travel there a lot and have family there. I not only can directly use the news I read, I understand it deeply and without much bias. "

Ibogaine is a very powerful and very long-lasting psychedelic and dissociative drug.A 24-hour trip into the depths of your own mind can certainly ~~help~~force you to reevaluate your life choices, but this isn't a necessary effect of ingesting ibogaine. You might just have a really bad trip and come out of it traumatized and damaged as all fuck. Ibogaine is commonly described as a ""merciless"" drug. And even if it does lead you to decide to quit, it does nothing to alleviate chemical addiction. meaning you will still experience cravings and withdrawal, which can possibly lead you to relapse.

Ibogaine has some neural interactions that help to relieve (not eliminate) the cravings experienced by opiate addicts, but this is also not a gauranteed cure.

Drop_,politics,1390586240.0,"Actually, malice is not generally required in defamation law for it to be actionable.  In general, a defamation suit has to only show four things: that the statement was ""published"" to at least one other person, that it was wrong, that it caused harm, and there was fault on the person who made the statement (generally negligence or maliciousness). 

Malice is added on as an additional element, when the defamed individual is a ""public figure"" which the scientist in this case may be considered.

the_ilz_have_eyes,technology,1390586291.0,"How about in-person networking? That has served me very well in my career as I don't use LinkedIn. It's much more meaningful and memorable, especially considering that LinkedIn is notably becoming more about recruitment and less about networking.

I'm also not the first person who hasn't liked LinkedIn, so it's not like that concept is preposterous, Sarcassafras. 

LinkedIn bills itself as a networking site even though it's now focused primarily on helping recruiters. But it advertises that it will take job hunters away from rec cons even though that's not true. They spam peoples' inboxes, and instead of that e-mail coming from LinkedIn *they send it from you personal email address*. More and more they're making it pay to use. Want to contact this person? You can if you pay! 

[They have shady business practices and poor security](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/218034/linkedin-accused-of-tricking-users-with-cryptic-d.html)

[They don't allow much control over your profile and how it interacts with your network](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2014/01/21/how-linkedin-is-thwarting-your-job-search/)

If you google LinkedIn endorsements you can find out exactly why that's a completely useless feature.

[""Pay now to move your application to the top of the list!""](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/businessdesk/2013/08/ask-the-headhunter-is-linkedin.html)

[They're basically like Monster.com and CareerBuilder now which are proven to be shady and ineffective at best](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2013/09/03/has-linkedin-crossed-an-ethical-line/)

LinkedIn is a business first. It's not all sunshine and roses and wonderful jobs, and it's definitely not better than just being proactive about in-person networking. To each their own. I don't have a profile there anymore because they didn't offer enough security, control over my profile or the e-mails that were sent out regarding my profile, endorsements are useless, and I thought the ""pay-for"" features were ridiculous.

I bang my stick on the ice and call for it as he picks it up against the boards, he looks up, sees me, puts it through the defenseman right onto my stick, I'm at about the top of the circle, and for all intents and purposes, have a breakaway - no way the defenseman is getting out of the corner in time to intercept me.

Their goalie was terrible, she (co-ed program) kind of went to one side, leaving the other side of the net wide open, so I just threw it in.

It wasn't fancy or anything, but I'll remember that goal forever.  I was 26, so finally getting into the game was a pretty big deal.

DCDVath,wow,1390586392.0,"I never said to ignore it. But you don't have to be mean to the person who messed up either. When I led raids, I found positive reinforcement way more productive than negative. You ask them what happened. They say it in front of everyone (embarrassing enough), and then you address the whole team to make sure everyone knows to watch out for that next time (don't single out anyone). If the person does it again, then you whisper them and ask if maybe there is something that is messing them up during that phase to try and pinpoint where the issue is originating. If they continue doing it after that, well then you have a problem with the raider.

Someone screwing it up once and then doing fine the rest of the night should not be ridiculed for one mistake. That just puts everyone on edge and demoralizes the person who made the mistake. Which will cause them to start doing worse. Which leads to more mistakes. Which leads to more wipes. Which leads to unhappy raiders. Not a good way to run a raid.

As a Raid Leader, your raiders should look up to you. You need to motivate them, assist them whenever possible, and go above and beyond to make each encounter a success. It's not just about knowing the fights and calling shots. It's about knowing how to work with each individual raider in order for them to produce their maximum output for the raid."

BeachBumHarmony,fatpeoplestories,1390586406.0,"I think this is my F2F story:

It was a combination of things. I've always been overweight. I had met him when I was on weight watchers (started September 2011) my senior year of college (around October of 2011). I stopped going to weight watchers once finals started (December 2011). My lowest weight while on WW was 164 lbs. 

Together, we put on the relationship chub. We would eat out a lot. I stopped weighing myself. We had a big fight on Valentines Day 2013. He didn't bring it up in the best way, but he pretty much said: ""You got fat. I got fat. We got fat. And I don't like it."" I cried. I cried a lot. He didn't bring it up again. 

That alone wasn't enough to motivate me. We went to his Fraternity's formal May 2013 (as recent alum) and everyone of course posted pictures on facebook. I looked fat in every photo. I hated every photo. I was the biggest of the girlfriends by far. That's kicked me in the feels. 

My coworker had been talking about Isagenix, so I decided to try it. It's a 30 day nutritional cleanse. It's rather expensive, but in my mind, I had spent so much, I was going to do my best to follow it strictly. 

The weekend before I started, my college friend came over. She had dropped about 40 lbs herself. In my mind, I though, ""Well, if she can do it, so can I.""

I finally stepped on a scale and took all my measurements. I weighed more than when I started weight watchers (187.6 lbs) and my BMI was obese. I told myself I would never see that number again. The 30 day cleanse was hard. It was very strict, but it did change my eating habits. I couldn't drink soda at all. I learned to cook clean. I drank a lot of water. And I lost 15 lbs that first month. If it wasn't as expensive and restrictive, I would have kept going with Isagenix... but I knew I couldn't keep that up. I switched to straight calorie counting and exercise, setting little goals along the way.

The first one was to get to my Weight Watchers weight. The next was to get to a healthy BMI. My next one is to be at 45 total lbs lost. I look at it 5 lbs at a time. 

As I started to lose, I have noticed how different my boyfriend acts around. He'll slap and grab my ass more. He'll pull me into bed more. He has a grin when he sees me working out in yoga shorts. He's told me how proud he is. 

He's also lost some weight too, but he's less verbal about it than I am. 

Overall, it has to be a decision your girlfriend makes. My Mom pestered me for years about losing weight, and it never stuck. Now, I'm 24 and am super determined. Once I hit goal, I'm awarding myself with my first tattoo. "

s54b32dd,investing,1390586463.0,"More specifically, there was a perception of vote gaming going on, and the discussion of ""power users"" who were able to make popular posts; this essentially gamed the most popular submissions, and some users apparently tried to monetize their own contributions, using the logic that some ""power users"" would be able to get multiple Diggs (the equivalent of upvotes) simply by the nature of their popularity (people would vote their friends' submissions up in the expectation of a return favor; a ""vote for a vote"" as it were).

Whether or not these accusations were true, the idea that popular content is no longer the will of the majority of users meant that the ""user driven"" piece of the puzzle was no longer being driven by individual, casual users meant the user base/""will of the majority"" was no longer being met, in favor of the potential for paid-for submissions.

I've had obnoxious drunk girls approach me when I used to go to bars and it's extremely difficult to just ""talk"" your way out of (even if you're just trying to act cool and treat her like a brat). It's better just to ignore them as much as possible or leave. No good comes of it if there are white knights around. 

There's no script you can play. None of the other guys care what game you're playing (""amused mastery"" or not) and she's too drunk.

If you get physical at all, even if it's to push her away, you put yourself at risk with white knights. 

I originally wanted to joke and post something silly like, *""Easy. Just be stronger than all the white knights. BOOM.""* Then I remembered that I am pretty confident in myself physically and still wouldn't want to get myself involved with some drunk, macho, cowardly white knights. 

Check this out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giklG51wNyk

Some gay guy gets harassed by a drunk girl (video cuts that short so we don't see how frequent). Guy tells her to stay away from him and leaves. She approaches him again, only this time the confrontation ends with her hitting or reaching for his groin, and also grabbing his shirt. He tries to get her to release, but ends up kicking her away. While he's walking away, a white knight sucker punches him.

Whether the kick goes overboard or not, he was defending himself and disengaging from the situation. He gets sucker punched after the ordeal. That's vengeance/punishment, not prevention. White knights, especially ones who are drunk, are not thinking rationally and they are cowardly. So you're not getting a fair fight. This guy is lucky it was just one guy who attacked him and not multiple guys bum rushing him. He's lucky to get away with just a damaged face, bruised ego, and a biased youtube video (titled to make it seem like *he* was the one who had too many drinks) from a moronic poster and a bunch of commenters declaring how much they hate gays.

It seems stupid and unfair, whatever. IMO it's better just to avoid the situation and avoid getting physical at all. You might think you can control the situation with minimal non-threatening physical force, but white knights might not perceive it that way and they are not rational. They are drunk/buzzed, looking for an excuse to be macho, and the slightest action on your part against a girl even in self-defense could ""excuse"" cowardly retaliation on their part (sucker punch, bottle, whatever).

BinghamL,snakes,1390586615.0,"My first, current, and only snake is a red tail boa. The two things that I just had issues with were figuring out a reasonably priced feeding option, and getting her a new enclosure. She is over 7ft now so finding those things are much more difficult as the market tends to be more 6ft and smaller friendly. Plus humidity/temps are much harder to keep in larger enclosures. It's not impossible, just be sure you can afford that gear when the time comes. Please keep this in mind as this is the point many people give up their snake which isn't fair to the snake, the owner knew it would get that big.

Keep in mind I've only had this one snake, but I think temperament is directly related to how often you hold them. I held my snake for an hour+ 5 days a week when she as young. I still hold her about 2x a week. When they get big it's not as easy to just hang out with her on your fingers/arm/shoulders. She's heavy and straight up uncomfortable sometimes. Not to mention it's a good idea to have a second person nearby, just in case.

 She's been a great eater 95% of the time. When she was about a year old there were a couple months she wouldn't eat anything f/t and I had to go to live for a bit. Thankfully I was able to ween her off live, back to f/t. I have a feeling that feeding f/t reduces likelihood of being bit as well. She used to strike her f/t, but now she just comes up and grabs it with her mouth slowly and starts to eat it. 

She has been to the vet twice due to injuries (I wasn't present during either injury, but did get her to the vet asap) and has healed wonderfully. She is very tolerant of new people holding her. I show them how but sometimes they're shaky or tense and it doesn't bother her. 

She is puppy dog tame. Loves being out of her cage and doesn't mind how many people are around and moving either. She has only bit one time (my gf at the time) and it was 100% our fault. It was during feeding and without thinking my gf put her hands in the cage and tried to move my snake. Other than that she has almost always been welcoming to attention. I can count on one hand the number of times I thought it best to leave her in the cage, and she gave me plenty of warning.

I'm rambling. This is the long version of me saying rtb's are awesome. I think it has been a great first snake for me, and could very well be the same for others.

 Just realize any snake is a commitment. I can't speak for other types of snakes on this part but if you're getting an rtb, you're looking at a 20+ yr commitment (in your 20s? You'll be over 40, maybe even 50 when this snake dies!) And you will spend thousands of dollars to house and care for this snake properly. If you think you can get through the majority of it's growing period without spending a couple grand, don't get this snake."
Drop_,politics,1390586617.0,"A lawyer could try anything, but it would be very hard to argue similar to false advertising with respect to inaccurate reporting of scientific findings.   False advertising is specifically regulated because of advertising's nature and propensity to induce commercial transactions. 

Defamation is the more appropriate action in a case like this.  But in general, merely being wrong as a media outlet isn't actionable because what is being reported on is generally a public figure.  And to prove defamation involving a public figure, actual malice is required as an element as well.

Lasreaine,dogecoin,1390586652.0,"For people who are having trouble seeing why others see graffiti as a bad thing, you have to think of the city and Dogecoin as a brand name.

Cities spend thousands of dollars and man hours yearly [cleaning up graffiti](http://www.cbipr.com/client-news/graffiti-is-bad-for-business/). You may think it is cute and harmless, but it does actually harm a community unless it is done as in art piece, with permission. Want to paint a doge mural on a wall? Ask the business owner. Want to put something in a park? Ask the local government.

Dogecoin is a brand now. If you want to be taken seriously and regarded a legitimate currency where you can buy things, and be accepted at shops, graffiti will hurt the cause. It makes the community look similar to a bunch of kids drawing on a bathroom stall, and will make businesses less likely to accept the coin. The gas station guy is an anomaly. Most business owners are very upset when someone defaces their hard-earned property, especially when it takes time and money to fix.  

TL/DR: Damage to other people's property is disrespectful. Get permission or don't do it. City land is not your property, it belongs to the city/community and not everyone wants a Doge on things.

I would comment on spelunky and smite, but because I couldn't get the videos to load for some unknown reason, I'll just give you some feedback based off of my observations of Civ 5:

* Make sure you never just assume your audience knows what you're doing, especially in a strategy game. Strategy games require lots of thinking, and each playthrough is different because of the choices you make. Don't assume your audience is stupid, but also make sure that you get across your plan of action and why.
* Stay lively! Your commentary at times is unsure and quiet. Don't stop talking because you don't know what to say, just speak your thoughts. Pauses are ok every now and then, but make sure they are neither frequent nor long. 
* I've noticed that your videos are consistently around 20-30 minutes long. This may work for shorter, more action packed series, but ideally you would want about a 15 minute video, as viewers are more likely to sit and watch 15 minutes than waste their time with a half hour long video. It's also beneficial to you because it allows you to have more videos based off of less footage, meaning it will be much easier to maintain a consistent upload schedule.
* Finally, liven up your thumbnails a bit. I won't judge your profile pic and banner, but your thumbnails seem to be very generic and hard to see. Make the text a bit more visible and try to make them pop a bit more, you know?

Alrighty, that's all I can think of. You're off to a great start, just work at what you can and always focus on improving yourself. Good luck!"
aznsk8s87,guns,1390586671.0,"Take a class. Depending on where you are in the midwest, there may be a lot of people who shoot who would be willing to teach you. In my state (UT) it's very gun friendly. You could either ask your LGS for directions or try to contact the NRA and see what's available in your state.

I got into guns by doing airsoft. We took safety very seriously - always had eyepro on unless in the safe zone. Before entering the safe zone, empty chambers, magazines out, safety on. Then, I got into shooting in college."
Slukaj,Purdue,1390586672.0,"Well the first thing I should clear up is that you think I'm somehow against the use of cannabis recreationally. I'm not, never have been, 100% support the legalization of it. At the same time, however, I am also pro-common sense. 

If you don't want to get in trouble for doing something, *don't do it.* If you disagree with getting in trouble for something, change the law *but continue not doing it until the law is changed*. 

&gt; Was the alert of a possible shooting on Purdue Villiage relevant?

Yes, because of it's proximity to the University. A joint isn't going to magically walk itself over onto campus and trick some kid into smoking it. A guy with a gun can absolutely walk the 500 feet to campus.

&gt; Once again, what does that have to do with this post? All the OP is doing is notifying students of purdue to become proactive in the legal process and contact their representative. I saw nothing the OP said about legalizing it on campus or allowing it on the dorms.

ruvb00m,WTF,1390586676.0,"According to my maternal nursing textbook (Lowdermilk, 2012, p. 958), a 'fetus' is ""a child in utero from approximately the eighth week after conception *until birth*.""

Since 'baby' is not a medical term, I looked it up on dictionary.com, which says:

1. an infant or very young child.
2. a newborn or very young animal.
3. the youngest member of a family, group, etc.
4. an immature or childish person.
5. a human fetus.

Therefore, both are correct in this situation.

It's the first of an amazing fantasy trilogy, really dark and violent but also very humorous with a very original premise behind it.

If you're looking for something more complex, I say go for the Malazan series.  I just finished the first book and was really blown away by it.  It's got a bit of a steep learning curve when you start into it, but things start to make sense as you continue to read and it really hooks you in with a great story.  "

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1390586690.0,"Personally, here's how I'd divide the profits:

1) Dad gets back his down-payment plus all principal paydown (e.g. purchase price was $120k, current loan value is $100k, he gets $20k).  He has now had all the money he put into the deal returned to him.

2) Split remaining profit 3 ways.

Legally, your dad is probably not entitled to anything.  Don't take it to court, that is just stupid.  Your dad provided the funding for the deal, he deserves to get his money back, and to receive a share of the profits.  You and your mom acted as partners and provided credit for the deal, so both of you deserve a share of the profits.  Since you didn't agree to anything up front, and even split is the fairest way to handle it.  If there is a next time, think like an investor.  Know your exit strategy in advance, and determine up front how to split the proceeds.  

Hope that helps."

It *looks* like there are five or six floors involved, but it's really only three of varying heights.  I just use staircases to lower some rooms and leave others as tall as they are.  It's something I've been experimenting with since I watched some of the videos from The Sim Supply Sims 3 101 tutorials, with specific regard to the constrainfloorelevation cheat.

As I said, I am not done and have not tested this at all.  But if you don't have another option it might be worth a shot.  Here's what I would suggest since you've already built and you want to be rid of that hill: use the *constrainfloorelevation false* cheat and just level the lot.  Make the hill smaller if you want or make it totally flat, it won't matter - the walls of your first floor should still be on the ground but much, much taller.

It's not irrelevant to the conversation because it demonstrates that your claim was false.

&gt;Actually, it's the complexity of the issue that makes it impossible to immediately, easily say ""Yes, this specific political policy accomplished this thing,"" rather than, say, an economic cycle, a new technology, or even a different political policy. You're the one simplifying things, and demonstrating immense ignorance about concepts as basic (well, okay. As undergrad-college-level) as noise in a data sample.

Who said anything about immediately being able to analyze the effects of all of Obama's policies?  Straw man.

&gt;My actual point is that you aren't actually looking for evidence honestly

That's two straw-mans in one post you've made. I am asking for evidence that any of his policies have slowed or reversed the growing wealth gap. That's the entire point of this conversation.  

&gt;because even if you were wrong, what you're looking for wouldn't exist. 

Unless you've got a source to back up that claim, that's just a baseless assertion and you don't know that the evidence doesn't exist.

&gt;You're not interested in challenging your belief and so it should be made clear that engaging you is a waste of time.

Between the 2 local pizza huts, we continued to use the same photo everytime we were hungry and at lunch at work. We always got a free large pie, buffalo wings and bread sticks, and they would offer to throw in a free 2 liter for their mistakes.

It took about  1 year for them to catch on, and one day the manager had a fit. They said they had a stack sky high of the same damn picture and they were loosing all these pizzas. I guess they printed out the photos and attached them to a log in teh book for when free food went out so they can explain why. We had our own binder, filled with photos and orders compensations.  He told us to fuck off and try to go scam someone else. He wasnt aware it went on for a year, he just thought it was a couple of months.

It's correct to say that you're not choosing one belief over another, because they're false. It's not like you're choosing a personal religion which has the passive effect of denouncing others in favor of your belief. You think they're all false. That is offensive to the religious. It's why they hate us. The bumper sticker is less offensive than your existence.

If you find this bumper sticker more provocative than any religious bumper sticker as an atheist, then you should probably reexamine why.

No person or group of people is insulted. It doesn't say that Christians or Buddhists are delusional. Nobody is blamed, condemned, or belittled. Your denial of their religion is the offense.

Your most basic religious belief (the lack of one) is what offends them, not the word ""fiction."" The more common we make atheists by making them visible, the less poorly we will be treated in public. It's not your responsibility to put your atheism on display, but I really wish you would."

rocky8u,pics,1390587010.0,"I think a lot of ancient ""warrior"" type training was focused on individual combat skills. ""How to defeat an enemy warrior"" was seen as more important than ""how to defeat the enemy army"". The civilizations that are usually considered better than their foes often had better unit and force sized training. A good example is the way the Greeks fought against the Persians during the Graeco-Persian wars. Greek military tactics usually focused on [phalanxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx) of [heavily armored infantry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoplite) who would usually march towards the enemy rather than charging. Much of it focused on maintaining a solid shield wall so that your shield protected you and your neighbor from enemy weapons.

The Spartans were usually considered the best at this, as they trained year-round rather than a having a training period once a year. These tactics were perfect for a place like Thermopylae, where there was no clear way to flank a forward facing shield wall. This, and good discipline explains why the 1000 Greeks that slowed the Persians at Thermopylae did so well against their enemy, which were mostly conscripts with little training. 300 did not depict this at all, as it focused on the individual combat of the super-ripped Spartans. In reality not was a shield wall of heavily armored hoplites that held the line, not bare chested macho-men swinging swords and stabbing dudes  out in the open.

Roman were improvements on several types of unit level tactics that emphasized unit and force discipline and training over individual martial skill. Their weapons and equipment reflected this. A tower shield like the ones the Roman Legionaries used (or the Ukranian Police) are better for a shield wall or [testudo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testudo_formation) then they are for individual combat. As they are bulky and heavy. The Romans used a sword known as the [gladius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladius) which was ideal for stabbing through a shield wall. Their tactics were a  good deal more adaptable than the phalanxes that the Greeks used, which explains why the Romans did not usually use phalanxes unless conditions were ideal for them."

kyrpa,Fitness,1390587148.0,"&gt; Should I just focus on losing the weight first with diet and 90% cardio?

You can certainly continue to strength train. Lifting heavy things repeatedly burns a lot of calories, and will help maintain that caloric deficit you're creating by eating less. You won't gain as much strength as you would during a bulking phase, but as a beginner, you should still see some strength gains at first.

&gt; With trying to lose weight, is it as simple as calorie deficit? How does that play a role in trying to get stronger?

Yep.  Once you're at a weight / bodyfat % you like, and want to start seriously increasing strength and/or muscle mass, flip the thinking and eat over your TDEE. By then, though, your TDEE will have dropped quite a bit from where it is now, be sure to recalculate as the pounds drop off.

It's understandable that you've reacted the way that you have, but now that you realize that you don't have to think that way anymore, just work on making the changes.  Don't worry about blame or whose fault it is/was, just accept the fact that you may have done things you don't need to do, such as questioning him unnecessarily, and then work on the fix.  Try to stay positive and keep pushing forward.  What happened is in the past, just worry about what you do as you move forward.

And yeah, that's tough - but if you sheltered yourself to the point of not leaving any of your own happiness up to chance, then you wouldn't ever be able to leave your house or form any relationships.  Sometimes, it's nice to jump in - I think people can really surprise you if you let them."

First, reddit defines itself by how it's different from the rest of the world. So there has to be a rest of the world with which to compare. Second, reddit is constantly in conflict with itself. There's really no compromise between the MRA's and the SRSers, or the anarchist and everyone else. Taking over through political means (mass voting, for example) simply wouldn't be an option because we would never agree on a candidate. Third, reddit doesn't have the equipment necessary. A couple of subs worth of people would, but everyone else would do pretty poorly. Very few people have any training of any kind, but everyone would pretend to be experts.

Reddit's main strength is in its numbers, but if you look at how we spread out geographically you'll see that we don't really have any kind of numerical advantage per city/country/whatever in which we live.

Also, redditors are lazy as fuck. Almost no one would actually want to go outside and do anything, and the moment it gets above eighty or below forty everyone would just go back inside.

From the video;

""I don't say there aren't equity issues, but overall I think the **major issues** for reasonable feminism are in other parts of the world. In the united states, feminism has been a great success story."" 

And I think she is proposing that gender-feminists consider that the differences of interest are possibly innate. Like some studies that present data indicating that in more 'egalitarian' nations gender behavioral differences are more pronounced than in developing countries.

&gt;In a 2008 study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, a group of international researchers compared data on gender and personality across 55 nations. Throughout the world, women tend to be more nurturing, risk averse and emotionally expressive, while men are usually more competitive, risk taking, and emotionally flat. But the most fascinating finding is this: Personality differences between men and women are the largest and most robust in the more prosperous, egalitarian, and educated societies.

She would be able to read your letter and thoughts on her own time, and it would allow her to process them instead of just reacting. Tell her that this conversation MUST happen in order to continue on with the relationship. It's gonna be difficult, but the more time that passes will only make it that much more difficult. If she's really the amazing, wonderful woman that you love, she will see that this is important to you and will want to address this, as hard as it may be.

wordserious,AskReddit,1390587611.0,"I.T. hiring manager here. Here's what I do:

1. Look for key points. This depends on the position, for example: check that resume has required education, experience, and buzzwords (i.e. ITIL, Java, virtualization, whatever). Throw away those that do not comply.

2. Read remaining resumes. Discard immediately those with spelling and grammar errors. Communication is a must in any job and being able to write correct English is decisive.

3. Read remaining resumes. See if the buzzwords appear connected with descriptions of real world use. If you list ""scripting"" in your highlights, I want to be able to see something like ""automated performance reports using Perl/Power Shell."" This gets rid of a lot of bullshit.

4. By now there are not a lot of remaining resumes. Read the remaining ones very carefully, making a professional and personal judgement and ranking the candidates accordingly.

5. Call the top 3 or 4 for interviews and call them on on what they say on their resumes. ""So tell be about the time when you used Power Shell to automate performance reports."" This definitely kills any remaining bullshit.

6. Call remaining candidates to the real interviews.

howlinatthemoon,GlobalOffensive,1390587631.0,"I love train, train's mah jam. The only reason I don't play it too much is cus the queue's are pretty long for it.

The main thing on train is that you can rarely get shit done just by yourself (imo). Unless you're holding a choke point as a CT of course. As a T your pushes have to be coordinated, smokes play an integral part, as do coordinated pushes. For example if you have a player with a good spawn (closest to t connector / z connector, whatever you call it) and he's good with an AWP - make him challenge the ivy/last track AWP/player on the ct's. Even if he can just stall him this creates an opening for the people trying to push alley to ivy.

It gets hard when you try to go just for picks and slow play as a T. From my experience aggressive pushes work the best. Just smoke the most important areas and then try to run over the few people covering the other areas. Sometimes you can just rush out of z-connector and pop a few headshots on to A site - and that's how you get it done.

Just play a lot of train man, embrace it. And then analyze what you think it is you're doing wrong/right."

The US and UK scientists aren't saying that preferences are wholly or largely determined by sex. Their argument is limited to stating that there's a degree of innate biological influence on the behaviour of men and women. 

The extent to which this is true has been a matter of a protracted scientific debate (diving into the literature will reveal a bunch of passive-aggressive sniping between notable and not-so-notable researchers with different agendas) for years, but it's a much more reasonable position than the view the opposition espouses, which is to completely discount any effects that sex and the associated hormonal differences might have on cognition."

nickgreen90,letsplay,1390587861.0,"Oh man, your channel artwork brings back some memories for me. I can tell on your banner that you're using Paint.NET, and specifically you're using wide latin font as well as a plugin that allows you to do outlines, right? I used to use that as well. Here's my advice on the art: go ahead and either buy or torrent Photoshop or adobe illustrator. Trust me, it will go a long ways in making your channel look more professional. As for learning how to use either or both, start out by mucking around in the program and making a simple design. Google/youtube anything you don't know how to do.

Your profile picture looks good, but the fact that it's a photograph of a drawing doesn't make it stand out. Work on digitizing it in Photoshop by tracing the lines with the pen tool and stroking. Possibly also add color, but that's up to you and what you think looks good.

Now that the art review is out of the way (I'm studying to be a graphic designer if you can't tell :D ), your commentary is actually pretty good. I'm not sure as to whether you're just starting out, but it seems like you have some experience, which is good. If people think you're already somewhat established, they are more likely to watch.
Here are some things you're going to want to work on:

* At the start of the video, you are commentating on the opening cutscene. While it is entirely up to you whether or not you want to talk over these, the volume of the game seems to make the decision that it wants to be heard. In the future, either lower the volume of the game so that this is never a problem or work on separating your game audio and mic audio
* As I said before, your commentary is great. However, you frequently mumble, and at times you seem to be avoiding getting any louder whatsoever. Try to speak very clearly. It's important that the viewer hears and understands you. Don't worry about getting too loud for the microphone, as long as you don't yell or scream, it should mostly be fine. 
* DO avoid making fart noises or coughing into the mic. It messes with the mic and comes out waaaaay louder than you'd think it would. A pop filter would help correct this problem, as well as a condenser mic, but until then, just avoid make noises with your mouth.

That's about it! Sorry if I've over assumed about your artwork method, I'm really curious if I got about half of that right tho! :) No comments on thumbnails, intros, or outros from me, I'm not in the mood to review those right now. Hope this helps!"
SnidleyWhiplash,hiphopheads,1390587862.0,"I like this album quite a bit. It is the first project of Theophilus' that I have checked out. There is a lot of indie influence a la Phoenix, so it is really something good to chill to and has a lot musically going on. That '80s sound revival in indie. Not a whole lot of leaning on drums for the quality of the beat. But it isn't just like he spit over indie the whole time. Lighthouse has some sick drums on it that really drive it and the line ""She got drunk showed her pussy on WorldStar"" is funny as hell.

That isn't to say I liked the whole thing. I Stand Alone demonstrated the whackest elements. The Fall Out Boy-esque background wailing chorus and bridge were melodramatic and his flow on the verses just made me think of Jeezy on My President is Black. Jeezy has some good flows but trying to sing isn't one of them. 

Overall it is an interesting place to be- between indie and rap, but the execution varies track to track.

IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,relationships,1390587862.0,"So he's injecting HCG but not changing his lifestyle at all? He isn't going to lose anything. 

What he needs is a dose of reality. HCG is expensive. And the fad surrounding it is just that: a fad. There *are* valid reasons to take HCG that I won't get into here. Regardless, the facts you presented are as follows. Not trying to be overly harsh:

* Your boyfriend is lazy.

* Your boyfriend is already overweight.

* Your boyfriend east poorly.

* Your boyfriend is unemployed.

* Your boyfriend is under-educated about what to expect from HCG and probably about health, fitness, and weight loss in general. 

Here's what I would do: Strongly suggest that he spend his HCG money on a personal trainer and/or nutritionist instead. Show him evidence of the futility of HCG, *especially* considering that he hasn't made any other lifestyle changes. This is easy to find online.

He needs a lifestyle change, not a miracle drug. If you can't get him to understand this even after presenting examples, then he's just dumb. That, or he's so lazy that he's in denial about the situation, and the HCG injections are just another way for him to ""do something about it"" without actually doing anything."
mrpoopistan,solotravel,1390587864.0,"&gt; see the cities highlights

No . . . just, no. City highlights should not be seen. At all. I mean, if you see the Eiffel Tower from the Seine, fine. It's there, it's part of the skyline, OK. If you actually go up into it? No, just don't.

A city should be seen solo and drunk at 1am, with an emphasis on speaking with random locals until someone invites you to a VIP event with a small cluster of pretty girls available. When I did Paris, I spent three whole days on just one old, hole-in-the-wall bar that I fell in love with.

I state this because I believe its integral to living a better life: fewer cities and longer stays are the way to go. A city must be soaked in. Absorbed. Incorporated into your DNA. Travel for the sake of seeing cities and checking them off your list is a lesser form of travel. Travel should be about new people and lots of time.

kicker7955,europe,1390587881.0,"I don't want to say I have a unique perspective, but it's different.

In romania liberalism is inexistent, any political front in fact is non-existent(the labels are there but they mean nothing), but we matured culturally very much in the last 20 years despite this. And I think this type of open dialog without shame between people of different views  without moral highgrounds is more beneficial  and transformative than censorship for the sake of not offending.

2 personal experiences to support this:

last year I was talking to a taxi driver about marriage and so on and the subject of gay marriage came up, I presented my case, he automatically assumed I'm gay(cause why would I care about faggots otherwise) and I encouraged him, the second he saw I don't have 3 horns and i don't have a 5 year old as a slave his perspective changed, seeing this I reiterated his earlier complaints about being married, and I asked why he thinks gay people don't have gelous, possessive or abusive partners, the expression on his face was priceless. Yes there was a chance he could have beaten me up, and in some heated moments, I really taught that was a possibility, but it was a saturday and I really didn't have anything planned.

Another taxi driver was once going on a tirade about how horrible Muslim immigrants are(and they really are, think arrogant spoiled rich kids with disposable income and not a care in the world) at tipping, and I argued that tipping isn't a world wide habit, and hassling is quite common in the middle east, his point was that In romania you behave like Romanians, then I asked him if he knows how to behave in a muslim country, he deflected but finally admitted that he would find it difficult, I then closed by pointing our that he has 20+ years of live experience on those kids and his judgement was misguided(although as I mentioned most are douchebags)

In a ""modern liberal"" country true dialog is nonexistent, because you are denying the possibility to express your ideas(banning nazi symbolism or just by making it acceptable to shame them into submission) if you are on the ""traditionalist side"". Speech can hurt I agree, but by silencing that speech we are imposing different standards and freedoms based on beliefs and that is no different that the anti gay propaganda laws in russia. Of course we don't have neo-nazis torturing and humiliating conservative adolescents  but the political principle is the same."

Czar-Salesman,WTF,1390587896.0,"You absolutely missed my point. You also have the wrong idea on a few things. 

You should never carry a gun unless you are willing to use lethal force to stop an attack. When you pull your gun you have indicated intent to use lethal force, you never brandish a gun as intimidation. If you do brandish and aren't willing to use it hoping they will just leave you alone they may be willing to use lethal force. You never brandish a gun, the only time you pull it is when you are going to shoot someone. You also shoot to kill, I never meant you chase someone and gun them down. Its intent. If you pull your gun never try to wing him, don't shoot his arm, don't try to wound him in anyway, you aim for the head/chest. If you miss just hope it was enough to stop the attack either by wound or scaring the attacker. Say someone breaks into your house, you pull a shot gun but you aren't hip on killing for protection so you shoot his knee out. This is improper use of a weapon and not standard firearm self defense. This doesn't mean if you wound you then follow up with a head shot while he is laying there. It means your intent and aim is to use lethal force and that is the only time a gun should be drawn. My original comment was about you need to aim to kill per standard firearm self-defense, and hope that you do kill rather than cause permanent damage due to the possibility of having a suit filed against you, that is more of a secondary thing, not the primary reason to shoot to kill.

**Shared Doors**

* You can now set a passcode on a door and share it with other people.
* Once they’ve entered the passcode they can open and close the door until you change it.
* This also works on gates.
* In addition, you can set a door to be unlocked so anyone can use it without a passcode.

[*Image of Doors*](http://playrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shareddoors_demo.jpg)

**Grass Improvements**

* Grass runs twice as fast as it used to
* Grass looks way better
* Grass shouldn’t flicker on ATI cards anymore (but let us know if it does)
* Grass has improved sound effects

[*Image of New Grass*](http://playrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/newgrass_demo.jpg)

**Beds &amp; Bags**

* Sleeping bags now reset the use timers of all your other sleeping bags in a 100m radius. This prevents base “zerging”
* Beds were added! – These can only be placed inside a house with a roof and act like the old sleeping bags did

[*Image of Beds*](http://playrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bed_demo.jpg)

**Other changes and fixes**

* added vsync option
* rcon now receives msgid 4 containing all console output
* opening boxes no longer resets decay – old things should actually disappear now
* added hud indication so you know when you’re voice chatting
* fixed exploit where mouse sensitivity reduced weapon sway
* added a delay to repairing objects after they have been damaged
* metal structures now need metal to repair instead of wood
* fixed random headshot sound that would happen when shooting near the top of inanimate objects
* camp fire particles are no longer visible at long range (should help with performance)
* you can only repair something 5 seconds after it last took damage

*Atrium Carceri*, the artist who made the initial music we had in the very very early alpha is a pretty cool guy. When we started selling rust we decided to remove his music because we hadn’t worked anything out with him. But recently we talked to him and he decided to make a few tracks inspired by rust as a demo. We’ve put them in game and will listen to the feedback, if you guys like it we will get him to do more!

It's covered by a law called FLSA - Fair Labor Standards Act. This is the thing that stopped child labor and set 8 hour work days, back in the 30s. 

If you look at [this lawyer's website](http://www.flsa.com/computer.html), you'll see this: 

&gt; There are, in addition, some special rules which apply to employees who work with computers and permit them to be classified as exempt even if they don't meet the usual requirements for exempt executives or administrators. However, there are special provisions which exempt some computer employees who might not otherwise qualify as ""professionally"" exempt. These include systems analysts, programmers (who ""write code""), or software engineers. More specifically, the special computer employee exemption applies to workers who apply systems analysis techniques and procedures to determine hardware, software, or system functional specifications, or who design, develop, test or modify computer systems or programs based on user or design specifications.

Basically, they added a special rule for programmers so that they could be paid salary instead of hourly. This comes from the government: 

&gt; However, Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay for 
employees employed as bona fide executive, administrative, professional and outside sales employees. Section 
13(a)(1) and Section 13(a)(17) also exempt certain computer employees.

zeoranger,AskReddit,1390588013.0,"&gt; The alternative of not existing does sound pretty bad in comparison to life.

On the other hand, not existing also means not having conscience of oneself, so it wouldn't really be bad. Because you wouldn't feel bad about it, you wouldn't feel anything.

I thinking the alternative to not existing sound depressing because we like existing, we have things that we enjoy and we can't imagine be without it. But that's the beauty of death. When you are dead, nothing else matters, because your conscience is gone.

animuseternal,writing,1390588086.0,"Walk around in any American city? Racism is very subversive. It's about *institutional* disenfranchisement of a people. Most people, especially when you enjoy the privileges of being in the majority, are unaware of the racist structures that maintain and reinforce systemic oppression. Most people perpetuate racism by simply not thinking about it and not being mindful of privilege/lack thereof in the world around them.

Something that affects me personally as an Asian-American born in Texas: when people ask me where I am ""from"" when they mean to ask what ethnic heritage I am descended from. Asking the question itself reveals a very subtle racism: it suggests that a person's concept of what is American is conflated with what is white. It suggests that no Asian can ever be a true American (despite certain Chinese-descended families living in America for seven or more generations and pre-dating the Civil War). The only thing I know about culture is American, but the question itself reeks of a *You are an outsider* mentality. And some people think asking what my ""nationality"" is or where my parents come from makes it less racist, but.. no, it's the same thing.

Here's a sample conversation that occurs a few times a month:

&gt; White Dude: So what nationality are you?

&gt; Me: I was born in Texas.

&gt; White Dude: Yeah, but I mean, what kind of Asian are you?

&gt; Me: (my serious answer would be, ""The American kind"", but at this point I'm normally fairly annoyed and just 
play along) ...Vietnamese.

&gt; White Dude: Oh! I *love* Vietnamese food. Have you tried (random local Vietnamese restaurant)?

If we just reverse the roles here, I think it's easier to see how dehumanizing this is:

&gt; Me: So what kind of white dude are you?

&gt; White Dude: ..uh.. well.. Part of my family is English, I guess?

&gt; Me: Oh, dude, I *love* fish and chips.

So my suggestion would be: have this character interact with someone of a different race. Have this character ask this other person where they come from. And then talk about the food of that culture, because that's all this character can think of as a way to connect with this other person, which should be a great and blaring signal that your character still perceives these others as something *other* than what he is personally."

He consented to getting shitfaced, he consented to paying money to the girl and he consented to having sex with her. If she turns out to be a guy then he'll hopefully be less shitfaced and less naive the next time.

&gt; Can a girl sending money home to support her buffalo at the behest of her family really be said to have consented?

This seems more strategic than anything, and it seems like NR may anticipate throwing Steyn under the bus.

I suppose this could feed into yours, especially the temporary aspect, as a strike expiring is kinda encouraging good behaviour. Also being issued in the reddit generated PM the duration of the strike/ban.

The strikes before an actual ban is automatically issued/escalated to, would be customisable in subreddit settings. The issuing of the strike being a button next to remove or approve would also make it really quick for large subs.

You are afraid of loneliness, and you need to address that first before you can open up to the poly thing. It's cowardly to be afraid of loneliness. Not a virtue to strive for. Once a woman has a senses of this they won't find it attractive.

The libido thing was an example of accepting your partner's compensation. If my libido is much higher than my partner's, and my partner is willing for me to feed those needs and allow it, I will be a much happier person to fill those needs elsewhere because he can not provide that. It seems like my partner is doing all the 'sacrificing' and it's true, but what he's really sacrificing is his ego, which compares himself to his partners' partner out of fear of loneliness and removing his selfishness from the equation."

In some countries the depth of talent is so large that it's a shame to have to eliminate some of the best players in the world simply because they are from a talent-wealthy country.  

I was looking at the stats for Team Canada in comparison with other 2014 Olympic Hockey competitors and, with the exception of a few teams like USA and Sweden, the Canadians weren't even considering players that would have been top tier in another country. In fact, I'm pretty sure that Canada could have supplanted the entire talent pool (in terms of experience and skill) for the bottom five or six teams.  Latvia, Slovenia, and Norway don't have three star players amongst their entire line-ups.

Chop up some bacon and set it to fry at the bottom of a big soup pot.  Get a bag of egg noodles boiling in another pot while the bacon cooks.

Add the cabbage to the pot, and stir to coat it in the grease and bacon bits. 

Salt a piece of core and nibble on it while the cabbage gets wilty. 

Egg noodles should be about done - drain them, add them to the pot with the cabbage and bacon. Dice up half a stick of butter and add that to the pot, then mix it up using tongs. The butter should melt pretty quickly, and at that point you can plop of of that into bowls and enjoy. This should feed a family of 8, and is fatty enough to make you feel full for hours.

""What in the name of Jesus happened here?"" Lou asks.

""Looks like a raging party that got a little too wild.  The housecleaning staff opened the door to clean and said they found the room just like this."" Another officer chimes in.

""Alright, I'm going to take a look around, you two go try to track down some witnesses, see if you can find out what the hell happened in here."" Lou says.

The officers leave and Lou begins to carefully walk amongst the carnage in the room, careful not to disturb any evidence.  The body of Howard has a massive gash on the forehead and a slash to the neck.  Lou begins to examine the bedside table, when a glint from a shiny black credit card catches his eye.  Lou gets closer to examine the card, and is taken aback to see, ""Louis Diego"" printed right on the front."

It sounds hard, but with enough effort you can do it pretty easily. Or you can hire someone else, which is not something I considered before typing this."

To open the gate, you trigger the bottom pistons, first the sticky then the regular -&gt; this pushes the gravel and fences up. Then you deactivate the regular piston, then the sticky piston.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390589081.0,"Capitalism, to me, is inevitable, at least until we can star trek our way out of it. Wealth inequality is also inevitable. You need inequality to inspire people to work harder. In this sense O'Leary is correct.

HOWEVER, this does not excuse the statistics, and sorry, this is not ""fantastic news"". Just because we need some level of inequality doesn't mean we can't have a say about how MUCH inequality, and trying to make things MORE equal. There is no excuse for 85 people having as much wealth as 3.5 billion, and people starving to death while other people are super rich.

That being said, I think we need governmental intervention in the economy. We need minimum wage laws, we need a standardized work week, we need regulations to protect workers, and we need a welfare state to provide for people where the free market fails. Just because there are winners and losers doesn't mean we have to let the losers starve and live a crappy life in general. They just shouldn't have as much as those who do work hard and succeed. I believe we can balance a capitalist system with making sure everyone attains a decent standard of living. That being said, I'm for what is known as a universal basic income, in which everyone is guaranteed a basic standard of living, and if people want more, they have to work.

We also need to find ways to keep business out of government. The problem with crony capitalism isn't government interfering with the workings of business. When there's a problem, that's it's job, to fix the problems. But we need to make sure that the government is actually fixing problems and not helping out the rich. That being said, the problem isn't the fact that we regulate, it's why we regulate, and how we regulate. We need to keep corporate interests separate from governmental interests, just like in the past we figured out how to keep religious interests out of governmental interests. Just like we have separation of church and state, we need to have a separation of business and state."

A ""bad lawyer"" would have the same qualities as anyone else who is bad at their job. Lazy, doesn't pay attention to details, asks bad questions, rushes through the work. Just passing the bar and maintaining a licence doesn't mean you are going to do a good job. Removing the incentive to build a reputation increases the chance of any client getting shitty service.

If you are randomly assigning lawyers, this problem gets worse. If I have no ability to even get more cases, then I'm going to do the bare minimum, get you off my desk, and either go golfing or look for a job writing wills or something where better work benefits me.  You've essentially made trail law ""lawyer duty"", like how we have jury duty now. 

As to the mental image issue, the danger is that all murderers will be thought of as black men, all rapists as frat boys, etc. This sort of helps even things out, but only by having every defendant subject to the same prejudice. We should be trying to make the system more fair for every defendant, not equally unfair.

What we would label as piracy was rampant because standardized forms of copyright had not yet been established, the only protection available to 'authors' (although the concept of single authorship is also an anachronism, which is also relevant here because writers were generally powerless in their relationships with editors and publishers and were most often seen as mere labourers) was guild custom based on establishment of precedence (which directly propagated the founding of scientific journals, but that's a different story) and hierarchy.  

These disciplinary measures didn't function very well as regional book industries expanded into an international complex. Entire companies were devoted to plagiarization because it was in many ways more viable and affordable than creating originals. 

Unofficial versions of literally every publication proliferated, and it has been established that the vast majority of available copies of Recens Habitae are knock offs with visibly sloppy reproduction of his moon prints. I don't have my chart that shows the difference between the first carvings based on his drawings and the variety of contemporary copies at hand, but it's pretty wild how inaccurate the majority of them are in comparison to that initial work.

I mentioned ibogaine's action in relieving opiate wihdrawal in the second paragraph. The ""it"" I was refering to in my first paragraph, which doesn't help with chemical addiction, is the Iboga trip itself, which is being claimed here to ""eliminate the craving"" for heroin, cocain and alcohol after a single dose. While the experience may help one to decide to quit, that resolve will do nothing to alleviate the withdrawal because the withdrawal is caused by the chemical dependence, not the psychological dependence.

ScubaSteeeve,funny,1390589236.0,"To anyone who isn't from Texas, the state's reaction to a little snow is excessive. However, let me explain it a bit as someone who's lived in Texas for several years but also used to live in upstate New York (and has walked to school past snow banks taller than I was).

Texas does not see a lot of snow or ice. Entire winters will go by in many places without so much as a snowflake. As a result, people simply don't know how to drive in the snow or ice because they simply never have to do it. Some people don't make any adjustments, while others will slow to a crawl and grip the steering wheel with white-knuckled desperation. The combination of the two is very dangerous, and when you toss in ice that tends to form on bridges (which make up a huge portion of every interstate, highway, or city-wide loop in Texas), you have a recipe for unpleasantness.

In addition, because snow and ice are so infrequent an occurrence, even the salt trucks don't really do much. They tend to wait until ice has already formed before they toss salt on the road, which is a bit like turning the lights on in a room after you've already stumbled around like an asshole and knocked over that expensive urn that has Nana's ashes in it. In other words, it'll help dissipate the ice, but it would have been more effective had they done it preemptively.

And here in Lubbock, where I'm currently residing, in November, we had a minor snowfall over a weekend. Less than three inches. I braved it to go pick up some groceries five blocks from my house... and saw, in that time, three totaled cars in a row, a fender bender, and some poor bastard who had tried to get onto the bridge that takes you to the highway but found that his car couldn't get up the ramp mid-way because of the ice. Which, thanks to Texas's ridiculously light-colored roads, is kind of hard to see (unless it's black ice, because hey, Texas)."

This is a drain on the body and brain and your brain knows this. Eventually your brain will ""learn"" that clenching your butt cheeks  leads to unpleasantness and will probably stop or diminish.

I like your ideas and agree with your end goal, but I don't think using the strategies that feminism does is a good idea.

My belief, though I will disclaim it by stating I have no proof that it's accurate, is that egalitarianism is about postmodernism. Specifically, I think dissociating from preconceptions and using critical thinking to consider them is an important skill to teach children. I believe that debasing the concepts of sex, love, and relationships (especially prevalent ideas like monogamy and gender roles) has to happen alongside the debasing of popular structural concepts like religion, capitalism, political affiliation, etc. This movement can't be aggressive like the feminist movement, because an aggressive movement has enemies. A movement with enemies has to fight to exist in the first place, rather than getting a chance at inspiring everyone.

Keeping track of calories and planning 100-200 calories (or sometimes less), really does stop me from eating a pint of ice cream. Salted chocolate, one cookie, one fun size candy bar, a square of dark chocolate with a tiny bit of peanut butter, etc... isn't going to ruin your diet. 

However, this is different for everyone. Some people need to just avoid sweets and junk all together to keep their mind off them. I go crazy if I know I can't have something, but one bite isn't going to make me eat 20 more bites, so I know I can handle it. If you can eat 1/4 a dark chocolate bar without eating the whole thing, go for it. If you think eating one caramel is going to set you off on a binge, then you need to find a way to avoid them all together. "

We tried making a status and chaning the permissions from there (while still in the Newsfeed) and you see the names.

I think the issue comes from sharing with a custom list; in general I share with ""these people or lists"" and mark ""Friends"" and ""Don't share with"" ""limited Profile"" and **that** shows up as ""shared with Custom"" to my BFF.  Those two options are predefined FB lists, not ones that I've made, so maybe the issue comes from me sharing with a custom list, versus sharing with my Friends, then removing one list.

Also love the ability to not have to collect / switch to a totally different set of gear for DPS.  I had a holy paladin in WoW, so if I got a piece of gear for ret it was totally useless for healing.

Chances are far more likely to be 51% plus once he went and looked at MILF porn after seeing his mom. Are you really suggesting it was just total random coincidence that he really only like mature woman/MILFs for the fun of it and of his own volition?   

You really think he'd be in the 49% chance category when he looked at OW/YM type porn after seeing his mom? If you weren't a mod, I'd just think you're trolling. Or stupid. I don't know which one. "

That said it would be a step in the right direction because it would prevent nonviolent offenders from going to prison. I hope this leads to the eventual legalization of it. I very rarely agree with Perry on anything and while I don't totally agree with him on this I'm glad he is pointing out the topic.

Kyokushin_Dude,cars,1390589711.0,"I disagree.  Firstly, you're conflating engineering and craftsmanship: engineering is the design of the movement and other things, craftsmanship is the work that goes into making the parts and putting it together.

Regardless, a watch is one of the classic forms of mechanical engineering, and is a great example of engineering qua elegance.  Look at a watch with multiple complications in a small case, like this: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qNc21pg-zPg/SxQAbaIQZPI/AAAAAAAACSY/jO6YK18RHIQ/s1600/Movement%2B-%2BPatek.jpg

Lots of mechanical engineering there.  A watch can have many complications from this list: http://www.thewristwatcher.us/watch-complications-guide/

That's a lot of things to cram into one tiny little case and still have it keep good time. Denying the engineering there is odd to me.  There's beauty in engineering of all forms!

Supposedly you can manage without *serious* risk of inbreeding-related genetic disorders by keeping at least a cousin's worth of family tree distance between mates. Going along with this, that means that every pair of mates could be as close as having parents who are siblings to each other. Starting with 4 unrelated humans in pairs, your second generation can mate between the two families (no inbreeding), giving the third generation several options for cousins to mate. After that, the familial relations branch off pretty well and your options for ""safe"" mating pairs only increase.

So 4 *might* be enough, given adequate selective breeding and possibly eugenics efforts (if an anomalous genetic disorder arises, prevent their breeding). Morality is seriously in question here, but I don't think they have a choice."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390589762.0,"Yeah, it's part of girl code to ""save"" each other from awkward advances from guys or bad dates. You know when you're at a party and a friend notices you talking to a guy and she gives you all those signals about trying to figure out if she needs to come ""steal you away""? Or when you ask a friend to call you during a date in case you need an excuse to escape? We're generally more comfortable approaching things indirectly and through others' help. 

Men, more than women I think, get a lot of their self worth affirmed by feeling useful to other people. I think women tend to care more about being valued for what kind of person they are, not necessarily what they do. A mother's desire to feel needed is fulfilled perhaps more abstractly, while a father wants to be needed for concrete things.  

Men often feel that the best way to express love is through acts of service. Love is expressed symbolically. Women often feel more freedom to express love directly. Helping you with little things is his way of showing he cares, and about fulfilling his own desire to feel needed.

A father's job for his son is to be a teacher. As a son matures, a father learns to let go of this urge to protect him because it's now his son's turn to fulfill that role.  But throughout a daughter's life, he continues to see himself as the protector. It's the main way he knows how to relate to his daughter. 

Fathers tend to guide their children's outside lives: their relationship with the outside world. I think fathers can tend to feel this as a burden to protect us from the outside world rather than really deal with it. Mothers tend to guide their children's inner lives: the emotional, private, and domestic spheres.  Of course, they help their kids deal with the outside world, too, but the tools they often emphasize are the tools of the inner world--being emotionally aware, for example. There is a strong stigma against a mother coddling her son because we assume he must be emotionally dependent. A son coddled by his father is assumed to be poor at dealing with real world issues. Yet, there seems to be less of a stigma against fathers coddling their daughters. 

Anyway, those are just a few of my armchair theories.

I think women are better at picking up non-interest signals than men are, or at the very least are pretty careful not to make a move if they aren't sure you'll be receptive (which makes sense, I can imagine that kind of rejection being worse if you're a girl due to social/image pressures and lack of experience with rejection).

DERangEdKiller,AskReddit,1390589862.0,"[BraveStarr - A space western featuring a Native American protagonist.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BraveStarr#Background)


**Warning, this started as a brief answer, and kinda evolved as I typed over the last 2 hours.  I cover the premise, and even go into the over arching plot of the 5 seasons I'd develop.**

This show was a head of its time.  Not only did it not condense the issues of a mixed culture society by just making up fake alien looking creatures ala Dinosaucers, it also touches on issues of poverty struggle by using a setting with very limited resources.  

but what could it be?  It could still hold on to multi-cultural aspect while developing more along the lines of revenge/drama.  In the original series, a few characters even died which was rare in the 80's.  This is a perfect way to express the shifting landscape of a society's moral grounds due to initial cause of conflict, and the example of the shades of gray that is life, and how we navigate it.

If I were executive producing it, that's what the core of our concept would be as we took examples from real life.  Although it would primarily be based on the style of U.S. Westerns it would use a lot of examples from around the world like the pacific war's massive racial cleansing, to African slave trading (both from the domestic side, as well as the men who comprise the sellers)  from conglamorate types, to the neighboring village who raids other villages and captures free men.  It would heavily question the world repercussions of economic division, and conversion of a world from an agrarian society into a mechanical-industrialized society, and its repercussions to the people physically, spiritually, and environmentally.

The possibilities are endless, and when I was done (either willingly, or forced), I would want people to say it was like watching an animated sci-fi version of There Will Be Blood

What would you do if you escaped the worst parts of a failing society by fleeing to another world, and then that society followed you, like a slow-motion avalanche you can't escape.

Another cool side note is that there were a few characters who were criminals who fled to the planet.  What do you, as a local lawman do to said people when you live on a planet built on the hope of a second chance.  Will the criminals embrace that creedo, or will they carve out a little kingdom for themselves and their kin?  In the face of that worry, can anyone truly embrace the hope of civility in a place that a galactic society is slowly poisoning with greed?

On top of that, each season would focus on another threat as the world changes.

Season 1: Prairie lands.  The first season would introduce us to the core group of characters, and the Western lawless struggle of the settler society.

  Pilot: The Stranger |  Finale: Trail of Tears

Season 2: This Rise of the Union -Displaced from their homes, and denied basic rights, Bravestarr must form uneasy alliances in order to combat the antagonistic strip mining conglamorates.

Ep 1: Wounded Knee/The Rights of Man | Finale: The First Delegation/ The Rights of All

Season 3: One Voice - As the war against the conglomerates and the ruling class rages on, The group splinters.  Some to different lands to bolster the battle lines. Some of the others go off world to gather support, and supplies for the rising immigrant army. 

Ep 1. Farewells and Never Wills | Finale: Liberty Weeps

Season 4: What Once Was, and Will Again Be:  With the Union army shattered because of the betrayal of Bravestarr's childhood friend former judge J.B. Mcbride, Bravestarr is left with his oldest enemy turned reluctant ally as they search for the one thing that can reunite the war effort, the secrets of the long lost civilizations that first lived on that world (surprise, they're on the long deserted lost earth).  At the same time, the other main cast that is still alive are stuck in isolated struggles against the rapid urban development of large swaths of the planet.  It doesn't go well.

Ep 1: The Pieces That Remain  | Finale: The Swords of Justice

Season 5: Picks up a year after last season. After having secured the first major victory against the Board of Trustees, and killing his once closest friend then turncoat J.B. Mcbride, Bravestarr and his new and old allies have reclaimed all of the ground they lost 2 years before, and the board of Trustees, now cut off from the aid of the Pan-Galactic Senate, turn to crueler tactics.

Ep 1.  Escalation/ The Price of a Nation | Finale (and assuming this might be the end of the series) The Storm of Light/ Be Brave

Bonus:  Series Finale summary - In the final days of the settler wars, Bravestarr is torn between his role as figurehead of the revolution, and his love for now captured love interest Belledona McBride, the little sister of J.B. (Jezebel) McBride.  He receives a message from the evil leader of The Board of Trustees.  The only condition for Belle's freedom is Bravestarr's surrender publicly.

As the trade off is about to go down, and the disheartened forces who didn't break away watch their leader, and hero destroy the cause, a stray long range missile from Conglomerate forces strikes Bravestarr, and kills him inciting the bloodiest battle to have, or will happen in centuries to come.  Barker, Bravestarr's long time former enemy turned most trusted friend and ally leads the forces of the union from the frontline of battle to become the great hero of change.  With nearly all of the forces of the Conglomerate dead or dying, no one can identify any of Bravestarr's remains, and the remains of what is assumed to be Belladona is to be buried at Bravestarr's memorial site.

It is only in the last 5 minutes we learn that what we have seen is really the events of the war as played through the mind of Barker's great great great grandson as he reads his forefather's and Bravestarr's personal journals.

Barker eventually became the elected leader of the new planetary nation.  Peace, and prosperity never wavered in the decades he was in office, and re-precedence for the right of people to self rule toppled the control of The Conglomerate and The Pan Galactic Senate in favor of true, honest, representative democracy.

The series finally ends after the reader finds a letter taped to the back of the cover of the last journal.  In it is one of two things  (I'm not sure which one yet as I'm coming up with this shit as I write it) 

Either:

1. Barker's confession that he organized Bravestarr's death making him a martyr.  A man needlessly killed by forces who'd already won after making Bravestarr sacrifice everything he believed in for the life of the woman he loved.

2.  Barker's confession that Bravestarr and Belladona Mcbride's deaths were faked to insight the battle and end the war, and they lived out in the prairie lands for the rest of their days in solitude.

He went through 4 years of schooling and it was less useful to his job than a 4 month intense Oracle DBA class. The certificate he got for that was more useful than his 4-year degree.

If we're just talking about jobs, a certification system has its benefits over the degree system. 

No 4-year ""all-in"" investment in degree. Just certificates that don't have to be acquired serially. Taken when convenient over a few to several month period. Pay as you go.

For broader/abstract advantages like holistic education and self-actualization, the current degree system has its own advantages, but that's a lot more subjective and hard to compare."

maowsers93,texas,1390589918.0,"It says that anyone who's had an abortion, but where the fetus survived to viability, can have their parental rights terminated if petitioned.  

Basically if you have an abortion and the fetus survives your rights to that child as a parent can be terminated by the state. I say fetus because under Texas law you can't have an abortion of choice (just because you don't want to be pregnant) during the period of viability. You'd have to have one say at about 9 weeks or so and then that fetus would have to survive the abortion and develop into a viable baby. 

I've only heard of this happening once and it was a case of twins I believe. The woman had a surgical abortion, the doctor checked to make sure the embryo was removed, and they considered it a successful procedure. Later on past the 20 or 24 week mark she realized she was still pregnant. It turned out that she had twins and only one had been removed. This usually doesn't happen because sonograms are used for the procedure. 

But in any case under this law that woman could have her parental rights terminated to the child she had. It is also worth noting that this bill isn't written with medical language. There are a whole host of reasons why a woman would terminate a pregnancy close or after viability. 

For example about 1.4% of all abortions take place after 20 weeks and the majority of them are because of complications. Every woman gets a 18-20 week fetal scan because at that point the fetus is finally large enough to check the physical structure of it. This is the point when you finally learn gender and structural abnormalities can be identified. This is the time period when most people find out that something is wrong with it if it hasn't developed correctly. 

So, most of the people who get abortions after 20 weeks do so because of structural abnormalities. About 1-2% of all 18-20 week fetal scans returns a sever structural abnormality like Hydrocephalus, Potter's Syndrome, etc. About 80-95% of people who get these diagnosis chose to terminate. 

As you can see in the bill there is no wording that covers people who terminate for that reason. So, basically if someone were to chose to terminate because of a fetal anomaly and it some how survived (which is being applied loosely here as many anomalies are fatal) then the parent can lose custody of the child. It is also important to point out that a child with a severe fetal anomaly is likely unadoptable and would become a ward of the state. Anyone who knows the statistics on the foster care system knows that, that is a cruel place for a healthy child to grow up in let alone a disabled one. 

So, basically it is a law that could revoke the parental rights of an individual that has no language concerning complicated situations. It is just more of the same in terms of anti-abortion laws that do nothing but hurt people and complicate family trauma. "
VoxMeretricis,sex,1390589920.0,"Think of it this way: in what way is consensual sex disrespectful? In what way is sex between partners degrading? Why do you believe rough sex and dominating her equates to disprespecting her?

What is it about this type of sex that you find degrading or disrespectful? Do you do humiliation play, or do you have a problem separating a lust for and enjoyment of BDSM from the idea that there is something shameful about women's unabashed sexuality? 

You might dig into ideas about what you consider to be loving, respectful, and caring and what you consider to be degrading, painful, and disrespectful in terms of sex and sexuality, and explore *why* you associate one type of sex with love and respect and another type of sex with degradation. "

Right, but this could be done with layered pre-events. For instance, have a caravan carry supplies necessary to set up a fixed assault point. Nobody helps? The caravan still does its run, and is decimated. The pre-event resets, and five minutes later the caravan leaves again. Immediately after killing a boss, there'll be downtime, and then an event to defend the fixed assault point. If that fails, it falls back to the caravan event. If it succeeds, then the boss is just easier to access for the next group.

Seriously, look up the UNO ""Regents"" scholarship - pays tuition at UNO up to X credit hours.  All that's required is a high ACT score; something like 30-32.

Additionally, if your daughter is interested in IT or Engineering, UNO's Peter Kiewit Institute runs a scholarship called the ""Walter Scott, Jr. Scholarship"" which is basically paid for by the Walter and [the late =( ] Susanne Scott.  They'll give you a computer, pay for you to live in Scott Hall (best dorm!) which includes food, and cover just about everything.  You get to go to Walter's ""barn"" for dinner annually and talk to him - he's a pretty awesome guy, and they have a fire fountain.  Yup. Fire fountain.  The Scott is harder to get - it used to be almost purely ACT scores, but now it also looks at where you graduated from high school (anywhere in NE &gt; anywhere else, basically), what extracurriculars you did (Join the NHS and sell water to do nothing...it looks good), and requires an essay or two.

The Regents and Scott scholarships can be gotten at the same time to cover just about all college costs (dorms, food, books, tuition).  If you get the Scott, you're basically guaranteed the Regents. They don't do it anymore, but they used to just cut me a check for $1-2k  every semester based on the overflow funds.  It was awesome.

The only money I spent during college at UNO was for my graduate year, since the scholarships are all for undergrad and I was too lazy to apply for grants for one year of grad work.

First off, a Pluot is completely different than a genetically modified plant in other aspects.  A pluot is not a plum or an apricot, but a hybrid of the two, and this is commonly known.  This is completely different than having a fish gene in strawberries, for example.  There is no process of hybridization in which you could introduce such a gene - and there is also no clear indication that such a food would carry such a gene.  

Second, something can cause an allergic reaction without being on a list of ""known allergens.""  People can have allergic reactions to many things - from bacteria to fish.  So if a strawberry has a fish gene, there is a potential for an adverse reaction in someone who is allergic to fish, despite it not being on a ""known allergens"" list.

One of the things I think I realized when I started (which was different than every other time I started) was that I didn't have to be on a specific diet, but I had to be on something. Don't like Keto? Do calorie counting. Don't like Weight Watchers? Do Slim Fast. Don't like Paleo? Do Vegan. I honestly recommend calorie counting with EVERY diet, and some diets are sustainable for a long time, and others are not. Some people can stay on one forever, and some people's can't. It's just about finding something you can stick with, even if it's only for two weeks, or two months, or two years. The main goal though, is once you quit a diet, to have another one lined up to start the moment you are off the previous one. I've seen people have life-long success with diets that I cannot stand.

I love how I am beginning to see a lot the folks I love on QI just shuffling around the panels shows, like David Mitchell, Dara O'Brien, Bill Bailey, Richard Ayoade, Lee Mack, etc.  So, another method for finding more shows you might like would be to pick a QI quest that you enjoy and look them up on IMDB.

I also loved the Ravencrest monument. Azshara was one of my favorite zones pre-Cata. It was such a beautiful sad ghost-zone.

I liked images that had elements from other zones to really throw you off (e.g. The Bombardment in Icecrown that looked like WPL).

&gt; New technology to link cartridge cases to guns by engraving microscopic codes on the firing pin is feasible, but does not work well for all guns and ammunition tested in a pilot study by researchers from the forensic science program at UC Davis. More testing in a wider range of firearms is needed, the researchers said.""

[Association of Firearms and Toolmark Examiners, 2006](http://www.nssf.org/share/legal/docs/AFTEVol38No1KrivostaNanoTag.pdf):
&gt; Certainly this research has shown that implementing this 
technology will be much more complicated than burning a 
serial number on a few parts and dropping them into ﬁrearms 
being manufactured.


[Association of Firearms and Toolmark Examiners, 2012](http://www.calgunlaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Clarity-of-Microstamped-Identifiers-as-a-Function-of-primer-Hardness-and-Type-of-Firearm-Action.pdf):
&gt; Despite shortcomings, microstamping does have the potential
to place valuable information into the hands of the officer or
detective at the scene of a crime in a timely fashion. If coupled
with an independent, voluntary oversight board, established
and maintained by firearm manufacturers and sportsman associations to control issuance of the identifier and maintain privacy, microstamping could enable tracking of fired cartridges
in an efficient and timely manner.


[National Academy of Sciences, 2008](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12162):

This *trans* thing doesn't go away - despite other problems I've had, despite me trying to keep up with every one else trying to get a degree and a job and a family. I can't seem to just work through it, since I can't get surgery. I gave it my all for five years, and I didn't get anywhere. I mean, I did great, fantastic for a trans girl.

Again, because of greed--which would still exist in your utopic vision. Who is going to oversee the distribution of resources in this utopia? Power corrupts even the most benevolent of leaders--this basically begs for abuse of power. Meanwhile, what about scarcity? What about commodities that simply aren't enough to go around. In the Western world, we are blessed with the resources to feed, clothe, and nourish mostly everyone. But what about water distribution in the Middle East? What about food in Africa? What about clean air in China? Scarcity is the root cause of most of the world's conflicts--hate is just a byproduct. I got to be honest. You are so ignorant, it's laughable."

Chalkface,paradoxplaza,1390590720.0,"I can help you with that. There is almost nothing for Sengoku, honestly. The three mods I found that actually seem to change anything are:

Sengoku 1551
&gt; - This mod provides what has been an oft-requested feature for Sengoku: the ability to play the game in the late Sengoku period, when the Oda, Takeda, Hojo, Mori and more sought to unify the country. The mod uses as its starting point April 9, 1551, the day after Oda Nobunaga's father's death.
&gt; - Has an expanded map and lots of relevant characters for the 1551 onwards period.

Genpei War
&gt; - the game starts on 05.01.1180
- new clans and characters. Some of them have ancestors from the 9th century.
- starting events for bookmarked persons (Taira Kiyomori, Yamato (Takakuranomiya) Mochihito, Minamoto Yoritomo, Kiso Yoshimasa and Fujiwara Hidehira)
- tweaked education events
- tweaked vassal events
- events for the titles at the imperial court
- new traits and icons with kanji
- additional modifiers

Monumenta Iaponiae Historica
&gt; - 10 scenarios from 1180 to 1600, including both of the above.
&gt; - Characters for this period
&gt; - The following features are already added in MIH:

&gt; 1. Additional events
a. Interactions with the Imperial Court
b. Seasonal events
c. Educational events
d. Historical events for each scenario
e. Building events

&gt; 2. More thrilling battle
a. x3 Movement of the Army
b. Siege check in each 15 days

&gt; 3. Provincial management
a. altered building effects of castles and cities
b. added new guild buildings
c. All provinces are specialized as economical base or military base.

&gt; 4. New traits with Japanese virtues and kanji
Since the traits of vanilla contain some Western virtues and icons such as angel, MIH replaced them with Japanese ones. Some of you might be unable to read kanji, but they are just icons, so you don't need to understand them. Please just try to feel them instead of ""to read""!

&gt; 5. Optional anime/manga character portraits

Growing your population in your existing cities (one of which already presumably has a bunch of science improvements including National College) will more rapidly increase your science output without causing the undue economic drain of building those buildings again. Additionally, they'll do so at reduced happiness penalties.

If you need to speed up development of your existing cities, consider granary, aqueduct, hospital, medical lab.

If, on the other hand, the additional city would grant you a new lux, access to the sea, or some other tile-benefit that mitigates the happiness penalty; or in the case that you're just overflowing with happiness - then sure, settle away.

Mehknic,Omaha,1390590918.0,"3.5 actually isn't all that hard when ""Honors"" and ""AP"" classes in high school are calculated on a 5-point scale, but their values are directly translated to the 4-point scale.  I had a 4.1 GPA on a 0-4 scale, which makes no sense whatsoever. 

The ACT is the harder one - I'm lucky enough to be good at tests, so I took it once and was happy.  A lot of people I know kept retaking it to shoot for higher and higher scores.  Start her taking it early on - first semester Junior year.  Plenty of time to work and improve from there.  It costs something like $30/attempt, IIRC, so it's totally worth compared to $75k in college costs.

For the Scott, you're probably going to want over a 32 with emphasis on the math/science scores...just a heads up.  A 30 is manageable by the average student with some work, but 32-36 is going to be almost entirely the realm of naturally gifted students.  Those tend to be the people that end up in IT/Eng degrees, though, so it's kind of self-selecting that way.

The ACT is the defining test for a lot of midwest schools.  The SAT scores are primarily used by coastal universities.  It doesn't hurt to take both."

Kaisharga,NoStupidQuestions,1390591005.0,"Actually the way peristalsis works that's not possible without causing some fairly severe injury to parts of your large intestine. Also anything that gets into your stomach is not coming back up, which is good considering the incredibly acidic nature of stomach acid. Anything you bring back up is from pre-stomach parts of your esophagus. This is why stomach pumps are called what they are--they bring stuff up from the stomach, because you can't do it yourself.

So if you try to stifle a fart, even if you don't have any solid matter behind it, it will come back periodically until you essentially air-shit yourself when the pressure surpasses your ability to contract your voluntary anal sphincter.

I shave usually 2x/week and always at night. I feel I look best with moderate stubble to a tight beard, so I like having at least a little scruff even the first morning after a shave. I do have a long shaving routine, mainly because I get bumps easily, and found I need to use a lot of care to minimize it.

Shaving Routine:

1. Wet face with warm water
2. Wash face with Cetaphil Cleanser and the CVS knockoff Clarisonic brush
3. Hop in the shower
4. If I dry my face too much after the shower, apply a little more warm water on the beard
5. Splash some rubbing alcohol on my razor (dollar shave club 4x)
6. Apply pre-shave oil to beard (Art of Shaving Lavender)
7. Warm a small glass bowl with hot water
8. Whip up shaving cream in warm bowl and apply lather with brush (Art of Shaving Lavender)
9. Rinse razor in hot water and shave with the grain
10. Rinse face gently with cold water
11. Dab face dry 
12. Apply Scruffing Lotion with cotton ball (Clinique for Men - although the women's toner is the same exact product)
13. Apply Aftershave Balm (Art of Shaving Lavender)
14. Consume 2 fingers of Bourbon or Scotch with a death star ice ball."

I know of many who have been harassed to the point of moving away due to people assuming guilt regardless of the courts. With that said, I think the issue there is also in part a distrust in the legal system.

That's probably due to the same presumption of innocence, which has the potential to let guilty people escape justice.

And yes, that's a common argument against rape culture. A rape culture would not heap disdain on anyone remotely associated with the act of raping someone.

drzoidburger,relationships,1390591561.0,"I never saw your original post, but wow....just wow. If I was your wife, I would have left you even while pregnant. Yeah, you're entitled to be attracted to whatever you want, but at the same time, as a husband who committed to a marriage, sometimes you have to suck it up and do things that you don't want to do, especially when this change is temporary. That includes making your wife feel loved and beautiful. You failed miserably on that front, and I predict it's going to be a long road to forgiveness to repair the damage that you did on her self-esteem. What are you going to do when she gets older, her metabolism slows down, and she inevitably gains weight? How can you guarantee that you won't treat her like shit again or even leave her? 
       
Your revulsion to any body type that isn't ""thin"" is a massive problem, one that requires individual therapy on your part. Why does it disgust you so much? It's one thing to not be attracted to fat girls but to be disgusted by it? Like really, she gained 40 pounds (which isn't even that much), and you couldn't even touch her? You had to hover-hand your own wife?! It sounds like you really need to work through that issue first and of course, go to couples therapy with your wife. 
      
Lastly, your wife is a wonderful woman. To be able to forgive you like that after shunning her for her whole pregnancy and then laughing in her face when she tried to repair your marriage....it takes a lot of strength of character. You really don't deserve her, but now that she's giving you a second chance, you need to step up and be the husband she deserves for once."

Lion_on_the_floor,AskReddit,1390591562.0,"The 2nd grade teacher I had for half a year, before switching to another class because of this incident:

It was fire safety week and we had a coloring book associated with it. Our homework assignment was to color a page in, then we'd like up to the teacher's desk and show her the page we colored. I forgot mine at home one day, and so when I got to her desk I told her that. She put me over her knee, asked the girl behind me how many times she should spank me (the girl said two) and so I got spanked two times.


Someone also put paper towel in the toilet, it was not me but I went anyway, and it didn't flush. The kid after me told on me and the teacher made me stick my hand in the pee to pull it out.


She made a classmate of mine stand on a chair and close pinned her sweater to a line of rope across the ceiling as a joke said she'd move the girls chair because she didn't have an assignment.


This teacher made us write our first and middle names on our folders. She told me I spelled my middle name wrong (which I didn't) and I had to have my mom tell her I was spelling it correct. 


The principal was retiring that year and thus he did not give a shit about the toilet or spanking incident :(

I'm really starting to get tired of Vice's shenanigans.This is another story that lacks perspective, depth, or research. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army(UPA) is a very controversial topic in Ukraine and to a lesser extent, Russia. Where some people see neo nazi sympathizers, others see the the UPA as independence fighters. Contrary to popular belief, not all Ukrainians liked being ruled over by the Russians. 

In fact, Ukrainians fought several wars of independence against the Russians often at times allying with a rival faction in Eastern Europe, such as the Turks, the Poles, the Lithuanians, and the Austrians. 

The more recent independence war was in the 1940's during WW2. The UPA was primarily focused on Ukrainian indepence at all costs. Contrary to the Russian fabrication that this was/is a primarily Nazi group.

 The idea of independent Ukraine has always been an affront to Russia and the lack of representation of both sides of the story by Brian Whelen is as bad if not worse than choosing not to cover it.

There are people alive today that could recount their own horror stories of the ""treatment"" methods from AHS: Asylum.

The distinction between the kind of horror expressed in season 1 vs. season 2 is important, and /u/whoniversereview touched on it briefly. 

Creepiness, stalking, the supernatural, people not who they appear to be - that's the recipe for season 1's story. Stuff that makes you want to keep the lights on, the doors locked, and look over your shoulder at every odd noise.

Psychological and emotional horror, torture, kidnapping, false imprisonment, racial cleansing, helplessness - that's what season 2 was going for. Stuff that will worm its way into the back of your mind, and stay there. Very real fears of a very ugly side of the human experience. Ignoring the alien side plot for this particular discussion.

Simms85,MakeupAddiction,1390591876.0,"I feel like most ""contouring"" is VERY hard to pull off in real life. It looks nice in photos, but can be jarring and overdone in person. I work at a fairly upscale bar, and on Saturdays and busy date nights (Valentine's, NYE...) you can pick out some pretty terrible makeup with a lot of bad obvious contouring from a mile away, even in low-lighting situations.

I think you might have better luck with applying concepts of contouring without losing your mind trying to blend everything. I feel as though a bit of understated highlighter on the brow bone and cheek bone does far more wonders for facial structure than trying to blend in darker bronzer underneath (which can look muddy and obvious). 

Disclaimer: My MU aesthetic is very conservative IRL, YMMV. If you are intent on contouring, the only way is more practice. Makeup application is a skill."

Often I realize I'm just randomly browsing the sites I frequent, so I close my computer and lie down for a while. If I'm still bored after resting a bit, it's time to meditate on what I want to spend time doing. Usually this means getting some food.

I feel like my energy is very limited, and I save most of it to go to work and excel as much as I can there. Once I'm home, I crave solitude, even if I'm bored like this. It does help my goal to save money, because I switched to a lower-paying but more satisfying job. It's hard to spend much when the only things I'll buy alone are food, beer/drugs, and music."

I also always have a real drain in case I want my cistern (or whatever it is) dry, which you always will. You always need a drain. Drain off the edge of your map on a rock level, and smooth and fortify the final blocks to allow water to run off the edge of the map. Then floodgate. Link. Repeat.

Falling water is also one of the most valuable things in the game. If you have water falling into a drain, there's no reason why it shouldn't be falling through your dining/meeting hall for the positive vibes. Again, floodgate, test, make sure there are ways to retrieve jumpers, etc.

Don't get me wrong, I love Dylan. He was a poet who happened to play guitar and sing his poetry. His voice wasn't amazing, but it fit the part of the songs he was singing. Dylan probably influenced more of the music you hear today than any other singer/songwriter I can think of. Maybe Chuck Berry. Anyway...

*Hurricane* is a good song that makes a statement, and that statement was ""Hey a bunch of crooked cops lied and got a black man imprisoned for a crime he didn't commiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit"". But dammit Bob, the song is like 8 minutes long, and you sing the chorus at least a dozen times. Hell, there's a minute long violin (cello?) solo in it. It's a great song. It tells a great story.

mahworkaccount,Rochester,1390592092.0,"Not sure what part of Spain you're from or if you're into going out to bars very much, but I did a study abroad in Madrid and I can note a few differences in the night life that I noticed pretty quickly:

Bars and clubs close at 2AM in Rochester, so people start heading out to them around 11-12PM as opposed to when I was in Madrid and we'd drink with friends in a park until around 2AM and then hit some bars until the metro opened back up at 6:30AM.

Speaking of drinking in a park outside: don't do that. It's not legal to drink in public in the US and you'll get a ticket.

Rochester has a few dance clubs, but they're outnumbered by casual bars which seemed to be the opposite in Madrid.

There's no metro Rochester, so your options on getting home are to walk, take a cab, or have a designated driver.

I remember having girls in our group of friends negotiate the cover charge for getting into bars as well as the amount of free drinks we might get if we went to the bar that promoters were pushing us to go to out on the streets.

It's worse than anecdotal data and those type of comments are really hard to distinguish from, say, paid marketers.

The whole point of submitting an article like this is that someone actually took a bunch of brands and ***tested*** them (even if we disagree with the brands they included/excluded or the criteria upon which they evaluated their ""quality"").

Where as family guy would have made something like that a main focal point of the show, with numerous other gory cutaways, Rick and Morty had a fairly fun and light show before the bathroom scene. Along with Morty's reaction, which made it seem even more real because he just wanted to go home and forget about what he saw. Like the good grandfather he is though, Rick wouldn't let him go back with that at the forefront of his mind, and wanted to prove to him that it wasn't all bad.

&gt;This is not an argument against it being cruel.

Sure it is: [**cruel**: ""willfully or knowingly causing pain or distress to others""](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cruel?s=t). Circumcision surely does not cause significant pain to others (the pain of the operation itself is momentary, to an infant), and while it may cause emotional distress to some (*i.e.* people who are upset over having been circumcised as an infant), I'd venture that most people who have been circumcised all their lives do not feel emotional distress over the matter. In any case, surely, any such pain or distress is not being willfully or knowingly caused.

So, yes, ""cruel"" is hyperbolic, IMHO. It implies *suffering*, which is questionable, and intention to cause suffering, which is surely outright groundless. That's without even getting into the intensifier ""appallingly"", which should surely be reserved for things that are truly horrifyingly cruel."

Drop_,DotA2,1390592364.0,"When you're playing at that MMR it isn't a factor of ""playing all the roles yourself"" it's merely a factor of playing your role well, along with picking up wards and placing them.  

As a mid, this shouldn't be a problem, and actually as a mid picking up wards is a sort of trivial expenditure, and gives you a huge degree more control (i.e. it lets you have vision of both their high ground and the runes).  

You aren't playing ""all roles.""  The role of a support isn't to simply buy wards and try to cast spells in teamfights.  It's to ward, pull the lane in the jungle, smoke gank, etc.  As a mid or other solo lane, you would only be picking up one of those - the one that impacts you the most. 

Climbing out of the lowest ratings is more difficult as support, because your teammates are likely to have shitty map awareness and situational awareness anyway.  So you should be playing for yourself almost entirely.  

If you are going to play support in the lower MMR's, roaming supports would be a better bet as they give you a stronger chance to snowball.  But you should also consider aggressive split pushers who can jungle (e.g. furion or lycan), Strong mids (e.g. Storm Spirit, QoP, OD, Dragon Knight), and strong midgame carries who can sustain a push (e.g. Juggernaut), and strong roaming gankers (Ogre Magi, Crystal Maiden, Alchemist).  

Focus on staying positive for your team, and your own mechanics.  At low MMRs teams tend to have both shitty awareness and shitty mechanics.  If you can rise above that despite your teammates doing stupid things, you will improve in your rating.  If you give up every time your team feeds first blood, you will be stuck there for much longer, particularly if you're playing support often.  "

I mean concept of ""gender"" has literally been a social construct well before it was ever used the way it is in modern society.

There's no clear line between ""gender role"" and ""gender"" anyway, and you see that when you try to delve in to language and literature throughout history well before modern feminism co-opted the term.

Does the ""gender"" of a library have anything to do with roles? There are [grammatical rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender#Gender_assignment) that have almost nothing to do with gender roles. At the same time, there are some that do.

captain_craptain,WTF,1390592768.0,"&gt; Combine that with clogged drains because the trucks only get cleaned out once every 6 months (I'm looking at you, Taco Bell), and you have this back-up of blood. 

I'd like to know how you came to your conclusions.  Have you worked on a dock that unloads meat?  Have you worked in transportation at all?  I've never actually heard of a drain in a reefer truck either, pretty sure this was a figment of your imagination.  We wouldn't want trucks driving around the country dripping blood trails everywhere now would we?

The reason I ask is because I actually have and do work in logistics with food and I've never heard of a truck being allowed to go into a slaughterhouse to pick up a load of meat before going through the truck-wash.   They are literally asking for 'food grade trailers' when you dispatch a reefer to pick up meat, meaning that the inside must be swept, clean and not have any type of odors.  If needed they will tell you to go hit a truck wash and come back and are sometimes still even turned down after taking care of all that because it still isn't clean enough for them.  

Not all loading docks have that slight incline either, that is just depending on your docks design.  I would say the vast majority or trailer level dock height and don't have the incline.    

Also, every time a trucker drops a load of meat it is in his best interest to get his shit cleaned out ASAP.  He doesn't know if he is going to get another food load or a dry load with his reefer unit off.  So if he doesn't clean it, it's likely he will be delayed or turned away at his next pick because his trailer is gross, bloody and smells like death, and that costs him time and money.

**TL:DR  I don't believe this guy actually knows what he is talking about.  Trucks get cleaned out WAY more often than every six months, particularly if they are food grade trailers.  Plus I'm pretty sure that Taco bell doesn't even have their own trucks so trying to place blame on a company with no logistics arm is silly...**

Ask her ""should I get a condom"" (not a turn-on but makes intention clear without being awkward). Don't ask if you can have sex with her.

Women think sex without explicit verbal consent= rape? Seriously? If you are sober when things get hot and heavy, and you take your clothes off, let him in and enjoy yourself without saying a damn word in the process, you can't call it rape.

poryphria,kpopslumberparty,1390592818.0,"(I love the snoo- first one where I immediately knew which group it was)

Namyu is my favorite girl group as of their ""Wild"" promotions, because I refuse to call Sunny Hill a girl group just yet.  I love the concept, I love the members (Kyungri, Erin, and Sera are my favorites), I love their synchronization, I love almost all of their songs except for ""No Playboy"", and I'm hoping that they can put out one track that can make them more known.  I thought it would be ""Wild"", but I guess not.  Their lives are pretty consistent, like APink or Dal Shabet, and while they don't have a Taeyeon or Hyorin-like singer, the vocal line is one of the strongest in any girl group.  Sera, Hyuna, Kyungri, and Hyemi can hold their own (and Hyemi has improved a ton).

Erin's a great rapper (although I'm pretty hesitant to name someone an actual rapper if they don't write their own stuff).  The verses in ""Wild"" are some of the best from an idol group in 2013.  She needs to throw down some of her own bars soon.

I think [Kyungri](http://kpopselca.com/selca/1193_too-hot-to-handle-kyungri.jpg) is one of the most beautiful women in K-pop.  People say she looks weird, but I like idols who have really distinct faces (like Leo, Onew, Jaejoong, Nana, Gyuri).  

[Link to their documentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PStaWsj9xsQ)  It's a little sad and I think it gets across just how hard it is to succeed as an idol.  Many other programs like to sugarcoat the bad side, so I appreciated what this documentary tried to do.

&gt;But they do not.

How do you define ""healthy"" that you deny this? Circumcised sex is surely not detrimental to a person's health (if anything, it may confer slight health benefits, which is why it was common practice for so long).

&gt;&gt;and by and large do not feel themselves to be diminished by the operation.

&gt;because they don't know any better

Nonetheless. I can understand why you oppose circumcision on the grounds that it deprives someone of potential pleasure that he'd have had the ability to experience, but ""depriving of potential pleasure"" ≠ ""causing suffering"".

&gt;&gt;The act of sex is still pleasurable to them.

&gt;""Still..."" you even acknowledge it yourself.

Not sure what you think I acknowledge with that word. The act of sex is still pleasurable after circumcision, as it is before it. Possibly it's not pleasurable to the same degree, but I wasn't taking a position on that, and in any case, it wouldn't affect my argument that depriving someone of pleasure he has never known is not ""cruel"", let alone appallingly so."

When I was home I was tired, and cranky, and distant. I ate to comfort myself. I was disinterested in work, and barely phoning it in.  I hated myself. Not a fun person to be around.

I went on a diet for a month and lost 20lbs, decided to get some exercise and joined an MMA gym in March, was to scared to grapple at first so I just did stand up for 3 months. Started Grappling in June, NoGI, started Gi in July. I lost 60 lbs in 9 months, stopped hating myself, stopped being a dick to my wife and children, reinvested myself in my career, and acquired a new and way more positive outlook on life.

I gave you a specific example.  Are you yourself not informed with how the fats we consume have changed over the last 70 years or so?

&gt;The unintended consequences argument reminds me of people who were afraid of the unintended consequences of the LHC, and that it would create black holes that consume the Earth.

Well I can't control your personal connotations with terminology.  If you can't get over your own hang-ups and scary words, we can't have much of a discourse.  

Unintended consequences are a part of any action.  The reason they are mentioned specifically in in association with agribusiness is that they are a constant factor.  Foods that keep longer, travel better, grow faster and are pesticide ready are valued over those that are healthier, tastier and that humans have evolved alongside with.

Consumers who try (and I do) can still get heirloom tomatoes, and chickens fed a natural scavenger's diet.  We drink raw milk and eat fermented foods that promote healthy intestinal fauna.

Clockw0rk,AdviceAnimals,1390593122.0,"I don't pirate games anymore, but I still do movies and television.

Here's my demands, media conglomerates:

1. I want to be able to access my media on all of my devices. Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS. That means you either have to actively develop AND MAINTAIN a file format and player for that format, or use an existing format.

2. I want to be able to have my media offline, within reason. Putting my device in airplane mode should not interupt my show. Going to the woods were cell reception is garbage and wired internet doesn't exist, shouldn't prevent me from watching a movie. Slow bandwidth at home should not cause my movie to stutter. I want to be able to ""buffer"" the ENTIRE video, so if there's a network interruption, there's not a viewing interruption. I'm willing to indulge ""connect once a week"" DRM so you make sure your content isn't just running rampant and free, but always on solutions just don't work for today's state of connectivity. We're not *there* yet.

3. It needs to be a flat rate. Tiers of flat rates is fine, but it has to be a flat rate. I only watch Fox sunday cartoons, mythbusters and a handful of shows on comedy central. I'm not going to pay 60+ dollars a month for a full cable package to have five channels. Maybe it's a set number of shows per month per price bracket, maybe its a set amount of bandwidth per month. Figure this shit out. I'm not going to BUY a season of television for five bucks a show because I'm not going to rewatch it. I want to 'rent' your content for a one time viewing. In the unlikely event I want to re-watch, I'll 're-rent'.

4. You have to be johnny on the spot. If you're airing on TV at 8PM, you've got to have episodes posted online by 9PM. **That's how fast the pirates are**. If you're launching a movie on Video on Demand the second week of March, then it had better be on the flat rate service by the third week of March. You are FAR over-valuing your timed exclusives, and pirates don't care about that completely arbitrary bullshit concept. I won't wait a month for a video being sold at Walmart to show up at Netflix. I'll go to pirate bay and have it downloaded faster than I could driven to the nearest store that would sell me a physical copy.

Why do I not pirate video games anymore? Simple.

1. When I buy a game online, it works on every computer I put it on for its specified platform. Period.

2. The game files are stored locally. I could unplug and live in a hole for the next five years and have my games with me.

3. I rent games through gamefly. Flat rate, new titles on day one. I buy games through Steam, titles are available immediately online the day they're on store shelves. Sometimes even before, particularly with indie ventures.

4. When a game is released in stores at a midnight launch, it's playable on steam at midnight (with few technical glitch exceptions). No arbitrary bullshit waiting periods.

When someone FINALLY figures out how to do for movies and TV what Steam has done for games, I'll be onboard. Netflix is close, but it's not there. And the reason it isn't there is because the studios won't let it."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390593172.0,"A lot of people are either too eager to suggest therapy or too against it to think it's necessary.  However, I think this might be a good example of when it could be pretty useful.  I'm really just going based off what I've gathered from my sister (she is a doctor in the medical field, although her initial degree is in psych), and if I had to guess, this is something that she'd suggest therapy for, which is why I would do the same.  You may be able to work through things yourself, but it's also possible that you don't have the necessary tools.  I understand not wanting to go straight to therapy and wanting to be independent about it, but it could also be incredibly helpful.  They can definitely help you work through things like this so it doesn't have to have such a large effect on your life, or even at all.  Therapy is an incredibly powerful tool, not a cop out.  

A therapist could probably help you see your relationship for what it is so it doesn't scare you so much.  They can walk you through what you're feeling and how to understand those emotions and deal with them.  

Relationships are tough - no one has all the right answers.  I think that's actually freeing.  It makes me realize that when things aren't perfect or I don't know exactly what to do, that's okay, because no one else has all the answers either.  It's kind of like getting older...people tend to worry that they don't feel much like an adult and that when it comes to a lot of things, they're really just winging it.  It's scary until you realize that it's the same for everyone else, and then you don't feel so alone and different.  

I also have a pretty stress-free outlook on life, though.  My SO is a bit of the opposite, and I'm trying to help her with that.  I'm not trying to change her, but I'm trying to show her that it's okay to relax and figure out a way to work through things instead of panicking, and that's a little how I feel about your situation as well.  Life is better when you allow yourself to enjoy it.  Don't let all the negative stuff get in the way of your happiness.  I used to worry about every little thing and try to prevent problems before they arose - turns out, I was causing them instead, because there was nothing to fix or even prevent.  Once I stopped doing that, I've been much happier.  If a problem comes up, I'll deal with it then, but I'm not going to let myself be unhappy when I can just put a little trust in someone I care about instead."

From my personal experience, I don't feel like there was enough **honest** guidance and advice for people considering grad school. Doing a PhD is the one of the hardest things you will likely ever do. It is a war of attrition, with very few high points. People need to realize what a PhD actually involves, and what it takes to successfully finish. A PhD is something for people who are truly passionate about a given area, and want to devote themselves to studying, researching, working in that area.

Turns out a hip replacement can cost anywhere from $11,000 to $125,000 depending on which hospital you ask, though most hospitals will be reluctant to give you a quote at all. Why the hell is that? The answer is complicated. Paying cash for these types of surgeries is always a good way to reduce the cost of the procedure, as shown [here.](http://www.surgerycenterok.com/)

The problem with American healthcare is so much more complex than it's typically given credit for being, especially on reddit. But the fact of the matter is that, with our hyper-prevalent immigration and huge population, the single-payer system doesn't really seem to be in the cards for us. Something about our system is keeping costs of routine care very high, and something is also making the cost of a simple hip replacement vary by a thousand percent from hospital to hospital. I don't feign to know the answer to any of this, but I'm certain it's not as simple as ""privatized healthcare is evil!"""

Also, you are not using periods at the end of your sentences. That's a pretty major grammatical mistake. 

I'm not saying this to bring you down, just pointing out that the world, and each person in it, is full of imperfection, contradiction, and confusion. The world becomes much more tolerable when you accept that as a natural state, rather than a problem in need of a solution.

I used to think like that. Then I started counting calories, drinking heavy calorie shakes, less rest time between sets. Boom, I gained 22 pounds in 4 months. Turns out for a 6'3 guy 2 albeit big meals a day were just maintenance. 

OP, take it from someone who knows best - if you REALLY want to then fine, do it. Do it my way. 5 times a week, low rest and high intensity 10x5 and more recently 10x10, nothing too fancy.  Eat big two meals, lots of carbs in those and protein, get used to taking breakfast too if you don't already have a big one, and make a monster Svunt Shake. 

I use 1 L milk, 3 bananas, 2 scoops of peanut butter, 3 or 4 scoops of a mass gainer, 1 tablespoon honey and 150-200g oatmeal. Drink that daily on top your diet. 

Now for the bad part, you're going to put on a lot of weight too fast. Expect stretch marks on your thighs, under your armpits, on your biceps, avoid them by rubbing high fat cream before and after working out.

 You're going to gain a lot of fat. I had 7% bf when I started, and I'm at 13-15% now. The belly really irks me, so expect to cut later on. Half my gains or more were probably fat.

Even so, you don't necessarily have to unfriend him, but remove him from your facebook timeline and turn off chat for him so you don't see his name coming up when you're not seeking him out. And try not to seek him out (read creep his page). It's not going to give you good feels. 

Take some time to get to know yourself alone. After 5 years of being together, it's not unheard of, and really is pretty likely, that your identities have melded together in unexpected ways. Reacquaint yourself with your identity as an individual. 

Also find your own happy. Wrap yourself in activities and friendships that matter to you and make you feel empowered, fulfilled, and give you a sense of accomplishment. For me, these have been salsa dancing, running, and rock climbing, and what each had in common was that they are physical activities that take skill, training, and mental energy. Endorphins are good. Physical activity = endorphins. BUT you don't have to do those things. Just do something new (or something you used to do!) that takes your whole focus in the moment that you're doing it. 

And don't be afraid to be sad, too. This was a huge part of your life, both temporally and emotionally. You're allowed to mourn and grieve for what was, but also remember that life continues. Time moves forward and so will you. Totally - you might burst into tears randomly when you see a little reminder of something you shared, and that's totally fine. Just don't let it paralyze you.

If you feel like you're having a hard time being alone, don't be alone. Ask a friend or cousin or sister or a potential new friend from one of your classes to meet you for drinks or lunch or brunch or some new social outing kind of thing like bar trivia or karaoke or social dancing (swing, salsa, etc). Surround yourself with people, but remember to be careful and be with people you trust, too, especially when alcohol is involved (like I really need to say it).

Now I will say, this comes from a girl whose secondary coping mechanisms were drinking an entire bottle of bubbly while watching Pitch Perfect, and turning to a mutually rebounding friend with benefits, but I think if I'd listened to my own advice (at least on the not being alone part), I probably would have skipped that last part. Even so, that's okay, too. It at least helped me cut off the part of me that kept thinking ""maybe he'll change his mind and realize he was wrong,"" despite knowing better. Probably not the healthiest coping mechanism, but it was freeing in a way that helped me start moving on when I was ready.

I shouldn'a tol' ye that.

But hey, we're all here, and we're all okay, even when it doesn't feel okay. You're okay. You're lovely and kind and generous and just wonderful, and if I could, I'd give you the squishiest hug and pour you a drink and bake you a feels cake. Take care, love."

Two years ago I got the ""There is something wrong with me"" speech in the middle of her suddenly going out with the girls to 'find herself'.  Like you, I chose to believe everything was OK and she couldn't POSSBILE be cheating on me.  But my gut instincts were sounding the alarm.  So I snooped in her phone and found that she was flirting and starting an emotional affair with a co-worker.  I don't have time to reference it, but if you look at my posting history I put it up on /r/offmychest a few months back.  Go ahead and read it and see if anything there sounds familiar at all to your situation.

Now, you have to stop putting on the blinders and REALLY start paying attention to where she goes, when she tends to go and who she's with, then start checking in on her without her knowing.  I know you don't want to hear it but I really do think she is either cheating on you already, about to start something or looking for something.  If so you need to catch her and stop it in it's tracks or use the evidence in the divorce.  

Stopping sex entirely for 3 months is a huge red flag, and you should know that from reading MMSL.

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390593535.0,"I'm interested in dialogue and the exchange of ideas, but if you feel like I'm already beating the dead horse by continuing this, please let me know and I'll stop, because that's not my intent. 

&gt;you require intellectual curiosity (great!) not just about Judaism or halacha, but about a ""movement"" (and, in particular, it's liturgical changes). 

When a group of people get together and say this is what it means to be “X”, or to be an “X” kind of “Y”, and then a person decides, “ya know what, I’m going to use the label “X” for myself,” how is it being unfair to that person to assume that that individual has a certain, basic, understanding of what “X” group defines itself to be? 

I mean, that individual claims that label for themselves; why would they do so without some basic understanding of what that label entails? (My point with this is that saying I am a Conservative Jew and I go to a Conservative synagogue convey two different things to me.)

And, as an aside, it’s not that I think liturgy is the best thing ever and the yardstick by which to judge one’s Yiddishkeit and Jewish education. I picked liturgy in this case because in my 10+ years in Liberal Jewish communities, I’ve found most Liberal Jews really identify with the synagogue-y parts of their Judaism. Thus this question should be playing to their Jewish strengths. 

And I’ve personally found that the intellectual curiosity that would call one to explore their liturgy highly correlates with exploration of other aspects of their Judaism as well (i.e., it’s not the one and only test, but a good indicator of many other tests as well.)

&gt;someone who self-describes with any label (especially a non-orthodox label) might not intend to mean that they identify with the movement, but that the label – 

So going back to the Chicago school example… if I go to DePaul for econ,  that means I get to call myself a Chicago School Economist, and that I am then entitled to feel frustrated or mad when people expect me to answer questions on neoclassical positions? I am the one that failed to understand the label that I adopted for myself properly.

&gt;Maybe I need to come up with a better label for myself, but ""conservative"" seems to convey large amounts of fairly accurate information with ease.

If someone told me they were a little-c conservative Jew in America, I’d ask them about the Republican Party. If they said “no, no, I mean like, I want to conserve Judaism as much as possible, but without like, going to that stupid hypocritical Conservative shul down the street that’s gone too far” then I’d encourage them to check out other labels that might work for them, like “traditional,” “Just Jewish,” “non-denominational,” “Reformative,” or “Conservadox.” 

Because within the context of Judaism, Conservative =/=conservative, and Conservative is a well-defined label given affiliated organizational structures (rabbinical school, synagogue organization, platform, publications, etc), whereas conservative is not (yet?) well-defined. (Just like Reform has a specific meaning within the Jewish context, but reform does not.) Doesn’t mean conservative can’t be the label for you. In fact, I for one would be really interested in hearing why you feel conservative works best(/better?) for you.

But to be clear: I admire all Jews making informed Jewish choices; I do not think my choices are the only informed ones. I left the Reform movement because it didn’t jive with me and I don’t agree with their stance. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t respect Jews who go there (as humans), or the Reform Jews who do Reform Judaism as Reform Judaism says Judaism ought to be done.


&gt;Your preferred Jewish intellectual activities

Awesome. I’d be interested in having you post things you’re learning about in this forum if you’re up for it.

&gt;(Although I will admit that I found it really interesting to find and read the conservative ""driving teshuvah"" that came up the other day.)

If I had to guess, I’d say that’s because you were studying how one group of Jews “do” the kind of stuff you really like doing as a Jew?

&gt;The ironic thing about this discussion is that I could probably pass at least some version of your test for conservative jews, 

Probably because you spend some time doing Jewish things, learning what interests you in Judaism, why and how we do things, etc. Hence, earlier, when I said I find this liturgy test to indicate a general intellectual curiosity about Judaism.

&gt;Conservative Aleinu

Conservative omitted the “this is omitted by some, ‘for they are vain and empty worshippers who pray to a fake god! Heathens!’” part.

&gt;So, I don't feel the need to define my Judaism with reference to why I agree or disagree with all of the decisions of any particular movement,... I'm certainly not ""lazy"" about Judaism. 

I do think doing things without understanding the hows and whys is intellectually lazy. You could lay tefillin, pray three times a day, make your own kosher cheese and slaughter your own meat, and be part of the social justice commitee and belong to Men's group and that wouldn't be lazy in deed. But if you did those things without understanding why, that I can't respect, even if I respect all the individual actions. Thoughtful, purposeful, intentioned living is important.

&gt; You demanded - and received, 'shkoyach - the respect of the orthodox component of this sub despite approaching Judaism from a vastly different angle than they do. Please don't turn around and deny respect to those who approach liberal Judaism from a different angle than you do.

I want to clarify, and this requires me to speculate what others think and believe. So take with a grain of salt (C:
First, I think Orthodox here (overwhelmingly/all) respect me as person. Or I’ve already told them off and don’t care anyway ;)

Second, I don’t think all of them consider me a Jew, given my Conservative conversion. That’s fine. Asking them to accept my conversion could be asking them to abandon their beliefs so my feelings don’t get hurt, so I’m not comfortable doing that either.

But let’s say I had been born Jewish and was raised Conservative and still lived the same “level” of Conservative Judaism as a hypothetical born-Jew as I do now as a convert. I think they’d all respect me as a fellow Jew – due to klal Yisrael, am Israel, ahavat Israel, all that jazz.

But by definition they think I’m doing Judaism in, at best, a less than ideal way, and at worst, completely wrong. Because that’s what being Orthodox means when being asked about today’s Conservative Judaism.

YET, given that I identify as a Conservative Jew, they probably think I’m doing that kind of Judaism well (I’m not a perfect Conservative Jew, not even by Conservative standards.)

And that’s exactly how I feel about my other Liberal Jews here.
First, they’re all people. I respect them for that. 

Then, 99.99% of the Jews here are people I consider Jewish (basically, the only people I wouldn’t think of Jewish is people whose Reform conversions didn’t include the ritual components, and their descendants…) and I’m commanded to love them by our shared G-d. I recognize that those Reform Jews who didn’t convert with all the required rituals are still connected with the Jewish people in a significant way. I think those are the only two kinds of respect that are required to be a good mod. I felt capable of doing that, so I agreed when namer asked me. It’s why I screamed and screamed on behalf of Reform, in addition to Conservative, in this community, way before namer even approached me.

BUT, I don’t always agree with the kinds of Judaism that others are doing. (Otherwise I’d probably be doing those kinds of Judaism instead of the one I do…)

YET, given that, I can respect people for being really awesome Reform, Reconstructionist, Conservative, and Orthodox Jews according to Reform/Recon/Conserv/Orthod standards.  That’s where my “I can’t respect a Reform/Recon/Conserv who can’t tell me about liturgy” test comes in.

Also, your nails grow out considerably quickly, so even if you damage the surface, it'll grow out and replace itself.

I'd be more worried about what you're doing to your nails from the inside, and I tend to harp a bit on this, but eating healthily is incredibly important to the condition of your nails.

Round 2: I'll give this to the Terminator. His learning computer gives him an edge. Pred can hide, but heat sensors and such null this. He dies first again. Terminator can use all kinds of improvised weapons to take out Robo once and for all.

Drinking in moderation is ok, driving after drinking can ruin a person's life.  Drugs are out there and they will be offered to you at some point, I can say yes or no.

And finally, whatever choice I make, I shouldn't ever get into a car with someone who has been drinking or doing drugs.  I could always call my parents and they would get me and my friends, the punishment would be small, like I would need to pay them ""cab fare"" and I could expect to do some extra work around the house in the coming days (extra dishes, yard work, etc)  

The result of this freedom of choice was that I didn't drink in HS, there was no taboo.  I didn't try pot till I was 20.  

TLDR: my parents taught me to weigh my options and then gave me the freedom to make my own choices."

ClearArmor,news,1390594041.0,"1) What I hear you saying is that treating people with basic kindness is a slippery slope so we should treat them as inhumanely as possible to make sure we're not being too kind.  You should do some actual research on prisons and find out where the lowest recidivism rates in the world are and read up on the prison systems there.  You may find yourself surprised at what you learn.


2) You seem to lack knowledge of how prisons are actually run.  Talk to someone who has worked in a prison and ask them if they really believe they could control the population if the inmates had nothing to entertain themselves.  Thinking an idea is far different than implementing an idea and the results aren't necessarily going to be the best because you started with the most idealistic approach.  Also, prisoners pay for their own entertainment anyway.  You think the taxpayers buy their TVs and xboxes?  Nope.  They do and they contribute to the economy quite a lot by doing so.  Keep in mind, prisons use varied environments and conditions as a means of creating rewards and punishments within the prison.


3) Um, last I checked homeless people are allowed to listen to music, watch TV, put creamer in their coffee, walk around as they please, etc.  Or are you suggesting that somehow there is or should be a line of homeless people around the block waiting to get into jail because the conditions are so nice?  If you had to pick homelessness or the most cozy jail, let me guess.... you'd pick being homeless?  Guess what?  So would I.


You seem to have the notion of people in prison as *them* as a distinct entity from *us*.  Small thinking.  They are us and we are them.  They are a constantly fluid group of people leaving and reentering our society.  It is not a static snapshot of good vs. evil.  They are your friend, brothers and sisters, and children and parents.  People end up in jail for things that they didn't do and for trifling things that they just can't afford to defend themselves from because in case you hadn't noticed, lawyers are expensive as hell and can make mistakes."

TheEquivocator,MensRights,1390594045.0,"&gt;So it does not cause significant pain apart from the significant pain it causes; pain on par with that which would result from some of our most well known forms of torture. In this case, the peeling of the foreskin is comparable to nail pulling, the excision compared to stripping the skin of the fingers etc.

OK, so you're making the argument that the pain of the circumcision itself is significant [enough to be grounds for outlawing it, presumably]. I disagree. Your comparisons to ""our most well known forms of torture"" are utterly fanciful: the peeling of an infant's foreskin does NOT cause pain comparable to nail pulling. Admittedly, it's hard to measure this directly, as we cannot ask an infant what it feels, but we can gauge it as well as anything else an infant feels, by its reaction, which is to cry for a minute or two, no more. The same could be said for a vaccination shot. Circumcision in adults is more painful.

&gt;&gt;I'd venture that most people who have been circumcised all their lives do not feel emotional distress over the matter.

&gt;That is true for most people that have been bodily mutilated in a culture that embraces whatever type of mutilation they've suffered; it applies to men as well as women. But just because they cannot perceive the ways that their mutilation has worsened their lives doesn't mean it hasn't. The evidence here is quite clear.

I'm willing to stipulate for argument's sake that circumcision deprives a man of some pleasure that he would otherwise have experienced (although anecdotal evidence from people, including in this thread, who have experienced sex both ways, suggests that this is not necessarily the case). Withal, I maintain that depriving a person of something where he is not even sensible of deprivation is not the same as causing him suffering, and the distinction is an important one.

&gt;Of course it is. What you're trying say is that it is not intended, but intent is irrelevant. Most parents that circumcise their children know that their child will be in horrible agony. They accept this fact as one of the unsavoury aspect of circumcision but they're well aware that it is excruciatingly painful.

See above. I DON'T believe that *infant* circumcision is ""excruciatingly painful"", and I don't expect that most practitioners of it believe that. The evidence for not believing so is the infant's reaction to it, which is no stronger than for other, mild forms of pain.

##TL;DR: It seems we disagree on the severity of the pain caused to the infant. It's impossible to measure this directly, but I would say that the mildness of an infant's reaction to circumcision (forgotten within a couple of minutes) is evidence that the pain is not that severe.

I think s/he might be mentioning things as suggestions or possibilities, and you're taking them as *definitive* statements - like possibly getting another friend for your dog, or the skin issues being from a food allergy or zinc deficiency. This might be a sign that you may want to ask more questions while you're in your appointment to be certain that everything is clear, or if worst comes to worst, you might want to simply switch veterinarians to one who fits with you better.

TheReaver88,worldnews,1390594223.0,"&gt; I just don't see what differentiates anti-abortion arguments from anti-birth control arguments (in utilitarian perspective), other than the fact that abortion is repulsive.

The *only* argument that I can get on board with here is the one that designates a fetus at X weeks as a human being with rights. Otherwise, you're right. It reduces to the choice of the mother. If a fetus at X weeks is *not* considered a person with rights, then why should anyone infringe on the mother's rights to terminate the pregnancy.

But at some point, the organism goes from ""not a human being"" to ""human being with full human rights."" At that point, discarding the organism is no longer acceptable and - quite importantly - this trumps *any preferences held by the mother, outside of her preference to live in the case where her life is in danger.*

My point here is, nobody thinks that a woman having her period is unacceptable on ""abortion""  grounds, because nobody thinks that's a person that was discarded. Nobody thinks a mother has the right to drop her baby in the dumpster, because we all agree that the baby *is* a person, which trumps whatever discomforts or difficulties that the woman has toward motherhood. The logical conclusion is that somewhere in between, discarding this organism goes from ""acceptable"" to ""unacceptable."" I think it's important that we understand how gray this is."

We have inferences, and for many parts of the world we can nail down some basic staples (especially protein ones), but a lot of plant foods do not preserve well, and seeds and coprolites (preserved feces) are less common the farther back you go because of preservation. In places with good preservation we have a better idea, but humans are very creative and make good use of whatever we have available, so what holds true for one area is not likely to hold true in another. The same goes for studying living hunter-gatherers and assuming that they eat like all ancient hunter-gatherers do. No one went to study living hunter-gatherers until well after European colonialism had begun, and living hunter-gatherers had often been forced into marginal environments where they had adapted to a new way of living. There is no ""pure"" or ""untouched"" hunter-gatherer society. Living hunter-gatherers can give us clues, for sure, but we cannot just look at them and say ""oh, so this is how my great^100 grandfather ate.""

Where did people get their carbs and starches? From fruit, sure, but also from the wild ancestors of wheat, barley, rye, maize, potato, rice, millet, etc. It's not like people were just eating deer, berries, and nuts and then all of a sudden domesticated wheat showed up and people were like ""hey, this grows well and gives me energy! I'm going to grow more of it."" People experiment with the foods they already ate. They ate wild wheat, it was important in their diet, and so they began to toy with it and cultivate it. And then eventually it became domesticated. Domestication is a long process that plays out over generations and with considerable experimentation, but people almost certainly were experimenting with things that they were already familiar with, which would be the wild ancestors of those things that are staples today, and many, many other things too, including lots that we would no longer all food. Diets did become considerably less broad with full-scale agriculture, but these things were a subset of what we ate before. We can't just pretend that we ate no starchy carbs because some modern diets like to think that 90% of the ancient diet was meat."

buildmeupbreakmedown,todayilearned,1390594241.0,"&gt; it resets the opiate pathways of the brain

Chemical addiction is about more than brain pathways (though they are a huge part of it). The entire body becomes accustomed to a certain level of the addictive substance and fails to function properly in its absence. Hence tolerance, cravings and withdrawal. Also, ""resetting"" opioid receptors does not magically change the psychological component of addiction. So I am not being inaccurate when I say that ibogaine relieves addiction, as opposed to eliminating it.

It's still pretty much a miracle drug for treating eligible opiate addicts, but you can't expect to just take a dose and be magically healed of your dependence. Unfortunately, it takes a lot more work than that."

Vault-tecPR,worldnews,1390594244.0,"*From the very beginning* I questioned your stance regarding HSBC's supposed unawareness of the money laundering taking place. That has consistently been my focus in each and every one of my comments, and I find it to be quite unbelievable that you've sincerely missed something that I've monotonously and clearly repeated throughout this discussion.

First, I asked on what precisely you were basing your stance. 

In addressing your response that ""From everything shown, it was mixed in these legitimate payments"", I reiterated my request for evidence. 

You rhetorically asked whether I thought it would be reasonable for random people to investigate HSBC. (Come to think of it, I probably should have asked *you* whether you think it would be *un*reasonable for an entirely independent and reputable body to investigate HSBC.) 

Again, I reiterate my request.

You accuse me of shifting focus and launch into an unnecessary--though very clear and well-written--explanation of the process of money laundering.

I demonstrate that I had indeed maintained the same argument from the very beginning.

You call me a troll, I try my level best to match your rudeness and hostility, and here we are.

I know that no one--not even you--can read the mind of HSBC employees. I know that their official statement is tempting and comforting. But I think it's rather foolish to assume that one of the world's biggest banks could not, within reasonable constraints and the vast amount of information and resources available to its employees, *possibly* have detected what was going on. Maybe I'm foolish to think that they even tried to, since the article cites ""systemic failures""..."

If you mean the casual sex...it helped a lot. One of the hardest things for me in a break up is associating my ex is all forms of intimacy like sex and cuddling. So part of missing my ex is really just missing that intimacy, but it's hard to separate the two in your head right after a break up. So sharing that kind of intimacy with another man helps clarify in your head that you don't miss the relationship itself so much as you miss *being* in a relationship. It helps cut the emotional cord with your ex and move on. And who doesn't love cuddles with a hot guy??"

It doesn't seem reprehensible if you consider the idea that maybe the fetus is a living person. If you threw a baby in the dumpster, would my wish to keep you from doing that be classified as ""pushing my morality onto others?"" I'm not in favor of legislating morality, but I am in favor of legislating the protection of human rights. So the question remains: when does the fetus/organism in question attain basic rights?

&gt; I am curious what you think too—at what point would you grant the rights of a living human?

I think a sensible place to grant rights would be when the fetus experiences alpha brain waves, since the ceasing of brain waves is when a person can be legally declared ""dead"" and all rights are removed from that person. We can also test for this, which makes it an important and detectable milestone."

Canuck147,Games,1390594478.0,"I'm submitting this - despite it being on IGN - because I see people losing their minds over Thief being ""dumbed down"" and made ""too easy"" or ""casual"".

I never played the original Thief games (a bit before my time), but from what this article describes there is still a punishingly difficult, stealth focused, challenging game here - if that's what you want.

Want to turn off their Focus vision? Do it.

Want to turn off the target reticle? Do that too.

Want to remove checkpoints? Go ahead.

Want to get rid of the mini-map and directions? Done.

Want to turn-on one hit kills by guards? Go nuts.

Want to play iron man - one death and it's game over? Enjoy yourselves.

And it seems as though by disabling features that help you the game will reward you in certain ways for the effort.

I see this game as being made accessible. If you want to ease yourself into Thief with a different stealth game than we've seen the last few years, then this game can do that. Want to recreate the style of older, more punishing Thief games? You can do that too.

As much as I can respect people wanting something pure - something that perfectly recreates a 10+ year old experience - I hope that older Thief gamers can appreciate that Eidos is trying to make this game accessible to players like me who have never played Thief before."

tallavery,aspergers,1390594525.0,"Most people wouldn't want to (*and probably shouldn't) do things her way. She's fiercely independent and prides herself on being self-sufficient. The Europe trip began after she saved enough to buy a round-trip ticket. She booked work-stay reservations at several organic farms and ranches. After her final work-stay, she took off with a bunch of Hungarian gypsies and traveled around the coast, subsisting on found food and the kindness of strangers. She missed her flight back by many weeks (no, I don't understand how, but she does completely lose track of time frequently), and eventually thumbed rides and stowed away on trains to get back to Barcelona. I bought her a ticket and she flew home.

The USA trip, she did a combination of couchsurfing and informal work-stays. Mostly she camped just off main roads, and traveled by walking, hitch-hiking, and train-hopping. I am not ready to hear all of the details there, as the mere thought scares the piss out of me. She'd eat from grocery store dumpsters and ask locals for work in trade for food or money. She ended up doing everything from dishes to stacking firewood to construction cleanup and yard work. She bathed most often in creeks or lakes. She's always had a high tolerance for cold weather, so that helped.

TheEquivocator,MensRights,1390594897.0,"&gt;Loss of sensation. Its quite obvious, stop asking loaded questions.

It's not obvious to me, and I don't categorize diminished sensation as ""unhealthy"". I define ""healthy"" as ""not detrimental to a person's health"", and I was the one who used the word originally, so instead of fighting over semantics, let's just clarify what each other mean and move on.

&gt;We don't need an appendis, so why not start cutting every newborn open and get it done while its still in the hospital?

I understand your point. But even if circumcision is an unnecessary operation, that doesn't make it *cruel*, in my opinion. It's important to frame an argument fairly: you can be opposed to something without making exaggerated claims against it.

&gt;&gt;Possibly it's not pleasurable to the same degree,

&gt;See, you acknowledge it.

My point was just that the word ""still"" doesn't *per se* acknowledge that—you took it as ""despite the fact that it is diminished [pleasure exists]"", but it could simply mean ""after the operation [pleasure continues to exist]"". But that's a side-point: yes, I'm willing to acknowledge that circumcision may diminish a man's sexual pleasure. My main argument is that this doesn't constitute cruelty and that the distinction is important."

Honestly, I could never forgive someone for that level of rejection. I mean, you seriously started putting a blanket between you and your pregnant wife because apparently even in a non sexual way her belly was too disgusting for you to touch? What about your own belly? Your absolute hypocrisy in regards to physical standards, as well as your apparent inability to empathize and have common decency for someone you apparently love are serious issues that will be difficult to change.

zeoranger,AskReddit,1390595076.0,"&gt; An analogy for death from this perspective is how death is a giant wave that keeps getting closer. Once the wave is passed, there's nothing to be afraid of... but knowing that the wave is coming is the part that's hard to deal with. Knowing it's coming is helpful to learn to ignore it until it's there, but nothing can really take the fear away.

In this case you are really afraid of the aftermath of the wave, what that huge force of nature will do to your body when it crashes over you. This fear feeds your anxiety waiting for the wave. If I were to tell you and convince you that I'm absolutely sure that when the wave get's you you would feel a warm embrace you wouldn't fear it anymore.

I don't fear death.

I fear life.

I fear all the suffering that awaits me on the years to come. That's the wave I see. I can hope for a happy life, but I'm sure that it will be full of pain. For all the good that may be on my path, I fear lot's of moments that I know will happen. I fear the death of my parents. I fear for my son's well being and happiness. I fear for my ability to support my family. I fear physical pain and diseases. But that's life.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal or anything, I don't think about death as a relieve. I'll wear my scars with proud until the day I die.

But no. I don't fear death."

MrQuizzles,AskReddit,1390595116.0,"Trademarks and Copyrights are different things. We're talking about trademarks here. There's a more loose determination about what infringes a trademark (based upon possibility of consumer confusion, brand dilution, etc), though trademarks only apply when the two companies/products are in the same market space.

Basically, a trademark is gotten to stop others from attempting to profit off of the recognition and popularity of your brand. A copyright is gotten to prevent people from outright copying your works.

""Windows"" is trademarked, and it's a valid trademark, so some other company trying to sell software that is named ""Windows"" or something similar to it can be forced to stop by Microsoft. A store selling windows can call it self ""Window Store"" or ""Windows"" just fine because they're not selling anything related to software or computers. Microsoft's trademark only applies to the markets and industries in which it operates.

Similarly, ""Apple"" is trademarked by Apple Computers within the sphere of software and computers. That's how Apple Computers and Apple Records existed at the same time for so long. Apple Computers got in trademark trouble with Apple Records when they started selling music because they crossed into an industry where their company name was already covered by a trademark.


As for this particular case, the word ""Saga"" will end up being a very difficult trademark to defend because it is a descriptive word that can be used to plainly describe many games. Not only that, it's a word that is not uncommon in game names already, so there's already a high degree of brand dilution."

I, for one, skip those threads, since I have no idea what they want from me. 

If someone asks ""hey guys, can anyone give me tips on finding a liquid foundation for my super light skin?"", I'll jump in and tell them what I use, and hopefully it can help them.

&gt; I can guarantee a hell of a lot of the working girls in Bangkok, or where ever, are sending money home.

Yes absolutely. Many girls I've talked to say so themselves.

&gt; They may not be forced as in having a knife held to their throat or shoved in the back of a lorry and driven to Ratchada every night but the are forced out of love for their own family, they see having sex for money as more preferable to letting their mother, father or buffalo starve.

I think this is common, and I also think it's consensual. It's very sad that people are so poor, but the real problem here is poverty.

It actually highlights an interesting point: Why do western people suddenly care so much about poverty when they learn that people sell sex because of it? What about all the people who live in poverty and don't have that opportunity to improve their situation? If poverty is seen as worse than selling sex, then we should be even more morally outraged at poverty than we are at prostitution. But we're not.

Have bid() be synchronized so only one thread can be in at once and then you just need variables representing the current winner, and current winning bid.  Increment a variable to get a unique ID for each bid, check if the bid is bigger than winningBid, and if it is set winner to your ID and winningBid to your bid, then wait.  Wait releases exclusive access to the object, and lets other bids happen.  The run function for the class can simply wait 5 minutes, then call notifyAll() releasing each bid method's call to wait() in turn.  After the wait function in the bid method,  you can just check if you are still the winner and return true if you are, and false if you aren't.

I wouldn't say I was like this from the start, but I saw that once I kept a more open mind as I learned and practiced more, the things I was skeptical about made more sense. I was often wrong in my initial assessment of them anyway, so I was just charging at windmills.

madprudentilla,Paleo,1390595449.0,"The Newbie Stickie has some really good information on this.  Personally, I took the Whole 30 tough-love cold turkey approach and it worked really well for me and I think if you're someone like me who really struggles with sugar cravings it might be a good approach.  I lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks and had zero sweets cravings at all within about 10 days of starting.  If you're not into the cold turkey approach, here's what the sticky says:

&gt;Switching to Paleo
You may feel foggy, cranky, or exhausted for a week or two at the beginning. This is normal. It’s a variation of the “low-carb flu,”[5] combined with a wicked withdrawal period from various forms of industrially processed crap. Hang in there, drink lots of water, and take deep breaths. Also eat some avocado and get enough salt to help balance your electrolytes (when you get rid of processed foods you take out the majority of your daily salt intake, so you need to make it up somewhere!). On the other hand, you may also feel awesome right away; that’s normal too.

&gt;Also worth noting: a gradual reduction in carbohydrates can be a lot easier on your thyroid[6] than going cold turkey, so consider taking it slow.

&gt;If the foggy/cranky/exhausted feeling goes on longer than 2 weeks, check out the “Food and Nutrition” section below to make sure you’re not making a rookie mistake like starving yourself of fat.
You can ease in slowly or jump in all at once; whichever one works for you is the way to go.

&gt;Any cravings will go away faster if you white-knuckle them now, rather than feeding them with dried fruit or nut flour imitations of your old favorite junk food.

&gt;If you post your meals or shopping list here, you may get some very nit-picky or technically detailed comments from people who don’t realize that you’re new. It helps to state clearly that you don’t know a whole lot about Paleo yet and ask for simple explanations. Also, expect to see a range of opinions and disagreement among the commenters: Paleo is not one monolithic entity and we all have our different variations. Ask for sources and think critically about what you hear, but keep an open mind.

&gt;A good quick-start program if you're the rip-off-the-band-aid type of person is the Whole30[7] . The Whole30 has a very tough-love approach that some people love and others hate. It is not necessary for most people to be that strict from a health perspective but some people find it useful in the beginning. That same site also has some useful resources including printable shopping lists here[8] .

Edit: Other people on this thread mentioned fruit and I concur, but I'd stick with low glycemic fruits like berries so you don't end up with an insulin spike.  Mark's Daily Apple has good info on this too: http://www.marksdailyapple.com/best-and-worst-fruits/"

Clockw0rk,AdviceAnimals,1390595469.0,"If Sony/Microsoft REALLY wanted to blow the doors off conventional on disk gaming and DRM, they could have implemented a ""one game at a time"" rental service. Include it in Xbox Gold or PS Plus, maybe make it a three to five dollar a month add on.

You get to download and play a ""rented"" digital title on your primary console for as long as you like, as long as you're paying the monthly fee. In order to check out a new game, you lose access to the old game. Maybe you can only swap games once per 12 hours, or something.

While this would murder GameFly and likely eat into a huge chunk of used game sales for certain demographics, game developers would be able to get a better idea of interest in their games and hopefully a cut of the rental program profit for participating.

I can definitely understand the reason they didn't do this is because it would also eat into regular game sales; especially for titles that only take eight hours to beat. I have no statistics, but there's definitely a percentage of people that only play a game to beat it and then move on. The same people that buy new and trade in a week later would prefer to do this, most likely.

Given the difference in consumption numbers and the inability to offer games-on-demand the way Netflix offers instant video, I don't see GameFly growing to the point where they can make their prices much lower.

*I* use gamefly as a ""try before you buy"" service, which means I usually spend only an hour or two with each rental before I return it. With mailing times, I can churn through four or five titles in a single month. If paying 15 bucks a month saves me from possibly making 4 50 dollar mistakes, then it's definitely worth the price.

If the 'next gen' of consoles finally makes it so EVERY game has a trial period, then I may drop gamefly. But for now, it fills the gap of developers who can't be arsed to make a demo. (I know, development time to make a demo isn't cheap; but demos sell me more than billboards and TV ads)"

DieMensch-Maschine,AskHistorians,1390595480.0,"Depends on whom you ask.  Modern Ukrainians tend to trace the founding of their modern state to the 10th century, with the baptism (into Eastern Christianity) of Prince Volodymir and the establishment of the Kyivan Rus'.  At its height in the eleventh century, the Kyivan Rus' stretched from the Black Sea in the south to the White Sea in the north, with Kyiv (Kiev) as its capital.  It then succumbed to the kind of feudal fragmentation that didn't differ substantially from its Western European neighbors.  The Mongol conquests in the thirteenth century (Kyiv fell in 1240), resulted in a series of tribute paying client states with varying degrees of autonomy.  These then were conquered by Muscovy in the east and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the west. That's a very brief rundown of the Ukrainian foundation narrative.  Your question regarding the emergence of an idea of a united Ukraine is ultimately one of historical memory and ideas of continuity.  Various socio-historical entities imagined a united East Slavic Rus'ian (not to be confused with Russian!) state differently at different times.  For example, Bohdan Khmelnytsky's Cossacks tended to view themselves as a community of Orthodox Christian believers with republican traditions, thus differentiating themselves from Catholic Poles in the west and authoritarian (though Orthodox Christian) Muscovites in the east.  At the same time, many Ruthenian-speaking Eastern Christians in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (especially those who in 1596 accepted a confessional union with Rome as Greek-rite Catholics), did not share Khmelnytsky's vision. I would argue that a fundamental moment in the creation of a Ukrainian identity which imagined a community of Ukrainians continuously residing from the banks of the Bug River in the west to the Don River in the east came with Mykhailo Hrushevsky's (+1934) ""History of Ukraine-Rus'"" (began in 1898).  Hrushevsky was arguably the first to imagine Ukraine along its current geographic parameters, while tracing its history to the founding of the medieval Kyivan Rus.' He likewise argued for a Ukrainian identity that was thereafter continuous, as evidenced through various proto-national liberation movements, placing particular emphasis on Cossack uprisings in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

EDIT: Just off the top of my head, some secondary readings which I happen to like: Timothy Snyder, The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuana, Belarus, 1569-1999; Paul Robert Magocsi, A History of Ukraine; Serhii Plokhy, The Cossacks and Religion in Early Modern Ukraine; Serhii Plokhy, Unmaking Imperial Russia: Mykhailo Hrushevsky and the Writing of Ukrainian History; Serhii Plokhy, The Origins of the Slavic Nations: Premodern Identities in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus."

I know how it feels for everyone to lean on you and depend and believe and all that shit without realizing, truthfully, the amount of strain it puts on the individual bearing the load - the feeling that failure is unacceptable, that every achievement is minuscule against the mountain of things you have yet to accomplish, that you have no dreams against the responsibilities that you have been saddled with.  Everyone comes to us, but where's our goddamned breathing room?

You find your own pillars were you can.  Sometimes late at night, I'll just drive out to some remote place, turn off my car and just scream in my car, it helps a lot.  You bury your stress because there's no time to deal with it, but we all run out of space eventually and you got to let it out or it's going to compound and make you feel worse.  Do you have time to go to the gym?  No?  Do you have a garage?  Buy a punching bag and just punch it out for a three or four 2 minute rounds.  They come pretty cheap on Amazon.

Just last week I was feeling really inadequate about my life given the fact that I have to support my brother, save to go back to school, and set a little aside for my lil sis' college fund all while paying off my loans and fighting for my health.  Meanwhile my friends are off in med school, investing in property, getting engaged and all that nice stuff.  My little victory was writing out a chapter in the novel I'm working on after months of writer's block.  7 pages closer to finishing the single largest undertaking of my adult life thus far.  FELT GOOD!

If you ever want to just vent shit out, feel free to PM me.  I can't say I fully understand every bit of your life, but if I know from experience that some times you just need someone to download your shit on every so often."
kicker7955,europe,1390595492.0,"friends and family don't count views are generally well knowned and nobody walks away with a different perception.

In western countries not every ""traditionalist"" is an arrogant bastard, they have valid concernes, but lack unbiased knowledge, they live in a bubble when it comes to controversial subjects, because they know they are instantly judged because of their opinion.

A couple of days ago the results of a poll concerning what members of /r/Christianity thought about homosexuals, and 80+% argued that they are sinners and love hates them and so on, but another question was Do you think they should be banned by positions within the church and only under 20% thought so.

I then used that same card in three different phones, saving myself that £150 each time, so a total of somewhere around £450 saved by one memory card.

So, 64GB for £35 is £0.55 per GB, whereas the three lots of £150 for the equivalent 48GB upgrade each time is £9.38 per GB!

InMyDreams_Nahh,gainit,1390595711.0,"So that the community understands what direction we are taking, I'm going to give some insight. We are basing many of these changes on the question: *what kind of tone do we want to set for /r/gainit?*

1. We can let it continue as is. As it stands, we are a help subreddit that has some good advice between a lot of crap, beginner posts, bragging posts, people making jokes for comment karma. This turns the subreddit into a bit of a light-hearted, circlejerk punchline that is willing to help out when asked. 

2. We could change the tone of the subreddit to focus on more serious themes. Set up rules against the bragging, jokes that derail threads, beginner threads (that haven't read FAQ), etc. Get rid of the picture to clean up the sidebar and give the FAQ link first billing -- the picture has become a bit of a joke anyway. If we do customize our Snoo, keep it serious in terms of gaining.

Doing this will ensure that /r/gainit goes back to more of what it used to be -- a serious place to get help for and discuss gaining lean mass. There will likely be some that are upset at first since they are used to the lax moderation, and it will likely decrease the amount of overall posts (since many would be moderated), but over time the tone of the subreddit will shift in a direction the moderators think is best.

Traditional antidepressants inhibit the reuptake of specific neurotransmitters, in order to stabilize *mood* to better match that of normal brain function. It has nothing to do with muting or shutting off emotions. In fact, antidepressants stimulate chemical receptors by keeping the transmitter next to the receptors longer, not shut them off.

azuretek,Futurology,1390595954.0,"&gt; You all seem to be working with pre-existing social norms and just assuming we all having a right to live from there. 

Humans aren't born by their own choice, they have the right to live by the mere act of being born. To take their life without consent after life was given is morally wrong.

&gt; Mind you I was referring to adults capable of working.

What's the difference between a capable adult and a capable child? Why shouldn't a child? The elderly? The mentally disturbed? Why should they be excluded from your notion that everyone must work? If they are capable of doing work why should it matter how old they are?

&gt; That is what this conversation is about.

Is it?

&gt; You don't just have the right to continue living if you are not willing to work.

Here in /r/Futurology many of us believe that the future of technology lies in automation and artificial intelligence. The mere fact that in the future most menial tasks will be able to be completed by a machine means your outdated model of ""acquiring resources"" is unsustainable. At some point we will be able to produce goods and services in such efficient ways that it will only require few individuals to manage very large operations that currently require thousands of human workers.

So it's only practical to acknowledge this inevitable future and make societal changes to support it. In the future there will be less jobs than there are people (some might say we're already there, less than 40% of the US population filed tax returns last year), we can't sustain this capitalistic view that peoples only value is their ability to earn. In the future I have hope that my children and their children will not be denied life because of a lack of work.

&gt;  Time to grow up.

Maybe you're the one who should re-consider your viewpoint, we spend a lot of time thinking about the future and what that could mean for all of us."

what_a_cat_astrophe,AskReddit,1390596104.0,"I work as a photographer at a night club occasionally.  After the show, the headliner asked me for a cigarette, and although his partner was ready to hit the sack, he was ready to go nuts.  We got hammered and checked out a few after hours spots.

lynn,Parenting,1390596105.0,"The major difference between me and my husband with our first was the amount of time we spent with our daughter. I was home learning how to take care of her through trial and error; he was at work, and when he came home I was still doing the vast majority of the care because I was breastfeeding and I never wanted to put her down (so I was holding her most of the time anyway) and when she needed a change I'd just do it. I should have asked him to. If your wife has trouble asking for help like I do, encourage her to do so. You might have to watch for when she goes to change him, and take over -- if she objects, point out that this is something you can do, and she can relax for a bit.

She knows what he needs because she's been learning his individual preferences for two months. The way to get past your awkwardness and inexperience is to do it. Take the baby and send her out, or take the baby out. This is for both her sanity and your experience and relationship with the baby. If she's breastfeeding and not pumping or baby won't take a bottle, it'll just be for a short time until the baby doesn't need to nurse as often, but it'll still give you experience and bonding time. Sometimes I'll take a quick trip to the store by myself in between baby feedings. It's nice to only be responsible for myself for a bit.

Sometimes moms can get in the way of dads getting bonding time, because we don't want to let go of the baby. If your wife is having a hard time letting go, or if she tries to tell you how to do things (because she does have more experience at this point), remind her that you need time to figure it out on your own and it's better for all of you in the long run if you get that time. Don't be afraid to ask if you want her input, but also don't let her steamroll you. When I had my daughter, my dad said something that I was surprised to hear from someone who had raised two children from infancy, and I asked him ""didn't you have that experience when I and my brother were babies?"" He said nobody would let him! And I believe it, too, because my mom is just the type to get fed up and do everything herself...and then she'd get mad at him for not stepping up.

General advice can be hard to get started with, so here's one thing you can do that'll probably help her the most: when you're about to sit down with your tablet or whatever, first ask her what you can do. Does she need anything? Is there anything she's been wanting to get done? You can hold him while she does it, or you can do it -- her choice. Does the baby need a change? If (she's breastfeeding and) he's not hungry, does she want to pass him off to you? Does he need a bath tonight?"

nevertruly,AskWomen,1390596120.0,"&gt; I know this is probably sexist of me, especially because I 100% understand what you're saying. But the idea of having to be ""careful of what you say around women"" just doesn't sit right with me. As if women are these bombs that will go off at any second. I never hear anyone saying stuff like this about men, even though the same idea SHOULD apply.

Well, that's nice, but you may notice that I didn't say that you need to be careful what you say around women. I said asking as if sex is something you do to someone instead of something you do together is awkward to me and that I assume this is being said in context and not just to some random person. I don't see how that implies that women are bombs, but, you are welcome to your interpretation.

Let Sick Beard search UseNet for the second it's available, download the episode, unpack it, sort it to the correct folder, watch via XBMC on my TV via XIOS streaming device.  WINNER WINNER!

The cable companies can compete with this but choose not to.  I would pay for a service that let me choose the shows I wanted plus a small bundle of channels (maybe 10-12).  It's easier for them not to; even Google isn't looking into new business models for Google Fiber service.

I'd stop paying for UseNet and gladly pay $75/ month for a 25 Mbps internet, 10-15 channels (or less channels if I could subscribe to local sports teams and skip the sports networks), and a handful of shows that I could watch anytime on demand.   Unfortunately, cable companies think I'm just to cheap to pay for anything and just want to get free stuff.

I know for a while he was doing lots of work on the economics side of the design teams, usually the cost of operating the plane under various circumstances (fuel economy, weight at different capacities, altitudes, maintenance, etc), financing, etc.

One little factoid I remember that you generally don't see in encyclopedia entries about the 737: being that it was designed to be a short-haul aircraft, the trip it was designed for was the Seattle to Spokane route (~250 miles), and the plane was to fly at a lower altitude at higher speeds than commercial aircraft fly today (I think he said it was ~.85-.9 mach, can't recall the altitude though, but I think it was 20k-25k feet).

I need to sit down with him some day soon and start recording all of his stories about doing commercial aviation design at Boeing. He's reluctant though because he got involved with management politics and ended up opposite of T.A. Wilson when he became CEO, and doesn't want to talk about it all much.

1) Both of you ""scream,"" get ""physical"" and fight when you've been drinking.  You don't even remember what you were fighting about, only the physical proof of the fighting.  She hit you first, you hit her back; you are lucky the neighbor did not call the cops on you.

2) You break up due to these fights, and yet you continue to spend time together, to the point where you are ""pretty much ready to ask her back.""  

3) You continue to have arguments and issues over other females, her being very jealous, and you being very closed off, and yet you think a ""friendship is salvageable.""  And now you have a possible pregnancy on your hands -- did you not use protection?

It takes two to tango, and you need to realize that you also played a role in this.  Since you are the one writing for advice, I will agree with the other poster, /u/Vessira.  Stop sleeping with her, take responsibility for the child if it is yours, and cut off contact.  Work on yourself, your anger issues, and your self-control.

I am tempted to call BS on this.  Dozens of first dates all cancelled at the last minute?  That is highly improbable.  If you're exaggerating or making something up, keep in mind that doing so will result in you getting advice that is not appropriate for your true situation.

Anyway, if it *is* true, then first of all, I apologize.  Second of all, here's some advice that only makes sense if what you said is the literal truth:  you must be doing something *very* unusual to result in dozens of cancelled first dates.  Either something you're doing after setting up the date is scaring them off, or they only agreed to a date because they did not feel comfortable turning you down.  They may literally be scared.  You seem like a pretty level-headed and non-crazy guy, so I can't imagine what's going on, but it also sounds like you don't really have a point of reference for what normal dating is like.  I can identify with that:  my parents didn't model any affectionate behavior for me, and my stunted social life didn't provide any opportunities to witness dating behavior among other kids, so I had a very slow and difficult time trying to figure out how to ""act normal.""  Fill out some more details for us, especially any contact you have with them after you arrange the date but before they cancel.  Whatever is scaring them off probably seems completely normal to you and might not even seem worth mentioning, but if you give us a fuller story, maybe we can spot it.

Jax is a bit tough as he has a gap closer, his e to dodge autos and stun and he also scales well.

Kha'zix you'll have to dodge his W's to prevent the slow if he's top or jungling.

Malphite is annoying, but you can level up W is he's stacking armor.

Nasus is somewhat easy, just have to be careful of overextending.

Panth is very hard, don't pick vayne into this.

Renekton is a skill matchup, he's got double gap closer so up to you to condemn and position properly. Likewise with Riven and her gap closers.

Wukong might also be a difficult matchup, same with xin as Wukong can dash in and q, and xin's gapcloser slows + knocks up if he gets it off."

civilianjones,INTP,1390596513.0,"&gt; Governments are so shortsighted. Even after the nuclear groundwater 'incident' in Japan, the US government wants to implement frackin,putting the drinking water of so many at risk.

These two events are not really related.  One is about nuclear energy, one is about fracking.

Solar/wind... they're freaking expensive.  If you were a Benevolent Dictator and mandated solar/wind energy-- you would raise the cost of energy. The poor in the northeast and midwest would be impoverished by energy prices for heating their homes in the winter.

And because you're overpaying for energy that could be generated other ways, your country would lose competitiveness and become slightly poorer than it was before.

The trade-off isn't as simple as you're making it. You have to be ready to stomach lower quality of life for millions or billions in order to reach your goals.


**So do I have any solutions? I do.**

They're not my own, they're mostly just stolen from The Economist and other organizations I respect.

Even with Fukashima, nuclear power is extremely safe.  It causes less cancer than the coal plants we operate (seriously-- coal plants cause measurable cancer in the region they're in.)  Right now the criticism against nuclear is mostly an emotional reaction, combined with some NIMBYism.

Here's a couple sources: 

* http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/03/climate-scientists-support-nuclear-power
* http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/nuclear-power-is-safest-way-to-make-electricity-according-to-2007-study/2011/03/22/AFQUbyQC_story.html


The other thing we should add is a carbon tax on any carbon-producing energy.  The idea is that if carbon is causing measurable harm to the planet, we should collect a tax to offset that-- and the tax will also slightly discourage the use of carbon-generating energy.  http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/09/climate-policy  

This, of course, will destroy some wealth, but it's the best way to reflect the cost of global warming to the consumer.

SpagNMeatball,ar15,1390596552.0,"I had to take one for the team and actually write down the idiotic comments in this video. My brain melted so many times during this process I barely know my own name. I have done my best to type things EXACTLY as he said them. My comments in italics.

*Starts by reading off note cards. He is doing ok, but had at least 5 UMMs in the first minute.* 

*It goes off the rails once he starts talking without notes*

**1:50** Self made or assembled firearm must include permanent metal parts that cannot be detached and that can be detected by metal detectors.   
*ME: Ok, that makes some sense. I can see trying to get a handle on 3d printed guns. But he immediately changes his concept of ""detection"" and moves to assault rifles*


**2:37** I want to show the process for creating a gus, a ghost gun which is quite shockily simple  
*ME: Shockily?* 

**2:45** *(Holds up an 80% lower)* If you just focus on this piece of metal, right now  
*ME: Are you trying to hypnotize me?*

**2:55** The weapons you see right up here, semi automatic weapons as well as automatic weapons, sniper automatic weapons, the engine, the heart is this piece of metal.  
*ME: Check out this shit I gots all up in here.   
Didn't know sniper rifles were full auto?, Tell me more...*  

**3:08** This is a lower receiver. It can be purchased online, it can be purchased at gun store, it can be purchased at county fairs when they have gun expos. We have one this weekend, Cal expo in sacramento. It can be purchased in Reno, Nevada, Las Veags, Laughlin, Phoenix Arizona. This again in the engine to the high powered semi automatic assault weapons you see here today.   
*ME: Thanks for the info, now I know where to go buy some guns before you enact this bill.  
WTF does Reno, Vegas and Phoenix have to do with this?  
Ok, I get it, its an engine and you're an idiot*

**3:49** All the person hassa do is secure this jig.  
*ME: hassa?*  
 
**4:07** Go to someone that has a drill press, god knows throughout the state of California especially my district and industrial areas you can go easily to any drill pr, uh,uh bit to make the holes necessary.  
*ME: Maybe I can pray to find that drill press since god knows where they all are?. I was just going to ask my cousin Tony. and all I need is to take it to a drill bit? No mention that I actually ned a milling machine.* 

**4:22** Once you make the holes necessary it becomes this (holds up a milled receiver). This is the lower receiver, again the engine. Then the engine becomes this (holds up a painted receiver) This is the difference between one block which creates a ghost gun of metal and the actual engine itself.  
*ME: The engine is apparently more dangerous if it has been painted*

**4:46** We have here a semi automatic which is illegal in the state of California. Nonetheless it has a serial number, this weapon right here can be detected by law enforcement, specifically through the department of justice.  
*ME: Apparently the DOJ has special serial number detectors. Commonly called Eyes. Local law enforcement has not been equipped with these special detectors*

**5:08** This is a gun that was manufactured by a gun manufacturer  
*ME: DUH*  

**5:20** With the purchase of this lower receiver, you can go on YouTube (picks up another AR) and you can create this illegal weapon (it appears to be an SBR) This is a ghost gun  
*ME: Apparently YouTube can make a bunch of gun parts magically appear in my garage*  


***Prepare for your brain to completely explode on this next comment. I had to listen to it several times to get the exact right text, these are the words that came out of his mouth***

**5:36** (still holding the SBR AR) This right here has ability with a 30 caliber clip to disperse with 30 bullets within half a second. 30 magazine clip in half a second. This was not manufactured with a legitimate gun manufacturer either United States or in another country. This was actually made illegally in someones garage.  
*ME: 30 caliber clip.. 30 Magazine clip.. I have no words.  
Based on the accepted 800 rounds/min fire rate of an automatic AR15, that calculates to 7 rounds in one half of a second. 30 rounds in half a second calculates to 3600 rounds/minute. The Gatling gun in an A-10 warthog fires at around 3900 rounds/minute for reference. His calculations are a little off* 

**6:18** We have this weapon, which is an automatic sniper weapon that is used by our troops in the military, in Afghanistan. *(He picks up an AR with a scope, sniper stock and long barrel. Can't tell if it's an AR15 or AR10)* Again, this is a weapon, is a ghost gun.  
*ME: Again, with the automatic sniper weapon. I think our snipers use the AR10 which is not the same, but similar enough for politics. And why bring up the military??*

**6:36** No serial number, you cannot trace it, its undetectable, you don't know who purchased it, you don't know who made it. It starts again with the lower receiver *(picks up the milled receiver)*. *(picks up the gun from 4:46)* That is the difference between an automatic weapon that is a legally purchased weapon with a serial detectable number by department of justice in the event that it is utilized in a crime and a high powered assault weapon, sniper version used by our troops in Afghanistan and patterned after the AR15 commonly used by US military, this weapon is illegal, its a ghost gun, its been used in crimes, it cannot be detected to the manufacturer or the owner of this weapon.  
*ME: I thought you said the gun from 4:46 was semi automatic? And I also thought you said the sniper rifles were automatic?  
Serial detectable?  
cannot be detected to the owner??   
Maybe the DOJ should retune their detectors to find the whole gun, not just the serial numbers*


**7:35** (during this he is picking up pieces of a disassembled AR) Again, let me highlight and underscore again, get the jig, a simple piece of metal that can be purchased lawfully. You take the jig go through a drill press, you create the necessary uh,uh conditions. You purchase the barrel, the barrel protector, the stock, and the other components necessary for the trigger and trigger release. (picks up the milled receiver) Again, this is the engine that drives the semi automatic and automatic weapon, without it doesn't function, it doesn't work. And this can be purchased separate pieces and assembled quite easily in garages throughout the state of California and it has been   
*ME: take the jig to a drill press and create the necessary conditions and metallic death appears!!. We knows the guy in the suit ELI5'd it and told you it's a fucking engine!!*


**8:38** With that, I would like to bring up a good friend. Um, one more thing, a couple things actually, These guns already exist.....blah, blah, blah. Points out that a shooting took place with a ghost gun after being denied a purchase.  
*ME: Take a fucking class in public speaking jackwad*


**9:55** To the right *(his right, the audience left)* on the poster board you see a plastic, undetectable ghost gun, another version that with the advancement of technology can be used in short range, uh, uh shootings uh and this can be boarded on any airport, any plane in the country, it can go undetectable by the TSA.   
*ME: Can be boarded to any airport, 'nuf said*

Basically, I can always get hard. I can get hard again seconds after coming, or just stay hard. So we can keep having sex. But it's *really* difficult (and often impossible) to come again after that. If we have sex at night then I probably won't be able to come again until the morning, and even that is difficult sometimes. But we can have lots of sex during that time, and it still feels good for me and all, but there's no natural stopping point. I like to keep going if she does because I want her to be satisfied too.

So, while this new partner likes this about me, she seems to feel really bad that I can't come again, and I try to assure her that it's absolutely nothing that she is doing wrong, I just don't have a reserve left. Even though I can get hard. Am I as rare as she makes me seem? How would you feel if you were in her situation, with someone who came once and is still turned on but can't come again no matter what you do? Any tips on what I can say to her to convince her that I want to keep having sex if she does, and that I have no problem with not being able to come again for several hours and that it's just the way my body works?"

But these substances are also either tremendously obscure or seen as ""hard drugs"" by society at large. So when someone oversells them, that person is doing a disservice because they are giving the ignorant opponents of this form of treatment ammunition.

is she not eating because she has no appetite, or is it because of nausea? I'm assuming she has antinausea meds if she is getting chemo, are they working for her? 

Any idea how her lab results are? Hemoglobin? White Blood Cells? If those are lower than usual, that could explain her lower than usual energy level. chemo really knocks the shit out of you unfortunately.

lastly, if she just can not bring herself to eat enough, try supplements like boost shakes. they are drinks packed with calories, protein, and other nutrients and can replace some meals.

d5000,weightroom,1390596664.0,"Hey ephrion, thanks for the reply.

&gt; with the same weight is guaranteed to stall pretty quick. 

The weight progression is 5lbs each workout.  I started at 140, progressed regularly up to 165, fail on the 24th rep (5x5), and you have one more ""chance"" to not fail before a deload.  Next workout, still lifted 165, but failed on 2nd set, so I deloaded to 150lbs.


&gt; Lastly, you're skinny as fuck.  IN order to gain strength and mass, you need to eat a calorie surplus.

Does Greyskull LP have a cutting variant?  I've been eating between 3600 - 4000 calories a day since September, and steadily gained 1-1.5lbs each week since, and all my other lifts have increased as well: SQUAT 155 - 205, OHP 95 - 120, Deads 225 - 275).  However, I have gained a tremendous amount of fat in my midsection.  Like, I genuinely have not gained much noticeable fat anywhere on my body except my midsection, and the fat gain on my midsection is A LOT (i'm not exaggerating).

Prior to September 2013, I lost 85lbs and went from fat to skinny as a rail, my lowest was 165lbs.  I am currently 196lbs."

PirateCodingMonkey,AskReddit,1390596873.0,"lol, first, while i am a supporter of same-sex marriage (i am gay after all) i don't think that marriage makes a family. i've known couples (heterosexual) who have been together for 30+ years, have raised children together, and never got married. they are just as much a family as the single mother who is raising a child alone or the two dads who are raising their adopted child.

yes, there are currently laws which give extra benefits to married individuals, but those were enacted because marriage already existed. marriage is, and always has been, a legal construct. in the old days, it was used to assure that a man's property passed down to his sons. it was used to bring together families in important business or state matters (e.g. the way royals intermingled in Europe, to create alliances among countries.) in point of fact, marriage, up until the mid to late 19th century, had nothing to do with love and the idea of marrying someone because you loved them was laughable. that's what mistresses and concubines were for.

Drop_,politics,1390596879.0,"A pluot is a hybrid of two different species and is essentially a new type of fruit.  It is very different than simply introducing another gene into a plant from another source.  

You have to understand the difference between a pluot, which is neither a plum or an apricot, and a plant with another plants genes.  A hybrid plant will probably cause an allergic reaction to someone who is allergic to either of the source species, and I'm not disputing that.  What I am disputing is the argument that it's the same as genetic modification.  If I'm allergic to Apricots if I'm reasonably informed I know to stay the fuck away from pluots.  However, even if I'm reasonably informed, I can't stay away from melons which are modified with an apricot gene, because those melons are sold as melons.  Not as melonocots.  

And while allergenicity can be tested for in some contexts, allergenicity is not a universal constant.  Not only do people have different allergies, but people are also probably allergic to different things within the same product.  

&gt;So, we should have warnings on every product that says ""warning: may contain proteins""?

No, we should label it as a GMO so people can make a decision for themselves whether the risk of allergenicity is worth buying the plant.  You literally can't exclude the possiblity of allergic reactions to food simply with a ""known allergen"" list, particularly once you start talking about including proteins from bacteria which may or may not be presents in humans in general.  

Tell me, how are we going to know whether a protein from a bacteria (such as the one that is the source of glyphosate resistance) is going to be a ""known allergen"" to people when people don't have a history of consuming that bacteria and related protein?  

And despite the fact that allergies to fish are well known and documented, that didn't stop the company from attempting to commercialize the strawberry with fish genes.  Just because it was not successfully commercialized doesn't change the point.  

Finally, I think you have a skewed perception of what allergenicity testing is.  Allergenicity testing is typically done on an individual basis to test for IgE in response to some food (or other) product.  There is no way to simply test a food and say it's an allergen or not an allergen, just that it doesn't have any proteins from common allergen sources. "

I realize this is not the main point of the article, but does anyone else see SDRs as a potential future problem? They are valued based on a basket of currencies, but are technically floating. They have no economic output backing them, nor are actual currencies deposited with the IMF to back them. It is essentially giving someone an IOU for actual currency at a future date, but where the holder has no legal right to the currency.

Given there is supposed to be the equivalent of roughly US$730 billion worth of SDRs outstanding, much of which are held by developing countries, any crisis would disproportionately hit the developing world. 

A crisis that caused countries to hoard hard assets like currencies could be a catalyst for an SDR crisis, unless I'm missing something?"

I'd like to think the founding fathers knew that the rules governing thier society would not last forever, and gave us the ability to tweak them as we saw fit. 

Where does one draw the line on the right to bear arms? In revolutionary terms, this meant a single shot, bore loaded musket, which a well disciplined soldier might be able to fire at a rate of once a minute. That's a far cry from today's standard issue M4/M16, let alone the multitude of other deadlier weapons platforms that have been invented. Should we all be allowed to own grenade launchers? 

I just refuse to believe that the only solution lies in arming every citizen. I can't imagine the chaos of being near a mass shooting where untrained civilians are armed as well.

Definitely something that needs to be taken into account with things like this.  There are things in Japanese culture that can have opposite meanings when viewed from an American perspective - for example, I was just talking with my Japanese teacher yesterday about how ""hot-blooded"" and ""cold-blooded"" can be seen as more positive character traits, whereas in America/English those aren't always very desirable qualities.  And calling someone ""easy"" in Japanese (yasashii) doesn't have the same connotations that it does in English.

maowsers93,texas,1390597025.0,"Oh I am absolutely saying that some of this could very likely be faked. Much of it is totally taken out of context. For one thing the ""Wendy Davis is too stupid to be governor"" is something that a man that was Abbott's political adviser said. If the person at the Democrat group said it they were likely re-reading the tweet that made headlines a few months ago. But that is entirely conjecture considering the video doesn't show who is saying it and the people in the video aren't laughing or having the response that is heard on the audio recording. 

The person saying Greg Abbott is in a wheel chair while the campaign slogan was acknowledging the discrepancy. Something that Abbott supporters have been complaining that Davis's groups [haven't been doing.](http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2013/10/11/wendy-davis-campaign-battleground-texas-misfire-again-with-insensitive-attack-on-texas-attorney-general/). So, someone (who by the way isn't even identified as a BGT employee but as a volunteer voter registrar) acknowledges the disparity, likely because of the attacks against them, and they're accused of being offensive. They're offensive it they don't acknowledge it and they're offensive if they do. See how that works?

The bit about Abbott being ugly and in a wheel chair by the way doesn't identify who said it or show who said it. It is just audio super imposed on top of random pictures and a second of footage showing people's backs. Considering James O'Keefe has literally been [sued for falsifying video](http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2013/03/08/james-okeefe-pays-100000-to-acorn-employee-he-smeared-conservative-media-yawns/) before why should anyone ever take him seriously again?

O'keefe literally just got off probation last year for committing fraud. The state he got sued in had the [attorney general's office](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/07/local/la-me-0308-acorn-20130308) investigate him. If he was investigated for fraud in Texas who would be the head of the office that would investigate him but one Mr. Greg Abbott. 

His video footage has also been investigated by the US Governmental Accountability Office. Seriously, you have to be kidding if you take anything this guy does seriously. 

The governor's race is going to be littered with smear campaigns. If you take everything anyone with a history of falsifying video does seriously you'll be in for a long road.

Edit: Ha! I just re-watched it. My personal favorite is how he ""exposed"" BGT for signing up people to register to vote regardless of who they're going to vote for. Oh the humanity!!! Oh what will the children think!! Wow, wow ..... wow. That, that's rich. "

TurbulentFlow,motorcycles,1390597039.0,"I went ahead an took the dyno from a Nighthawk 750 and laid it over the dyno of a CX500:
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mGKakAy.png)

V-Twin enthusiasts will wax poetic about low-end punch and power off the line, but that graph shows that the Nighthawk produces more torque and horsepower everywhere - the existence of the high-end punch (and it's even more pronounced on the 700s) may make it *seem* like there's less down low, but it's still more power than the CX makes.

Honda reports 471lb dry for the 700s and 441lb dry for the CX, but the 25-30 horsepower advantage of the Nighthawk more than makes up for the defecit (note that the CX wet weight will be heavier due to coolant). The Nighthawk feels a little taller, but I'm tall so I prefer that. The riding position is pretty similar (My CX is a Standard, the CX500C has the pegs a few inches further forward and is less comfortable for me).

For me, the Nighthawk hits a nice sweet spot in technology and usability - the carbs Honda used in the late '70s and early '80s were pretty bad. They were a pain to work with, a pain to keep clean, and didn't do a good job. The CV carbs introduced in the '83 model year on the Nighthawk 550/650 were actually used on the Nighthawk 750 through 2003 - they were that good. The Nighthawk's electronic ignition was bulletproof and the charging system was actually decent. It's air/oil-cooled so there's no radiator, cooling system, and water pump to deal with.

I've fully refreshed both bikes, and the Nighthawk, although it's only 5 years newer, feels like it's a couple generations ahead of the CX. The throttle pull and clutch feel of the Nighthawk are lighter and more responsive. It revs more freely. The better carbs mean you don't get weird idle issues and hanging revs. I've upgraded the CX to Progressive front springs and rear springs/shocks, so it actually rides really well. The Nighthawk has stock rear shocks and Race Tech springs up front, so it's quite a bit firmer. My wife finds the CX comfy for 2-up rides and it has no issue lugging both of us around. 

The CX was my DD for the past year as I built up the Nighthawk and I got a chance to flog both in North Carolina. For sheer thrills, I pick the Nighthawk. For ease of maintenance and reliability, I pick the Nighthawk. For exhaust note, the CX wins hands down. For my favorite bike? I'm undecided. I'm probably going to sell a bike or two this spring, but I really don't know what gets to stay and what will go.

Personally I think the first episode is pretty fine. The fan nods were there but they weren't distractingly so. it's not Supernatural (now there's a show that's coasting, doing anything they can do get canceled without burning bridges).

The second episode will be the most disappointing.

The third episode gets things back on track.

ibbity,TheBluePill,1390597276.0,"Well, according to the article...

&gt;A common misinterpretation of the case is that the Supreme Court held that women are not persons. For example, the website of Status of Women Canada, a federal government organization, states that ""After five weeks of debate and argument the Supreme Court of Canada decided that the word 'person' did not include women.""[8]

&gt;On the contrary, the majority judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada noted explicitly that ""There can be no doubt that the word 'persons' when standing alone prima facie includes women.""[6] The Court also made this point clear in its formal judgment. The Court did not respond directly to the question as posed by the federal Cabinet. Instead, the Court gave its own interpretation of the question and then answered that re-formulated question:

&gt;""The formal judgment of the court was as follows:

&gt;Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the Senate of Canada,' the question is answered in the negative.

I'm *very* well aware of the terrible treatment of women by the law back in the day, don't worry. It's just that, while the law might not necessarily have interfered or looked too closely when women were abused by men, it still wasn't considered a *good* thing to rape or beat or abuse women, and although the social penalty for sex outside marriage was most certainly MUCH harsher for a woman, a man who ""took advantage"" of a woman that way was generally considered a cad (though he could often get away with it pretty well.) 

Basically what I'm getting at is that even in the days when acting like a terper was legally permissible and/or was ignored by most people, it wasn't considered to be the done thing by most people (and men who committed rape/spousal abuse could sometimes be successfully sued if the woman had male relatives who could take the case to court for her.) Women had very few defensive measures available to them at the time, but it wasn't a socially accepted norm for men to beat and rape their wives, as terpers appear to believe."

As a main carry his skillset doesn't really justify pumping the biggest share of the team's gold into him and in a 1v3 offlane situation he gets zoned out incredibly easily.

 However, he still loves the xp of a solo lane and has ridiculous sustainability with bloodbath. So if you can draft in such a way that he can solo the safe lane against one enemy offlaner, you can get the most out of this. He can shrug off almost all of Nature's Prophet's or Elder Titan's harrass, stomp Bounty Hunter completely, deal with Windrunner and Dark Seer reasonably well, pretty much root Timbersaw in place,... The only popular offlaner I can think of who would ""beat"" Bloodseeker straight up would be Bristleback.

Aside from that, his vision + movement speed passive is a great boon for the clashes between the two trilanes, and makes him effective at tp counterganking.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20116655
(Link is for same article - ScienceDirect and Pubmed) 

The findings from this study conducted by researchers at Oxford Brookes found that adding tea to milk lowers the overall antioxidants in the tea - assessed using a method that tests the ferric iron reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of the tea itself. This simply means that there are fewer compounds present that can prevent oxidation from happening in your body. 

In fact, they found that the most well-known compounds - catechins, were completely absorbed into the bloodstream even with added milk. Assuming that this is all true for coffee as well, the conclusion is that you reduce the beneficial properties, but don't eliminate them.

Second, I'm not taking it for free in the traditional sense.

Here's an analogy. I love analogies.

You're a baker. Only you're insane and you only serve people with hats on Wednesday. Well I work on Wednesday and I don't much care for hats, so it would be extremely inconvienent for me to actually buy one of your supposedly great cakes.

An independant chef, who happens to be open 24/7 and is indifferent to hats, visits your insane pastry shop and buys one of your cakes. He decides the cake is pretty good, but your demands of only being availible on Wednesdays and only serving people with hats is silly, and being a baker he can reverse engineer your recipe and make your style of cake. But instead of selling your cake, he just gives it away. Who knows why.

When I go to the independant chef's shop and get free cake, I'm not taking it from you. I'm not stealing your recipe, I really couldn't reproduce the results myself. In fact, the version I got for free? Kind of inferior. Not a perfect copy. But the price is right, and I don't have to skip work or wear a hat.

Your poor business practices made it difficult for me to give you money for your product. So when someone offered a cheap copy of it for free, I accepted. If you changed your practices, the difference in quality would probably prompt me to pay you for the real thing.

buildmeupbreakmedown,todayilearned,1390597640.0,"Wrong on all three counts.

If I break into your house every night while you sleep and dose you with heroin or nicotine or any of a huge number of drugs, you can become addicted without even knowing it. All it takes is having the drug in your body. Many teenagers experiment with addictive substances due to nothing more than curiosity and end up addicted. Women who are kidnapped by human traffickers for prostitution are frequently subjected to forceful injections of heroin so that they can be controlled through their addiction. And there are many possible psychological motivators for mental addiction other than depresson, like stress, anxiety, etc.  These conditions have high comorbidity with depression but also frequently occur without it. Ergo, addiction does not necessarily entail depression.

Many perfectly happy people are addicted to coffee and/or chocolate, suffering bad tempers and headaches when we don't get our fixes but otherwise being perfectly satisfied with our lives. People become addicted to useful drugs like stimulants (nicotine, caffeine, d-amphetamine, methylphenidate, etc), pain killers, sleeping pills and so on. They begin using these drugs to fill a practical need, without hating their lives at all, and due to any of a thousand factors (e.g. not paying attention, forgetfulness leading to redosing, poor self-control, a particular susceptibility to a specific drug) end up becoming addicted. Ergo, plenty of people who are perfectly happy with their lives will feel the need to use drugs and end up becoming addicts.

Finally, even in an instance where a person's addiction was spurred on by depression, once that happens the addicton becomes its own thing. Just like having unprotected sex might lead to herpes and starting to use condoms won't heal your herpes. A previous condition leads to behavior which causes a new condition, and this new condition then perpetuates itself through its own mechanisms. Ergo, it is perfectly possible to have an addiction brought on by depression, cure said depression, and remain an addict.

I shouldn't have to walk through a gift shop when I just want to look at the dolphins. I really hate the long hallway I have to walk down to get to the dolphins, the tanks should be right there when I walk in the door; I'm not paying to walk down hallways. I also hate  that the concession stand has a big coke banner on it, it shouldn't be in my line of sight even when I'm looking at the  sea otters, especially if I'm not planning on buying a coke.

It also doesn't open until 10 and I shouldn't have to wait, so sometimes I'll just jump the fence and go in early; besides, the entrance is on the opposite side from where I live, and I shouldn't have to walk all the way around to get in. If they wanted me to pay for their business it should be available when I want it, and there should be entrances on every side.

I really hate that they got rid of the Killer Whales too, if they aren't going to have Killer Whales I'm sure not going to pay to see the other things they do have. And if I only want to see the dolphins, I shouldn’t have to pay the same price to see everything, especially since they don't have whales anymore.

And I really hate that there's cameras in the aquarium and that they have a 'loyalty' program card that tracks how many times I visit the aquarium - the aquarium is run by the city and they can share that information with anyone! I should be able to visit anonymously and not have anyone know I was there.

It's not like it hurts them that I don't pay to go in, I'm not taking anything from the aquarium, they have to run the place whether I go in or not so it doesn't make a difference.

Don't get me wrong, I'd gladly pay to visit the aquarium if it was exactly the way I wanted it, but until they do, I'm not going to stop going to the aquarium because, fuck them, the aquarium is for everyone. I pay at the museum because they don't have a gift shop, so it’s not like I'm not supporting businesses. 

Besides, I tell everyone how awesome the dolphins are, so I'm promoting the aquarium. If I couldn't go in for free I wouldn't be able to tell people about the aquarium so they wouldn't know about it and the aquarium would lose business.

wolfkin,television,1390597819.0,"To be fair to Supernatural (how interesting we both made that same comparison)

that show WAS great and smart. But it ended. There was a literal biblical apocalypse and then it ended. But the fans brought it back like in *Button, Button*. Now the show is like a walking corpse. It's trying to kill itself. It's gone overly meta, it's inserted bad puns (The Rise of Dick) but the fans won't let it go. And CW? it's CW right? won't let it die if the fans are still willing to suck from the teat.

But even after all that. It's surprisingly watchable imo. They had some of their best episodes post apocalypse. Yeah they leaned on Felecia Day and poked fun at Wincest with the Con but they also generated real actual believable tension between the brothers for the first time in the series (arguably twice with the recent events). The Bobby episode was a fantastic character study episode. One of the interesting things about SFF on TV is the trending towards upping the stakes. It climbs and climbs until usually a biblical apocalypse then it collapses. Supernatural didn't collapse.

So my point is that you say ""Supernatural gets away with fanservice"". I don't think they do. I think they thrive ***despite*** it."

metssuck,Marriage,1390597993.0,"I know this was 10 days ago, but here is my little advice.  I am a project manager in IT and I spend a TON of time planning things so wedding planning was right up my alley.  I took the lead with organizing everything (budget, guest list, task list, timeline, etc...) and we worked together on the decisions.  A few things I let her decide (i.e. flowers, DJ) that I couldn't care less about, as long as they stayed in budget.  She let me choose a few things (i.e. alcohol) where I was most interested in, but the rest we decided together based on our preferences and how things fit in to our overall budget.

The first thing we did though once we had the budget set was to determine our priorities and where we would spend most of our budget or where we were willing to go over an allocated budget.  Once we nailed down those (photography, location, alcohol) we rebalanced our budget and went on to level 2 in our priorities (food, photo booth, DJ).  We kept doing that until we had everything planned and booked.  We also had every vendor booked at least 9 months ahead of time and a few as many as 14 months ahead of time, so we really had our choice in vendors."

victorialol,dogs,1390598004.0,"I have sat in my car for a good 30 minutes before trying to just get her to lay down for a half second in the passenger seat. It's near impossible for her (especially at the dog park, but anywhere really). I block her from jumping in my lap then say okay and remove my arm before she comes over onto my lap, and grab hold of the leash and open and let her out the door. She has no chance of getting away (not since she escaped from that harness that one time.) 

Down is her best known command, so I make her lay down before we leave the car every single time even though it takes 10 minutes and is only for a half second sometimes. 

However, a crate fixes all of these issues. She's crate trained very well. Won't even push the door open with her nose if it's unlatched. She will wait for me to come back and open the door for her."

If you mean 'pet' as in 'action companion' I'd pick 4 as he seems a bit more sturdy, and his limbs aren't quite as wonky.  
All of the options strike me as a bit creepy, though. They're a bit too humanoid to make me really think of any of them as pets.

Brad Maddox was the one that put Orton in the handicap match against Cody Rhodes and Goldust, not Triple H or Steph. They made that bad decision up to Orton and also got to punish Maddox by having him face Maddox in a No DQ match on Raw the following week. That's totally consistent with both of their charcters. Their golden boy stopped whining and Brad learned not to overstep his authority. 

Triple H the wrestler and Triple H the COO are two distinctly different characters at this point. Wrestler wouldn't be jocular because he's supposed to be a mean bastard who just beats people senseless, but COO Triple H *has* to be personable because of his position in the company.

Tombstone31,seduction,1390598192.0,"First thought - some people naturally have very little or no AA, some people have a lot. I personally used to have a lot, but I got over it.  You're not at a disadvantage, necessarily, because having AA can be a side effect of some very beneficial personality traits, such as a finely tuned social awareness. It's just that your struggle will be different than the struggle many other guys face.

So, for me, the only way to get over the fear was to face it many, many times. No amount of reading or affirmations helped. Instead, for me, the standard approach games are what really, really worked:

Give a friend $100 (or $20, or whatever), and every time you approach, you get $20 (or $5) back. 

Do 3 warm up sets that don't ""count."" 

Play a game with your wingman, where you take turns approaching. No hesitation allowed. Your wingman approaches, you wing, and when you're done with the set, it's immediately your turn to approach. As soon as you see a set, you go. (My wingman and I used to only do non-mixed sets of 2-3 girls to reduce the excuses not to approach - so, as soon as we saw such a set, we **had** to approach). 

It will fucking SUCK for a long time, but it WILL get better. And maybe you'll even get to a point where you take pride in your ability to approach and open any set. Finally, having wingmen who you like, who support you, and who encourage you can make a big difference. "

Mono W: Precinct Captain, Daring Skyjeck --&gt; 2/2 and 3/1 respectively. Will need spear (but that's turn 3; if you're on the draw you're boned, if you use Charm, same as above)

**3 Drop (assume both decks use banisher priest and Brimaz)**

Selesnya: Loxodon --&gt; nope, laugh at Sorrows, Boon Satyr --&gt; can play around it with flash, or save for bestow. Or, just play Brimaz a turn earlier.

Mono W: NOW you play Spear of Heliod, which if you're on the draw means it's too late because they've already sorrowed the turn before. Also means you can't play Brimaz until turn 4.


Overall, I just think the advantage of G/W not having to do anything to play around sorrow to be a bigger advantage. Also, you'd get to play Brimaz on turn 3 instead of waiting to turn 4 after your spear, which is huge.

Also I'm curious; what would the WWg decklist look like?

I posted an earlier version of this a couple weeks ago but didn't get any feedback. I'm not entirely sure how to classify it; it starts out really heavy, and there's a big ska influence that becomes obvious about 0:43 in. Then it gets kind of funky around 1:44 or so.

I did do vocals for it, but I'm not much of a singer and didn't like how they turned out and am contemplating simply foregoing vocals entirely. So this is the instrumental version; I'm playing guitar, bass, organ, and trombone on this recording, while the drums are a VST.

While comments about mastering and such are helpful for my own personal knowledge, I'm not intending this to be a polished recording. I want to simply use it as a demo for a band in the event that I ever actually get one together here (which is more difficult than it sounds). I'm more looking for feedback on the song itself."

Because you don't generally expect people to troll, if a 4 man premade doesn't troll, it fits in with your expectations of what should generally happen, and doesn't stand out.  Because being matched with a 4 man premade that will be as toxic as your example is such an outlier from normal League games, it stands out a lot more in your mind.  A lot of people that queue up in 4 man premades are not dicks, you just have selective memory of the instances where you were more emotionally affected.

Just having a moment of objectification is not the evil act, seeing women primarily in that way is where things are bad. I agree that there is a problem with objectification of women in general in society, but that problem is that a woman's worth is too often tied to that object status, not in her status as a human being. People are always going to get sexual arousal from members of the gender they are oriented towards and have personal thoughts related to that. Policing those thoughts isn't going to fix the problem of societal objectification of women. Promoting a holistic view of women as 3 dimensional agents is a much better start, and promoting relationships focusing as such helps as well. "

Sportsmanship is me bringing my best, you bringing your best, and seeing who comes out on top, not to jerk each other off about who has the most flavorful army. 

Casters don't win games. Players win games. If you don't like playing against a particular caster because you can't win, it's because you're too much of stubborn scrub to modify your tactics, and it's your fucking problem for not being a remotely worthy opponent.

For example, if we discuss confessional identities, I would argue that Kyivan/Ruthenian/Ukrainian Eastern Christianity owed little to Russian influence prior to the seventeenth century.  Today, just under half of Ukraine's Christian population are members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate).  That's more than 50% who identify as members of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate, or as Ukrainian Greek-rite Catholics.  Linguistically, Ukrainian identity is even more complicated.  The further east one travels across Ukraine, the fewer Ukrainian speakers one is likely to encounter.  In the far-eastern Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia oblasts (provinces) only a small minority speak Ukrainian; most resorting to Russian.  In these region, there is very strong opposition to the Euromaidan demonstrations and this is where Victor Yanukovych receives his strongest support.  Geographically, not everyone in Ukraine identifies as Ukrainian.  For example, Crimea functions as an autonomous republic within Ukraine (majority Russian, followed by approx 25% Ukrainian, and 12% Tatar).  In many eastern provinces, a good portion of the population identifies simply as ""Russian.""  In the Uzhorod oblast (far south-west of Ukraine) a large portion of the population identifies as Rusyn (Paul Magocsi is a particular proponent of this ethnic group as fundamentally different and separate from rest of Ukraine).  I realize this might make understanding ethnicity in Ukraine even more confusing, but I would argue for multiple Ukrainian ethicities/identities, a mosaic of sorts, rather than just one.  I hope this helps somewhat.  If not, I will be happy to try and clarify in other ways."

if you haven't watched the nhl in years, this is the year to start again. The west is so incredibly deep and talented, every game is an absolute war. I was at the Kings Ducks and last night and it was incredible. The playoffs this year will be in-fucking-sane. Part of what helps me is to immerse myself into something like a sports team. Something I can feel something with, because for years nothing made me feel any emotion. I just always felt like shit and nothing made me feel better or worse. But having a team to root for changes everything. You're already on reddit. Come on over to /r/anaheimducks or /r/hockey (which in my opinion is the greatest subreddit ever.

Really? You don't think legalizing gay marriage would make being gay more accepted worldwide? You don't think that acceptance for gay people is a huge deal? Reducing hate crimes and granting rights to gay couples is a pretty big deal for society. Certainly it would have some effect on society.

What about people whose daily lives are affected by laws or attitudes towards gay people? Say, for example, a gay couple living in Mississippi. Gay rights are probably far more important to those people than overpopulation or genocide.

But in all seriousness. This is a really good example of how multifrags and hawk missiles combined with the staggering power of the Venom can render you untouchable. Multifrags completely decimate spawns and will take out a large chunk of the wave budget before the wave has even started. They are also excellent at being used for a panic button. 

In short, watch the video and learn how to War Machine. 

Just to note, this is vs FasterThanFTL, the current number 2 on the N7 leaderboards. He is an excellent player, as he should be, given his play time. He is also using the Hurricane GI, AKA, arguably the best kit in the game. It goes to show that even the best players with the best kits can be overwhelmed by grenade spam. 

So, as a Salsadips approved recommendation, the War Machine is certainly worthy of a respec card if you haven't tried it out already. Its a ton of fun anyhow. And it requires very little aiming, so thats good too.

It's not as if he doesn't deserve one. He is by far one of the best, if not the best actor of this generation. Every movie he has been in since 06, arguably 2000 has been amazing. The fact that Django Unchained was the first time in 16 years that he hasn't been the lead actor highlights how good Hollywood and directors consider him to be.

Also, what is more surprsing is that he has only been nominated for an Academy Award four times. Three of those are for leading actor. He wasn't nominated for Romeo &amp; Juliet, Titanic, The Beach, Gangs of New York, Catch me if you Can, The Departed, Inception, J. Edgar or Django Unchained.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390598827.0,"&gt; When have they ever gotten that? The only way during the revolution was through printing pamphlets, a sort of internet precursor where anyone with a bit of cash could have anything they wanted printed out, pretty much what the internet is like today.

Printing press only gave access to get your ideas out there if you could get over the hurdles of publishing stuff. The founding fathers were not average citizens. They were pretty freaking rich. Which basically demonstrates my point that in traditional means of communication, you need financial backing to get your point of view heard. This is the problem. Now, all you need is a $200 netbook and some mcdonald's wifi if you come right down to it.

&gt;I concur, but I can see no method to reduce PAC's that cannot also be used against legitimate citizens organizations, which would be worse than unacceptable. The solution seems to be voter education and a major BS meter installation.

How would you accomplish this? Make political science degrees mandatory? I think it's easier to tighten restrictions to mediums that are not controlled by everyone. When you watch TV, my viewpoints arent heard on there, and it would cost me millions to get my views on there. That's the problem. people are spoon fed opinions from the media, while having little control over the media itself."

&gt; On est alors en droit de se poser la question : pourquoi est-ce que son comportement est en contradiction direct avec la religion qu'elle défend sur la place publique ?

La preuve n'est pas faite que son comportement *est réellement en contradiction avec ses croyances religieuses*.  C'est pas tout les musulmans qui sont intégristes, et c'est exactement ça qu'elle tente de faire comprendre.  Clairement, selon elle, son habillement n'est pas en contradiction avec sa religion et ses valeurs.  Affirmer autrement pour l'attaquer, c'est dire:

1. Qu'on connaît mieux sa religion qu'elle, et que notre interprétation de sa religion est meilleure que la sienne, et
2. Que notre interprétation de ce qu'elle porte est un jugement plus adéquat que le sien à propos de comment son linge cadre dans ses valeurs.

Max_Insanity,germany,1390598989.0,"&gt; Many people don't understand what I am talking about, here is hopes someone on the internet will.

Black born in Germany in 1990 and since having been raised here. While those are all legitimate points, I think you can shed some more perspective on some of them. 

For example, people are ignorant. But that doesn't mean that they have anything against you. Most of them just don't really ever meet people who are very different (since most people here are either white or turkish). They are also curious. Of course it is annoying, always having to answer the same questions. For me a typical first conversation goes something like this:

""What's your name?""

""[Insert my name here]""

""What?""

""[Repeat name, because they didn't understand - it isn't difficult, just odd.]""

""Interesting, I haven't heard that name before. Where does it/Where do you come from?""

""Born and raised in Germany, parental heritage in [Insert fathers home country here]"".

It is *always* the same and gets really annoying, especially if you meet a lot of people on the same day and feel like a fucking parrot after a while. But while it gets annoying for you, for all of them it is the first time meeting someone like you and they simply *don't know better*. And honestly, I prefer curiosity to willfull ignorance. Because that leads to animosity. As long as people actively want to know about me as a person, they aren't very likely to hate me just because of my appearance. Basically, you can't have your cake and eat it too, or, as we say in German: ""Einen Tod musst du sterben"" (meaning roughly: you have to die *one* kind of death). It is as if people have two default modes for dealing with the unknown. Hate and curiosity.

But that's just my opinion. It's easier to live thinking like this than to just hating on everyone just for their curiosity. And about your example with the black Texan, people are used to African Americans, there isn't even a term for blacks in Germany."

kayjay734,nfl,1390598990.0,"&gt; Brady started on a team that was built to win a Superbowl immediately.

Brady started on a team that was 5-11 the year prior, was 0-2 at the time, and was the consensus pick to place last in the AFC East before to the start of the season. What are you talking about?

I'd argue that Brady is, career-wise, a better quarterback, not because of his postseason success (although 8 AFC Title Games in 12 full seasons, 5 AFC Championships, 3 Super Bowls, 2 Super Bowl MVPs, most TD psses in postseason game, most postseason passing yards, most postseason wins - those numbers are nothing to scoff at or discard), but because of the combination of that with his more recent regular season success (he and Joe Montana are the only players in NFL history to own multiple Super Bowl and NFL MVPs), ""recent"" being the time since the first year he had first-round talent on offense (2007). 

In fact, Brady could be considered the more efficient and prolific regular season quarterback when he has the talent around him. Brady, between 2007-2012 (obviously, discounting 2008), had the best 5-season statistical stretch of any quarterback ever (average season: 4,633 yards, 37 TD, 9 INT, 105.4 rating - for FIVE years). Until this season, wherein the Pats' receiving corps was *absolutely* decimated and Manning exploded, Brady actually had a higher career passer rating than Manning.
 
And when it comes to talent: Manning's had a first-round pick at receiver (and many years, multiple first-round picks) to throw at literally every single season of his career (Harrison 98-06, Wayne 01-10, Gonzalez 07-10, Clark 03-10, Thomas 12-13)! Brady had never had that until (you guessed it) 2007, when Randy Moss came to town, after which Brady broke the TD record, and began on the aforementioned unprecedented statistical stretch.

* cooking - not just healthy and gourmet, but quick and efficient too
* cleaning - house, kitchen especially, and laundry
* time management - kids have to get to school, doctor appointments, day care, activities.  Shopping and other errands have to get done.  The more kids you have the worse it gets.
* frugality - look for sales, clip (and actually use) coupons, creatively recycle leftovers
* flexible and prepared - kids get sick at the most inconvenient times.  How are you going to handle it?  What if your car breaks down hauling the kids somewhere?
* willing to ask for help and delegate - frankly a lot of women get caught up in the ""I have to do it all myself"" or ""if I don't do it myself it's not done right"" mindset.  Fuck that noise.
* can you take care of yourself when life gets stressful?  Will you still hit the gym after a stressful day at work?  If not you'll become a dependopotamus.
* have a hobby or some identity that you can preserve.  Frankly, it's easy to lose your self-identity when you stay home with kids.  It can be an isolated lifestyle.  Have something to talk to your husband when he gets home **besides** how little Johnny made poopies in the potty."

Option. 1 and 2 are not viable to me (this is called an opinion, it can't be wrong).  Option 1 forces me to either be home when something airs or fast forward through commercials.  I'm not going go schedule my life around TV, and why bothering fast forwarding when for very little cost and effort, I can skip then entirely?

Option 2 forces me to walk around work with ear plugs so I don't get spoilers for the 3 or 4 shows I actually watch.

If this were 1999, 1 would be very viable.  If Netflix got shows 1 week after airing, option 2 would be.  I didn't download season 4 of Arrested Development because I have Netflix.  No need because it's an awesome service, even if storing it locally gives me better access."

Clockw0rk,AdviceAnimals,1390599149.0,"I never said I had a right. Don't go making things up.

But there's so much weirdness here, isn't there? Especially with TV.

Let's look at the Simpsons.

The Simpsons airs on Fox, which is broadcast in many markets by local affiliates that both put the programing on basic cable as well as terrestrial broadcast. Literally, if I have the one time purchase equipment to receive the signal, I don't have to actually pay anyone to watch the Simpsons on the night it airs, on the channel it airs on.

Also, it's syndicated. So even if I miss it on the night it airs and the channel it debuts on, there's a fine chance that another local affiliate may show it as a re-run on yet another terrestrial broadcast which has no subscription or payment required. They're giving the product away for free, because it's bundled with advertising.

Should I boycott the show because they don't have simulcast on the internet? Well, I could. Or, I could just download it. It's really no different than if someone had recorded it on a VCR and handed me the tape. The local affiliates were giving this away, for free; so what do I care if some guy on the internet is also giving it away for free?

Now, it's somewhat different if we're talking about Cable. Cable TV still has advertising, but there's also the matter of local cable providers paying fees to the channels. So let's do some very abstract math:

Let's say the cable package is 60 dollars a month for 120 channels of content. 

Let's assume each channel airs content 24/7 and a month is 30 days. That's 720 hours of content per channel, per month.

720 X 120 = 86400 hours of content, per month.

86400 hours of content for 60 dollars.

That's 1440 hours of content per dollar.

Pretty good deal.

Now, I download 7 hours of television a week. Quick now, that's 28 hours worth a month.

MATH!

That means I'm pirating 1.94% of a dollar worth of a cable subscription. 

That's my two cents. Literally.

I could pay Comcast two cents for 28 hours of content a month, but I honestly don't think they care. And they don't have a system in place for me to pay anything remotely close to reasonable. Could I pay 2.00 a month for only the shows I want to watch? If they made it possible. And it'd still be a 100x mark up. Look at that profit margin!

I could boycott them. But you know, being a selfish prick, I prefer to cost them two cents a month for every month they don't offer a sensible way for me to pay them for content."

Sasuke is incredibly mentally strong given it took him many many traumas and shocks before *he finally did* go mentally unhinged.  Luckily, his search for truth the second he spotted Edo Itachi shook him back.  I see Sasuke as someone who Naruto should always aspire to be due to his strength and will (but thats another point).

My method: lying next to her, I hold her shaft against her body with my fingers so her clit points upward. I then use my thumb to finger her.

Nipple play is a natural accompaniment to this. I'll lick/tease them or watch her play with her breasts.

ANewMachine615,tolkienfans,1390599337.0,"Try playing LOTRO. They've had you kill a Balrog, fight several Ringwraiths (and win), raid Orthanc (and beat Saruman in a fight), kill a fire dragon, kill the Watcher in the Water, meet at least one character who is known to be dead (though I'll admit, that was kind of a cool plot, albeit super fanfictiony), run into Orome and do quests for him... the list goes on.

Also, what's wrong with Agaundar? Is that just an untranslatable name, or does the idea of a Black Numenorean as a villain not work? Doesn't that just make him a Corsair?"

1st was awesome and they created a hell of a universe and the Revan story is awesome. 2nd one was a hell of a lot darker but ended up being my preferred game. In the middle of playing it when I have free time atm."
michaelnoir,AskReddit,1390599347.0,"Well, I just think that what you call ""circumstance"" is more important than their ""nature"", whatever that is. 

The ""it's human nature"" argument is usually a conservative argument. The idea is that mankind is inherently bad, therefore we need strong government. But under a strong, ruthless government, that often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

It's also the Christian paradigm. Man is fallen and evil because of the sin of Adam, and therefore needs to be strongly reigned in. It's surprising the extent to which people have absorbed this kind of thinking, and in some cases they begin to act it out.

And most of those proprietary players only work on Windows. If you buy a movie online, you don't get a DVD; so the DVD player analogy is broken.

ANewMachine615,tolkienfans,1390599419.0,"&gt; I just had an interesting thought while typing this. At what point is a video game like this considered your own work rather than Tolkien's? How much separation can you create between the game and Tolkien's world while still keeping it legal? Because once it's your own work, doesn't that make it plagiarism to still be using Tolkien's settings and characters?

They have a license to use these settings and characters, which negates any legal complications from doing so. They still don't have access to anything but LOTR and the Hobbit, so you're unlikely to see *Shadow of Angband* anytime soon, thankfully."

Of course, there are also mods that help make the games run more smoothly, by doing things like letting you run the game with more memory available if you have it, and the like.

If you're interested, and you have a decent gaming PC, you should head over to [the Nexus](http://www.nexusmods.com/games/?) and poke around. They have a huge amount of mods and guides, too."

It's also very beginner friendly: the documentation is kick-ass.

There are critics with fair points, and you'll find it's weak spots soon enough, though don't let it detract from your learning. It's a very common language and powers impressive software (Facebook, Mailchimp, Flattr).

If you're not digging it, try a JS framework and try Python. You'll find one that clicks... it'll be easier to learn and get along with. That's the one you want to stick with when you're learning. For me and my wife, it was PHP. For others, it's ruby or python."

IndignantChubbs,TrueAskReddit,1390599707.0,"&gt;What's the risk? Are you kidding me? I'm not trying to be an asshole but do you know anything about finance or markets? That comment is pretty ignorant because risk is inherently present in any financial market. People lose their asses off every day starting and investing in businesses.

You're totally right (and you're not being an asshole), but what I was saying was different than ""there is no risk."" I said ""What's the risk? That they'll have to rejoin the working class?"" That's my point. While there is a risk being taken, the people in possession of capital are still in a far superior position to those stuck laboring for them. *If* an owner fails completely, he simply loses the privilege of being in a superior class position. My sympathies, therefore, lie with the worker who is already lower on the totem pole, not the capitalist who is risking his vaunted spot on the pole.

&gt;And please name one business owner of a major corporation today who took a risk and started a business and didn't work his ass off to build his business. Evil Sam Walton (Walmart) or Evil Ray Kroc (Mc Donalds) worked harder and took bigger personal risks than every single one of their employees ever did.

See that's the thing. Most owners of big corporations today are not the entrepreneurs who started the company. They're financiers, hedge fund managers and bankers, or corporate executives who came in after the company was already established. I view an entrepreneur differently than an average major shareholder because most major shareholders are not entrepreneurs.

&gt;If the workers of these companies want to share in the profits they can assume the same risks I do. In fact it would be really smart of them to do so because you'll usually come out ahead. But there's still a risk involved.

Well, again, they basically already do share in the risks, because their jobs can be terminated at any instant, which is a huge cost to them. But you're right, it would be smart of them, *and* I think given the chance they would gladly share in the profits and losses. But they don't have that chance because, as you said, this is how our economy works. That's the problem, in my opinion. Well, at least part of it."

There was a surge in popularity of comics during the late 80s/early 90s that resulted in a flooding of the market with a lot of different titles from a lot of different publishers. That flood brought in just as much bad as good.

Comics like X-Force and the early Image titles were hugely popular and influential, but they were all on the strength of their artists and the general ""attitude"" and style of them, which meant as stories they were mostly lacking.

DC and Marvel also began resorting to cheap gimmicks to sell titles because of the increased competition from indie publishers like Image. Some of the most infamous gimmicks are things like the Death of Superman, the breaking of Batman/rise of Azrael, the Spider-Man Clone Saga, and Onslaught/Heroes Reborn which led to the crash of the industry."

It may not seem like a big deal for people who don't know, but when we essentially sell all of our flights through our GDS system, to have to go to the Westjet website if we want to not only book, but to compare pricing against other airlines, it adds a huge amount of time to each of our customer interactions.  

I honestly think this hurts Westjet as well, if their fares and schedule comes up in the GDS along with all the other airline options we can quickly make a decision, but if we don't have that option to offer and have someone on the line with us pressuring us to make a booking for them, searching on the Westjet website might not happen."

hemoman,changemyview,1390599818.0,"I think /u/mcgorgeous is on the right track. Though I’m not sure I personally believe electronic music to be subordinate (it is an art form making such distinctions difficult to make and back up), I will try and point out certain things about music involving real instruments that cannot be truly recreated.
 
The main argument I have is in live music. I agree with you, on a record/CD/the radio there’s really no difference, but when you’re live the advantages to real instruments can be huge. This is something that’s been touched on already in the thread. Yes you can record an incredible guitar solo in the studio or the jazz trio can do a wonderful take of a tune on a recording, but the brilliance of this is that, when you see the band live, the guitarist has the opportunity to take risks, the trio can improvise and create new, spontaneous moments. A great example of this, for me, is the Macklemore song “Same Love”. I’ll admit that this isn’t usually my genre of choice, but on hearing the recording I was really blown away. It’s a beautiful song. But if you see it performed live the difference can be startling. Here the vocals and backgrounds are played from a recording: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrEJmvuKSwo and here much of it is live: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Kfs3dgXhM. To me the difference is remarkable. The live performance feels more powerful. This isn’t someone in the studio who got 4 decent takes of a vocal line and spliced them together to make something that sounds awesome after editing and mixing (not saying that they did this, just that it is possible and we would never know). This is a real person in front of you creating this beautiful sound. I think vocals are the best example of this because it literally comes from their body. Yes it’s amplified and it probably has reverb on it, but there isn’t a whole lot to hide behind. The emotion behind the woman’s voice will be different and unique each time.
 
You didn’t specify in your post as to whether you were talking about music or simply recorded music. As I’ve said, I think it matters a whole lot less in recorded music, but in live music it makes all the difference. Watch live videos of Freddie Mercury and Queen watch the Tallest Man on Earth. They bring something new to each and every performance. It’s slightly faster or slower, slightly angrier or breathier or more melancholy than any other performance they have of the exact same song. It allows each performance (if you have a talented performer) to be unique. It means that each time you see that band you find something new about the songs they play, not because you didn’t hear it last time, but because it wasn’t there. The performer has lived one more day (or week or year) and their performance has changed because of it. If you don’t have a real instrument and you’re simply hitting play on most of the sounds this, arguably, the most beautiful part of music and any live art, can be completely lost.
 
This is also a generalization. There are electronic instruments that allow live changes to speed, volume, etc, but that doesn’t seem to be what you are talking about. Seeing a band that’s good live is like having seen a movie and then seeing the same cast in a play of a movie. But it’s different. It’s being created right in front of you by one or many people perfectly in sync with each other. They are listening to each other and singing their harmonies perfectly because they’ve rehearsed their butts off and they’re talented as shit. It’s another skill set altogether, on top of having written the actual music they are here personally to play it for you. You get both experiences. If you’re not playing the music, not changing it live, you may as well just go to a theater and see a screening of the exact same movie. The movie can be phenomenal, but there’s another beautiful side of music that gets lost."

Be confident in who you are, and don't hide anything. If they don't accept you, then they're not people you need around you in your close circle."

BurningLed,DotA2,1390599866.0,"Others have explained it, so just an example: If you (OD) have 200 intelligence (a reasonable mid/late game value), level 3 ultimate, and an opponent in the ultimate has 50 intelligence, the damage you deal is 

    200 (your int) - 50 (his int) = 150
    Multiply by 10 (8/9/10, depending on your ult level) = 1500 damage.

As for the whining, presuming nothing real is wrong, it's either distraction, or let her whine, or put her to bed.

Just be consistent.  She's testing boundaries, and if your reaction is the same each time, she'll understand them eventually."

TheFarnell,Quebec,1390599900.0,"&gt; Tu affirmes donc qu'il est impossible de critiquer l'Islam.

Absolument pas.  Il est totalement possible et même sain de critiquer l'Islam (quoi que, dans la majorité des cas, il serait plus approprié de dire qu'on critique *certaines pratiques* de l'Islam).  Il est cependant trompeur et simpliste de traiter de l'Islam comme un monolithe et présupposer que tout les pratiquants de l'Islam sont nécessairement des pratiquants des choses que l'on critique de l'Islam en général."

lsteph,pics,1390599907.0,"It wasn't necessarily the demand, but also the means - the market was artificially inflated by the transplants.

For example, the Californians that moved up here drove prices up severely, because they would sell their places in LA for large sums and come with pockets overflowing, for our ""cheap land."" It's not so cheap anymore, and even land out in the middle of nowhere like Dayton is extremely expensive. ([Check out the median prices](http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/census/historic/values.html) in 1990 vs 2000, and California's at the same time)
